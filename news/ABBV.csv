1,ABBV,"AbbVie (ABBV) stock is trading about 2% north of its actual value, an analyst said Monday in a far-reaching analysis of the pharmaceutical company.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says the pharmaceutical company's current assets put its fair value around 91 per share. On the stock market today, AbbVie stock rose 0.5%, to end the regular session at 93.11. The stock is consolidating with a buy point at 125.96.""But accounting for the most uncertain part of the company valuation, which is return on future unallocated R&D (research and development) expense, could get the valuation up to about 104 per share (assuming a 10% return),"" he said in a report.The biggest chunks of value for AbbVie stock come from Humira and Imbruvica. They are worth 57 and 18 per share, respectively, he said. Humira treats several forms of arthritis and psoriasis. Imbruvica is a cancer drug AbbVie acquired along with Pharmacyclics in 2015.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UsePorges noted AbbVie has late- and early-stage pipeline assets, but those are uncertain. He sees those — drugs called elagolix, risankizumab and upadacitinib — as worth a collective 11 per share today. Without risks, they would be worth 18, he said.Even earlier-stage assets could be worth an added 13 per share, he said.""The opportunity for AbbVie stock comes from either demonstrating a return on this expected future R&D expense or revealing material upside compared to our forecasts for one of the current or later pipeline programs,"" he said.Humira will see competition from biosimilars, or copycat drugs, in Europe as soon as the end of this year and in the U.S. in 2023, analysts say. Porges expects Humira to hit peak sales of $22 billion in 2022, before declining 15% in 2023 and 25%-30% from 2024-30.Imbruvica is among the pharmaceutical company's biggest drugs, though its contribution to revenue pales in comparison to Humira. In the first quarter, Imbruvica accounted for about 10% of total sales, whereas Humira generated close to 60%.AbbVie stock is down 4% year to date. It has lost 26% from its 2018 high. It has since scuttled plans to seek accelerated approval for a cancer drug dubbed Rova-T. This followed poor results in a mid-stage study in March.""While this drop in value (for AbbVie stock) exceeded the $1 billion to $2 billion in Rova-T revenue that was removed from the consensus, with the stock currently trading at 93, our (sum-of-the-parts) analysis suggests that the pullback has not been overdone,"" Porges said.Porges has a 113 price target on AbbVie stock, which is 9% higher than his sum-of-the-parts analysis. For AbbVie to realize that price target, it will have to ""enhance long-term value creation through internal R&D or licensing and acquisitions,"" he said.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

2,ABBV,"AbbVie (ABBV) sank to a two-month low Friday after an analyst suggested that its blockbuster arthritis treatment Humira could face increasing sales pressure from rival copycat drugs later this year.On the stock market today, AbbVie lost 2.2%, to close at 93.49. Shares are consolidating with a buy point at 125.96. Stocks of pharmaceutical companies rose a fraction to wrap up the regular session.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan noted that patents protect Humira sales in the U.S. until 2023. In Europe, though, AbbVie's arthritis treatment is expected to see biosimilar competition later this year. Biosimilars are nearly identical copies of biologic drugs.""With our estimates suggesting the biologic blockbuster Humira accounts for 60% of AbbVie's total (net present value), we remain cautious on AbbVie's outlook in front of Humira biosimilar competition,"" Divan said in a note to clients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIt's also likely AbbVie could see competition for its arthritis treatment in the U.S. prior to 2023, he said. He noted that AbbVie recently lowered its 2018 Humira sales guidance in the U.S. That cut represents additional pressure from insurers and less ability to raise prices in the U.S., he said.Divan reiterated his underperform rating on AbbVie. His comments followed a decision Thursday from the Food and Drug Administration to withdraw and reconfigure draft guidance for developing biosimilars.The decision is intriguing, he said.""Our interpretation of this development is that the FDA is learning (along with all of us) what is necessary in order to ensure safe and effective, but also cost effective and efficient, development of biosimilars in the United States,"" he said.Divan expects the FDA to issue updated guidance in the coming months. On Thursday, the FDA said it decided to withdraw the guidance based on public comments. It now plans to rework the guide for developing biosimilars with further consideration of scientific and regulatory issues.FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb noted the potential for biosimilars to foster competition and lower the cost of biologic treatments. President Donald Trump has long argued for competition to help bring down the price of drugs for American consumers.""Yet the market for these products is not advancing as quickly as I hoped,"" Gottlieb said in a written statement. ""We're taking a fresh look at our draft recommendations for evaluating analytical studies in order to ensure our guidance takes into consideration the most current and relevant science.""RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

3,ABBV,"AbbVie's (ABBV) biggest drug, Humira, could be in trouble as biosimilars take share in Europe beginning this year, an analyst said Wednesday as he downgraded the stock and slashed his price target.XOn the stock market today, though, AbbVie gained 3.6% to close at 103.01, after announcing the preliminary results of its modified Dutch auction tender offer. AbbVie expects to acquire about 71.4 million shares of its common stock at 105 per share. This will total about $7.5 billion, excluding fees.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan downgraded AbbVie to underperform from a neutral rating, and cut his price target to 89 from 104. He sees Humira biosimilars — nearly identical biologic copies — cropping up in Europe in 2018-2020 and in the U.S. in 2023.European sales will take the brunt of early competition from Humira biosimilars, Divan said in a report. He expects a 32% decline in Humira sales outside the U.S. from 2018-2020, above the 18%-20% dip that AbbVie expects.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""We expect relatively rapid erosion of Humira sales in the EU following the entry of multiple biosimilar versions of the drug in (the fourth quarter),"" he said. ""There are already three biosimilars approved in the EU, and we believe there could be another two to three approved in 2019.""Reports often cite Humira as one of the best-selling drugs in the U.S. of all products from pharmaceutical companies. In 2017, it generated $18.43 billion in sales globally. Of that, $12.36 billion came from the U.S. Humira treats several forms of arthritis, psoriasis and Crohn's disease.Divan further calls for rapid erosion in Humira sales in the U.S. beginning in 2023. But pressure is already apparent. AbbVie recently lowered its 2018 U.S. Humira sales guidance to about $13.7 billion, an 11% year-over-year decline.""We believe these pressures will intensify as we expect a decreased ability for companies such as AbbVie to extract price increases from the system in the future while copay accumulator programs will also effectively further lower net prices going forward,"" he said.AbbVie stock has outperformed shares of other pharmaceutical companies since January 2017. Over that time, it has risen 61%. Meanwhile, shares of pharmaceutical companies have advanced 21%.Divan credits AbbVie's stock performance to better insight into competition from Humira biosimilars as it reaches legal settlements with potential rivals. The firm is also enjoying a low 9% tax rate this year, trending up to 13% over time. Investors are also enthusiastic for its late-stage pipeline.But, in addition to looming Humira competition, the late-stage pipeline is ""stretched,"" Divan said. A late-stage drug called risankizumab will enter the highly competitive psoriasis market. Further, he questions the safety and differentiation of upadacitinib, a potential psoriasis and arthritis drug.AbbVie management, though, still sees more than $5 billion in sales potential for both drugs.Divan notes the tender offer news ""may lead to some acute, unpredictable volatility, but our cautious outlook is driven by longer-term fundamental concerns we have with the story.""AbbVie shares are currently consolidating with a buy point at 125.96.

8,ABBV,"AbbVie (ABBV) attempted a small rally Friday after shares cratered nearly 13% Thursday after the biopharma scuttled plans to seek accelerated approval for a lung cancer drug that performed poorly in a mid-stage trial.In a note Friday, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges called the stock reaction Thursday ""excessive."" But he also suggested the program might be AbbVie's undoing in oncology. AbbVie bought Stemcentrx and the drug it was studying, dubbed Rova-T, for $5.8 billion in 2016.""The investor disappointment reflects an unraveling of the company's overall solid tumor oncology strategy, as well as questions about its business development discipline and judgement, and the quality and reliability of management's long-term revenue forecasts,"" he said.On the stock market today, AbbVie slipped 0.7% to close at 97.46, after collapsing 12.8% on Thursday. Shares had been forming a cup-with-handle at a 122.10 buy point but crashed far below their 50-day moving average during Thursday's session.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UsePorges cut his revenue and earnings expectations by 1%-2% and 2%, respectively, after 2019. He questioned whether Rova-T will ever get approved as it struggles with lung and blood toxicity. As a result, he slashed his price target on AbbVie to 115 from 128.He suggested in a separate note on Thursday that the FDA ""told the company not to bother filing for accelerated approval given the trial results and the risk/benefit seen in the study.""Rova-T was tested as a third treatment in small cell lung cancer that either relapsed or doesn't respond to other therapies. In a specific group of patients, an independent review found the best objective response rate was 29%. Overall, 16% responded for a median 4.1 months.Overall survival was a median 5.6 months. At 12 months of treatment, the probability of survival was 17.5%, the review found.The drug was tied to a number of adverse events. About a third of patients experienced fatigue, sensitivity to sunlight, a buildup of excess fluid around the lungs, swelling and/or nausea, the firm said in a news release. Porges is concerned this could affect other drugs associated with the AbbVie-Stemcentrx deal, known as antibody drug conjugates, or ADCs.""In turn, these safety liabilities undermine a key component of the Stemcentrx platform,"" Porges said. ""The adverse events appear to be associated with a toxin included in the ADC, and must be a liability for all ADCs coming from Stemcentrx.""AbbVie said it wouldn't seek accelerated approval for Rova-T as a third treatment in small cell lung cancer. But it is still in Phase 3 testing for the drug as first and second treatments in the same form of advanced lung cancer. Data in those trials are expected after 2020, Porges said.Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond kept his overweight rating and 138 price target on AbbVie, but noted he's ""surprised over today's news that the company will not seek accelerated approval in third-line small cell lung cancer.""Several weeks ago, AbbVie had suggested an objective response rate in the mid-teens would be sufficient to file for accelerated approval with the Food and Drug Administration, Raymond said in a report to clients on Thursday, calling AbbVie's decision a ""head-scratcher.""""Speaking with the company today, we understand that durability (4.1 months) was the issue, and we think the (FDA) was looking for less variability on this metric for accelerated approval,"" he said.Raymond argued the stock reaction was overblown. The results of Rova-T as a third treatment in this form of lung cancer are relatively in line with the standard of care and other comparable drug trials.Although the opportunity was small for AbbVie at about $200 million to $400 million, ""sentiment will take a hit,"" he said.RELATED:How Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?Investing Basics: How To Sell A StockLooking For The Next Nvidia?

9,ABBV,"Without question, AbbVie (ABBV) has proved itself to be a pharmaceutical leader with an extremely healthy dividend to boot.The company debuted on the NYSE in January 2013 near 35. Since then, the stock has climbed as much as 259%. Over the same period, the S&P 500 has rallied as much as 105%.AbbVie, therefore, is living proof that savvy dividend investors who also seek capital appreciation can achieve both.What are the keys to the Chicago-based medical giant's long-term success?First, the company's focus on important therapeutic areas provides opportunity. AbbVie aims at products to tackle diseases in immunology, cancer, virology and neuroscience. And the company has produced medicines that gain traction.On Friday, AbbVie announced that the FDA granted approval of its Venclexta treatment in combination with rituximab to treat patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and have received at least one prior therapy. A Phase III clinical trial found that the combined regimen cut the risk of disease progression or death by 81% vs. a standard chemoimmunotherapy.In 2017, AbbVie's total revenue grew 10% to $28.2 billion. In 2013, its top line was $18.8 billion. AbbVie, a spinoff from Abbott Labs (ABT), earned $5.60 a share last year, up 16%.Second, solid dividend generators tend to show stable and increasing earnings. AbbVie excels in both. The three-year Earnings Stability Factor of 3 shows tremendous stability on a scale of zero to 99, according to William O'Neil + Co. data. Wall Street expects profits to rise 39% this year to $7.79 and 14% to $8.91 in 2019.On May 15, AbbVie paid 96 cents a share in cash to holders of record on April 13. That dividend translates to 3.8% vs. 1.8% for the S&P 500. A year ago, AbbVie paid 64 cents a share, both on Feb. 15 and May 15.Third, income investors gain an advantage when more funds are piling into their stocks. What about AbbVie?At the end of March 2018, mutual funds and hedge fund owning AbbVie shares totaled 2,514, up from 2,285 funds at the end of the second quarter in 2017. Total share ownership also grew over the same time frame, rising 3% to 626.1 million shares.The top-rated Fidelity Contrafund (ticker symbol FCNTX) boosted its ownership by 1.46 million shares to 3.95 million shares as of the end of Q1 this year.AbbVie shares are in basing mode and are still trading 20% beneath an all-time high of 125.86. The stock is trying to hold support at the 50-day moving average.On Aug. 31 last year, AbbVie rallied out of a five-week flat base in heavy volume. The stock surpassed a 75.14 proper entry and rallied 67% before going into its current basing action.RELATED:Top Growth Stocks Today: A Peek Inside IBD 50The Best Large Cap Stocks Today: Inside Big Cap 20Inside Investor's Corner: How To Find The Right Buy Point For Most Stocks

10,ABBV,"AbbVie (ABBV) is a rare jewel in the U.S. stock market. Since its debut in January 2013, it's beaten the pants off the S&P 500 by rising more than 255%. (The S&P 500 advanced 101% over the same time frame.) The pharmaceutical giant also delivers a healthy payout to further benefit long-term holders.On Feb. 15, the North Chicago-based firm raised its quarterly cash payout to 96 cents a share, up 35%. With an annualized dividend of $3.84 a share, AbbVie shows a yield of 3.3%, vs. 1.8% for the S&P 500.On the same day the company's board also approved a new $10 billion stock-repurchase program. That's more than 5.5% of the company's total market value of $181 billion.

Strong fundamentals are one linchpin.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAbbVie has increased its earnings in each of the past 14 quarters. In the past four quarters, the growth has actually accelerated. Earnings rose 6% to $1.20 a share, then jumped 11%, 13%, 17% and 23% in the next four cycles. While healthy revenue growth can help boost the bottom line, AbbVie is enjoying stronger profit margins. This indicates either the company is commanding strong pricing in its products or finding novel ways to reduce costs.After-tax margin in Q4 hit 30.9%, up 200 basis points vs. a year ago. In Q3, after-tax margin rose by 150 basis points to 32.5%.AbbVie appears to be gaining market share in the fields of immunology, oncology, virology and neuroscience. In its Q4 results, the Abbott Labs spinoff noted that global sales of its Imbruvica treatment for mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia rose 41% for fiscal 2017.As noted in IBD Stock Checkup, AbbVie gets an B Accumulation/Distribution Rating, meaning institutional investors have been net accumulators of shares over the past 13 weeks.Mutual funds and hedge funds owning shares in AbbVie have expanded to 2,481 in total as of the end of 2017, up from 2,224 in the first quarter of the same year.

11,ABBV,"Novartis (NVS) is one step closer to taking a bite out of AbbVie's (ABBV) blockbuster arthritis drug after a European committee on Friday recommended that officials approve Novartis' Humira biosimilar.AbbVie, meanwhile, dipped after an analyst downgraded it on those same worries — that the threat of Humira biosimilar competition would pressure its biggest product. Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond dropped AbbVie to a neutral rating from overweight.""Specifically, while European biosimilar erosion models abound, and Humira's looming fourth quarter 2018 loss of exclusivity in that important geography is well known, we think investors are still underestimating the downside potential,"" he said in a report.On the stock market today, AbbVie dipped 0.9% to close at 98.05.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEarly Friday, Novartis' generics unit announced the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use recommended the full European Medicines Agency approve its Humira biosimilar. Humira treats forms of arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.""The positive CHMP opinion for our biosimilar (of Humira) is an important milestone for the millions of patients looking to reclaim their health after an autoimmune disease diagnosis,"" said Richard Francis, chief executive of Novartis' generics unit, Sandoz.If approved, Novartis would be able to sell its Humira biosimilar in 28 European countries.Humira is AbbVie's biggest drug and one of the best selling drugs ever. In 2017, it generated $18.43 billion in sales. More than two-thirds of that came from the U.S. There, AbbVie is soon to see biosimilar competition, expected in the mid-2020s.Meanwhile, other headwinds persist in the U.S. where copay accumulators are taking some of the wind out of Humira's sails. Other threats, like rhetoric from the Trump administration calling out incentives for middlemen, exist. But it's likely reform is a long way out.The same can't be said for copay accumulators. These make it so discounts — provided by pharmaceutical companies to help patients afford costly drugs — don't apply to a patient's deductible. When the discounts run out, patients must pay the full cost.That's a costly proposition with medicines like Humira, which can run into the thousands of dollars each month.""That said, a very real draw on revenue in the form of copay accumulators has really yet to be felt,"" Raymond said. ""And while AbbVie has already lowered Humira guidance once on this emerging threat, we wonder if it's the last.""It's hard to make a valuation argument for AbbVie, Raymond said. He cut his price target to 105 from 138. Over the next 12-18 months, it's possible AbbVie will gain approval for drugs that treat female reproductive issues, inflammatory conditions and arthritis.""We model success across the board and think they're largely priced into the stock already,"" he said.Raymond isn't the only one to step to the sidelines on AbbVie. Earlier this week, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan downgraded the stock to an underperform rating. He also cut his price target on looming Humira biosimilar competition in Europe.RELATED:How Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?Investing Basics: How To Sell A StockLooking For The Next Nvidia?

12,ABBV,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) shares rocketed to a three-month high Friday after rival Galapagos (GLPG) released disappointing results for a cystic fibrosis treatment that led partner AbbVie (ABBV) to opt out of additional studies.On the stock market today, Vertex popped 15.2%, to 169.96. Shares of Galapagos tumbled 3.8%, to 92.18, though AbbVie stock lifted 0.3%, to 92.69.

The patients had already received Vertex's drug, Orkambi. But Galapagos' goal of showing its drug could be part of a triple-regimen in cystic fibrosis fell short.At day 28, patients treated with GLPG2737 showed a 3.4% improvement in lung function over those who received the placebo. That failed to hit statistical significance.

But Divan is now bearish on that study, called Falcon.Thursday's ""data raises significant concerns about Falcon and the competitiveness of the entire (cystic fibrosis) franchise,"" he said.Galapagos is partnered with AbbVie on its cystic fibrosis efforts.

13,ABBV,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) is getting some breathing room, an analyst said Thursday, as rival Proteostasis (PTI) tumbled on disappointing results from a study testing cystic fibrosis drugs.Proteostasis tested its drug, PTI-801, in patients also taking Vertex's drug Orkambi. The regimen showed improvements in blood glucose, sweat chloride — an indicator of cystic fibrosis — and weight gain. But patients didn't experience a major improvement in their breathing.It's ""not as easy as it looks,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note. Vertex shares have dipped 10% quarter to date on competitive worries. But the ""sell-off can reverse after competitive threats fade,"" he said.Vertex rose as much as 2.5% intraday, but ended the regular session down a fraction to 145.75. Shares of Proteostasis crashed 38% to 3.03 on the stock market today. Galapagos (GLPG), another rival, saw its shares lose 2.5% to 102.67 on Proteostasis' news.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA number of cystic fibrosis drugs work to correct malfunctioning protein made by the CFTR gene. PTI-801 is what's known as a CFTR corrector. Vertex has a portfolio of correctors that work in different patients based on their own genetic mutations.Vertex, Proteostasis and Galapagos with partner AbbVie (ABBV) are all working on combinations of drugs to treat cystic fibrosis. The study from Proteostasis was looking to determine the best doses of PTI-801 for double- and triple-pill studies, Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz said.The key metric these tests look to improve is forced expiratory volume for one second. In Proteostasis' study, the best result came from a 200-milligram dose of PTI-801 on top of Orkambi. That improved forced expiratory volume for one second by 2.5 percentage points.But that lagged Vertex's newly approved drug Symdeko — a two-medicine regimen — which improves patients' ability to forcefully expel air by 10% to 11%, Leerink's Porges said. Now, Proteostasis' competitive threat ""appears modest,"" he said""While Proteostasis' corrector binds to a different site on the CFTR protein than Vertex's medicines, the failure to match the high (effectiveness) bar established by Vertex is a testament to the difficult development path for competitors with small molecule therapies for cystic fibrosis,"" he said.Galapagos will likely have data later this month for a study of its second-generation corrector on top of Orkambi.The results from Proteostasis ""suggest that the medicinal chemistry at Vertex may indeed be a durable competitive advantage for the company in the cystic fibrosis indication,"" he said. But if Galapagos is successful, Vertex could ""retrace back to the 160-170 range through June and July.""RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionLooking For The Next Nvidia?

Humira is AbbVie's most important drug. It treats several forms of arthritis and psoriasis, as well as Crohn's disease.Investors long have been concerned about the potential for rival copycats, in this case biosimilars, to wrest revenue from Humira, a massive blockbuster that is often cited as the industry's best-selling drug.

""Management believes drug pricing in the space has largely stabilized.""Gilead still expects 2018 hepatitis C drug sales to come in around $3.5 billion to $4 billion, Mizuho's Syed said. But Gilead doesn't typically adjust guidance much on its first-quarter earnings conference call, he noted.""Doing the math now that pricing has 'largely stabilized,' Gilead's remaining quarters could perhaps look like $900 million, $800 million and $700 million,"" he said. ""That basically hits the low end of the range ($3.5 billion).""During the quarter, HIV drugs raked in $3.33 billion, up 2%. But that missed views on an ""exaggerated seasonal inventory effect,"" RBC analyst Brian Williams said in a note.""Encouragingly, though, volumes and share metrics remain directionally favorable, suggesting the core franchise is still healthy and should perform well the rest of the year,"" he said.Biktarvy, Gilead's newest HIV drug, brought in $35 million in the U.S., lagging the most bullish views. But Williams sees that number as indicative of a strong contribution from the drug in 2018.It's also possible Biktarvy is already taking share from other drugs.

Meanwhile, rival Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) dipped 0.5% to finish at 50.90.The hoopla surrounding Merck follows the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting last week. Then, a regimen of Merck's Keytruda and chemotherapy seemingly topped a combination of Bristol's Opdivo and Yervoy as first treatments in lung cancer.Keytruda plus chemo reduced the risk of death by 51%, Merck said. A combination of Opdivo and Yervoy cut the risk of cancer progression or death by 42% in a similar group of patients compared with chemotherapy alone, Bristol said.Now, analysts expect Merck to take the lion's share of an already large lung cancer market. Keytruda and the animal health unit drive Merck's value, Rubin said. She sees the bottom line getting a disproportionate contribution from higher Keytruda sales.Rubin assumes Merck will eventually have roughly half of the immuno-oncology market, up from her earlier estimate for 40%. Immuno-oncology medicines treat cancer by teaching the immune system to identify tumor cells.In 2021, Keytruda will bring in $12 billion with $8 billion of that stemming from sales as a first treatment for advanced lung cancer, she predicted. Rubin expects Keytruda to generate $16 billion by 2025.As a lone therapy, Keytruda will likely get a quarter of the market serving patients whose tumors have a lot of the PD-L1 protein, Rubin said. The amount of PD-L1 is thought to predict how well drugs like Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo will work. She doesn't expect Bristol's Opdivo to get any of this market.Merck's share of the combination market remains to be determined, she said. Keytruda likely has access to 70% of the lung cancer market. But Bristol and Roche (RHHBY) are still running tests of their rival combinations.""While there is room for further upside if Merck establishes more of a leadership position, we still need to see data from other combination trials to give them more credit,"" she said.Merck could also seek mergers to further diversify, especially as diabetes drug Januvia looks likely to see generic competition in the mid-2020s, Rubin said.""We see potential for Merck to be an even better story if management takes steps to diversify and address longer term growth post-Januvia to complement Keytruda,"" she said. ""And we believe they have more than enough balance sheet firepower to do so.""The firm is now a ""compelling mix and margin improvement story,"" she said. That's mostly been overlooked amid the lung cancer discussion. But, historically, investors reward margin expansions stories. Key examples include AbbVie (ABBV) and Eli Lilly (LLY).RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

27,ABBV,"When Sylvie Lammert had her first seizure at nine months old, she was rushed to an emergency room where doctors couldn't find an apparent cause. It would be the first of five seizures she had that day.During the last seizure, it took medical personnel 30 minutes before they could bring the baby's tiny, convulsing body under control. And it would be years before doctors could diagnose Lammert's debilitating condition — later determined to be a rare form of epilepsy known as Dravet syndrome — and even longer before they found a medication that could help.Eventually, she was enrolled in a trial on Epidiolex, a cannabis-based oil made by U.K.-based GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH). The drug, which contains the chemical cannabidiol, or CBD, has made a world of difference for Lammert and could do the same for drugmakers now experimenting in cannabis-based treatments.""The first thing we noticed when she started to take the CBD oil was that she had a lot more clarity in her thinking and in her processing,"" Lammert's mother, Kathleen Corkins, said in an interview with Investor's Business Daily. ""She has the ability to express herself. She is much less fatigued and her seizures came under control.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSmall biotech firms like GW, Insys Therapeutics (INSY) and Zynerba Pharmaceuticals (ZYNE) are looking to cash in on the green source that up until recently was considered taboo. In June, it's likely GW Pharma's Epidiolex will become the first to cross the finish line with an approved treatment derived from cannabis plants.Epidiolex is on track to become a blockbuster, according to research firm Clarivate Analytics, while other analysts will say only that it might reach that status. Clarivate lists Epidiolex among a dozen drugs expected to launch in 2018 and become blockbusters in five years. In 2022, it sees Epidiolex generating $1.19 billion in sales.Its likely approval also could stoke interest among Big Pharma and biotechs looking to get an early jump in the cannabis market, says Dan Ahrens, portfolio manager for AdvisorShares Investments' Vice exchange-traded fund. The fund focuses on the alcohol, cannabis and tobacco markets.""You could almost call that a first mover,"" Ahrens said in an interview. ""When you get someone approved, a lot of other biotech and pharma companies want to get in on the action. It could cause additional interest or movement in the space.""GW derives the CBD in Epidiolex directly from the cannabis plant. CBD is non-psychoactive, so it doesn't carry the same side effects associated with marijuana.This differs from approved drugs by AbbVie (ABBV) and Insys, which contain the chemical tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, and are created in a lab. THC is the chemical responsible for marijuana's euphoric high.If approved, Epidiolex would be the first medicine that specifically treats Dravet syndrome. GW, which operates as Greenwich Biosciences in the U.S., also is testing or seeking approval for Epidiolex to treat other conditions.Epidiolex can be taken with other seizure medicines. For instance, Lammert still takes a trio of anti-seizure medications, though Corkins notes her daughter is now taking lower doses.GW began pivoting its cannabis research to seizure disorders based on the high unmet need in that market, Stephen Schultz, vice president of investor relations, said in an interview. The firm has been working in cannabis for two decades.""With both of these conditions, the seizures are uncontrolled,"" Schultz said. ""It's not uncommon, especially for Dravet patients, to pass away, generally in their sleep. So the more you can reduce the convulsive seizures, certainly one would assume the better the prospects for that patient.""Lammert wasn't diagnosed with Dravet syndrome until she was a preteen. It's a rare form of epilepsy that begins in the first year of an infant's life. Children with Dravet often have developmental disabilities.""Back in the day, there would be times when it would be hard for her to get out of bed,"" Corkins said. ""She would go to school and they would call me at 11 to come get her. When she was tired, she would have more seizures.""The science was still relatively immature when Lammert got her diagnosis. In the ensuing years, Lammert tried countless drugs to control her seizures, Corkins said. She had a device implanted in a critical nerve, and removed when it didn't work. She also tried a special diet.Now 21, Lammert lives in Lincoln, Mass, and attends a school for those with special needs in nearby Lexington. She works in a library and a garden center, and also plays on a basketball team. In May, she's planning to attend a school prom.Lammert still has seizures, but they are much less frequent and less severe, Corkins says. In the past, Lammert had seizures where she would lose consciousness and/or drop suddenly. For a year, she wore a helmet to prevent injuries due to the sudden onset of seizures.""It was a huge roller coaster, we never knew when she would have one,"" Corkins said.A Phase 3 study unveiled in January showed the benefit of Epidiolex in Lennox-Gastaut, another epileptic disorder. Patients ages two to 55 who suffered a median of 74 drop seizures per month took Epidiolex for two weeks. Those patients saw a 44% reduction in the episodes.The firm also tested Epidiolex in Dravet patients ages two to 18, with a median 13 convulsive seizures per month. Patients added Epidiolex to their standard drugs for two weeks. These patients saw a median 39% decline in convulsive seizures.Schultz emphasizes Epidiolex's difference from CBD sold at dispensaries in states like California and Arizona where medical marijuana is legal. Epidiolex is clinically tested at specific, consistent levels. Doctors know how it will interact with other medications, he said.""It does not vary, which is a real problem with artisanal, dispensary-based products,"" he said.Also, insurance companies will likely cover Epidiolex if the FDA approves it.""In our trials, patients were taking a gram, 1.5 grams, up to 2 grams of CBD per day,"" he said. ""If you find 1.5 grams of CBD (from a dispensary), that's going to be very expensive.""GW also is testing Epidiolex for a genetic disorder characterized by noncancerous tumors and infantile spasms. Outside the U.S., another GW drug called Sativex treats spasticity in multiple sclerosis patients. Sativex contains both CBD and THC, as well as other chemicals found in the cannabis plant.So far, GW remains in a class of its own in cannabis. Insys and Zynerba are working on synthetic CBD drugs. Insys also sells Syndros, which is similar to AbbVie's Marinol. Both contain the THC chemical found in cannabis, but create it synthetically.Insys is also studying CBD in a form of epilepsy, infantile spasms and a genetic condition called Prader-Willi syndrome. Further, the firm is doing preclinical work for THC treatments in anorexia associated with cancer and agitation in Alzheimer's disease.Zynerba is researching the use of CBD and THC in several rare disorders including some seizure conditions, Tourette's syndrome and a genetic condition called Fragile X syndrome. At the same time, Cara Therapeutics (CARA) is looking at drugs that interact with the cannabinoid receptors in the brain.GW must work with the Drug Enforcement Agency to legally handle cannabis. The DEA lists it as a Schedule I drug, which has no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. Firms must invest in a robust program and prepare for ""a very intense regulatory protocol,"" GW's Schultz said.""It does take special skill and special care,"" he said. ""We're very excited about the work we're doing here. This is hopefully going to be a very transformative year with the launch of our first drug in the U.S. and the first plant-derived cannabidiol medicine.""On Tuesday, it appeared likely the FDA was leaning toward approving Epidiolex. Ahead of a special advisory committee meeting to discuss the risks and benefits of the drug, a briefing document laid out the merits of Epidiolex in seizure disorders.""The risk-benefit profile established by the data in the application appears to support approval of cannabidiol for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome,"" according to the document.On Thursday, GW will speak before the FDA committee, which will decide whether to recommend Epidiolex to the full agency. The full FDA will consider Epidiolex for approval on June 27.Analysts are excited about the prospects for Epidiolex and other CBD drugs, plant-derived or synthetic. In a February report to clients, Leerink analyst Paul Matteis noted patient enthusiasm is growing.A neurologist speaking at a recent panel said not a day goes by that a patient or physician doesn't reach out with a question regarding CBD drugs. He called the excitement ""unprecedented,"" Matteis said.""The neurologist questions whether or not Epidiolex can realistically live up to the cannabidiol hype over time,"" Matteis wrote. ""However, he envisions it garnering wide use and emphasizes the high level of awareness heading into the launch.""Dr. Jacqueline French, a professor at NYU Langone Health medical center and chief scientific officer of The Epilepsy Foundation, says there is now ""indisputable evidence"" that CBD has a beneficial impact on seizures. She notes no clinical studies have borne out data on the impact of THC on seizures.But the CBD hype comes with a few caveats, she said in an interview. Like other medications, it has risks including sleepiness when mixed with some other drugs. It can also cause an upset stomach and diarrhea.""It's like any other intervention and new therapy,"" she said. ""We can be very excited about it. But this is a drug, like other drugs. It has side effects. You have to do some monitoring of the body chemistry. But that doesn't make it less exciting. It just means you have to treat it like a drug.""Patients see Epidiolex as a natural remedy, she said. Lammert's mother shares that opinion.Lammert went through a ""dramatic change"" when she began taking CBD oil, Corkins said, though she acknowledges Lammert is also older now and there are other factors that could have eased her seizures.""Basically, any seizure medicine that was available between 1998 and 2010, Sylvie probably tried,"" Corkins said. All of it was to little avail until Lammert enrolled in a study of Epidiolex at New York University several years ago.Lammert's doctor works with French at NYU's Comprehensive Epilepsy Center and has treated her since she was about 3 years old. Corkins understands the societal stigma attached to CBD medications, but says it wasn't a difficult choice to enroll Lammert in the study.""I think when you're at the point you've used all your options and your loved ones are struggling, and you have the chance to try a CBD oil, I guess it was an easy choice for me,"" she said. ""It's super purified and I feel like it comes from a natural substance.""RELATED:How Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?Investing Basics: How To Sell A StockNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

Celgene, still reeling from the sudden departure of its chief operating officer, is typically weak in the first period.But clinical studies and business development are more important in biotech, he said.""We believe clinical trial successes and increased mergers-and-acquisitions activity will be more important to help improve sentiment given renewed drug pricing, competitive and life-cycle concerns across the sector,"" he said in a note to clients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Celgene jumped 4.2% to 90. 47 on a possible rebound after dropping in the wake of the sudden and unexplained departure of its chief operating officer. COO Scott Smith left late last week.Up 2.8% for the day, the biotech group was ranked first just 26 weeks ago and fifth as recently as eight weeks ago. It's now slipped to No. 11 out of 197 groups tracked by Investor's Business Daily. Shares hit a 30-month high in March but have since toppled about 12% from that point.Abrahams calls for a strong quarter for Gilead. HIV drugs are becoming more important to the firm's top line and the hepatitis C market is stabilizing.More HIV patients are using regimens that contain a drug known as tenofovir alafenamide, or TAF. Among those, Abrahams sees Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey beating expectations and taking share from its own Atripla and Stribild.Biktarvy, a three-drug treatment for HIV, is still early into its launch. It's expected to bring in $47 million in the first quarter, and ""sales look to be tracking ahead of the consensus projecting out longer term, in 2019,"" he said.Hepatitis C drugs Harvoni and Epclusa are seen beating views for $923 million. Abrahams models $1.02 billion for the two drugs. That's despite competition from AbbVie's (ABBV) new drug Mavyret, which treats a wide group of hepatitis C patients.""If the franchises perform as we expect, we could see an 8-cent bottom-line beat in the first quarter and earnings per share tracking to exceed the consensus for the year — which we believe would help drive upside as the pipeline matures and visibility increases into earnings growth in the out years,"" he said.Abrahams has an outperform rating on Gilead shares.Biogen looks ""generally solid"" for the first quarter. Abrahams expects $3.13 billion in sales to be slightly below the consensus for $3.15 billion based on prescription trends. He expects earnings per share to come in 8 cents below the consensus.Multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera is experiencing steady erosion. But Celgene's experimental drug ozanimod has been delayed in multiple sclerosis. Meanwhile, revenue from spinal muscular atrophy drug Spinraza is likely to be in line.""With multiple sclerosis contracts for 2018 secured, key competitor ozanimod delayed and a temporary lull in competitive spinal muscular atrophy news flow, we expect the focus of the call to be on potential out-year growth drivers,"" he said.The biotech is expected to outline plans for aducanumab, which is being tested in Alzheimer's disease. Recently, Biogen made some changes to its studies for the drug. Investors also are likely to key in on potential acquisition talk.""We expect shares to trade in-line pending more clarity on the long-term picture,"" he said. Abrahams boosted his price target to 330 from 316. He has a sector perform rating on the stock.The first quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Celgene, ""though we believe it should be solid enough to allay any concerns emerging following the departure of their president/chief operating officer,"" Abrahams said.Abrahams boosted his expectations for inflammation drug Otezla to $346 million in the first quarter and $1.63 billion for the year — in line with consensus views. Otezla sales have been a source of pain in the past, widely missing in the third period before rebounding in the fourth.But Abrahams lowered views for Pomalyst, an anti-cancer drug, ""to reflect weaker-than-expected use patterns"" and the likelihood of indirect erosion from Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Darzalex.Investor focus will be on the next steps for ozanimod after U.S. regulators rejected the drug in multiple sclerosis. Celgene could also offer up further details for Acceleron Pharma (XLRN)-partnered luspatercept in blood diseases.Abrahams cut his price target to 120 from 131.

Like the Nasdaq, the stocks found support at the 50-day line. Like the S&P 500, which is now above its 50-day, the stocks haven't hit new highs.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThis is a clear example of how stocks — even highly rated ones like Tencent, Visa and AbbVie — tend to follow the market. That's why it's critical to follow the actions of the major averages and leading stocks. Reading the Stock Market Today columns and The Big Picture every day will keep you in sync with the market.Visa, Tencent and AbbVie are all in cup-with-handle bases. Technically, they are two days short of the seven-week minimum for a cup-with-handle pattern. Cup-without-handle bases are valid at six weeks. So if the stocks clear these handles on Thursday or Friday, there is a slightly added risk.In any case, Dow Jones component Visa has a 125.40 handle buy point, settling Wednesday at 122.58.AbbVie, closing Wednesday at 188.94, has a 122.10 handle entry.Tencent has a 59.54 handle buy point and closed Wednesday at 58.65.Alibaba, Tencent's rival for Chinese internet dominance, has a similar chart pattern at first glance. But the midpoint of its handle is below the midpoint of the base, so Alibaba is in a cup-without-handle base with a 206.30 entry.Tesla fell 4.45% to 326.63 in Wednesday trading. The stock tumbled through two support lines, the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Meanwhile, Tesla's relative strength line is near recent lows. The RS line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been gradually declining since last June.Tesla has struggled with Model 3 production levels, slashing output goals several times in the last several months. And there are many reports of significant manufacturing defects with the entry-level luxury sedan. Tesla employees told CNBC that  the company is making a high level of faulty parts, requiring costly, time-consuming fixes.Meanwhile, two top Tesla finance executives have left in the past week after the global sales and services president exited in February. That puts more pressure on Musk to manage Tesla's operations and attract new high-level staff.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: This 'Bear' Hit 10 Years Ago; How Are Stocks NowWhy This Blue Chip Leader Triggered A Key Sell SignalAlibaba In Sweet Spot As Online Retail Sales In China AccelerateTired Of The High Volatility?

39,ABBV,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) could have a triple-pill treatment for cystic fibrosis as early as 2019, analysts said Thursday after the biotech initiated the first of its Phase 3 studies to test the drugs involved.X The pivotal trial ""should be short and sweet,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients. Vertex announced late Wednesday it's beginning a trial combining drugs known as VX-659, tezacaftor and ivacaftor to treat a group of cystic fibrosis patients.""This timing is two to four months ahead of our expectations and even more importantly, the trial will be shorter than the company's prior pivotal studies for its cystic fibrosis combinations,"" Porges said.In total, Vertex plans to enroll 360 patients in the trial. The goal is to improve patients' ability to forcefully expel air at week four of treatment. Safety will be evaluated through 12 weeks of treatment. Then, Vertex could file an application for approval in the U.S.Porges expects the trial to enroll very quickly and suggests a regulatory submission could occur as early as the first half of 2019.

AbbVie (ABBV) and Galapagos (GLPG) also are working on triple combinations, but analysts say the duo is lagging Vertex.Vertex is also planning to test the regimen of VX-659, tezacaftor and ivacaftor in a group of patients with a different genetic mutation. Another regimen of VX-445 with tezacaftor and VX-561 will be tested in two groups of patients with different mutations.Porges kept his outperform rating and 190 price target on Vertex stock.

Investors should focus on the true market leaders. The stocks below were outperforming the S&P 500 heading into the market sell-off, held up well during the brief stock market correction, and have posted strong gains this past week.Netflix has been on a massive run this year, and was so far extended from its latest buy point heading into the correction that no sell signal was ever triggered and no technical support levels were in question. Netflix shares are closing in on the prior high of 286.81, with the relative strength line hitting a new all-time high on Thursday.Netflix rose 0.8% shortly after the open on the stock market today.During the recent market volatility, Ferrari never even came close to touching its 50-day moving average. Shares dipped below the buy range from a base that was originally cleared several weeks ago, but held up relatively well. Ferrari is now slightly extended from the 5% buy zone and hitting a new high, as the relative strength line hits a new short-term high as well.Ferrari shares slid 1.9% Tuesday morning.IBD Survey: What New ETFs Would You Like To See Created?After finding support at the 50-day moving average, Adobe is now extended 8% from a 186.37 buy point first cleared close to the beginning of the year.

44,ABBV,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) broke out Monday on competitor AbbVie's (ABBV) strong fourth-quarter hepatitis C drug sales — reinforcing recent commentary from Gilead that the market is stabilizing.X By the closing bell on the stock market today, Gilead popped 3.9% to close at 88.80, breaking out of a cup base at an 86.36 buy point. Shares jumped 5.3% on Friday after AbbVie's fourth-quarter earnings report, but closed at 85.46.For the quarter, AbbVie reported $510 million in sales of hepatitis C drugs, which includes its Viekira products and Mavyret/Maviret. Analysts have suggested the latter could take share from Gilead as it treats all genotypes of hepatitis C patients.AbbVie said the lion's share of its success in hepatitis C stemmed from Maviret sales outside the U.S. The drug sells as Mavyret in the U.S. and Maviret outside the U.S. International hepatitis C drug sales were $296 million in the period, in line with expectations.But U.S. sales of $214 million missed RBC analyst Brian Abrahams' estimate for $263 million. AbbVie estimates its $510 million in fourth-quarter hepatitis C drug sales represents about 32% of the market, Abrahams said in a note to clients.""We believe this is a positive for Gilead going into earnings, as it reinforces their prior commentary of market stabilization and downplays the potential impact of U.S. competition,"" he said in a note Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead is set to report earnings after the close on Feb. 6. Analysts list it as likely to top expectations. But uncertainties in payer dynamics, competition and U.S. drug access could hinder some companies' guidance. Head to IBD Industry Themes for other predictions ahead of the earnings season.Abrahams expects patient flows and pricing in hepatitis C drugs to be more predictable going forward after AbbVie's disruptive launch of Mavyret/Maviret. AbbVie echoed Gilead's commentary regarding stabilization on its earnings conference call, he said.Abrahams models Gilead pulling in $1.6 billion in fourth-quarter hepatitis C drug sales. He expects Gilead to guide to $5.2 billion in 2018 revenue.

47,ABBV,"There are only a handful of marijuana stocks with direct exposure to the industry, but several household names have have gotten involved, however peripherally, or are expected to benefit from more permissive marijuana laws, including Jack in the Box (JACK), Microsoft (MSFT), HP Inc. (HPQ), and Cree (CREE).Lawn- and garden-care company Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG) also does business in hydroponics, or the practice of soil-less plant growing often used to grow marijuana. Scotts Miracle-Gro said Tuesday said it would buy Sunlight Supply, a large U.S. hydroponic distributor, for $450 million.But given the fragile, often patchwork state of marijuana regulations, the pot industry is still very volatile and drama-prone. Scotts Miracle-Gro stock collapsed in January after management said the ""slower-than-expected pace of regulatory changes in California"" was harming its hydroponics business.The LED company's products appear on lists of preferred indoor lighting options for growers with hydroponic set-ups. While LEDs carry higher up-front costs than other lights, they produce less heat and use up less electricity.Sure. Microsoft offers software that tracks cannabis sales for states that allow them via a partnership.HP will work with Flowhub, a developer of pot industry compliance software, to roll out cash-register terminals that have Flowhub's software.Marijuana-focused ETFs, like the ETFMG Alternative Harvest (MJ) and AdvisorShares Vice ETF (ACT), are among the exchange traded funds that track the cannabis industry.Alternative Harvest's holdings include stocks like GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH), a company that makes seizure-fighting drugs containing cannabidiol, or CBD, a part of the cannabis plant that doesn't get you high but that typically has a relaxing effect. The fund also follows some of Canada's biggest publicly traded marijuana producers, like Aurora Cannabis and Cronos Group (CRON), which in February became the first pure-play pot stock to join the Nasdaq.AdvisorShares Vice ETF largely follows the booze and tobacco industry, but holdings with a marijuana stock aroma include Scotts Miracle-Gro and companies like Abbvie (ABBV), whose drug Marinol is made partly from synthetic cannabinoids.After years of indirectly targeting the appetites of pot enthusiasts, burger-and-taco chain Jack in the Box in December directly advertised to them.The company at that time partnered with Merry Jane, the cannabis website co-founded by Snoop Dogg, to launch a promotional munchie meal ""that commemorates the legalization of recreational cannabis in California,"" the website said.The meal, which cost $4.20, was available in select parts of the state. The chain said the partnership was ""one more way for us to connect"" with late-night customers.Cowen & Co. also said that pot legalization is good for the Jack in the Box, with the research firm singling it out as a top marijuana stock play in fast food.""Within quick-service, we note Jack in the Box has the greatest exposure to recreational marijuana use becoming more widely accepted in states that have already legalized use (10% of the store base), as well as 5 states with an upcoming legalized recreational use proposal on state ballots for the November election (52% of the store base),"" Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said in a report in September of 2016.""The latter is driven by 42% of the Jack store base that is located in California,"" he added.Cowen analysts in 2016 saw an opportunity for Ulta Beauty (ULTA) to expand its hemp-product offerings as customers gained a ""wider understanding"" of cannabis. Lotions infused with non-psychoactive cannabidiol are already available at dispensaries. There are also cannabis bath soaks. Ulta said it was ""not able"" to make someone available for an interview.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Will Marijuana Industry Overtake Beer As Legalization Spurs Innovation?Could Big Tobacco Become Big Cannabis As Marijuana Business Soars?Can Cannabis Treat Seizures?

50,ABBV,"Buyout and partnership news sent biotechs flying on Monday as Novartis (NVS) bid $8.7 billion to take out AveXis (AVXS), rumors emerged that Celgene (CELG) could swipe Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO), and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) partnered with AstraZeneca (AZN) to make a liver disease treatment.At the close on the stock market today, AveXis rocketed 81.6%, at 210.46, easily hitting its highest point since going public in February 2016. Novartis lifted 1.1%, to 81.07. Agios surged 9.3%, to 80. Celgene was flat, at 86.94, though it was up more than 1% after hours.Meanwhile, Dow Jones stock Merck (MRK) popped 5.3% to end the regular session at 56.18, on data showing its drug Keytruda improved overall survival as a first treatment option for some lung cancer patients. Key rival Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) dipped on the news.And Acadia Pharmaceuticals (ACAD) hit its lowest closure point since June 2013 on a CNN story detailing deaths in patients taking its only approved drug, Nuplazid. Nuplazid treats psychosis in patients with Parkinson's disease, and is being tested in an array of other conditions.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNovartis agreed to pay $218 per share of AveXis in an offer that represents an 88% premium to where AveXis closed on Friday. The deal is a 72% premium to AveXis' 30-day volume-weighted average stock price, AveXis said in a news release.AveXis is developing AVXS-101, a gene therapy treatment for spinal muscular atrophy diagnosed in young children. The drug would rival Biogen (BIIB) and Ionis' Spinraza, which is already approved to treat the condition. Biogen stock, though, fell a fraction, to 257.52, though rose 1% in extended trading.RBC analyst Brian Abrahams credited the deal for ""breathing life into (the) sector,"" in a note. The biotech group has been under pressure recently. Shares sank to as much as a two-month low on Friday, but collectively advanced 3.2% on Monday.This ""could be the (mergers and acquisitions) kick-start that the sector has awaited in our view,"" he said. ""There has been anticipation, but no major deal and trepidation on drug pricing and risk-highlighting negative catalysts (have kept) sentiment down of late.""The transaction is expected to close midyear. The price will go up to $225 per share of AveXis stock if Novartis decides to extend the close date to Oct. 6. If AveXis terminates the deal, it will owe Novartis a $284 million fee. If Novartis terminates the deal, it owes AveXis $437 million.PTC Therapeutics (PTCT) jumped 1.9%, to 26.18, on the news. PTC is in the early stages of making a treatment for spinal muscular atrophy, alongside Roche (RHHBY).""While this asset remains early, it has shown early positive signals, and we could see increased attention today given the value that Big Pharma is clearly willing to place on SMA assets once they are further de-risked,"" RBC's Abrahams said.Immuno-oncology drug Keytruda significantly outperformed chemotherapy in patients with advanced lung cancer, Merck said in a news release. The study, dubbed Keynote-042, tested Keytruda as a single drug vs. chemo in patients who have the PD-L1 protein in at least 1% of their tumor cells.The study examined overall survival. Interim analysis shows Keytruda kept patients alive longer than chemotherapy as lone treatments. Safety was in line with earlier studies. Merck will now continue the study to determine Keytruda's impact on progression-free survival.Patients who have PD-L1 protein in 1%-49% of their tumors represent 10%-15% of the overall market in lung cancer, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a note. Bristol's rival drug, Opdivo, failed to improve progression-free survival in patients with PD-L1 in at least 5% of their tumors, he noted.Bristol shares touched an eight-month low in intraday trading on the news but recovered somewhat and closed down 0.7%, at 60.48.AbbVie (ABBV) ran up 0.8%, to 90.48, and rose another 1.2% after hours, after its investigational drug upadacitinib beat its own blockbuster Humira in a study of rheumatoid arthritis patients.Patients received either 15 milligrams of upadacitinib daily, 40 milligrams of Humira every other week, or a placebo. AbbVie examined patients at week 12 for at least a 20% improvement in rheumatoid arthritis symptoms and clinical remission.The study showed 71% of upadacitinib patients experienced a 20% improvement in symptoms vs. 63% and 36% of Humira and placebo patients, respectively. Of upadacitinib patients, 29% were in clinical remission vs. 18% and 6% of Humira and placebo patients.""We are excited by these strong results, which add to the body of evidence that support the potential of upadacitinib to be an important treatment option for patients with rheumatoid arthritis,"" AbbVie spokesperson Michael Severino said in a prepared statement.Rumors emerged that Celgene could be eyeing takeovers of Agios or Jounce Therapeutics (JNCE). Agios popped and Jounce surged 7%, to 19.78. A buyout would follow Celgene's recent acquisition of Juno Therapeutics, a cancer biotech.The report emerged from the Financial Times, which cited unnamed sources. Celgene is reportedly ""hunting for acquisition targets with promising drugs"" to offset the loss of patent protection for its key blockbuster, Revlimid.Celgene already partners with Agios and Jounce, both of which are working on cancer drugs. Agios has a market cap of $4.6 billion, eclipsing Jounce's market cap, which remains under $1 billion. Jounce went public last year.In similar news, Ionis and AstraZeneca announced a partnership to develop a drug to treat nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Under the terms of the deal, AstraZeneca will pay Ionis a $30 million license fee to take over responsibility for the development and commercialization of the drug.As the drug advances, Ionis is also eligible to receive up to $300 million in additional development and regulatory milestone payments, as well as tiered royalties up to the low teens on sales of the drug.Ionis stock advanced 2.3%, to 41.61, as AstraZeneca lifted 1.4%, to 35.90, at the close.Menlo Therapeutics (MNLO) and Acadia were among the biggest biotech stock losers on Monday. Shares of Menlo tanked 76.8%, falling to 8.17, just three months after going public. The stock had been forming a cup with handle with a 38.92 buy point. Shares rose 2% after hours.The tumble followed news on Sunday that Menlo's itching drug failed in an eczema study. Menlo found no statistically significant differences between its drug, serlopitant, and a placebo. Chief Executive Steve Basta noted there were still signs of improvement for serlopitant-treated patients.Serlopitant is also being tested in another skin condition known as prurigo nodularis, itching associated with psoriasis and chronic cough. The setback in eczema doesn't necessarily hurt Menlo's chances for serlopitant in prurigo nodularis, Piper Jaffray analyst David Amsellem said in a note.""After all, prurigo nodularis is an altogether different condition,"" he said. ""The larger point here is that Menlo decided to run a broad clinical program in (itching) in order to have a handful of potential pathways to market for serlopitant.""Amsellem kept his overweight rating on Menlo.Meanwhile, Acadia dived 23.4%, to 16.50, on a CNN story outlining deaths in Parkinson's patients who took Nuplazid for psychosis.Nuplazid was approved in 2016 to treat hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's. After its approval, patients continued to experience hallucinations and side effects including death, life-threatening incidents, falls, insomnia, nausea and fatigue, CNN wrote.Since its approval, more than 700 patients on Nuplazid have died. As of last June, Nuplazid was the only medicine listed as ""suspect"" in at least 500 death reports. Acadia, though, notes that two studies have shown no difference in the number of deaths reported between Nuplazid and a placebo.The drug is Acadia's only approved medicine. Acadia is testing Nuplazid in dementia-related psychosis, schizophrenia and depression.RELATED:How Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?Long-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsShould You Buy A Stock Ahead Of Its Earnings Report?

51,ABBV,"Price and volume are the guitar and bass of stock trading. You really need both to rock 'n' roll in the market. Without sufficient trading volume, price may fall flat at key inflection points as you enter a trade.The volume requirements at those inflection points depend upon the time frame of your consolidation. Your typical cup-with-handle base requires a duration of seven weeks. Volume at the buy point, in that case, should generally be 40% to 50% above the average volume over the last 50 days. Since swing trades rely on shorter periods of time, the volume thresholds can also use shorter periods. A 10-day consolidation with volume at the highest level of the entire consolidation is often enough. It's more telling than a comparison to the 50-day average volume.But when a stock sets up over multiple time frames those thresholds require an adjustment. A cup-shaped pattern over the span of three weeks may be part of the handle in a larger 12-week cup with handle. In that case, the volume at the buy point should have volume approaching the higher threshold of the longer time frame.Take AbbVie (ABBV) during its recent consolidation. It tried to breakout on Dec. 1 (1) but couldn't gain traction as market conditions deteriorated. Its pullback remained mild and joined the SwingTrader watch list as the stock consolidated and got support at its 50-day moving average (2). The buy point was set at 98.53, the previous high.An eight-day consolidation formed in AbbVie and on Dec. 13, it crossed the buy point (3). However, intraday volume was weak throughout most of the day. Even a huge spike in the final half-hour of trading only put volume at 12% above its 50-day average. That might have been acceptable for the short consolidation as it was the highest volume in the last eight days. However, because the short consolidation was part of a larger base more than seven weeks long, our expectations were higher. We sent out an alert to subscribers that morning: AbbVie would remain on the watch list but wouldn't be a buy yet due to a lack of volume.A weak close on the day, followed by a loss of more than 1% the next day (4), confirmed the validity of the decision. The stock remains on the watch list as an improved market may give the stock another chance. It's hit resistance just above 98 three times. So a break above that level would be meaningful, especially with volume.More details on current and past trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED: Sherlock Holmes And The Case Of Missing VolumeVolume Speaks Volumes About Stock TradesShort-Term Stock Breakout Strategies Have Familiar RulesSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

53,ABBV,"AbbVie (ABBV) surged to a record high Friday after issuing a beat-and-raise earnings report that included guidance for a 9% tax rate in 2018, prompting one analyst to suggest ""yet another industry behemoth"" could become acquisitive.X For its fourth quarter, AbbVie reported adjusted income of $1.48 per share on $7.74 billion in sales, rising 23% and 14%, respectively. Both metrics topped the consensus of analysts for adjusted profit of $1.44 a share on $7.59 billion in sales.By the closing bell on the stock market today, AbbVie soared by 13.8% to close at 123.21, helping drug stocks to rise a collective 1.9%.Guidance for a lower 2018 tax rate should have been expected, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients. In December, the White House approved legislation that lowered the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%.""With this tax rate, and the company's revenue growth and margin performance, we expect a significant increase in free cash flow in 2018, with attendant de-leveraging, thus setting the stage for more active business development activity from yet another industry behemoth,"" he said. Investors had previously expected AbbVie to guide to a 20% tax rate, Porges said.Mergers activity has been heating recently in the biopharma group. This week, Celgene (CELG) said it would buy the remainder of Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) it didn't already own for $9 billion. In 2017, Gilead Sciences (GILD) spent nearly $12 billion to acquire Kite Pharma.AbbVie expects its effective tax rate to increase to 13% over the next five years due to increased domestic income and investment, Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond said in his note to clients.As for AbbVie's results, sales of Humira — which treats several forms of arthritis, Crohn's disease and plaque psoriasis — increased 14% to $4.89 billion in sales. Humira is AbbVie's most important drug. Sales beat the consensus for $4.82 billion, Raymond said.IBD'S TAKE: AbbVie leads its group with an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of a best-possible 99, making it a leader among all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. For more on how drug stocks rank, visit IBD Stock Checkup.Cancer drug Imbruvica brought in $708 million in revenue, growing nearly 39%. That was $1 million ahead of analysts' collective view, Raymond said.Worldwide sales of AbbVie's hepatitis C drugs Viekira and Mavyret advanced more than 63% vs. the year-earlier period to $510 million, beating the consensus by 89%, said Porges.The lower tax rate also boosted other 2018 guidance. For the year, AbbVie calls for adjusted income of $7.33-$7.43 per share, up from $6.45-$6.55 and topping the consensus for $6.57. Sales are expected to approach $32 billion, above the Street consensus view for $31.4 billion.RELATED:Intuitive Surgical Tops Fourth-Quarter Sales, Earnings ViewsCelgene Reverses In Fourth Quarter As Otezla Sales ReboundBiogen Revenue Tops As Spinraza, MS Drugs Deliver Upside

54,ABBV,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) beat fourth-quarter sales expectations by more than 9% and has selected a pair of cystic fibrosis treatments to send into late-stage testing, the company said late Wednesday.X Vertex reported adjusted income of 61 cents per share on $651.6 million in sales, rising a respective 74% and 42% vs. the year-earlier period. Both metrics beat the consensus for adjusted profit of 58 cents a share on $596 million in sales.Of its total sales, Vertex brought in $621 million in revenue from cystic fibrosis treatments, growing 37% year over year. Its biggest drug, Orkambi, increased 32% to $365 million and Kalydeco, also known as ivacaftor, tacked on 44% growth to $256 million.Chief Executive Jeffrey Leiden called 2017 ""an outstanding year for Vertex,"" in a written statement.""As we look at 2018 and beyond, Vertex's scientific expertise and financial strength position us to advance key pipeline programs in CF, including our triple combination regimens and bring forth potential new medicines in multiple other serious diseases.""In after-hours trading on the stock market today, Vertex popped 3.2% after closing up 0.2%, to 166.87, during the regular session.The triple-pill treatments are expected to treat up to 90% of cystic fibrosis patients, said Jeffrey Chodakewitz, Vertex's executive vice president and chief medical officer. Vertex plans to send combos using the drugs known as VX-659 and VX-445 into late-stage testing this year.""We look forward to concluding our discussions with regulators and initiating Phase 3 development in the first half of the year, with the goal of bringing a triple regimen to patients as quickly as possible,"" Chodakewitz said in a written statement.Excitement has been building surrounding the potential triple-pill, which targets the underlying genetic cause of the disease. In total, Vertex had four potential combinations it was considering.Vertex has now narrowed that down to two potential combinations. A combination of VX-659, tezacaftor and ivacaftor will begin two Phase 3 trials in the first half of 2018. The two studies will investigate the regimen's effect in two patient groups with different genetic mutations.IBD'S TAKE: Vertex wasn't always a cystic fibrosis-focused company. In its earliest days, it was focused on hepatitis C until Gilead Sciences launched a massively successful drug called Sovaldi in 2011. How did Vertex escape that crisis? Head to The New America for more.Pending additional data in the first half of the year, Vertex also plans to send a combination of VX-445 with tezacaftor and a drug called VX-561 into Phase 3 testing as a once-daily treatment in two groups of patients with different genetic mutations.Vertex selected the treatments based on ongoing studies which show absolute improvements in patients' ability to forcefully expel air for one second. Those treated with VX-659 and VX-445 regimens showed improvements of 13.3 and 13.8 percentage points, respectively, through four weeks of treatment in some cystic fibrosis patients.The triple combinations were generally well tolerated across both studies, Vertex said, with the majority of adverse events mild or moderate in severity. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were low.Vertex isn't the only firm seeking to make a triple-regimen to treat cystic fibrosis. AbbVie (ABBV) and Galapagos (GLPG) have also teamed up to make a triple-pill. But analysts have said the duo is several years behind. Most see Vertex's triple getting approval in the 2019-20 time frame.In February, Vertex expects to get approval in the U.S. for a regimen of tezacaftor and ivacaftor as a treatment for cystic fibrosis patients ages 12 and older with a specific genetic mutation. European regulators will make their determination in the second half of 2018.Vertex said it will issue 2018 guidance for cystic fibrosis drug sales after the anticipated U.S. approval for the tezacaftor and ivacaftor regimen on Feb. 28. Analysts expect Vertex to offer an outlook of $2.89 a share in adjusted earnings on $2.73 billion in sales.Vertex is also planning to move forward with Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) using gene therapy to treat blood diseases known as beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease.

55,ABBV,"Eli Lilly (LLY) issued strong 2018 guidance early Wednesday — following in the footsteps of AbbVie (ABBV) and Dow's Pfizer (PFE) — with an improved tax rate and earnings expectations after a fourth-quarter beat.X For 2018, Lilly called for an 18% tax rate, down from 20.5% in 2017. As a result, Lilly now sees adjusted income of $4.81-$4.91 per share, which would grow 12%-15% vs. 2017. Sales are expected to be $23 billion to $23.5 billion.Lilly cited U.S. tax legislation for the improved 2018 tax rate outlook. Adjusted earnings and sales guidance topped views for $4.65 and $23.19 billion, respectively.But Lilly stock dropped 5.4% to close at 81.45 on the stock market today. Collectively, drug stocks tumbled 2.2% a day after Amazon (AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) pledged to cut down on U.S. health care costs.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat noted Lilly's animal health business disappointed. Sales of food animal products declined 8% to $547.4 million and widely missed expectations, he said in a report to clients.The miss stemmed from the U.S. where Lilly is facing competitive pressures for two products used in cattle: a milk supplement called Posilac and a nonsteroidal growth stimulant called Optaflexx.IBD'S TAKE: Lilly has an IBD Composite Rating of 80 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms eight in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to the IBD Stock Checkup for a look at other strong drug performers.Milk has been oversupplied in the market, depressing prices, Raffat said. Production has been strong and many customers are forgoing Posilac. Optaflexx is likely suffering from a rule under a U.S.-China export trade deal that the meat can't contain Optaflexx, he said.Outside animal health, there were very few misses, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a note to clients. Sales of plaque psoriasis drug Taltz, diabetes med Humulin and erectile dysfunction drug Cialis lagged the consensus.Still, total sales of $6.16 billion grew 7% year over year and beat the consensus for $5.96 billion.

56,ABBV,"Shares of Dow's Pfizer (PFE) tumbled Tuesday after sales from a breast cancer drug lagged expectations, though the fourth quarter culminated with a beat-and-raise, including a ""dramatically improved"" 17% tax rate.X By the closing bell on the stock market today, Pfizer dove 3.1% to 37.80. Meanwhile, drug stocks broadly dipped 1.4% on uncertainty after Amazon (AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) announced a collaboration to lower healthcare costs in the U.S.For its fourth quarter, Pfizer reported $716 million in sales of Ibrance, which is approved to treat some breast cancer patients. Sales grew 11.4% year over year, but missed the forecast of Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez for $955 million.Ibrance sales declined internationally in the period due to a one-time price adjustment in some European markets, Pfizer said in a news release. Despite this, Ibrance volumes grew 20% sequentially in developed Europe.Still, ""Ibrance's growth was a disappointment and highlights the need for international growth as investors await the outcome of the ongoing adjuvant breast cancer studies,"" Fernandez said in a note to clients.More broadly, Pfizer brought in adjusted income of 62 cents per share on sales of $13.7 billion for its fourth quarter, rising 32% and 1%, respectively. Both metrics beat the consensus for adjusted profit of 56 cents a share on $13.61 billion in revenue.Fernandez called the fourth-quarter beat ""largely irrelevant,"" instead focusing on 2018 guidance for $53.5 billion to $55.5 billion in sales and adjusted earnings of $2.90-$3 a share. The consensus had modeled $53.72 billion and $2.77, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Gilead Sciences and Vertex Pharmaceuticals are expected to top fourth-quarter expectations while others continue struggling with rivals facing their biggest moneymaking drugs. Head to IBD Industry Themes for more on what the fourth-quarter earning season could hold.Pfizer also guided to a 17% tax rate in 2017. Investors should have expected the lower tax guidance, Fernandez says. In December, the president signed a massive tax cut on corporations into law. Last week, AbbVie (ABBV) guided to a low 9% tax rate.""Key questions on the call likely will focus on the sustainability of the 17% tax rate,"" Fernandez said. ""How — if the consumer business is sold — management plans to deploy the capital and what the after-tax impact might be to Pfizer's cash hoard.""Investors will also look for commentary on whether Pfizer will split its company with or without large-scale mergers and acquisitions, he said. Pfizer says it will have a decision sometime this year on whether it will sell its consumer healthcare business.During the quarter, consumer healthcare sales were flat at $950 million. Sales of cholesterol drug Lipitor grew nearly 23.7% to $574 million, above estimates for $465 million.

59,ABBV,"A dozen drugs launching in 2018 from heavy hitters like Roche (RHHBY), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) are expected to reach blockbuster status by the end of 2022, an analytics firm says.Clarivate Analytics describes 2018 as ""the year of the blockbuster,"" in which these 12 drugs have either launched or are expected to launch, and eventually bring in north of $1 billion in sales over a five-year period. That's the biggest number since Clarivate began making its forecast in 2013.It's setting up ""to be an exciting year that will see valuable additions to existing treatments as well as disruptions to certain markets and first-in-class treatment options for some diseases,"" the firm said in its report, issued late Thursday.By the end of 2022, three drugs from Roche, Gilead and Novo Nordisk (NVO) are expected to top $3 billion each in annual sales with the remaining nine likely to account for $1 billion to $2 billion a year in revenue, analysts said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAmong the 12 are two diabetes drugs, a Food and Drug Administration-approved medicine derived from cannabis plants and the first in a series of drugs expected to prevent migraines in some patients. In all, these dozen drugs are projected to collectively top $22.5 billion in sales in 2022.Roche's Hemlibra, a treatment for some patients with hemophilia A, tops the list and is expected to generate north of $4 billion in sales in 2022. Though there only 350,000 hemophilia A patients in the world — with roughly 30% of them eligible for Hemlibra — the treatment costs $482,000 the first year and $448,000 every year after that.The drug was approved three months early and launched in December 2017. Sales of $496 million are forecast for 2018 with the drug set to reach blockbuster status in 2019 at a forecasted $1.46 billion.Hemlibra is expected to take share from Shire's (SHPG) Feiba and Novo Nordisk's NovoSeven.Hemlibra also will compete against Bioverativ's (BIVV) Eloctate and Shire's Advate. For 2018, Eloctate was forecast to be a blockbuster, but Advate will continue to be the market leader with an estimated $1.8 billion in sales.""However, (Advate) sales are forecast to decline further thereafter,"" the Clarivate report said.Gilead's Biktarvy grabbed approval in February and targets an estimated 37 million people globally living with HIV. Of those, 21 million are receiving antiretroviral therapy which suppresses viral replication and allows the immune system to strengthen.Biktarvy adds to Gilead's HIV franchise which has long rivaled that of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). The two have traded market share since 2006 when Gilead first entered the market with Atripla. Two of Gilead's HIV drugs were featured in Clarivate's 2016 Drugs to Watch report.In 2019, Biktarvy will become a blockbuster, generating $2.28 billion in sales before spiking to $4.3 billion in 2021 and declining to $3.72 billion in 2022, the report says. The trajectory is similar to GSK drug Triumeq, which is expected to bring in $3.68 billion this year, five years after its launch.Rounding out the top three, Novo Nordisk got approval for diabetes drug Ozempic in December. The drug helps stimulate the body's own insulin release and limit how much sugar gets into the blood from the liver, and slows down how quickly food leaves the stomach.Ozempic is expected to become a blockbuster in 2020 with $1.58 billion in revenue on its way to $3.47 billion in 2022.In 2017, immuno-oncology treatments from Novartis (NVS) and Gilead grabbed headlines for ""their ability to revolutionize the treatment of the disease,"" the report said. And more than half of all drugs on the potential blockbuster list were cancer therapies.But in 2018 just one drug on the list of expected blockbusters is a cancer treatment.Erleada, a product of Dow Jones component Johnson & Johnson, was approved in February to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer that hasn't spread across the body. J&J and fellow Dow Jones component Pfizer (PFE) have drugs that treat the same cancer once it's spread.""While Zytiga and Xtandi battle to expand their market share, including the market for patients with non-metastatic disease, J&J's second-generation oral anti-androgen, Erleada, became the first approved in that setting in mid-February 2018,"" Clarivate said.The drug is projected to bring in $1.2 billion in 2020 and rise to $2 billion in 2022. It also could be expanded to treat other forms of prostate cancer and in combination with J&J's Zytiga contribute to its blockbuster potential.In 2021, GSK's shingles vaccine, called Shingrix, and a rare disease drug from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) known as patisiran are expected to join the blockbuster list with $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion in sales, respectively.Revenue is expected to hit a respective $1.37 billion and $1.21 billion in 2022.GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH) is expected to grab approval this summer for the first cannabidiol drug derived from the cannabis plant to treat patients with two seizure disorders. In 2022, the drug, called Epidiolex, is expected to generate $1.19 billion in sales.""If approved, Epidiolex will likely encounter bureaucratic barriers to distribution and political hurdles associated with cannabis-derived medicines, particularly in the U.S., where strict guidelines for use of medicinal cannabis exist,"" the report said.But the biotech isn't alone in this market. Cara Pharmaceuticals (CARA), Insys Therapeutics (INSY) and Zynerba Pharmaceuticals (ZYNE) are also working on treatments based on the cannabis plant.A migraine drug from Amgen (AMGN) and Novartis, Aimovig, is projected to bring in $115 million in 2018 sales before spiking to $1.17 billion in 2022 sales. This drug, and others like it, seek to prevent migraines by blocking a specific peptide, or group of amino acids.If approved, Aimovig would be the first drug known as an anti-CGRP to market, ahead of Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) and Eli Lilly (LLY). Allergan (AGN) also is working in this area.""A first-in-class mover advantage will be crucial for Aimovig since competition from two other subcutaneously administered monoclonal antibodies targeting CGRP is not far behind,"" Clarivate said. Lilly and Teva filed for FDA approval of their drugs late last year.Meanwhile, Alder is in Phase 3 testing with its drug. Analysts are worried, though, that Alder may falter in submitting its application to the FDA after co-founder Randall Schatzman unexpectedly stepped down from his chief executive role on Tuesday.In other areas, Shire's lanadelumab, a treatment for a swelling disorder, is forecast to bring in $1.15 billion in 2022. Next is AbbVie's (ABBV) Elagolix, a treatment for painful symptoms associated with menstruation.Rounding out the list, Pfizer and Merck's (MRK) diabetes drug Steglatro and Indivior's opioid dependence drug Sublocade are forecast to become blockbusters in 2022 with $1.09 billion and $1.07 billion in sales, respectively.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?How To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

62,ABBV,"Imagine editing one gene and curing a debilitating disease. Three small biotech companies with combined annual sales of less than $50 million — Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP), Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA) and Editas Medicine (EDIT) — say that soon could be a reality.X All three biotech stocks went public in 2016 to bet big on a simple premise: Altering specific genes can create curative medicines. An estimated 5,000 diseases could be cured by changing one targeted gene, says former Intellia Chief Executive Nessan Bermingham.The World Health Organization has a higher estimate for what are known as monogenic diseases and says it's actually north of 10,000.""People have been talking about (personalized medicine) for 20 years and yet we've never had a system to allow us to do it before,"" Bermingham told Investor's Business Daily before stepping down from his role on Dec. 31. ""And for the first time ever, we actually have a system to do it and that system would be based on your personalized genome.""That system is known as CRISPR, and it's where Crispr, Intellia and Editas are putting their chips. It's a cheaper and faster gene editing method and, according to Bermingham, the key to advancing personalized medicine. Some analysts think CRISPR technology could provide the platform for the next generation of giant biotech companies.CRISPR the technology — not to be confused with Crispr Therapeutics, the company — builds on a project that sequenced the human genome. The first map cost $2.7 billion and was completed in 2003.Since then, the cost to map an individual's genome has dropped precipitously and could come down to just hundreds of dollars in the next few years, Bermingham says. Large-data analytics also have a part to play in sifting through the genome.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech companies account for a large share of recent IPO stocks, yet investing in them before they have profits or sales can be risky. Learn to identify the best IPOs and how to trade them for potential big gains.  When the first human genome was mapped, investigators were ""absolutely horrified"" to find just 20,000 genes in the human body that code proteins, Bermingham says. That was down from estimates of 100,000. Essentially, these protein-coding genes serve as words in the genetic language.Investigators also found regions of DNA that were initially thought to have no purpose. These were controversially called ""junk DNA"" that does not code protein. But, as it turns out, these sequences do have a key purpose in regulating the expression of genes.All together, the better understanding of the human genome has allowed these biotech companies to utilize CRISPR, an acronym for the technology known as Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats.There is a caveat, however. In January, a paper published by bioRxiv said there may be evidence that human immune systems may fight off the major form of genome editing that uses an enzyme called Cas9, thus rendering the science ineffective. The paper, however, has yet to be peer reviewed.The process, developed at various universities, essentially uses specialized strands of DNA that act as molecular ""scissors."" Those scissors are capable of editing other DNA at specific points, and allow biotech companies to edit, add or remove faulty genes responsible for diseases.There are varying types of scissors. Crispr, Intellia and Editas are using the Cas9 CRISPR technology, ARK Invest analyst Manisha Samy told IBD. She estimates Cas9 can reach 70%-80% of the human genome. Developing new scissors can expand the reach into more genes and diseases, she says.Gene editing isn't new, she adds. Older techniques called TALENs and zinc finger nucleases have been around for some time. Notably, biotech company Bluebird Bio (BLUE) is using a variation of TALENs, and Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO) is using a method of zinc finger nucleases.She likens CRISPR technology to a word processor.""We think CRISPR gene editing is analogous to a DNA word processor with two functions: find and delete,"" she said in a January 2017 report. ""In addition, scientists are working on a rudimentary paste function, allowing CRISPR to insert appropriate DNA code to repair mutations.""Older technologies used by biotech companies are more like old-fashioned typewriters, requiring actual cutting and pasting, she says. CRISPR technology is also cheaper and easier to use than TALENs and zinc fingers, says JMP Securities analyst Mike King.""What's so powerful about CRISPR is it's so easy to use,"" he told IBD. ""High school students are doing experiments in the biology lab to knock out genes. Zinc fingers takes a lot of talent and time. You have to fiddle with them a lot. The systems created under CRISPR are quite robust.""In January, bioRxiv — an online archive and distribution service for unpublished reports in the life sciences field — published a paper casting doubt on the durability of CRISPR gene therapy over time, suggesting the body could build an immunity to it. Analysts and biotech companies are not worried, however, saying either this is a nonissue or there's time for the science to catch up.Many companies working in CRISPR are doing so using the Cas9 enzyme, short for CRISPR associated protein 9. Cas9 is derived from two bacteria that cause infections in humans at high rates, meaning some immune systems could have developed immunities to them.Would CRISPR gene editing, using that enzyme, work in those patients?It depends, Crispr Therapeutics said in a follow-up email to IBD. It's important to note the lead investigator and writer on the bioRxiv paper was Matthew Porteus, a scientific founder and advisory board member for Crispr Therapeutics.When the gene editing is done ex vivo, or outside the body, the Cas9 enzyme is degraded and, therefore, essentially gone by the time the cells are reintroduced to the patient, Crispr told IBD.For in vivo applications, when gene editing is done inside the body, Crispr Therapeutics says it uses several approaches to ensure transient expression of the Cas9 enzyme. Because of that, ""we do not expect pre-existing immunity to Cas9 to cause any issues,"" the firm said.Ark's Samy also noted that other enzymes are in use. Editas is also using the Cpf1 enzyme. This enzyme is derived from other bacteria and could overcome some of the immunity challenges involving Cas9.Intellia told IBD in a follow-up email that in clinical testing, its delivery system for treatment in rodents and non-human primates has yet to falter. Further, Intellia notes it's using an advanced form of Cas9 and none of the donors had a pre-existing immunity in its study.The data are still early. Editas has done its own work in immune responses to CRISPR genome editing and will present a paper in the future, JMP's King said in a Jan. 8 note to clients. Management has indicated it found immune responses to be ""much lower"" than those reported in the other paper.""Immune responses are not uncommon,"" Samy said. ""Scientists have worked for decades on evading immune recognition. There are numerous workarounds that can be implemented to reduce any potential side effects with Cas9 and we have proved this in a number of other therapeutic modalities.""Among the biotech companies, Crispr Therapeutics is ahead of the competition from a regulatory standpoint. On Dec. 7, the firm submitted its first application for a clinical trial testing its gene therapy, known as CTX001, in a blood disorder known as beta thalassemia.The company is working with Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) in beta thalassemia, as well as sickle cell disease. The therapies are part of Crispr's ex vivo programs, where gene editing is done on cells outside the body before they are reintroduced to the patient. Crispr is also looking at in vivo therapies for the liver, muscles and lungs.According to a Crispr news release, the trial is set to begin in Europe in 2018 in adult patients. This is expected to be the first in-human trial of a gene editing treatment based on CRISPR technology. Crispr also plans to file an application to begin testing for CTX001 in treating sickle cell disease in the U.S. in 2018.Intellia also has in vivo and ex vivo programs in gene editing, and also is working in sickle cell disease. It's furthest along in a partnership with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) for a therapy to treat what's known as transthyretin amyloidosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of abnormal protein deposits throughout the body.Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) also are working separately to treat the disease using different methods called RNA interference and antisense technology, respectively.Meanwhile, Editas is working on an injected treatment for an inherited eye disease known as Leber congenital amaurosis, which is characterized by severe loss of vision at birth. It is also using gene editing in sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia.Intellia and Editas also are expected to start in-human trials in 2018, analysts say, though Intellia has not said when it will begin testing.Regulators are getting more comfortable with the idea of gene editing, Crispr Therapeutics President Sam Kulkarni told IBD. The benefit of gene editing — and potential trouble with it — is that it's meant to be a permanent fix. The biotech companies are working to ensure they hit a bull's-eye every time out.""We've shown you we can make this edit and it's done in a precise fashion using (targets the industry calls) molecular ZIP codes,"" he said. ""We eliminate edits happening outside places you want them to happen. And we manufacture these in a high-quality fashion, understanding the pharmacology.""Both Kulkarni and Intellia's Bermingham — who was succeeded by John Leonard, a former AbbVie (ABBV) executive — say there's room for all three big players in the group.Sizing the market is a challenge, ARK's Samy says. No matter how you slice it, the numbers are big and a lot will depend on which diseases companies target and how they set pricing.If CRISPR is able to address all monogenic diseases diagnosed each year, that's a $75 billion market globally, she says. Addressing all these diseases for people already living with diagnoses would be a $2 trillion market.""One product is not going to cure everything,"" she said. ""Whenever you're seeing volatility between these three main CRISPR companies, it doesn't really make sense because there's room for all of them and more when it comes to CRISPR.""Kulkarni says it's unlikely the market will remain at just three publicly traded biotech companies with CRISPR technology in the long run. The technology is just that remarkable.""Once in a lifetime may be a little bit of a stretch, maybe not,"" he said. ""But it's definitely a once in a generation type of advance in the field. The last time this kind of excitement happened in the biotech field was when antibodies were applied as therapeutic modalities. On the basis of that, technology companies like Genentech (now owned by Roche (RHHBY)) were created.""He added: ""Here we have the basis of a CRISPR platform to create the next big biotech giants.""RELATED:6 Top Biotech Companies In Innovation Earn Recognition In New AwardsWhy Bluebird's Downgrade Sent These Two Rivals SkyrocketingFind The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch NowMeet The 5 Best Brokers Overall For Every Investor Need

64,ABBV,"AbbVie (ABBV) could follow in the footsteps of Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Celgene (CELG), an analyst suggested Monday after AbbVie guided to an unexpectedly low 9% tax rate in 2018.X ""We expect the narrative for this stock in the coming months to develop into a 'who will it buy?' story, similar to Gilead in 2016 and Celgene more recently,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients.The acquisition narrative follows AbbVie's fourth-quarter earnings. On Friday, the biopharma giant topped quarterly expectations and beat 2018 guidance predictions. It also guided to a 9% tax rate in 2018 and a tax rate around 13% in the near-term.It also follows announcements last week that Celgene would acquire Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Sanofi (SNY) would acquire Biogen (BIIB) spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV). Today, Sanofi also said it will buy Ablynx (ABLX).If AbbVie does seek an acquisition, it will likely be in neuroscience, early-stage immuno-oncology or solid tumor medicine, Porges said. AbbVie could seek deals to build onto or complement its early-stage Alzheimer's disease pipeline ahead of a key readout in 2019.So far, though, AbbVie is playing its cards close to its vest. The firm doesn't seem inclined to make ""large or disruptive"" transactions, Porges said. Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan noted the firm is constantly looking at assets but believes it already has a strong pipeline.Further, ""they do not have a burning platform where they need to acquire an asset,"" he said. ""If there isn't a compelling need and the company is dealing with many other things, it probably is not the best time to do mergers and acquisitions.""IBD'S TAKE: Celgene and AbbVie have already reported their fourth-quarter earnings, but a slew of biopharmas are still slated to issue their reports. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at what analysts expect from the biotech and drugs groups.That puts AbbVie in a slightly different boat from Gilead and Celgene. Gilead acquired Kite Pharma in 2017 amid slowing hepatitis C drug sales. Last week, Celgene said it would buy Juno four years before it begins losing exclusivity on cancer drug Revlimid.Divan's comments follow a conversation with AbbVie's management post fourth-quarter earnings. Analysts suggested the lower-than-expected 9% tax rate means AbbVie will have extra cash on hand with which it could engage in mergers and acquisitions. AbbVie says it's looking at earlier-stage and single assets to build out its pipeline.""If they find anything in the 2019 or 2020 timeframe, even before the (neuroscience) readouts, they would not necessarily feel the need to wait,"" Divan said in a note to clients.Divan boosted his price target on AbbVie to 135 from 98 and kept his neutral rating. Porges also upped his price target to 127 from 105, though he downgraded AbbVie to a market perform rating from outperform.""At current valuations, we prefer Celgene to AbbVie among the larger cap names in our coverage,"" he said. ""Growth names such as Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) continue to offer more upside, in our view, than AbbVie.""By the closing bell on the stock market today, AbbVie dipped a fraction to 122.31.RELATED:Celgene Reverses In Fourth Quarter As Otezla Sales ReboundCould Sanofi's Ablynx Deal Spur A Biopharma Buying Spree?Will Biotech's Merger 'Spigot' Turn On After Juno, Bioverativ?

72,ABBV,"AstraZeneca (AZN), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are the likeliest targets of a biopharma ""detonation event"" in which tax reform spurs widespread mergers and acquisitions across the group, an analyst said Friday.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez calls the coming consolidation ""inevitable.""Products made by the likes of AbbVie (ABBV), Roche (RHHBY), Amgen (AMGN), Dow Jones stock Merck (MRK), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Shire (SHPG) are soon to face new competition and generic rivals.This follows ""an unprecedented period of innovation and new product launches within large biopharma,"" he said in a note to clients. ""Several of the largest companies will likely experience a substantial growth slowdown within the next five to seven years.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCelgene, Biogen and AstraZeneca would be most accretive to a potential acquirer, based on short-term financials, Fernandez said. Their average accretion in 2020 would be 25%, 14% and 13%, respectively.But Bristol, AstraZeneca and Vertex make the most sense long-term and strategically, he said. These three appear to be ""best positioned"" for longer-term revenue growth based on a look at consensus expectations for 2020-24.The last major consolidation period in biopharma occurred during the last decade, in which there were seven deals greater than $40 billion in value. The largest was Dow Jones stock Pfizer's (PFE) $93.8 billion acquisition of Warner-Lambert, at a 34% premium.Pfizer also paid the biggest premium, 38%, on Pharmacia, forking over $60.5 billion to acquire the firm. Merck paid a 34% premium to buy Schering-Plough for $45.7 billion. Since 2010, deals combining Pfizer with AstraZeneca and Allergan (AGN) and AbbVie with Shire have failed.Fernandez sees the next cycle as a seller's market. Pfizer is struggling with its late entry to the immuno-oncology market, whereas Merck has a strong immuno-oncology drug — Keytruda — but lacks a robust late-stage pipeline.Roche faces biosimilar competition for its top drugs: Avastin, Herceptin and Rituxan. Novartis (NVS) is still experiencing challenges in its Sandoz unit. AbbVie is strong in the near-term, but its key drug Humira will soon see competition in Europe and in the U.S. after 2022.Strategically, AstraZeneca would be a strong fit for AbbVie, Pfizer, Roche or Merck, Fernandez said. Bristol could fit in at AbbVie and Pfizer. Meanwhile, it's possible AbbVie could swing for Vertex.Through a financial lens, AstraZeneca, Vertex, Biogen and Bristol are the most compelling targets for their ability to enhance long-term sales, he said.Amgen could be an acquirer or a target with $70 billion in funds to buy something, Fernandez said. Assuming Amgen is looking to make a deal valued at less than $90 billion, Vertex rises to the top of the list among the potential targets, outlasting Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Shire.""Among the three, Vertex looks more interesting,"" he said.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityLong-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsShould You Buy A Stock Ahead Of Its Earnings Report?

75,ABBV,"When Miles White was named CEO of Abbott Laboratories (ABT) in 1998 at 43, he was the youngest head of a major health care company.Today, he's one of the longest-serving chiefs in health care and has made a reputation as a master strategist, known for making bold moves at Abbott. And none was more dramatic than when he spun off the research-based pharmaceutical half of the firm as AbbVie (ABBV) in 2013. Before this, Abbott had a market capitalization at about half that of industry leaders Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK).It seemed crazy to many, but White perceived that developing new drugs had a completely different business rhythm than what the new Abbott would now focus on: devices, diagnostics, nutritional products and branded generic drugs. The result: Abbott's stock has since risen from 24 a share to around 59 a share, giving it a market cap of about $102 billion, while AbbVie's shares increased from 33 a share to near 100 a share, giving it a value approaching $159 billion. His creations combined are now worth around $260 billion, far more than Pfizer ($217 billion) or Merck ($156 billion). And White has been ranked by Barron's as one of the world's 30 best CEOs for nine straight years.""It's about keeping the company current and relevant,"" White told IBD. ""We continually shape our business to ensure we're where the needs and opportunities are for the future. For instance, our recent acquisition of St. Jude Medical makes us a leader across a range of growing medical device categories where new technology can make a huge difference — for the patient and for investors.""White grew up in Las Vegas and earned a Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering at Stanford in 1978, and an MBA two years later. He joined McKinsey & Co. in Chicago as a consultant, but while he felt the work was fascinating, projects and clients came and went. White said he wanted something he ""could feel connected to for a longer term, which would be more fulfilling.""White was hired by Abbott, based in the north Chicago suburb of Abbott Park, Ill., in 1984 as a director of sales in diagnostics, and four years later he was offered a chance to head the division's growing Asia-Pacific region — a prestigious position for a 33-year-old. But he turned it down because it meant moving to Japan; his wife wanted to open a children's bookstore in the U.S. White said he is a big believer in work-life balance and was confident that other opportunities for advancement would come his way. Indeed, 10 years later he was chosen to be the new CEO and the following year added the title of chairman of the board. (And his wife ran her bookstore for 19 years before selling it in 2008.) Abbott had rarely done acquisitions or divestitures since its founding in 1888. A whirlwind of change followed after White took the helm, including:But 2007 was dramatic and traumatic. Abbott acquired Kos Pharmaceuticals, a maker of cardiovascular drugs, for $3.7 billion in cash, but a deal to sell its core laboratory and point-of-care diagnostics divisions to General Electric (GE) fell through. White decided to revive these challenged divisions instead, investing in research and development, streamlining operations, and reorganizing products and services into a new diagnostics division. In August 2016 it began launching a family of next-generation instruments, informatics and services with common software and hardware platforms designed to be easy to use and more efficient, which White called ""a game-changer for the industry.""Among other acquisitions, in 2010 Abbott paid $6.2 billion for the pharmaceuticals unit of Belgium-based Solvay, expanding its presence in emerging markets. The same year, a plan was announced to purchase a unit of Piramal Healthcare for $3.8 billion, which would make Abbott the biggest pharmaceutical company in India.The success of the company's acquisitions may largely depend on an ability to anticipate consumers' medical needs, understand where the practice of medicine is headed, and aggressively position the company to benefit through internal and external investment.""It's not just about acquiring companies,"" White said. ""It's about what you do with them. How can you do more with that business? How can you make it better? How can it improve your existing operations?""We've developed a very disciplined integration process through which we learn how best to bring new assets into Abbott and help them expand and reach their potential, faster and better than they could have before.""All of this and more were just preliminaries to spinning off half the company, for which Abbott took a 2012 third-quarter charge of $478 million. AbbVie was officially listed on the New York Stock Exchange on Jan. 2, 2013.""What makes White such a savvy deal-maker?"" asked Jim Cramer on his ""Mad Money"" show on CNBC in November 2017. ""He has a real talent for anticipating consumers' future medical needs and then aggressively positioning his company to benefit from them. Within four years of becoming CEO, Abbott released Humira, which would go on to treat forms of arthritis, plaque psoriasis and Crohn's disease, among other ailments. In 2016, now part of AbbVie, it made $16.1 billion in sales, making it the best-selling drug in the world. But White had the foresight to spin off this part of his company ahead of the explosion of the debate about drug prices.""But guiding a global enterprise through massive change can result in mistakes, and Abbott's biggest occurred in the midst of the drama leading to the split. In October 2012, Abbott was fined $500 million for marketing Depakote, a brand of valproic acid, the world's most widely prescribed anti-epileptic drug, for conditions not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. As part of a settlement that cost it a total of $1.5 billion, the company agreed to strengthen its internal controls.After separating from AbbVie in January 2013, the new Abbott emerged with a focus on not only diagnostic products and services, but medical devices, nutritional lines and branded generic medicines. The latter is the Established Pharmaceuticals Division, which sells to developing markets, where a brand name may be trusted more than an unknown, due to high quality and efficacy standards, but which doesn't have the high costs of R&D-based pharma. The division now offers more than 1,500 products, with 400 in development. In 2014, it acquired CFR Pharmaceuticals for $2.9 billion, more than doubling its Latin American branded-generics pharmaceutical presence.Abbott is also the world leader in adult nutritional products, including Ensure and ZonePerfect, as well as the U.S. leader in baby nutrition with Similac and other lines, and for special dietary needs with Glucerna and Juven.The company is also a leader in diabetes care, introducing a revolutionary continuous glucose monitoring device, FreeStyleLibre, in September.In 2017, the company purchased St. Jude Medical for $25 billion in cash and stock, establishing Abbott as a leader in the medical device arena. It also closed Alere for $5.3 billion, which made it the leader in the $7 billion point-of-care diagnostics market.""We've reinvented the company multiple times over the past 20 years,"" White said. ""It's a continuous process of shaping the company for the future. We work very deliberately to ensure that we remain relevant and current to the people we serve and to the changes taking place in our environment. We're in several different businesses today than we were decades ago, and they were all chosen specifically for their relevance to where the science was going, where demographic and socioeconomic factors were going, and where our customers were going. And that's why we're still growing strong and our stock is at an all-time high.""Today, Abbott employs 94,000 workers in over 150 countries. In 2016, its revenue was $20.9 billion and net income was $1.4 billion.CEO and chairman of Abbott Laboratories, a global leader in medical devices, diagnostics, nutritional products and branded generic medicines.Overcame: The failed sale of the challenged diagnostics businesses, which he turned around by investing in innovation and becoming a highly profitable, consistent grower for the company.Lesson: Envision a long-term big goal and work out the detailed steps to get there, even if it means defying the industry's consensus.""You need to continually ask yourself, 'Is there a better way?' Because the answer is always yes, even though exactly how might not yet be apparent.""MORE ABOUT LEADERS & SUCCESS:Pam Nicholson Drives Global Growth For Enterprise HoldingsTaco Bell's Founder Changed America's Fast-Food MenuMeet The Man Hired To Take On AmazonPhil Knight Cleared Hurdles To Make Nike A Merchandising Champion

78,ABBV,"A strong open for the stock market Tuesday saw the Dow Jones industrial average cross the 26,000 level early, but gains faded badly by the close.X After rising 1.1% early, the Dow faded to a loss of less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite also gave back a healthy gain, falling 0.5%, while the S&P 500 gave back nearly 0.4%. Small caps underperformed with the Russell 2000 down 1%.Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in higher than Friday's levels in the stock market today, resulting in a distribution day for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Higher-volume declines haven't been an issue for the broad market in recent weeks, but it's always important to pay attention to signs of institutional selling when it arises, even when the percentage declines aren't severe.Money flowing out of stocks did not translate into bond inflows as the 10-year Treasury yield was mostly unchanged at 2.54%.Strong showings from Merck (MRK) and UnitedHealth (UNH) helped the Dow early. Shares of Merck gapped above the 200-day moving average, rising nearly 6%, after the company said a late-stage trial of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda, in combination with two chemotherapy treatments, was effective in treating patients with advanced lung cancer.Shares of UnitedHealth, meanwhile, gained 2% after the company reported earnings and gave a solid outlook for 2018.Wall Street also liked the look of quarterly results from Citigroup (C). Shares rose 0.4% to 77.18. It tried to clear a flat base with a 78.02 entry but came up short.Tuesday's session served up early breakouts from many top-rated growth names including IBD 50 names Atlassian (TEAM) and Align Technology (ALGN) as well as Weibo (WB), but all three names looked a lot like the major stock indexes by the close.Results from Atlassian are due Thursday after the close. Shares rose 0.5% to 52.82 ahead of the results. It cleared a 53.55 buy point but ended below the buy point.Shares of Weibo rose more than 1% to 123.19. It ended just above a 122.31 cup-with-handle buy point. Note that the handle is only visible on the daily chart, not the weekly, and the latest breakout was from a late-stage base.Align Technology also broke out early but closed with a whimper. Shares rose 2% to 263.88, closing just below a 266.51 entry.AbbVie (ABBV) turned in a solid performance after a recent breakout over a 98.36 buy point. Shares rose another 2% to 102.46.

79,ABBV,"Beleaguered biotech investors likely will have to wait until 2018 to get some relief, though trial data and drug approvals could help stoke the embers of the formerly red-hot group.X That's the take from analysts, who say there may be some relief on the horizon. But don't expect anything earth shattering, they say.""The next quarter and a half is likely to feature significant disclosures for a number of companies in our coverage, but is unlikely to be a period of strongly stock-moving events,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a recent note to clients.Porges' view follows a third quarter in which large caps struggled as their historic moneymakers caught the double whammy of increasing competition and pricing concerns. Meanwhile, smaller caps crushed expectations.As a result, IBD's 462-company Biotech industry group, ranked first just a month ago, is now listed as No. 37 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks. Shares touched a 22-month high in October, but have since lost nearly 6%.""However, the flow of events is set to accelerate in early 2018, and the first quarter offers more opportunities for meaningful value inflection across biopharmaceutical companies and stocks,"" Leerink analysts wrote in a recent note.Despite frustration depressing biotech stocks, the group has posted an impressive number of new approvals this year, JMP Securities analyst Mike King said. According to the Food and Drug Administration, 140 original applications for drugs and biologics have been approved this year.""You need product approvals,"" he told Investor's Business Daily. ""Even the most jaded observer of the sector would have to say the sector as a whole has produced very satisfactory results when it comes to major trial readouts. I don't see any change in that regard.""Tacking on drug approvals and successful data readouts will be key for companies like Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), a pair of large biotech leaders facing a growing field of competitors for their moneymakers Revlimid and hepatitis C drugs, respectively.Celgene is set to have two readouts in a type of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and could have CAR-T developments from partners Bluebird Bio (BLUE) and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO). CAR-T drugs treat cancer using a patient's own re-engineered immune cells.Both are important for Celgene, which has long enjoyed revenue gains from chemotherapy Revlimid. Analysts had been expecting generic competition from Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) in 2020. Recently, though, Dr. Reddy's missed a key deadline to file its generic.Still, it's less than ideal for Celgene to rely so heavily on one stream of revenue, FBB Partners analyst Mike Bailey said. Celgene had been preparing to replace some of its patent-challenged Revlimid sales with a Crohn's disease drug. But the firm said in October it won't initiate Phase 3 trials of that drug.""The bull case on Celgene previously was that they had these new drugs to limit the risk for Revlimid,"" he told IBD. ""If you take away the risk management piece, all of the focus is on this one drug which is going to go generic at some point.""Similarly, Gilead has an HIV combination using its drug bictegravir set to gain potential approval in February. This could accelerate HIV sales starting in the second quarter, Porges said. At the same time, ARK Invest analyst Manisha Samy says Gilead will likely get further into CAR-T in 2018. Gilead also announced Thursday its $567 million acquisition of Cell Design Labs, a privately held CAR-T player.In October, Gilead acquired Kite Pharma for nearly $12 billion. This followed the FDA's approval of Kite's drug, dubbed Yescarta, to treat large B-cell lymphoma in adults. Due to their individualized nature, CAR-T drugs aren't likely to rake in the same sales as Gilead's now faltering hepatitis C drugs.""But two or three years down the line, that could be a huge revenue maker,"" she told IBD.IBD'S TAKE: Big-caps struggled in the third quarter which isn't surprising considering a patent cliff over the next 10 years is set to hit some $17 billion in annual sales for blockbuster drugs, says one analyst. Head to the Industry Snapshot for more on how biotechs fared in the period.Yescarta won't replace Gilead's hepatitis C franchise at its peak, but it will grow steadily, Bailey said.""My guess is hepatitis C is going to shrink really quickly,"" he said. ""At some point I would expect CAR-T to replace hepatitis C sales, but no way at the peak. That was once-ever in terms of what Gilead did. It will never be that big.""In the next several months, Leerink's Porges looks for AbbVie (ABBV) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) to disclose pivotal trial or regulatory events, while Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) will report more ""value-confirming events.""AbbVie will have data for an anti-inflammatory treatment known as upadacitinib, he said. Those results could add more detail to the evolving landscape of what are known as JAK inhibitors that treat psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis, among a number of conditions.Regeneron is on deck to file the results of its drug Dupixent in asthma. The drug is already approved to treat eczema. The firm could also report data for its eye drug, Eylea, and for its immuno-oncology drug, cemiplimab, in a type of skin cancer.Also, look for Vertex to provide Phase 2 data for two of its triple-pill combinations to treat cystic fibrosis. In total, Vertex is testing four potential regimens to bring into Phase 3 trials. The firm is also likely to gain approval for a two-drug combination in February.In the Big Pharma world, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez says there are few significant stock-moving catalysts left in 2017, but the first half of 2018 will be busy.Dow's Merck (MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and AstraZeneca (AZN) all have immuno-oncology combo results in lung cancer, while Bristol and Merck/Incyte (INCY) are set to deliver results from their regimens in melanoma.Bristol could also offer interim data from a trial of its immuno-oncology drugs Opdivo and Yervoy as a first treatment for lung cancer.Outside those, ""major immuno-oncology catalysts should (thankfully!) be limited,"" he said. There's a high bar on Bristol's interim data, which require nothing short of stopping the study early on extreme effectiveness. That's unlikely, so expectations are probably low, he said.""Nonetheless, an early stop would be a major validation of Bristol's strategy — likely driving the stock up 15% in our view,"" he said. ""Continuation of the study would likely increase concerns over Bristol's strategy and the ultimate success of the study at the final analysis, possibly pushing the stock down 5%-10%.""PARP inhibitors, yet another class of cancer drugs, are set to have trial results as well. AstraZeneca will have results for its drug, Lynparza, as a first maintenance treatment in ovarian cancer.""I think the PARP space will be quite large,"" JMP's King said. ""It's hard to tell in the real world if doctors will see these drugs as better so they can start producing some satisfactory sales figures.""RELATED:Biotechs Sell Off In Droves — Are Investors Seeking Mergers?This Biotech Just Neared A 17-Year High On Strong Cancer RegimenThis Cancer Biotech Is Falling On Its $1.55 Billion Bayer Deal

91,ABBV,"What's going on with the stock market? After more than a year of gradual to solid gains, investors suddenly discovered that stocks can go down, sharply.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite saw more than a week of heavy selling in whipsaw action, breaking key support lines and leaving them 10% off their highs as of the Feb. 8 market close. Leading stocks crumpled under selling pressure.But despite the breathless coverage of ""record losses"" for the Dow, the stock market has not had some historic meltdown. After an unusually calm 2017, the major averages are in the midst of their biggest pullback in years — and pullbacks and corrections are normal parts of healthy markets. The market has now moved into a correction.The major averages has rallied for past three sessions and was on track for another gain on Wednesday. That's encouraging, but investors should look for further evidence before assuming a new market uptrend is underway.Here's an in-depth analysis of recent stock market action and how you should respond as an investor.The stock market hasn't crashed, though you might not know that from the news. But its losses signaled a change in market direction for the immediate term.After several months of gradual, steady advances, stocks rose sharply for the first few weeks in 2018. The Dow Jones industrials, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite rose about 8%, with Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and energy stocks among the big winners.That followed a strong 2017 with few hiccups in the stock market. Investors became complacent with the stock market rising and never suffering a bad loss. Up until Jan. 30, the S&P 500 index hadn't fallen 1% or more since last August. The market hadn't had a cumulative pullback of even 4% since the presidential election. Eventually that had to change.One big change affecting the market is interest rates, which have climbed sharply in 2018 to multiyear highs in the U.S. and around the world as economies have picked up steam.A surprising jump in U.S. wage gains intensified concerns about inflation and the likelihood of a more aggressive Federal Reserve. This week's congressional budget deal that boosts federal spending sharply — on the heels of the big Trump tax cuts — pushed the 10-year Treasury yield to a four-year high of 2.88%. The 10-year bond had ended 2017 at 2.41%.The Dow and other major stock market indexes hit record highs on Jan. 26. The S&P 500 was already up 7.5% in 2018, with the Dow industrials up 7.7% and the Nasdaq 8.7%. Amazon and Netflix had sprinted 20% and 43%.But on Feb. 1, IBD switched its stance on the market direction from confirmed uptrend to uptrend under pressure. The market had finished mixed that day after an up-and-down session. That followed a few mild distribution days — days with selling in above-average volume — since the market top.IBD'S TAKE: Staying in sync with the market direction is one of the most important things an investor can do. Investor's Business Daily lets readers know at a glance what the current state of the stock market is. The Market Pulse graphic in The Big Picture column lets you know if the market is in a confirmed uptrend, uptrend under pressure or a correction. Subscribers also can find the market direction arrow clearly displayed on the Investors.com home page.Meanwhile, more leading stocks showed weakness. Alibaba (BABA) tumbled on earnings, while several other top China internet stocks struggled as well. Homebuilders and RV makers, two leading groups that began to sell off sharply near the stock market top, continued to slide. Yet there were still some new breakouts.That switch in market direction was a clear warning sign for investors. Market direction is critical and lets you know whether you should be looking to buy stocks, take profits or move to cash. In a confirmed uptrend, most stocks are likely to rise and leading stocks are more likely to deliver huge gains. In a correction or bear market, even top-rated stocks find it hard to make headway. When the market is under pressure, breakouts may occur but are more likely to fail, and other leading stocks struggle.On Friday, Feb. 2, the January U.S. employment report showed that average hourly wages rose 2.9%, the biggest annual gain since 2009 and much higher than expected. That pushed yields even higher, raising the odds of a more aggressive Fed just as Jerome Powell took over as chairman from Janet Yellen. Meanwhile, Apple led a sell-off in the broader iPhone ecosystem on its weak handset sales and current-quarter guidance. Fellow Dow stocks Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) plunged on earnings.Stocks sold off significantly, including the Dow's ominous 666-point tumble, capping the worst weekly percentage losses in two years for the major averages.The next Monday, Feb. 5, stocks plunged in violent action. Talk erupted about the Dow falling 1,175 points, its biggest point loss ever. But that point loss reflects the fact that the Dow is so much higher than it was in prior drops, such as in 1987 or 1929. In percentage terms, the Dow's 4.6% fall was the biggest since August 2011, but only the 25th largest since 1960. For perspective, the Dow plunged 22.6% in its Black Monday crash on Oct. 19, 1987.Still, that Feb. 5 loss was significant. The S&P 500's 4.1% drop was also the worst since August 2011, while the Nasdaq composite's 3.8% was its biggest since the post-Brexit-vote sell-off in June 2016. On a technical basis, the market undercut important support areas. The major averages all fell through their 50-day moving averages, along with many leading stocks. Laggard Apple (AAPL) undercut its 200-day line.The stock market had clearly worsened since Thursday, Feb. 1. The market's fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, skyrocketed to multiyear highs. Psychological indicators like the VIX are secondary market gauges to the major averages and leading stocks, but can be contrarian signals. When fear hits extreme levels, it's often a sign of at least a short-term bottom. IBD left the market direction at uptrend under pressure.The stock market went on a wild ride Tuesday, in part because of volatility related to VIX-related products. Stocks sold off sharply intraday but closed higher. The Nasdaq and some leading stocks retook their 50-day lines.But one good stock market day isn't meaningful. In fact, most of the best percentage gains in history are in the midst of deep corrections or bear markets.On Wednesday, stocks whipsawed again, and this time closed lower as a renewed rise in Treasury yields spooked investors again. The Nasdaq fell back below the 50-day line while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials found resistance there. Chips, energy and some China stocks were notable losers.On Thursday, shares opened higher but quickly turned lower as Treasury yields moved back to recent multiyear highs. The Dow Jones fell 4.15%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 undercut Tuesday's intraday lows. Leading stocks reeled. After a week of negative action, most stock breakouts from the last several weeks had failed while longer-term winners were slashing gains and falling through support areas.This combination of negative action triggered a shift to an outright market correction, signaling that investors should move to the sidelines. At Thursday's close, the S&P 500 and Dow industrials were 10% off their highs, the traditional level for a correction.On Friday, big swings continued. The Dow tumbled intraday through its Tuesday, Feb. 6 low, joining the other key indexes. The S&P 500 index briefly undercut its 200-day average for the first time since mid-2016. But the major averages then rebounded strongly, closing with gains of 1.4%-1.5%.Even with that gain, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell just over 5% for the week, their worst performance in two years.For a return to a confirmed market uptrend, the major averages must rebound over several days, with at least some strong gains in heavy volume. Friday's rally was encouraging. But as Tuesday's rebound showed, one good day isn't enough.The major averages rose more than 1% on Monday, closing above their Friday intraday highs, passing an early test. Stocks rose modestly on Tuesday, rebounding from morning losses.On Wednesday, the major averages opened lower on hot inflation data. But stocks soon reversed higher, even as the 10-year yield hit 2.90%. The Nasdaq composite rose more than 1% in afternoon trading, moving back above its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones advanced more modestly, still below that key support level. Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index fell sharply. Look for a rally attempt to be confirmed by one or more price gains in heavy volume in at least one of the major averages.The Dow industrials get a lot of popular attention, but the index represents only 30 stocks. The broader Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index are usually the gauges you should focus on.Another confirming sign of a market uptrend will be if leading stocks break out of bases into buy zones. If there's nothing to buy, the market may be telling you it's too soon to return.Some leading stocks were entering or reclaiming buy points or hitting new highs by Wednesday.Back in December and at the start of the new year, IBD explained why stock market gains in 2018 could be smaller than in 2017, with more corrections during the year.The S&P 500 rallied 19.4% last year, double the historical norm. It was one of only 19 times that the index had returned more than 15% since 1962. After such a strong year, stocks typically rise but not as much. In only one of the 19 cases was there a stronger gain (1997), while there were only four times when the next year was negative. The average gain was 7.5%.Meanwhile, few signs indicate a bear market is looming. Bear markets are typically associated with a recession. That seems unlikely in the near term, with economic growth strong across the globe for the first time in several years.While bond yields are rising as a result, inflation is still low. The Federal Reserve aims to raise rates toward more normal levels. But the Fed, like other central bankers, does not want to unnerve financial markets.Earnings are robust, with more S&P 500 companies beating profit views than at any time since 2009. Companies are hiking 2018 earnings forecasts on the new Trump tax cuts.Some people say we're due for the nine-year bull market to end, but stock market cycles don't follow a set calendar. Bear markets typically are preceded by a sharp ascent. Good examples include the tail end of the dot-com rally in early 2000 and the housing bubble run-up to 2007.While January 2018 was a strong month, for much of last year the major averages were just grinding higher. And there were few climax runs in leading stocks. Square (SQ) exhibited some climax-like characteristics, but that stock was turbocharged as part of the Bitcoin climax top in December.Another harbinger of a bear market — big year-over-year increases in margin debt — also is relatively low. However, the rise of double- and triple-leverage ETFs means that margin levels may not reflect speculation and investor exposure as well as before.If the market had moved into a full-blown bear — often defined as stock market down 20% or more — you'd see sustained heavy selling, breaking through multiple support areas in heavy volume. Rebound attempts would be short-lived. The vast majority of stocks would fall, with leading stocks breaking down en masse.Pay attention to the market by following the major averages and leading stocks. IBD's daily market analysis, including the Stock Market Today articles and The Big Picture, will keep you in sync with the S&P 500, Dow industrials and Nasdaq as well as top stocks and groups.Don't fight the stock market. Most stocks move with the market, so a correction is a time to sell stocks and move to the sidelines.For those determined to stay invested, you should probably take at least partial profits. Follow sell rules. If a stock falls 7% to 8% below your buy point, just sell. Don't let stocks that had run up 10% or more turn into losers. Remember, if you get out and a stock bounces back, you'll get another chance to buy — or you'll have capital for another quality stock.Keep in mind that these rules apply to individual stocks. When it comes to diversified mutual funds and ETFs, long-term investors may take a different approach. Whereas specific stocks might not bounce back in the next upturn, the broad market eventually will recover. Investors can use market pullbacks and corrections to add to holdings of diversified funds.Still, there is a way for fund investors to reduce losses and capture gains in the next upturn through market timing. The ETF Market Strategy uses the current market direction in IBD's Market Pulse feature to determine when to buy and sell a broad stock index ETF like PowerShares QQQ (QQQ).When the stock market clearly resumes an uptrend — whether it's next week or months from now — you want to be ready.  The market can turn very quickly. When a new rally takes hold, the first leading stocks that break out often turn out to be big uptrend winners.So stay engaged with the stock market. This is a great time to build a watch list. Buying right solves most of your holding and selling problems.Look for highly rated companies with strong and rising relative strength lines. The RS line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. If the market corrects or moves sideways, these stocks may set up in bullish patterns and be leaders in the next uptrend. Good examples of top stocks with RS lines at or near record highs include Adobe Systems (ADBE), ServiceNow (NOW) and AbbVie (ABBV).For more help finding quality stocks, check out IBD's premium products Leaderboard and Marketsmith.You can also look for stocks that found support at their 50-day line and didn't give up too much ground.A great place to find potential stocks to watch during a downturn is via IBD's stock lists, including the IBD 50, the Big Cap 20 and Sector Leaders.Keep editing your watch list during corrections. Some stocks that hold up well initially will break down, while others will begin to outperform.When everyone is bullish, nobody wants to sell but there are no longer many people left to buy. That's why excessive bullishness can mark at least short-term tops. Markets rise on a wall of worry. They need investors coming off the sidelines and buying stocks. So a dose of fear in investors is healthy.Pullbacks and corrections clear the decks and set the stage for a new strong uptrend. Leading stocks can set up in bases, and you can buy these first movers when the major averages confirm the new stock market rally.The original version of this story published on Feb. 8.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:When To Sell Stocks — Rules That Help You Protect Profits And Avoid LossesIs It Time To Get Into — Or Out Of — The Stock Market?How To Spot A Major Stock Market Top, The Easy Way2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Price Gains

96,ABBV,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) topped sales and adjusted profits views in the third quarter, but shares dropped late Thursday after its hepatitis C drug franchise declined again and narrowly missed consensus expectations.XIn after-hours trading on the stock market today, Gilead fell 4.1% to 74.70. Shares closed down 2.5%, at 77.88, as biotech stocks widely sold off before the closing bell Thursday following Celgene's (CELG) sales miss and guidance cut.Total sales of $6.51 billion declined 13.2% but topped the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $6.33 billion. Adjusted profit came in at $2.27 a share, down 17.5%, but beat expectations for adjusted earnings of $2.03 per share.Sales of HIV and hepatitis B drugs climbed nearly 3% to $3.6 billion. Flagship HIV drug Genvoya posted a yearly gain of 114% to $988 million and beat the consensus for $934 million, RBC analyst Brian Abrahams wrote in a note to clients.Gilead's hepatitis C drugs, meanwhile, continued to struggle, falling by a third to $2.2 billion and missing analyst views for $2.3 billion, Loncar Investments Chief Executive Brad Loncar said in a note. This follows the entry of AbbVie's (ABBV) Mavyret which can treat all six genotypes of hepatitis C.RBC's Abrahams noted hepatitis C drug Harvoni came in ""considerably lighter than expectations"" at $973 million vs. the consensus at $1.1 billion. Epclusa also missed, posting $882 million, which was below the consensus for $958 million.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead currently has an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 66 out of a best-possible 99. Earlier this month, its RS Rating rose as high as 73.

97,ABBV,"AbbVie (ABBV) launched to a record high Thursday after it settled a patent dispute with Amgen (AMGN) that will require the No. 1 biotech to pay AbbVie royalties on sales of its Humira copycat.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, AbbVie popped 5%, near 88.96, though in earlier trades shares were up as much as 7.3% to a record high of 90.95. Amgen stock lifted fractionally to close at 185.46.Per the settlement, Amgen's drug known as Amgevita will launch in Europe in October 2018. Its U.S. version, Amjevita, will launch in January 2023. The drug is a biosimilar of AbbVie's drug Humira, an anti-inflammatory med. A biosimilar is a biologic copy of a drug.Amgen will pay royalties to AbbVie, though the specific terms are confidential, AbbVie said in a news release. All litigation pending between the two will be dismissed. AbbVie will grant patent licenses to Amgen on a country-by-country basis.Humira is AbbVie's most important drug, bringing in 69% of total sales in the second quarter ended June 30. Ten other drug firms are working on Humira biosimilars, including Biogen (BIIB), Novartis (NVS), Dow's Pfizer (PFE) and Mylan (MYL), Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: AbbVie and Galapagos are also working together on cystic fibrosis drugs. But Vertex Pharmaceuticals says it has a strong lead and analysts don't disagree. Head to The New America for a breakdown on the market and why Vertex is leading the pack.The consensus is calling for Amgen's Humira biosimilar, the first approved, to bring in $748 million in worldwide sales in 2025, up from just $50 million in 2018 when it's set to launch in Europe. Still, there are patents remaining that AbbVie could use to extend litigation, Raffat said.But RBC analyst Kennen MacKay boosted his views for success for Amgevita/Amjevita to 95% from 65%. He expects Amgen's drug to penetrate at its peak 30% and 50% of the Humira biosimilar markets in the U.S. and Europe, respectively.MacKay models peak global sales of Amgevita/Amjevita hitting $928 million in 2032. On a sales share basis, he expects Amgen to have 20% of the Humira biosimilar market, depending on royalty rates. He kept a sector perform rating and 192 price target on Amgen.RELATED:Biotechs Beating The Market, But Are They In Buy Range?These Companies Gain If Trump's Foreign Profit Relief Plan PassesWhy Amgen, Lilly, J&J Are Interested In These Small BiotechsAbbVie's New Hepatitis C Drug Chipping Away At Gilead's Share

102,ABBV,"Sanofi's (SNY) second deal in a week could spur a ""robust"" buying period in biopharma, an analyst said Monday after the French drugmaker outbid Novo Nordisk (NVO) for Belgium's Ablynx (ABLX).X The deal comes a week after Sanofi said it would spend $11.6 billion to acquire Biogen (BIIB) spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV), a hemophilia drug specialist. Also last week Celgene (CELG) said it would buy Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) for $9 billion.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez says this could signal the beginning of an active time for biopharma deals.""In our view, Sanofi's aggressiveness in mergers and acquisitions may precede a more robust period of deals within biopharma as the effects of U.S. tax reform are felt and valuations for late-stage assets continue to drive higher,"" he said in a note to clients.Specifically, Sanofi plans to spend about $4.8 billion to acquire Ablynx. Ablynx is nearing approval for a drug to treat a rare blood clotting disorder and is already partnered with AbbVie (ABBV), Dow's Merck (MRK), Sanofi and others on a number of potential drugs.""The various partnership programs offer upside to prospects for Ablynx's wholly owned assets,"" Fernandez said. He notes a drug to fight a virus that causes infections of the lungs and respiratory tract is expected to have Phase 2 data in the second half of the year.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts don't expect payers to push back on drugs that treat rare diseases considering the small populations they tend to treat. See which companies are working in this arena by visiting the Industry Snapshot.The acquisition also adds a drug known as caplacizumab to Sanofi's pipeline. The drug is being tested as a treatment for acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, a rare clotting disorder caused by impaired activity in an enzyme.Ablynx estimates the market for the disorder, also known as acquired TTP, to be 1.2 billion euros, or $1.48 billion. It expects to gain approval in Europe in 2018 and in the U.S. in 2019.But Sanofi fell 1% to close at 45.32 on the stock market today. Ablynx, on the other hand, rocketed 12.6% to finish at 53.65. Novo Nordisk, which lost out on its chance to acquire Ablynx, sank 1%, to 57.53.Novo Nordisk had put up a bid of about $2.6 billion earlier this month for Ablynx.RELATED:Why This Biopharma 'Behemoth' Could Soon Become AcquisitiveIntuitive Surgical Dips On Lackluster Guidance, But Analysts BullishWhy These 3 Biotech Stocks Could Outperform Their Peers In 2018

103,ABBV,"Jeffrey Leiden's office shelves are plastered with all the accoutrements you'd expect from the chief executive of a $39 billion biotech. But from the awards, letters of accommodation and inevitable family photos, emerges a theme.Gratitude.Leiden's Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) currently aims to treat 31,000 cystic fibrosis patients across the globe. Cystic fibrosis is a progressive, genetic lung condition and those who survive into adulthood generally don't live past the age of 38, according to most estimates.XIn 2012, Vertex set out to change that and the success it's seen with two medicines — soon to be three — on the market have generated the 50 to 100 pieces of mail plastered to Leiden's shelves. They're letters of thanks from graduates and newlyweds.""We get about 50 (letters and emails) a week from patients and families thanking us for what we do,"" Leiden told Investor's Business Daily. ""We know all these patients. Most of them are kids and teenagers and we watch them grow up. It's like being part of a family. Not a company.""Vertex wasn't always a cystic fibrosis play. In earlier days, it was focused on treating hepatitis C and launched a drug known as Incivek in 2011. Then Gilead Sciences (GILD) launched its drug, Sovaldi. That launch was one of the most successful in history. It also nearly put Vertex out of business.Though Incivek became a blockbuster drug shortly after its launch, Vertex pulled it from the market in 2014 as demand withered. Leiden describes that time as one of ""crisis"" for the company.""We were in the middle of a crisis,"" he said. ""We had gone from being a hepatitis C company with a billion-dollar drug for literally one year to essentially zero revenue. And there are very few companies that can, frankly, survive that kind of crisis simply because it's so hard to pivot to a new area or drug.""But for 13 years, a division of the company in San Diego had been quietly working in the cystic fibrosis arena. The indication fit in with Leiden's strategy: investing in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for serious diseases with large unmet medical needs in specialty areas.Vertex's specialty focus allows it to keep its sales and marketing forces slim which, in turn, allows it to reinvest nearly nine in 10 dollars of its revenue back into research and development. It sells cystic fibrosis drugs in the U.S. with a sales force of fewer than 20, Leiden said.Fast forward to 2017. Vertex has two drugs on the market — Kalydeco and Orkambi. In the second quarter, sales of Kalydeco, its first approved cystic fibrosis drug, grew 5% year over year to $190 million and Orkambi rocketed 32% to $324 million.Year to date, Vertex stock has more than doubled, rising 108%. Shares began forming a cup with handle and a 163.74 buy point in late July. Meanwhile, the broader biotech industry group has risen 28% and is ranked eighth out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 20 just 13 weeks ago.Shares of Vertex dipped 0.5% to close at 151.26 on Friday.Vertex is a rarity among biotechs, in a way. Its pipeline is almost solely in cystic fibrosis. Of 13 drugs in its pipeline not already licensed out to bigger pharmaceuticals, 11 are in cystic fibrosis. Leiden acknowledges the risk from a portfolio standpoint.But some products simply don't make sense for Vertex, he said. Vertex has farmed out drugs in flu and cancer to Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Merck KGaA because the enormous sales contingent it would take to sell drugs in those indications would take away from reinvesting in science.Reinvesting in science has allowed Vertex to do something else unique. Whereas medicines from other firms target the symptoms of cystic fibrosis, Vertex is working to correct the genetic underlying causes of the disease to, eventually, prevent infants diagnosed with it from ever fully developing it.The underlying science focuses on about 200 genetic mutations that can be divided into four ""buckets,"" Leiden said. Kalydeco can treat 10% of patients. Orkambi, a combination of Kalydeco and a drug known as lumacaftor, can treat another 50%. Eventually, though, Vertex plans to treat 90% of patients.Getting to that third ""bucket"" of patients, though, will require a three-pronged treatment strategy. Already, the ""backbone"" for that triple is being considered for approval in the U.S. and Europe: A combination of Kalydeco and a drug called tezacaftor. That looks likely to be approved in February 2018.On top of Kalydeco/tezacaftor, Vertex is adding a ""next-generation corrector,"" a drug that can fix other abnormalities in genes to treat another 30% of patients. Vertex has strong Phase 1 data for three next-generation correctors in combination with Kalydeco/tezacaftor, and a fourth ready to read out soon.The eventual goal is to decide which of the four possible triple-pill combinations will provide the most efficient treatment with few to no side effects. After that, Vertex plans to use gene editing to treat the last 10% of cystic fibrosis patients for whom traditional small molecule medicines won't work.Leiden won't comment on when he expect a triple-pill to get approval. He sees pivotal trials beginning next year. Most analysts take that to mean the U.S. Food and Drug Administration could approve a triple-pill from Vertex in 2019-20.Vertex's goal with the triple is to prevent infants, less than 1 year of age, from developing cystic fibrosis as it's known today. In adults who already have lung damage, Kalydeco has been shown to improve lung function within two weeks and, over time, slow the rate of decline in lung function.IBD'S TAKE: Vertex is among several leaders nearing a buy zone. Head to IBD's list, Stocks Near A Buy Zone, for other near-term opportunities including an entertainment stock and a financial services play.""Rather than declining at 1%-2% per year, they decline at 0.75% per year in lung function,"" Leiden said. ""And while that may not sound that significant, it's sort of like compounded interest. Take that over a lifetime and it makes an enormous difference in both their survival and their quality of life.""The quality of life improvement is huge, Leiden said.""They used to go to the hospital four to five times per year. Now it's zero to one time per year,"" he said. ""They used to be on a transplant list. Now they're not a transplant list. They used to be able to walk one block. Now they can walk miles. It's not just their longevity but their quality of life.""Galapagos (GLPG) and AbbVie (ABBV) have teamed up to follow in Vertex's steps, but both Leiden and JMP Securities analyst Liisa Bayko are doubtful the duo can catch up. To get FDA approval for a triple-pill combo, they must show strong data for each component first.Bayko estimates Galapagos is several years behind and even if it does make it to market, its triple-pill would have to have outstanding efficiency to persuade Vertex's patients to switch to a new medicine.""Vertex has done a good job at continually improving on its meds,"" she told IBD. ""They keep moving the bar higher. They make it challenging for people to want to go on a drug that will be just as good as Vertex's. Why would you want to do that if you can just get on Vertex's drug?""Some are more bearish, though. Jefferies analyst Michael Yee sees Galapagos eventually getting 20% of the cystic fibrosis market. Still, he notes Vertex has created a strong setup for itself with making barriers to entering the market high and delivering strong medicines.He, like others, questions what Vertex will do after its cystic fibrosis well runs dry. Leiden acknowledges the cystic fibrosis journey is nearing an end but says Vertex has plans to shift into other rare diseases like sickle cell, a genetic lung/liver condition and a deadly nerve disorder.""Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (a lung/liver condition) looks a lot like cystic fibrosis,"" Leiden said. ""We have the technology and we know how to go after it.""And as to the bears skeptical about Vertex's cystic fibrosis pipeline?""There's a group of analysts or investors out there that say, 'Well, it's really great they want to do that but we'll see if they're able to, I'm skeptical,'"" he said. ""The reason that's weird to me is we've already done it. We've proven we can do it and we've proven the model.""""I don't think it's a question anymore. I think we've demonstrated it works.""RELATED:Why The Biotech 'Catch-Up Rally' Could Add Another 15%-20%Celgene Breaks Out; These 2 Biotech Giants Close On Buy PointsTop Biotech Stock Near Buy Zone After FDA Drug Approval

109,ABBV,"The potential cancer-cure disclosures that propelled Loxo Oncology (LOXO) stock up 43% one day in June and an additional 15% one day in September indicate innovation in cancer research and treatment that many investors say could keep Loxo aloft.XWith a potential near-blockbuster cancer treatment in the making, Loxo is recognized by Investor's Business Daily in the inaugural IBD Biotech Innovators Awards. Its lead drug looks medically promising, but it targets a relatively small patient population, so annual revenue is expected to fall short of the $1 billion that defines a commercial blockbuster.But it could get close. Loxo stock made that big leap on June 5 after the company disclosed progress in Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials for its lead drug candidate, larotrectinib. The Sept. 13 leap for Loxo stock followed word it would disclose Phase 1 trial data for its tumor fighter at the annual meeting of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, set to start Saturday, Oct. 15. Loxo stock touched its all-time high of 95.92 on Sept. 28.The company expects to file a New Drug Application for  larotrectinib by early 2018. If the Food and Drug Administration approves the NDA within six months, as Loxo expects, the company could begin sales to specific patients almost immediately.How IBD Chose The Biotech Innovator Award Winners: IBD asked equity analysts, ETF and mutual fund managers, and university professors to identify the top biotech companies based on their innovative research. We asked them to focus on companies with pioneering drugs likely to launch in the next several years and reach blockbuster, or near-blockbuster, sales of $1 billion or more a year. The award winners selected by IBD editors are the six most-cited companies. To find profiles of all the award winners and details of their work, go to our full Biotech Innovators special report.)Loxo's focus on developing highly selective ""precision medicine"" for patients with genetically defined cancers is gaining ground with researchers, patients and doctors — and fund managers.Rather than looking to attack a specific cancer, say by using compounds that kill lung tumors (and sometimes either don't work or kill healthy cells too), Loxo uses increasingly popular gene sequencing to identify patients hosting a specific gene mutation resulting in a tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) fusion. These are abnormal proteins that tell tumor cells to grow. Using Loxo's novel compound that inhibits TRK fusion activity — called TRK inhibitors or kinase inhibitors – Loxo's clinical trial therapy demonstrated improvements in patients with 17 different types of cancer.Hence, Loxo's larotrectinib is gaining attention in research clinics and on Wall Street. It could well become the first drug initially approved by the FDA to target mutant proteins in many cancers rather than targeting a cancer itself.Loxo spokesman Dan Budwick calls this approach ""tumor agnostic,"" and notes that Merck's (MRK) Keytruda was indeed approved in May for treatment of any unresectable metastatic solid tumor with specific genetic qualities, a first from the FDA.But Keytruda was initially approved, in 2014, for metastatic melanoma, then for non-small-cell lung cancer in 2015, then head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in 2016, and was already in widespread use when Merck applied to the FDA to also use Keytruda in a gene-sequencing tumor-agnostic approach rather than the old tumor-specific approach. In contrast, Loxo's larotrectinib would be the first time the FDA initially approved a cancer drug using the tumor-agnostic gene-sequencing approach.IBD'S TAKE: Loxo recently hit an all-time high, but what companies are doing so at the moment? IBD's New Highs list tracks these movers, but also ranks them by IBD Composite Rating.Loxo's potential has Wall Street's attention. The number of mutual funds holding Loxo shares jumped 27% in Q2, supporting a market cap near $2.7 billion and a secondary offering in late June. It marked eight straight quarters of rising fund ownership. Loxo of late sports a highest-possible IBD Relative Strength Rating of 99, putting it among the top 1% of stocks in price performance over the past 12 months.Some two weeks after Loxo's June 3-5 reports at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in Chicago, the world's biggest cancer conference, Loxo sold more than 3.6 million shares of common stock in a secondary offering, pricing shares at 72, although the stock had traded well below 20 as recently as November. The company raised $260.8 million before expenses.The stock performance of Loxo rivals or would-be rivals, however, has been spotty at times, though most are on a roll of late.Loxo's peer Ignyta (RXDX) — which went public in early 2014, five months before Loxo — has mostly traded below its IPO price of 10, though on Thursday Ignyta stock touched a 22-month high of 14.70.Loxo partner Array Biopharma (ARRY) peaked near 16 shortly after its 2000 IPO, but the stock is way up since touching a six-year low below 2.50 in February 2016, this month hitting an eight-month high of 12.68.Blueprint Medicines (BPMC), which like Loxo develops kinase inhibitors, went public at 18 in 2015 and on Sept. 29 hit a new all-time high of 71.67 after a 50% September run-up.At ASCO in June, Loxo reported a 76% objective response rate — tumor sizes were reduced in 76% of patients — across many cancer types in clinical trials with patients whose tumors hold TRK fusions.""Larotrectinib delivers consistent and durable responses in TRK fusion patients across all ages, regardless of tumor context, and does so with few side effects,"" Dr. David Hyman, the research team's principal investigator in Loxo's larotrectinib trials, told the ASCO conference. Hyman is chief of early drug development at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. ""In this way, the larotrectinib/TRK-fusion story fulfills the promise of precision medicine, where tumor genetics rather than tumor site-of-origin define the treatment approach.""Cowen analyst Eric Schmidt says Loxo estimates 1,500 to 5,000 U.S. patients annually could benefit from larotrectinib treatment. In the trial data disclosed to ASCO, patients with the greatest tumor shrinkage — at or near 100% — included those with soft-tissue sarcoma, lung and colon cancers, melanoma and salivary-gland cancer. In all, 17 types of cancer are being treated in three trials with 55 patients who have at least one thing in common: those gene mutations causing kinase or TRK fusions that tell the cancer cells to grow.Larotrectinib earned Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA in July 2016, meaning the FDA gives it some priority because early trials suggest the new therapy offers a serious advantage over existing treatments for people with life-threatening diseases. (Breakthrough is not necessarily the FDA's highest priority, however. Fast Track and Priority Review designations and an Accelerated Approval Pathway are the FDA's urgent alternatives.)Larotrectinib, then called Loxo 101, received the Breakthrough designation for ""unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with (neuronal) TRK-fusion proteins in adult and pediatric patients who require systemic therapy and who have either progressed (worsened) following prior treatment or who have no acceptable alternative treatments,"" noted the Friends of Cancer Research. The nonprofit counted 47 FDA Breakthrough designations in 2016, of which 17, including larotrectinib, targeted cancer.Analyst Schmidt says the recent efficacy data for larotrectinib are among ""the best ever that we have seen in oncology."" He estimates a peak larotrectinib market of $500 million in annual sales in five to 10 years. Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison sees larotrectinib peaking at $800 million in annual sales around 2025.Loxo, which went public in August 2014 at 13 per share, conceivably could get acquired at a blockbuster-like premium, though no buyout talk has surfaced. Among biotechs that end up being purchased, most are acquired before becoming profitable, says Schmidt. Cowen estimates Loxo won't escape the red ink until after 2020.""One thing that has transpired since (ASCO in June) is Celgene's (CELG) pricing on Idhifa at $25,000 per month, a new high for the niche oncology market,"" Schmidt told IBD.  ""This will give Loxo some breathing room and perhaps lead them to consider a higher price for larotrectinib.""Idhifa was approved by the FDA on Aug. 1 to treat AML, the most common form of acute leukemia in adults. Celgene estimates some 21,000 new AML cases are diagnosed in the U.S. annually.June's secondary offering, which more than doubled Loxo's cash pile to nearly $470 million as of June 30, helped Loxo make a $40 million acquisition of the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors program from Redx Pharma. It renamed the Redx drug candidate Loxo-305.In Loxo's acquisition release, its chief business officer, Jacob Van Naarden, called the deal ""another program to our pipeline that so nicely aligns with our larger strategic vision and capabilities. The Redx team has created a novel chemical matter that selectively and reversibly inhibits BTK, a validated molecular target across numerous B-cell leukemias and lymphomas.""Analyst Schmidt told IBD the $40 million price tag ""looked right to me. The BTK target is validated, and there is unmet need in patients who fail Imbruvica,"" AbbVie's (ABBV) and Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) commercial name for ibrutinib, which treats complications from stem-cell or bone-marrow transplants known as chronic graft versus host disease, or GVHD.In his research note, Morgan Stanley's Harrison praised the BTK acquisition, calling it ""a logical addition to the Loxo pipeline."" He rated Loxo stock as overweight, with a 91 price target. Cowen's Schmidt rates Loxo outperform but doesn't offer a price target.The Cowen analyst was unfazed by Loxo's Q2 financials, with losses greater than estimated. ""Cash-burning biotech earnings rarely are interesting,"" Schmidt said. Loxo reported a wider loss of $30.4 million, or $1.14 a share, up from $15.9 million, or 77 cents, in Q2 2016. Loxo is slated to post Q3 results on Oct. 31.With its cash hoard, Loxo is in no danger of running out of money for years, but  investors expect sales and profit before then.Cowen's Schmidt, who's met at least twice recently with Loxo's top brass, says the company is ""on track"" toward speedy approval for larotrectinib.Loxo is working on other potential drugs, including the BTK inhibitors bought from RedX to target leukemia and lymphoma, and a pipeline with partner Array Biopharma for six kinase inhibitor targets. But it's too early to suggest that any will approach blockbuster status.RELATED:Get The Details On All 6 Biotech Innovator Award-Winning Companies And Their WorkHere's Why Loxo Oncology Stock Hit A Record HighWhy This Small-Cap Biotech Stock Popped To A New High

Investor's Business Daily does the work for you. Check out Leaderboard, where our markets team curates and analyzes a list of top-notch names. Take a free trial of Leaderboard.Take-Two Interactive rose as high as 122.21, clearing a 120.28 cup-with-handle buy point from a consolidation that's been taking shape since early November. But shares reversed to close down 0.1% at 119.29. The gaming software company's stock had been somewhat rangebound over the past few weeks, trading between the 50-day line and the buy point.Meanwhile, Vertex Pharmaceuticals broke out past a 167.95 entry late into Friday's trading session, rising 1.8% to 169.21, as the markets surged to more new highs. Volume was 2% below normal. You'd like to see volume rise at least 40%-50% above average on a breakout.On Monday, Vertex reversed lower, losing 1.2% to 167.14, back below the entry. Volume was modestly above normal .The action comes ahead of earnings on Wednesday. Vertex had been consolidating since last July, and the biotech has been on a steady rise since December.Wellness services software company Mindbody sank 0.6% to 34.95 on Monday, working on a consolidation forming since November, the shortest base of the group. Though Mindbody lost support at the 50-day line several times while building the base, it has been able to quickly recover. The stock has now formed a handle, lowering the buy point slightly to 36.05.It is important to note that as the major indexes have continued to surge higher, each of these four base-building technology and health care stocks has a Relative Strength line that is lagging.

112,ABBV,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages hit record highs amid a wave of earnings and a weaker dollar, though the greenback rebounded somewhat. Netflix (NFLX) skyrocketed on blowout subscriber growth and a bullish outlook. Celgene (CELG) will buy Juno Therapeutics (JUNO). Intel (INTC) surged on its earnings and outlook, while Texas Instruments (TXN) and some other top chips failed to impress with their quarterly financials, but Apple (AAPL) continued to lag amid a growing chorus of concerns regarding iPhone X sales and production. Airline stocks plunged as United Airlines (UAL) said it would expand rapidly, setting the stage for a renewed price war.X The S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq all rallied solidly to hit fresh record highs as earnings season heated up. The falling dollar, which has acted as a tailwind for U.S. multinationals' stocks and profits, rebounded from three-year lows Thursday as President Trump said he expects a stronger greenback. Netflix (NFLX) was a big earnings winner. Intel (INTC) also did while after Texas Instruments (TXN) and Lam Research (LRCX) were among several leading chip stocks to struggle on earnings. Airline stocks plunged on United Airlines (UAL) while Apple (AAPL) and iPhone-related stocks sold off as several analysts cited evidence of weaker iPhone X demand.Shares rocketed to record highs as Netflix (NFLX) added 8.33 million streaming subscribers worldwide, crushing its fourth-quarter target of 6.3 million. The Internet TV streaming giant ended 2017 with 117.58 million total streaming subscribers, with one analyst predicting 200 million Netflix subscribers in 2020. The gains came despite Netflix implementing price hikes to its service plans in the U.S. and Europe. Netflix credited hit original content such as TV series ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Crown"" and movies like ""Bright"" for its subscriber gains in the period. For the March quarter, Netflix is predicting it will add 6.35 million net new subscribers.Chipmakers Intel (INTC), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), STMicroelectronics (STM) and Xilinx (XLNX) beat their December-quarter targets, but got mixed reviews from investors. Texas Instruments (TXN) posted in-line results and its shares were punished. The sector continues to wrestle with concerns that the chip cycle has ebbed. Top chip-gear makers Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) beat views, but sold off on the news. Meanwhile, Xilinx joined Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) in benefiting from the sale of high-performance chips for mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.RELATED:Intel Beats Fourth-Quarter Targets, Offers Cheery 2018 OutlookBiotech mergers heated up with Celgene (CELG) agreeing to pay $9 billion for the 90% of CAR-T drug developer Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) it didn't already own while Sanofi (SNY) reached a deal with Biogen (BIIB) hemophilia spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) for $11.6 billion. Celgene's acquisition comes as it prepares to lose exclusivity for cancer drug Revlimid in 2022. Juno rivals Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Novartis (NVS) in making CAR-T drugs to treat blood cancers. Sanofi's deal follows two failed mergers in 2016 and 2017.Early Wednesday, Novartis (NVS) reported core earnings of $1.21 per share on $12.92 billion in sales, up a respective 6% and 2% on a constant-currency basis, and easily beating the consensus.

AbbVie (ABBV), on Friday, topped expectations with adjusted profit up 23% and sales climbing 14% to $7.74 billion in sales.United Airlines (UAL) sent airline stocks into a tailspin after the carrier told analysts that it planned to expand flight coverage through 2020. Investors fear the move, done in part to regain relevance in the smaller cities United once abandoned, risks more competition and cheaper fares, helping passengers but threatening profits. American Airlines (AAL), during its Q4 earnings call, signaled that it wouldn't change its profit and growth targets based on United's ambitions — for now. Southwest Airlines (LUV), JetBlue (JBLU) and Alaska Air (ALK) also reported.General Electric (GE) missed on earnings and disclosed an SEC probe, though core units did well and GE kept its 2018 outlook. Three industrial members of the Dow industrials, Caterpillar (CAT), 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX), reported strong earnings and guidance. Insurer Travelers (TRV) and consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG) also beat on earnings views.

The tax on washing machines decreases and then expires after three years, while the duty on solar cells and modules phases out after four years. Solar technology providers Suniva and SolarWorld charged that China was providing unfair subsidies and financing to its solar producers.

Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) report next week.Steel Dynamics (STLD) earnings rose 26%, topping views modestly, as sales climbed 22% to $2.34 billion. The No. 1-ranked company in IBD's Steel-Producers industry group said 2018 is shaping up to be a good year, thanks to more moderate inventory levels, improvement in global demand and pricing, and incremental investment driven by tax cuts. Specialty steel producer Allegheny Technologies (ATI) nearly doubled profit estimates. Revenue grew 14% to $910 million, fueled by its high-performance materials for jet engines. Freeport McMoRan (FCX) benefited from higher copper prices, boosting Q4 earnings by 104%, ahead of estimates. Revenue grew 15% to $5.0 billion.

113,ABBV,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are likely to beat fourth-quarter earnings estimates, an analyst predicted, but biotech guidance will be cautious despite the windfall of tax reform.X The fourth-quarter earnings reporting season kicks off next week with Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Novartis (NVS) weighing in Tuesday and Wednesday on the pharma side. Celgene (CELG) and Biogen (BIIB) are on deck early Thursday with AbbVie (ABBV) trailing on Friday.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges expects cautious predictions at the beginning of 2018, noting the example of Celgene's pre-announcement earlier this month. Uncertainties in payer dynamics, competition and U.S. drug access are likely to play into forecasts.""All these factors, along with an imminent return to a more challenging political environment, suggest that management teams will be more than typically cautious in the guidance that they first provide to the financial community on their earnings calls,"" he said in a note to clients.For the fourth quarter, Porges calls for Vertex's cystic fibrosis drugs Orkambi and Kalydeco, Gilead's hepatitis C and HIV drugs, and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' (REGN) Eylea and Dupixent — the latter two eye disease and eczema treatments, respectively — to surprise to the upside.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs suffered in the third quarter as high profile drugs missed expectations and smaller players took headlines by beating views. Head to the Industry Snapshot for more on what happened in the prior quarter and whether history is expected to repeat itself.But he sees older drugs from Amgen (AMGN), including psoriasis and arthritis med Enbrel, as at risk of disappointing investors. Biogen's multiple sclerosis drugs Avonex and Plegridy, and AbbVie's cancer med Imbruvica could also disappoint, he said.Needham analyst Alan Carr sees investors focusing on mergers on the fourth-quarter calls and throughout 2018. This week, rumors emerged that Celgene could be considering a takeover of Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), and Biogen could be considering putting in a bid on Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR).""We continue to believe pharma has a bias towards de-risked assets that are on the market or in some cases still under regulatory review,"" he wrote in a note to clients.In the first half of 2018, he expects the Food and Drug Administration to approve Vertex's cystic fibrosis regimen of Kalydeco and tezacaftor as well as an HIV combination from Gilead. AbbVie and Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX) could also get the OK for a drug to treat severe menstrual pain.Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) is also likely to grab approval for patisiran, a drug to treat a condition in which abnormal protein deposits throughout the body can cause systemic problems. Achaogen (AKAO) and Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals (TTPH) are also nearing approvals for two antibiotics.RELATED:Why Celgene's Rumored Acquisition Of Juno Actually Makes SenseDow's Merck Does An About-Face, Releases Cancer Trial ResultsHow Hospitals Plan To Put Pressure On Generic-Drug Makers

It tumbled 1.3% Tuesday to breach the support line. IShares 3-7 Year Treasury Bond (IEI) also extended its losses from the prior session. But TLT recovered most of its Wednesday loss and IEI reversed slightly higher.Homebuilders, semiconductors and real estate led the downside among sector funds in the stock market today.

Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) slumped 9% to about 1,972, for a third straight decline. It skyrocketed last year but has had a far tamer start this year with a 2% gain.Meantime, the cryptocurrency it aims to track continues to make daily headlines. So far this year, South Korea has announced a probe into banks to curb speculation, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he regrets comments last year in which he called Bitcoin a fraud, and billionaire investor Warren Buffett told CNBC Wednesday he has no interest in cryptocurrencies. The Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) CEO said: ""What's going on definitely will come to a bad ending.""Talk about a fresh start for the new year. A cannabis-focused exchange traded fund is soaring as more states legalize marijuana sales.But it's not a newly minted ETF. ETFMG Alternative Harvest (MJX) has run up 16.4% so far this year through Jan. 9, according to Morningstar Direct, far ahead of the S&P 500's 2.8% gain. The fund hit a new intraday high Tuesday. It perked up with a 3% jump Dec. 26, when MJX began trading with a new objective and ticker, and has soared 30% since then.Before that date, MJX traded under the ticker LARE and was the Tierra XP Latin America Real Estate ETF. In late October, ETFMG notified investors it would change the Latin America index to Prime Alternative Harvest Index and track marijuana stocks instead.MJX now boasts $317.6 million in assets and owns Canadian pot stocks such as Cronos Group, Canopy Growth and Aurora Cannabis. It also has positions in medical companies such as GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH), a U.K.-based developer of marijuana-derived drugs to treat cancer and other diseases, and Insys Therapeutics (INSY), whose products target cancer pain.A handful of tobacco makers including British American Tobacco, Japan Tobacco and Altria Group (MO) round out the 30 holdings in the portfolio.Since the fund began trading under the new objective and ticker two weeks ago, there isn't really a track record. It's currently extended from any buy point. MJX carries a 0.75% expense ratio.IBD'S TAKE: Even as investors in the cannabis industry try to get in on the ground floor, investing in the space in the U.S. can be tricky.AdvisorShares Vice ETF (ACT) isn't a pure-play marijuana fund. As the name implies, it's a broader theme. As of Dec. 13, cannabis stocks accounted for 20% of its portfolio, while alcohol and tobacco made up the remaining 49% and 32%, respectively.ACT has attracted $15.1 million since its Dec. 12 launch. Its top holdings include alcoholic beverage producer Constellation Brands (STZ), drugmaker AbbVie (ABBV) and agricultural chemical firm Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG).Constellation Brands rose more than 2% Tuesday on news related to its work with Canopy Growth Corp., a Canadian medical marijuana company, to develop nonalcoholic cannabis drinks.

117,ABBV,"Biogen (BIIB), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) will build on momentum in the biotech sphere to beat Wall Street expectations for the third quarter, an analyst predicted Friday.X""Large-cap biotech stocks have been strong as we head into the third-quarter reporting period,"" Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young wrote in a note to clients. She is focused on Biogen's Spinraza, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' (REGN) Dupixent and Gilead's hepatitis C drugs.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Investor's Business Daily's 453-company Biotech industry group dipped a collective 0.8%. But the group is ranked first out of 197 groups tracked by IBD and hit a 22-month high earlier in the week.That momentum will likely continue into the third quarter for most large-caps, Young said. She calls for Biogen, Gilead, Sarepta and possibly United Therapeutics (UTHR) to beat on the top line.Biogen is set to report its quarterly results early on Oct. 24. Young calls for Spinraza, a spinal muscular atrophy drug developed with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), to beat the consensus view for $250 million. She forecasts $356 million in sales.The Cure SMA website reports that an estimated 2,000 U.S. patients have been dosed with Spinraza as of the third quarter, 450 of whom were in trials or expanded-access programs, Young wrote. That suggests that there were about 1,550 commercial U.S. patients as of the period. She sees 1,400 U.S. patients on Spinraza in the third quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks have trended north over the past several weeks amid a healthy dose of good news for several key players. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at which stocks helped send the group to a 22-month high.""We do think at some point Spinraza could surprise to the downside as patients switch to the much less expensive maintenance dose vs. the loading dose,"" she said. ""However, we think this quarter Spinraza will very much still be in its launch phase.""On the top line, Young models Biogen reporting $3.11 billion in sales and adjusted income of $6.08 per share. Both metrics top the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $3.03 billion and $5.68, respectively.The multiple sclerosis franchise is likely to face more headwinds, though. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, U.S. Tecfidera's total prescriptions fell 4% in the third quarter with no price increases. As a result, Young's model for Tecfidera is $35 million below the consensus view.Young forecasts Gilead beating third-quarter expectations on strong sales of drugs to treat hepatitis C and HIV — helping the biotech shuck off quarters of hepatitis C malaise. Still, AbbVie's (ABBV) new hepatitis C regimen could have an impact. Gilead is set to report late on Oct. 26.AbbVie's Mavyret gained approved in August to treat all genotypes of hepatitis C patients. It's typically dosed over eight weeks — a shorter duration than rival drugs — and is priced at roughly half the price of its competitors, on a wholesale basis.For that reason, Young dropped her 2018 forecast for Gilead's hepatitis C drug sales to $6.4 billion from $7.8 billion to factor in risk from AbbVie. But she remains bullish on the third quarter, where she models $6.57 billion in total sales, above consensus views for $6.37 billion.Her forecast is driven by consensus-topping views for $1.18 billion in sales of Harvoni and $1.12 billion in sales of Epclusa. But HIV estimates are largely in line with consensus views. She models a miss on HIV drug Truvada, with an estimate that's $125 million below the consensus due to the entry of generics outside the U.S.On the bottom line, Young calls for adjusted profit of $2.26 per share vs. the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks for $2.07.Young calls for Regeneron and Sarepta to narrowly beat Wall Street forecasts, benefiting from eczema drug Dupixent and Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug Exondys 51, respectively.Regeneron, which is set to report its earnings early on Nov. 8, could deliver a slight beat vs. the consensus for its Sanofi (SNY)-partnered eczema drug. Young models $86 million in sales of Dupixent, down from her earlier view for $111 million, but above the Street's $73 million.Dupixent's weekly total prescriptions are up an average 153% in the third quarter vs. the prior period. Dupixent ended the third quarter with 2,398 outstanding total prescriptions, Young wrote. She forecasts 155% quarter-over-quarter growth for the drug.But her third-quarter model for Eylea, approved to treat a number of eye conditions, is $920 million, which trails the consensus for $936 million.Sarepta could, again, surprise to the upside with Exondys 51. In the second quarter, Sarepta crushed expectations by $13 million. For the third quarter, Young calls for $43 million in Exondys 51 sales, above the consensus for $40 million.Further full-year guidance for $125 million to $130 million in sales is likely conservative, Young said, noting that ""management sounds upbeat about launch trends.""RELATED:AbbVie's New Hepatitis C Drug Chipping Away At Gilead's ShareThis Biotech Broke Out To An 11-Month High — Can It Keep Going?Why Regeneron's Patent Win Is Worse For Amgen Than You Think

118,ABBV,"AbbVie's (ABBV) newly launched hepatitis C drug Mavyret has already grabbed 7% of total new prescriptions, further chipping away at Gilead Sciences' (GILD) struggling hepatitis C franchise, an analyst said Friday.XAs a result, Wall Street sees Gilead's 2018 hepatitis C drug sales declining 28% vs. the year-earlier period, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a note to clients. The drop will be sharper in the U.S. at a 31% plunge. In 2019, sales are expected to fall another 19%.On a wholesale basis, Mavyret is priced at roughly half its competitors at $13,200 per month vs. $24,920, $28,000 and $31,500 for Gilead's Epclusa, Sovaldi and Harvoni, respectively. Dow stock Merck's (MRK) Zepatier and AbbVie's Viekira Pak cost a respective $18,200 and $27,773 monthly.But Gilead contends that after discounts and rebates, Mavyret is priced similarly to Harvoni. They differ, though, in treatment duration. Of the wide array of hepatitis C drugs, Mavyret can treat every genotype and has the shortest treatment duration at eight weeks for most patients.IBD'S TAKE: Novartis was first to the finish line with a CAR-T drug. What does it mean for Gilead's plan to acquire Kite? Head to IBD Industry Themes for a deeper dive on the segment.To contend with the likelihood of further erosion in its hepatitis C franchise, Gilead is pivoting into cellular therapy with the $11.9 billion acquisition of Kite Pharma (KITE). Though Kite doesn't have an approved drug, the merger was announced days before a rival drug from Novartis (NVS) gained approval.Novartis' drug is approved to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients up to age 25. Analysts now expect a similar drug from Kite, a treatment for an aggressive form of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, to grab approval later this year.Behind them, Bluebird Bio (BLUE) and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) are each partnered with Celgene (CELG) to work on similar treatments, known as CAR-T therapies.

120,ABBV,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) toppled Thursday after rival AbbVie (ABBV) revealed strong results from a Phase 2 trial of an eczema drug that could chip away at Regeneron and Sanofi's (SNY) potential blockbuster, Dupixent.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Regeneron sank 5.7% to 471.92, while Sanofi lost a fraction, near 49.32. AbbVie popped 6.1% to 81.78, soaring to an all-time closing high.AbbVie's drug, known as upadacitinib, achieved its main goal of improving eczema area and severity vs. a placebo by week 16. Half of patients achieved clear or almost clear skin on a 30-milligram once-daily dose.""We are excited by the results of this study, which shows that upadacitinib has the potential to be an important treatment option of patients with atopic dermatitis,"" said Michael Severino, AbbVie's chief scientific officer, in a statement.Upadacitinib is set to go into Phase 3 testing in 2018. In the Phase 2 study, the drug reduced itching within the first week and improved skin condition within the first two weeks.

121,ABBV,"Galapagos (GLPG) stock popped Monday to Vertex Pharmaceuticals' (VRTX) detriment after it figured out ""one piece of its triple-combination puzzle"" in treating cystic fibrosis, an analyst said.XStill, Galapagos still has a long road to truly challenging Vertex in treating cystic fibrosis, according to Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges. Vertex already has four potential triple-pill combos in midstage testing, whereas Galapagos just has one potential piece of its triple.Late Sunday, Galapagos said its drug known as GLPG2222 was safe and tolerable in a group of patients with cystic fibrosis. The drug also helped reduce chloride in patients' sweat — a test of cystic fibrosis — and increased patients' ability to forcefully expel air.But the lung function results were inferior to Vertex's results of tezacaftor plus ivacaftor in a failed Phase 3 trial, Porges said. On sweat chloride, GLPG2222 was inferior to Vertex's tezacaftor alone in a Phase 2 trial in the same patient population.""There is a vast amount of work in front of Galapagos and its potential partner AbbVie (ABBV) to challenge Vertex in this category,"" he said. ""These results do not yet compel us to alter our cystic fibrosis market.""IBD'S TAKE: Vertex started out in hepatitis C, but its efforts were dampened by Gilead Sciences' massive hepatitis C franchise. So it moved onto cystic fibrosis. See what transitioned the firm from its ""crisis"" by visiting The New America.Porges currently forecasts Galapagos having a 25% chance of success in cystic fibrosis, and maintained an outperform rating and 179 price target on Vertex. Vertex is planning to use its drugs tezacaftor and ivacaftor as a backbone for its triple.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Galapagos lifted 2.8% to end the trading day at 93.39.

123,ABBV,"A Wall Street analyst's downgrade of megacap tech leader Apple (AAPL) didn't ruffle the feathers of institutional investors, even as major stock indexes cooled mildly Tuesday. Apple, down 0.9% to 174.79, still hovered only 1% below its newest buy point, 176.34 in a flat base.X Apple is also still extended from a prior buy point at 160.97, stemming from an eight-week cup with handle.Apple is also up more than 47% since it broke out of a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12 in early January. That cup with handle was part of a long bottoming base pattern, one of the most bullish chart patterns that help an investor time a new buy correctly after a stock has made a devastating correction.Nomura Instinet cut its rating on Apple to neutral on concerns that iPhone X sales are already incorporated into the stock's price. Jeffrey Kvall also noted a ""historically full multiple.""Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) took a well needed break, showing wild action as the Bitcoin-tracking exchange traded fund careened from a new all-time high of 3,523 to an intraday low of 2,630.With an intraday range of 33.9%, Bitcoin Investment is definitely not for the faint of heart. Yet for those who embrace time-proven chart patterns that have shown up in the greatest stock market winners going back to the late 19th century, Bitcoin Investment is acting just as one would expect after it bolted out of a deep yet well-formed cup with handle at 985.10.The gain from that Nov. 22 breakout has now exceeded 257%. The buy point is derived by adding 10 cents to the highest price within the two-week handle, or 985.00.At 3:40 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite rebounded a bit to cut its losses to around 0.4%. The leading U.S. equities index is also still up for the week following Monday's 0.8% boost. Investors are showing unwillingness to dump stocks as the House of Representatives passed a major tax reform package on Tuesday. The Senate is expected to do the same as early as Tuesday evening and send it to the White House for President Trump's signature before Christmas.The S&P 500 eased almost 0.2%. Finance, REIT, utility, solar and automaker stocks led the downside.Volume is running lower vs. the same time Monday on both main exchanges.The Dow Jones industrial average was off nearly 0.1%, with just two more components in addition to Apple down 1 point or more: Visa (V) and Goldman Sachs (GS). Goldman has gained nearly 4% since clearing a 247.84 buy point in a nine-month saucer with handle.Notice on a daily chart that Goldman broke out past the proper entry on Nov. 30 with a 2.6% gain in volume that expanded 148% higher than its 50-day average, a good sign. The Street expects the giant in fixed income and commodity trading and mergers and acquisitions to increase Q4 profits 2% to $5.16 a share.Microsoft (MSFT), one of the tech components within the Dow 30, dropped 1% to 85.53 in light trade and is mildly below an 86.30 buy point in a new flat base. The cloud computing, business software and Xbox giant initiated its slow yet steady advance with a late-July 2016 breakout past a 56.87 buy point in a three-month flat base that's part of a longer saucer pattern.As noted in this Investor's Corner column, the saucer pattern requires patience on the part of the investor before a proper new buy point finally emerges.Microsoft holds a solid 91 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. Apple sports a 94 Composite, supported in part by a stronger EPS Rating than Microsoft (90 for Apple on a scale of 1 to 99, 68 for Microsoft). A 90 EPS Rating means that Apple is superior to 90% of all companies in IBD's database in terms of near-term quarterly and long-term annual profit growth.Back to Bitcoin Investment Trust. While the ETF has simply skyrocketed amid a surge in interest in the alternative currency, one reason why Bitcoin perhaps has not yet reached bubble conditions is the fact that both the Cboe and CME Group have only recently begun trading futures on their respective exchanges.Two, the total value of Bitcoin being traded globally is said to be only a fraction of the total value of trading in bonds, stocks, commodities and forex.A third reason why Bitcoin could see future growth is that professional money managers are showing an increasing appetite.

Since then, the stock has been forming a flat base that could also stretch into a saucerlike pattern.Biogen's earnings have nearly quintupled from $4.12 a share in 2009 to $20.22 last year. However, growth is expected to slow amid stiff competition in treatments for multiple sclerosis and other chronic medical conditions. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see earnings rising just 9% to $22.06 a share this year and up 8% to $23.81 in 2018.Within the IBD Big Cap 20, the current list showcases just one medical stock, AbbVie (ABBV).In other financial markets, investors dumped U.S. government bonds following the Federal Reserve's third hike in short-term interest rates of the year.

124,ABBV,"No franchise is safe in 2018 among large-cap biotechs, which are feeling pressure as the Food and Drug Administration speeds approvals for rival branded and generic medicines, analysts said Monday.X The theme is a continuation from 2017, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients.""Despite the near-record number of drug approvals, the large-cap biopharmaceutical sector fell out of a favor with investors, with no names more punished than those with concentrated product portfolios and looming branded or generic competitors,"" he said.Heading into 2018, management confidence is low as revenue trajectories for high-profile products face a slowdown courtesy of payers and competitive pressures. Porges doesn't see the uncertainty lifting in 2018 — and ""possibly not ever.""In 2017, competitive pressures slugged the likes of Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD). Celgene is feeling the pain in its inflammation unit amid mounting competition from Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novartis (NVS), as Gilead sees a rival for its hepatitis C drug sales in AbbVie (ABBV).Early next year, Porges expects guidance from the lion's share of large-cap biotechs to be conservative. The most stock-moving guidance will come from Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Gilead, he predicted.Alexion is working on a drug dubbed ALXN1210 to treat a pair of rare blood diseases. It's also undergoing a restructuring. Meanwhile, Gilead's hepatitis C franchise will again come under the microscope even as it attempts to pivot further into HIV with its drug bictegravir.""We believe there is $16 per share of value in Gilead's stock for hepatitis C, and the stock price could move up or down 5% if hepatitis C revenue guidance meaningfully differs from the consensus $5.5 billion to $6 billion estimate,"" Porges said.IBD'S TAKE: Small-cap biotechs performed well in the third quarter, but large-caps suffered mounting competitive concerns. See how that translated in the stock prices by visiting the Industry Snapshot.He noted AbbVie's plans for hepatitis C products are likely to hurt Gilead stock. AbbVie recently launched Mavyret to treat all six genotypes of hepatitis C. AbbVie will likely provide guidance on its fourth-quarter call ahead of Gilead.Porges expects 2018 sales outlooks from Celgene, Alexion, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Gilead, Amgen (AMGN) and AbbVie to miss analyst estimates. Biogen (BIIB) could provide an outlook that encompasses analyst views, he said.Later in the year, the large-cap universe will face political pressure, Porges predicted.""By midyear the congressional midterm elections will be underway, and these campaigns are likely to renew the focus on pharmaceutical companies and their pricing policies,"" he said. ""We continue to favor stocks of companies that are structural demand growth stories, with products protected by commercial, scientific, clinical or legal barriers to entry.""For 2018, his top picks are Vertex and Alexion.Another Leerink analyst, Michael Schmidt, pegs Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) as his top picks among small- and midsize biotechs focused on treating cancer.This group of stocks has outperformed the broader biotech market by 52% thus far in 2017, Schmidt wrote in a note to clients. This dynamic is set to continue in 2018 in a ""favorable regulatory environment"" and as large caps expand their portfolios via acquisitions.In 2018, Incyte (INCY), Seattle Generics (SGEN), Exelixis (EXEL), Clovis, Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO), Puma and Array Biopharma (ARRY) are set to launch key products. He counts nine in the group set to unveil pivotal trial results and pending regulatory decisions for a total of seven firms.Emerging technologies remain of interest. CAR-T therapy, which trains a patient's immune cells to fight cancer, and precision oncology had a strong 2017. But success in immuno-oncology combinations, cancer vaccines and certain antibodies has only been modest.""We think next-generation antibody-drug conjugates could be an underappreciated re-emerging area of interest in 2018, representing a clinically validated category but with significant room for upside,"" Schmidt said.Antibody-drug conjugates are antibodies linked to cell-killing agents. The antibody binds to specific marks at the surface of a cancer cell. ImmunoGen (IMGN), Mersana Therapeutics (MRSN) and Seattle are working in this area with the latter the furthest along, he said.RELATED:Why Big Pharma And Biotech Companies Are Girding For A Pricing 'Knife Fight'Teva's Restructuring Plan: Another Case Of Been Here, Done That?Generic Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don't

132,ABBV,"Invest in the disruptors.That's the advice from Wall Street, as giant biotech companies and the incumbents of Big Pharma are bracing to get crushed by more innovative — and cheaper — new drugs.X What started in 2017 will continue in 2018, analysts say. Generic drug approvals are rising and interesting new medicines are starting to take market share from the legacy makers of medications that consumers use frequently, including both Big Pharma and biotech companies.Blockbuster drugs representing an estimated $17 billion in annual sales are set to lose patent protection over the next decade, analysts say. Disruption will come as generic drugs and innovative new biologic alternatives come on the market.""It will be brutal,"" JMP Securities analyst Mike King told Investor's Business Daily. ""It will be a knife fight.""In the market for cholesterol-lowering drugs, King expects Amgen (AMGN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) to feel the heat from the likes of Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR), The Medicines Co. (MDCO) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY).Meanwhile, in anti-inflammatory treatments, Celgene's (CELG) Otezla, which gained blockbuster status in 2016, missed sales forecasts by a wide cut in the third quarter. Analysts say newly approved drugs to treat the same conditions from Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novartis (NVS) are taking market share.Gilead Sciences (GILD) is still feeling the pain from the maturing of its hepatitis C drug unit in the U.S. and Europe. The rapid pace of Gilead's hepatitis C sales decline is expected to slow down somewhat, but newer medicines like AbbVie's (ABBV) Mavyret are likely to swipe some of its sales.Big Pharma isn't getting any help from regulators either. Food and Drug Administration head Scott Gottlieb will continue to increase approvals for copycat drugs, stoking competition for both branded and generic drugs facing new rivals as firms try to undercut one another in price.Among the Big Pharma companies, Pfizer (PFE) will be at the forefront feeling the sting of generics taking sales. Earlier this month, Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) was allowed to launch a generic copy of the blockbuster erectile dysfunction drug Viagra.Generic drugs tend to be cheaper than their branded counterparts and Viagra is a pricey drug at about $70 per tablet, according to AccessRX. In 2013, after Pfizer lost exclusivity for Viagra in Canada and Europe, worldwide sales fell 8% to $1.88 billion.Today, generics in Europe have slashed the price of drugs containing the same active ingredient as Viagra by about 90%. Generic versions of Viagra cost about a third of the price in Canada. U.S. Viagra prices could also fall if the trend repeats itself with a generic on the market.Teva, meanwhile, is struggling with $34.7 billion in debt as of the end of the third quarter. On Thursday, Teva announced a plan to cut its workforce by more than a quarter, close several manufacturing facilities and suspend its dividend on ordinary shares.The firm is also planning to review its generic drug portfolio, most specifically in the U.S., to change prices or discontinue products.IBD'S TAKE: See how giant biotechs fared vs. smaller players in the third quarter by visiting the Industry Snapshot. Hint: The quarter was classified as ""alarming"" for one large-cap biotech which could be in trouble as they see more competition for their traditional moneymakers.Across the board, spending on prescription drugs in 2016 increased by just 3.8% per person, according to a report from Express Scripts (ESRX). That's down from a 5.2% rise in 2015, representing a 27% drop in the growth rate.That trend is likely to continue in 2018, FBB Capital Partners analyst Mike Bailey told IBD. He credits Gottlieb for the decline in generic prices. Gottlieb is running the FDA like a business, which allows for a cycle of more approvals, more competition and lower prices.Although the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could use their tools to influence pricing, it's unlikely President Trump will use his executive powers to enact sweeping drug-pricing reform such as allowing Medicare to negotiate prices or enacting outright pricing controls, Bailey says.""I wouldn't expect any major changes out of the Trump administration in pricing,"" he said. ""I think mechanically and politically it's difficult to get pricing law through the system. It's politically more acceptable to just get more generic drug approvals. It's a win-win.""JMP's King counts drugs that treat rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis as among those in the ""crowded areas."" In 2016, drugs in this class cost an average $3,588 per prescription and benefited from increases in utilization and unit cost, according to Express Scripts.But in the third quarter of 2017, things began to look dour for the likes of Celgene, which missed expectations for its inflammation drug Otezla by 26%. In the U.S., the lag was even sharper at 28%. One analyst suggested Celgene was forced to take a price concession.Celgene also cut its guidance for 2020 after terminating trials of a drug to treat Crohn's disease, a condition that results from chronic inflammation in the digestive tract. It now sees inflammation and immunology drugs bringing in a combined $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion in 2020, down from the $4 billion outlook it issued in 2015.Biotech companies and Big Pharma will need to ""get realistic"" on their pricing in these competitive arenas, King says. The same could be said for companies making treatments for hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis and high cholesterol. All are highly saturated markets.To the latter point, he expects prices for drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors like Repatha from Amgen and Praluent from Regeneron and Sanofi to be under the microscope. These drugs lower bad LDL cholesterol in the blood. Evidence shows they also have a benefit on some cardiovascular outcomes.Repatha is listed at $14,100 per year, while Praluent costs $14,600. But rivals are closing in. Medicines Co. and Alnylam are working on another cholesterol drug, known as inclisiran. Meanwhile, analysts expect bempedoic acid from Esperion to be cheaper.Some of these Big Pharma and biotech companies ""are probably going to get their arms twisted a lot,"" King said. ""The pricing umbrella has created opportunities for new companies to come in and scale market share. Be careful if you own incumbents. Invest in the disruptors.""Other areas are seemingly immune to pricing pressure, analysts say.In 2016, the price of multiple sclerosis drugs rose an average 7.4%. That's a continuing trend, FBB's Bailey said. The price increases have been so egregious that House Democrats launched an investigation in August, noting that many of these drugs carry price tags north of $85,000 per year.The investigation was launched by Reps. Elijah Cummings and Peter Welch and centers on Bayer (BAYRY), Biogen (BIIB), EMD Sereno, Novartis, Roche (RHHBY), Sanofi and Teva.Among those pharmaceutical and biotech companies, Teva's 20-milligram dose of Copaxone has increased the most, rising 1,002% since its approval in 1996 to an annual price of $91,401 today, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Novartis' Gilenya, approved in 2010, is the highest priced at $91,836.The investigation is ""10 years too late,"" he said. ""It's more difficult to push price control for specialty markets. Multiple sclerosis is a massive market now, but stakeholders view it as a specialty market.""Rare disease and innovative cancer therapies also seem immune to pricing controls, analysts say. For example, earlier this year Novartis and Gilead — via its acquisition of Kite Pharma — gained approval for CAR-T drugs known as Kymriah and Yescarta, respectively.CAR-T drugs are developed using a patient's own immune system cells. They are trained to seek out and destroy cancer cells. Kymriah goes for $475,000 per year and Yescarta is listed at $373,000, ARK Invest analyst Manisha Samy wrote in a recent post.""While gene therapies are beginning to cure cancer, they come at a price that can cause sticker stock,"" she said. ""That said, compared to traditional therapies that suppress, but do not cure cancer, the cost benefit analysis of gene therapy is compelling.""Pricing shock tends to tamp down on excitement for really compelling drugs, Bailey says. The prime example is Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals' (IONS) Spinraza, the first spinal muscular atrophy drug approved. It costs $750,000 in its first year and $375,000 in subsequent years.But sentiment for the biotech companies' shares is already down, he said. So drug pricing concerns shouldn't be a big stock killer in 2018.""In the past when biotech stocks go up quickly, they get new drugs and people are excited, a lot of times someone will throw in a grenade: 'What about drug pricing?'"" Bailey said. ""But sentiment is already down. Even if there's a concern about drug pricing, I see a little less downside.""IBD's 462-company Biotech industry group is now ranked No. 34 out of 197 groups tracked, and has fallen from first just two months ago. Shares collectively neared a two-year high in October, but have since shucked almost 7% from that point.Over that same time, Amgen and Celgene — among the biggest biotechs — have seen their share prices dive 9% and 26%, respectively. Regeneron has taken a 19% hit and Gilead has tumbled 14%.Meanwhile, Alnylam and Esperion, which look likely to rival PSCK9 inhibitor drugmakers like Amgen and Regeneron, have lifted 7% and 5%, respectively. AbbVie, which recently launched a rival to Gilead's hepatitis C franchise, is up 5%.But Novartis and Lilly, which are competing against Celgene to treat inflammatory conditions, have seen their shares retreat, though to a smaller degree.

134,ABBV,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Galapagos (GLPG) stocks diverged Friday as one analyst suggested that while Galapagos has an interesting molecular formula, it may not have a viable cystic fibrosis drug on its hands.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Vertex popped 3.5% to finish at 149.97, as Galapagos fell 2.7%, to close at 97.09. The biotechs made presentations Friday during the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference in Indianapolis.""Galapagos has well-researched molecules that have intriguing activity in a variety of laboratory systems and molecular models for cystic fibrosis, but so far it is difficult to know if these molecules will actually make viable drugs,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients.Both biotechs are working on triple-pill combinations to treat the genetic lung condition. Analysts mostly estimate Galapagos is several years behind Vertex, which already has four potential triple-pill combinations in midstage testing.To catch up, Galapagos appears to be compressing and ""attempting to outright skip over"" many of the traditional aspects of clinical testing. That has raised some questions for investors, Porges said.""Given their lack of progress with their combinations in the U.S., we don't foresee the sort of rapid development timeline for Galapagos' combinations in the U.S. that they are proposing and planning for Europe,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: At one point, Vertex looked like it was going to go bust as it worked to pivot to cystic fibrosis after its hepatitis C drug tanked. Visit The New America for more on Vertex's transition and what's next.During its presentation, Galapagos indicated it plans to introduce molecules via single-drug and add-on studies first, and then advance into novel triple-combination trials very rapidly, Porges said. The goal is seemingly to avoid traditional Phase 2 trials.But the Food and Drug Administration hasn't endorsed that strategy.""This means that all the current and soon-to-start trials of the Galapagos combinations will be conducted only in Europe,"" he said.Still, Galapagos is aiming to advance their combination to Phase 3 testing in 2019. AbbVie (ABBV) acquired the rights to Galapagos' cystic fibrosis combination program in 2013. Under the terms of the deal, AbbVie has to fund and execute the Phase 3 trials.AbbVie would likely prefer a more traditional and complete path to expensive Phase 3 testing, he said. Before that, AbbVie will have to decide whether to opt in or out of the deal.""Should AbbVie discontinue, or delay a decision about going forward, this would be viewed negatively for Galapagos and positively for Vertex,"" he said. ""Such a decision doesn't seem imminent, which is fortunate for Galapagos, but will make for challenging times for Galapagos if AbbVie opts out, or doesn't advance any of the combinations.""Porges has an outperform rating and 179 price target on Vertex stock.RELATED:Three Biotech Firms Top Third-Quarter Views — But Only One PopsIonis Rebounds After Beating Alnylam To Drug Application In EuropeNeurocrine, Exelixis, Juno Stocks Rocket After Crushing Views

135,ABBV,"Growth slowed again for AbbVie's (ABBV) key immunosuppressant Humira, prodding shares to dip early Friday despite AbbVie's otherwise strong second-quarter sales and earnings beat.XOn the stock market today, AbbVie sank 1.8% to 70.44. Shares topped a 67.60 buy point in June out of a flat base. The stock extended 10.4% from that point, but has since retreated to a 6% gain from its buy point.Total sales grew 7.6% to $6.94 billion, beating the consensus for $6.93 billion. Adjusted income of $1.42 per share was up 12.7% year over year and topped analysts' views by 2 cents.But Humira pricing commentary spooked investors, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat told Investor's Business Daily. For the second quarter ended June 30, Humira grew 13.7% vs. the year-earlier quarter to $4.72 billion. In the U.S. Humira sales grew 18%. Elsewhere in the world, Humira grew just 5.5%.Humira sales growth decelerated for the third straight quarter. But sales still topped expectations by $76 million, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott wrote in a note to clients. AbbVie sees a healthy Humira outlook in 2017 ""and no major access changes in 2018,"" he said.Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez said during the conference call with analysts that AbbVie would continue to be ""careful and conservative"" about pricing, according to Reuters. Negotiations with insurers to cover Humira in 2017 and 2018 have already wrapped.Humira is facing biosimilar competition outside the U.S. and analysts expect it to hit peak sales in 2018 before facing sales erosion through 2020.

Head to IBD Industry Themes for a look at who might be for sale and who's buying.Investors are counting on Imbruvica, a cancer drug, to be AbbVie's next biggest growth driver. In the quarter, Imbruvica brought in $626 million, tacking on 42.6% growth. Outside the U.S., Imbruvica sales rose 77% with U.S. sales growing 37.6%.Four smaller drugs faced double-digit declines vs. the year-earlier period. A Parkinson's drug called Duodopa grew 12.7% vs. the year-earlier period. But it was also the smallest, bringing in $81 million.AbbVie also confirmed its full-year adjusted earnings per share outlook for $5.44-$5.54, which would be AbbVie's third consecutive year of double digit earnings growth.In 2017-18, JPMorgan's Schott says to look for pivotal studies of AbbVie's drug known as ABV-494 which is being looked at as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, atopic dermatitis and psoriatic arthritis.RELATED:Gilead's Hepatitis C Franchise Topples Again, But Shares Up On BeatBiotech Fever Cools As These Players Dip On Longer-Term ViewsAstraZeneca Beat, But Stock Dives On Drug Failure; 4 More Report

137,ABBV,"Celgene (CELG) and AbbVie (ABBV) are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries of the inflammatory bowel disease market which is expanding at a rapid 20% clip, an analyst said Wednesday.XThe biologics market for these gastrointestinal diseases generated $9.2 billion in sales in 2016, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients. AbbVie's Humira and Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Remicade, both anti-TNF drugs used to fight inflammation, dominate the market today.""We believe this market is likely to continue or exceed its recent 20% growth rate, with significant share and value likely to accrue to Celgene and some offsetting value available also for AbbVie despite the inevitable erosion of AbbVie's dominant Humira franchise,"" he said.New classes of inflammatory bowel disease drugs are arising. That's where the likes of Celgene, Roche (RHHBY), Galapagos (GPLG), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and AbbVie are looking to make their marks with drugs now in Phase 3 trials for Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis — common forms of the disease.But earlier trials, without the benefit of clinical data to back them up, are having some difficulty in recruiting patients, Porges said. Many of these trials also exclude sicker patients, including the patients who've stopped responding to their current treatments.IBD'S TAKE: Earlier this year, AbbVie said it expects Humira to hit peak international sales in 2018 before facing erosion. Head to IBD's Technology page for a breakdown on where AbbVie sees its biggest drug going and how it plans to offset competition.Though anti-TNFs like Humira and Remicade were the ""first truly disease-modifying treatment approaches,"" many patients don't respond to or stop responding to anti-TNF drugs, Porges said. Studies suggest 50%-60% of anti-TNF patients don't respond or lose response within a year.Estimates show there are up to 1.6 million patients in the U.S. with inflammatory bowel disease. Of those, about 640,000 have Crohn's disease and another 680,000 have ulcerative colitis. Patient numbers in Europe are about 60%-70% higher than in the U.S.This ""provides a large opportunity for drugs based on new mechanisms,"" he wrote.RELATED:Perrigo's Beat-And-Raise Lifts Generic Drugs, Bucks Teva-Mylan TrendCould This Small Biotech Break Out On A Tie-Up With Eli Lilly?AbbVie Topples As Humira Sales Brake For Third Straight Quarter

138,ABBV,"A late-stage failure by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) could bolster biotech rival AbbVie (ABBV) in treating infants infected with a serious lung disease, an analyst said late Monday.XRegeneron's drug, known as suptavumab, was being developed as a treatment for respiratory syncytial virus, a common virus that leads to mild, coldlike symptoms in adults and older children, but can be serious in infants.Suptavumab proved efficient in a subgroup of 1,149 preterm infants tested in the Phase 3 trial, but didn't meet its goal in the study, Regeneron said in a news release. Regeneron discontinued development of the drug.""Despite this finding, the company has decided to discontinue the development program, presumably based on a limited opportunity such a subgroup would offer, and the cost of conducting another pivotal trial,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said.Regeneron's failure is to AbbVie's benefit, Porges said. The drug was meant to be a more convenient option to AbbVie's Synagis which is given to patients before the virus season starts and every month during the season. Suptavumab was tested as a 30-milligram single dose, or two doses eight weeks apart.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's 444-company biotech industry group is ranked sixth out of 197 groups after it spiked 1.4% higher on Monday. But biotech fever has chilled since the sector hit an 18-month peak in late July. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at what's affecting the sector.Porges cut his revenue forecasts for Regeneron by 1% to 3% and eliminated a potential 5% upside catalyst for Regeneron this year. He cut his price target to 552 from 580, but kept his outperform rating, noting the strength of Dupixent, an eczema drug.""We remain positive about Regeneron's stock based on our expectations of the long-term Dupixent trajectory, the positive upcoming catalyst of Dupixent asthma data and the (supplemental Biologics License Application),"" he said.Dupixent was approved as an eczema treatment in March. It was developed by Regeneron and Sanofi (SNY) in an agreement set to end this year. Analysts are bullish on Dupixent, which is also being looked at as an asthma treatment.Removing suptavumab from his forecast, Porges says his sales expectations for 2017 are still 1% ahead of the consensus. For 2018-19, Porges' revenue forecast is 5% and 12%-24% north of the consensus, respectively.At Tuesday's close, Regeneron had slipped 0.4% to 472.57 while AbbVie lost 0.7% to 70.34 on the stock market today.RELATED:Can Generic Drug Stocks Catch A Break After Mylan's Crash?Alnylam Reports Lagging Sales, Wider-Than-Expected LossesThe Surprising Reason Regeneron Toppled Despite Its Beat-And-Raise

"
143,ABBV,"It was just a year ago that the formula seemed right for Biogen (BIIB), the fourth-largest company in its industry, to mix up a biotechnology megamerger.Biogen's multiple sclerosis franchise — a lineup of six drugs that includes Tecfidera and Tysabri — was growing. Tecfidera, Biogen's most important drug, brought in $3.97 billion in 2016, up 9%.Further, hemophilia sales, though small, grew 53% in 2016 to $847 million between just two brand-name drugs, Eloctate and Alprolix. And Spinraza, a spinal muscular atrophy drug, grabbed FDA approval just days before Christmas.The plot thickened when Biogen's chief executive, George Scangos, resigned in July, leaving the company susceptible to takeout by the likes of Merck (MRK), Allergan (AGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Pfizer (PFE). Takeout rumors abounded, and Biogen stock ended 2016 down 6.2%, making it a cheaper asset to buy.""I thought last year was really the time for it to happen,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said. ""What Biogen offered last year was a relatively stable MS business that was still growing, a robust cash flow scheme, the opportunity for Spinraza and the hemophilia franchise. So an acquirer could say, 'I get all of that.' ""Fast-forward to today, and the picture is entirely different. Biogen is seeing increasing competition in the MS market, payers are balking at Spinraza prices, and the company has already taken its hemophilia drugs out of the equation.Now, only 24% of Wall Street sees Biogen as a potential takeout candidate in 2017, according to a Mizuho survey. And Porges says Biogen will probably have to wait until 2020 to see the deals roll in, if ever.""I think it has become significantly less likely,"" Porges said.So, what happened?After an incredibly successful 2016 in multiple sclerosis — including the launch of Zinbryta with AbbVie (ABBV) — Biogen's MS unit is facing looming competition from the likes of Roche (RHHBY) and Celgene (CELG), Porges told Investor's Business Daily.In a note to clients on April 7, Porges called Roche's Ocrevus a ""game-changer."" Ocrevus was approved in late March to treat both relapsing-remitting and primary progressive forms of MS, separating itself from the pack that is only approved for the relapsing-remitting form.""Both the MS physician and patient communities have been eagerly awaiting the Ocrevus launch,"" Porges said. ""The drug's high efficacy, reasonable safety profile and convenient six-month dosing schedule are all major factors in the drug's positive reception.""That spells trouble for Biogen, as Tecfidera had comprised 40% of total product sales as well as 76% of the MS unit. Biogen is actually partnered with Roche on Ocrevus, but the royalty won't be enough to offset erosion to its own MS franchise, analysts say.Porges expects Ocrevus to get 60% of the primary progressive MS market within three to four years. In the relapsing-remitting MS market, Porges sees 40%-50% erosion of Tysabri, and 30%-40% erosion of Tecfidera and Novartis' (NVS) Gilenya sales.Meanwhile, Celgene is working on an MS drug called ozanimod in Phase 3 testing. In function, ozanimod is closest to Novartis' Gilenya, though it could also rival Tecfidera or Sanofi's (SNY) Aubagio. Tecfidera, Gilenya and Aubagio, respectively, lead the MS market in terms of sales.""If Celgene wanted to buy a sales force and have something overnight to help sell ozanimod, Biogen could be that company,"" Porges told IBD. But with Biogen likely to suffer erosion from Roche competition in MS, that's looking less probable.The silver lining? Biogen won a patent and an interference case against Forward Pharma (FWP) over Tecfidera, though it was out a $1.25 billion settlement fee. Forward stock toppled 22.5% on the decision as it now loses out on a major royalty.Biogen's Spinraza has a different set of troubles. Developed with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), Spinraza is the first and only drug approved for the rare neurological disorder that causes muscle weakness and wasting in infants and children.Wall Street largely thought of Spinraza as a slam dunk. It had ""profound efficacy"" in two August 2016 studies in infants and children. The drug was so effective that Biogen and Ionis ended the studies early, Ionis Chief Executive Stanley Crooke told IBD in December.Spinraza was approved Dec. 23 with a fairly broad label. It's approved for use in children and adults with spinal muscular atrophy and remains the only drug approved for the disease that Crooke called ""catastrophic.""""This drug, of all things, should be rapidly adopted and widely reimbursed,"" Porges said. ""And what may have happened was what appeared to be good fortune with the label may have turned into a liability because payers became concerned too many patients would start on the drug so they restricted access.""Mizuho analyst Salim Syed calls 2017 ""largely a Spinraza story."" Biogen is set to report its first-quarter earnings on April 25. That will be particularly telling following the launch of Spinraza earlier this year. Analysts say, though, that payers are pushing back hard on reimbursements of the drug.Insurers Anthem (ANTM) and Humana (HUM) are only reimbursing patients on Spinraza with the most severe form of the disease, Type 1. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) has a broader policy, covering Type 1, 2 and 3 patients. That could be because Spinraza costs $125,000 per treatment, or $750,000 in the first year, and $375,000 in subsequent years, making it a pricey drug.The consensus is projecting $15 million in first-quarter Spinraza sales, Syed said.Porges lowered his expectations for Spinraza for 2017 to $266 million from $400 million. Sales results for the first quarter will be especially telling, he told IBD. North of 100 patients on the drug would be ""pretty good — as long as they're seeing continued starts.""Then there's Biogen's hemophilia drug lineup.In February, Biogen spun off its hemophilia franchise into Bioverativ (BIVV). Since then, Bioverativ shares are up 27%, which is great — for Bioverativ. But any company considering a Biogen takeover might think again without that unit, Porges said.IBD'S TAKE: Bioverativ isn't your standard biotech startup. Head to The New America to find out why.Bioverativ has yet to announce any quarterly results, having only been public since early February. The company is set to release its first-quarter earnings results on May 3. In its last full quarter with Biogen, that hemophilia unit brought in $242 million, up 11.5% year over year.Now, Porges says it would be smart for Biogen to also spin off its multiple sclerosis unit and turn its focus toward Alzheimer's. In Alzheimer's Biogen is following Eli Lilly and Merck, both of which had notable failures in December and February.Biogen's Alzheimer's play is the strongest in the sector, analysts say.In March, RBC analyst Michael Yee told IBD that Pfizer and Merck are the likeliest players to make a bid on Biogen. They would be ""interested in more branded drugs and particularly the Alzheimer's pipeline.""Biogen is working on two classes of Alzheimer's drugs — one that works to remove plaque buildups in the brain associated with Alzheimer's and another called a BACE inhibitor with Eisai. BACE inhibitors aim to prevent the plaque buildup.Porges says Biogen will likely have to wait until 2020 to see renewed takeover interest. In 2020, Biogen is expected to release the results of two Phase 3 trials of aducanumab. Its BACE inhibitor, elenbecestat, is also in a Phase 3 trial with results expected after September 2020.Eli Lilly's solanezumab worked on the theory that it would remove plaque buildup — called beta amyloid — in the brain. Merck's verubecestat was a BACE inhibitor. But both failed, and there are only a handful of potential Alzheimer's drugs in development now.Meanwhile, Axovant Sciences (AXON) is working on a different theory of treatment that doesn't involve beta amyloid. It expects to have Phase 3 data of its drug, intepirdine, later this year. That, too, could change the Alzheimer's landscape and potentially further dent Biogen's chances of a merger.Still, Biogen's board will place a high premium on its Alzheimer's pipeline if it ever comes to the acquisition table, Porges said. That's because everything else has failed and development costs for aducanumab and elenbecestat have headed toward the billions of dollars, Porges said.""If you're willing to take the risk on Alzheimer's, it still makes some sense as an acquisition, but what I've heard from people in and around the industry is they're struggling to bridge the gap,"" he said.

144,ABBV,"AbbVie (ABBV) stock hit a seven-month high Friday on an upgrade from Goldman Sachs, which estimated growth assets could bring in up to $20.5 billion in sales over the next five years.On the stock market today, AbbVie shares rose 2.1% to 65.88, after earlier rising as much as 3% to touch a high at 66.45. The last time AbbVie shares eclipsed 66 was in August 2016. AbbVie stock outperformed all but Kempharm (KMPH) and Nexvet (NVET) — two smaller firms that now trade under 5 each — among drugmakers on Friday.Goldman Sachs analyst Jami Rubin urged AbbVie to separate its Humira and growth units. Humira, an immunosuppressant, brings in the lion's share of AbbVie's sales. In 2016, sales of Humira accounted for 63% of AbbVie's total $25.56 billion in revenue.""We believe AbbVie would benefit from unlocking trapped value by separating business segments for reporting purposes and returning cash to shareholders through a recurring Humira dividend or buyback, as investors wait for (the) growth (products) to mature,"" she said.Rubin has a buy rating on AbbVie stock and moved it to her conviction list. She also boosted her price target on AbbVie stock to 80 from 74.Rubin estimates Humira is worth $39 per share of AbbVie's stock price. Growth assets in oncology, immunology and women's health are worth $52 per share today, minus $19 per share in debt, she wrote in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Among biotechs, Biogen's hemophilia spinoff into Bioverativ is looking at $1 million in sales this year. To ambitious after a month on the market? Maybe not. Head to The New America for a closer look at Bioverativ.Over the next five years, Rubin expects those assets to grow 16% to $20.5 billion in sales from $9.8 billion. In the meantime, Humira will act as a cash flow-generator and repatriation of cash overseas could make accessing funding easier.Though AbbVie doesn't appear likely to see mergers, she said.""Recent comments from management about lack of interest in large deals suggest that alternative uses of cash could be considered,"" she said, but didn't offer suggestions of what use AbbVie has for extra cash.RELATED:How Gilead Is Paying The Price For Actually Curing A DiseaseAbbVie Stronger Bet Than Gilead, Amgen — At Least Until 2020: LeerinkDrugmaker Reaches Dividend Leaders List As It Hits Buy Point

145,ABBV,"Acadia Pharmaceuticals (ACAD), Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) and Lexicon Pharmaceuticals (LXRX) could be on the cusp of being acquired, an analyst said Friday as he examined historical merger patterns in Big Pharma.""Small to midsize biotech companies with approved drugs may be attractive acquisition targets due to reduced development and regulatory risk,"" Needham analyst Alan Carr wrote in a research report.The trio just grabbed their first FDA approvals. Acadia's Nuplazid was approved in April 2016 for psychosis associated with Parkinson's. Ocaliva, from Intercept, was approved in May 2016 for a liver disease. Lexicon's Xermelo got approval in February for carcinoid syndrome.Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX) looks likely to get approval next month for Ingrezza, a drug that aims to treat involuntary movements associated with long-term use of certain medicines. The disorder is known as tardive dyskinesia.Though there was ""a disproportionate number"" of earlier-stage companies bought last year, that doesn't tend to be the trend. A third of the 60 small-to-midsize companies with approvals in 2011 have since been acquired, Carr wrote.""However, each of these acquired companies had previously launched a drug somewhere, which we interpret as risk mitigation by the acquiring company,"" he said. Of those 60, 11 were acquired shortly after their first FDA approval and nearly all within two years of that.IBD'S TAKE: Can anyone catch this beauty giant in medical-aesthetics? At least one company is trying. Read on in IBD's Industry Snapshot.Among biotechs, about half of the 41 companies acquired since January 2014 for more than $250 million in upfront cash had at least one approved or marketed drug. Some 74% had Phase 3 data or a drug under FDA review at the time of the announcement.Drugmakers targeting oncology and infectious diseases were ripest for takeover between 2011-17. Since then, 45% of infection and 42% of oncology outfits have been acquired. Most rare disease companies, 80%, remain independent today.Allergan (AGN) and Japanese pharmaceutical firms were most likely to acquire earlier-stage firms, Carr said. Overall, Allergan, Astellas Pharma, Daiichi Sankyo and Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma collectively acquired six companies between January 2014 and today.In the U.S. and Europe, AbbVie (ABBV), Merck (MRK) and Novartis (NVS) have each acquired one earlier-stage company since January 2014.RELATED:Did This Beauty Giant Just Solve The Acne Challenge?Lilly, Merck, Allergan Top Analyst's View For 2017 Pharma

147,ABBV,"You're looking for dividend stocks to invest in as a source of steady income, so how much emphasis should you put on fundamentals? A lot.X That's because if you want steady income you want to own the best dividend stocks — companies that offer above-market yields and a solid earnings and stock price track record to boot.And if that's the case, IBD's The Income Investor column can help. Each day on Investors.com and every week in IBD Weekly, the column features one or more companies that meet those criteria and have the potential to rise in price. That puts these stocks in more of the growth-and-income camp vs. simply, income.Why is it important to pay attention to earnings, yield and other factors? If a company hits a tough patch or its profits falter, that could hurt its ability to keep making those payouts.Where To Find Income Without Taking Big RisksTop Dividend Fund Manager Expects Growth In These Three SectorsHow Growth Stocks Can Yield Solid Income TooWhat Does Trump Tax Cut Mean For Dividends?General Electric (GE) provides a recent example. Shares dived 13% over two sessions after the diversified giant halved its prized dividends and lowered its outlook for 2018. The dividend cut was a shock to investors who've been relying on it for income. Its yield before the fall: 4.7%. The stock fell to its lowest levels in nearly six years. At the predividend cut annual payout of 96 cents a share, the stock's $13 decline this year offset the payouts earned over the past 13 years.GE's earnings have been volatile the past few years. They fell sharply in 2014 and 2015, increased last year and are expected to fall 8% this year.That's why a steady earnings track record is key, as is dividend growth rate. Most income investors would likely prefer to see a company raise its dividend rate, instead of reducing or keeping it the same.In addition to the daily column, you'll find three accompanying screens online and on The Income Investor page in the weekly edition. The Dividend, Utility and REIT Leaders offer other stocks that meet the same criteria as companies featured in the column, while the mini charts above the lists provide further details about six of those stocks. The mini charts appear only in the print edition.To access the dividend screens at Investors.com, go to the home page and click on the Stock Lists tab.The broadest screen is Dividend Leaders, featuring names such as Blackstone Group (BX). It's paid out a total of $2.32 per share in the past four quarters (or $2,303 per 1,000 shares). With the stock trading at 31.49, that amounts to a 7.35% annualized dividend yield. Plus the company sports a 24% dividend growth rate. Shares are up 18% this year, in line with the S&P 500, which yields just 1.91%. Blackstone is not your grandfather's dividend stock.A few other standout names on the list in terms of YTD price gains are Cisco Systems (CSCO), Toronto Dominion Bank (TD) and AbbVie (ABBV).But Steady Eddie names known for a steady earnings track record and dependable dividends like Coca-Cola (KO) and Chevron (CVX) often make the cut, too. Both stocks are S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, companies that have increased their dividends for at least the past 25 consecutive years.Utility Leaders show utility stocks, which are known for their defensive nature. They tend to hold up well when growth stocks are weakening. Their reliable revenue streams also enable most utilities to pay a steady dividend.IBD'S TAKE: Cisco has outperformed the broader market this year, but how does it rank in its industry group? Find out now at IBD Stock Checkup.Like utilities, real estate investment trusts (REITs) offer a relative safe haven in a volatile market. REITs are structured in a way that allows them to avoid paying corporate taxes if they pass the bulk of their earnings through to shareholders. Since that's done in the form of cash dividends, many income investors favor REITs. Though not immune to a slowing economy, these companies enjoy a fairy stable revenue stream via rent payments and lease proceeds from buildings or other real estate assets they own and operate.That said, keep in mind that utilities and REITs can also fall sharply if the stock market enters a steep slide. For instance, the Dow utility average dropped 45% during the 2008-09 bear market. In such severe corrections, it's important to cut stock losses and raise cash.The three screens offer plenty of dividend stock ideas that have to meet certain fundamental and technical criteria. From there, investors can conduct further due diligence to narrow down their choices.Subscribers to MarketSmith, a sister company to IBD, have access to a proprietary metric: Earnings Stability. This metric is calculated using a company's quarterly per-share earnings over the past three to five years. The resulting number runs on a scale from 0 (most stable) to 99 (least stable).The accompanying table shows stocks with a dividend yield of 2% or higher and an Earnings Stability of 4 or lower. In general, a number below 25 is considered stable. For further details on how this metric is derived, read this Investor's Corner column.RELATED:What A Red Bull Air Race Champion Can Teach About Winning In StocksYielding To A Higher Power: Dividends and Fed Rate HikesCan This Big Dividend Retail Stock Have A Joyous Holiday Season And 2018?

148,ABBV,"Dow component Merck (MRK) slid 6% Friday and kept tumbling after hours on disappointing third-quarter sales and the withdrawal of its application in Europe for an advanced lung cancer treatment.XIn after-hours trading on the stock market today, Merck fell an additional 3.3%, near 56.40, after shares closed down 6.1%, at 58.24. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), which makes rival drug Opdivo, lifted 1.8% late Friday after closing down 1.7%, at 59.94.AbbVie (ABBV), which also missed third-quarter sales expectations but beat profit views, advanced 2.7%, to 91.93, before the closing bell.Late Friday, Merck said its decision to withdraw its European application was based on data from a study dubbed Keynote-021, Cohort G. But it didn't offer specifics regarding its findings. The regimen is already approved in the U.S. as a first treatment for advanced lung cancer.""Merck is confident in the clinical data from this rigorously conducted trial, which demonstrated specific improvements in overall response rate and progression-free survival for the Keytruda combination regimen compared to chemotherapy alone,"" the firm said in a news release. Immuno-oncology drug Keytruda is combined with chemotherapy to treat lung cancer.Earlier in the day, Merck reported adjusted income of $1.11 per share, up 4%, and beating the view of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $1.03 a share. But sales of $10.33 billion declined 2% and lagged the $10.51 billion analyst model.Investors have zeroed in on Keytruda for Merck ""given the increasingly challenging hepatitis C environment,"" Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said. On Thursday, Gilead Sciences (GILD) reported its hepatitis C drug sales fell by a third.""We expect questions to focus almost entirely on the evolution of Keytruda uptake (as a first treatment) in non-small cell lung cancer,"" and timing on the readout of another study, called Keynote-189, confirming Keytruda plus chemotherapy in advanced lung cancer, Fernandez said in a note to clients.Still, for Merck hepatitis C was a bright spot in the quarter. Sales of Zepatier posted a yearly sales gain of 185% to $468 million. Its growth only paled in comparison to cancer drug Keytruda, which brought in $1.05 billion, up 194%.IBD'S TAKE:  Merck shares began to form a flat base with a buy point at 66.90 in early March. A flat base is one of several ways of identifying potential breakout stocks. Head to the Investor's Corner for more on how to read this pattern.Merck's biggest product, a diabetes drug called Januvia/Janumet, declined 2% to $1.53 billion. Other big declines included a 51% dip in sales of cholesterol drug Zetia/Vytorin, and a 22% slide in revenue from human papillomavirus drug Gardasil/Gardasil 9.Sales were reduced by about $240 million due to changes in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stockpile for the Gardasil vaccine after a cyberattack hit Merck in the quarter. Revenue also took a $135 million hit from lost sales in some markets after the cyberattack.The firm raised and narrowed its full-year guidance. It sees adjusted earnings of $3.91-$3.97, up from its prior target of $3.76-$3.88 and analyst views for $3.87. It also forecast $40 billion to $40.5 billion in sales, above its earlier view for $39.4 billion to $40.4 billion. The consensus saw $40.43 billion.AbbVie's quarter was ""just OK,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients. It earned $1.41 a share excluding various items, up 16.5% and topping the consensus for $1.39. Its $6.995 billion in sales lagged the consensus for $7.04 billion, though grew from $6.43 billion in the year-ago period.More importantly, AbbVie outlined its ambitions through 2025 for current products and its late-stage pipeline, Porges said.The firm sees Humira — which treats rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, spinal arthritis, Crohn's disease and plaque psoriasis — approaching $21 billion in sales by 2020, up from its prior target for $18 billion, Porges said.For the year, AbbVie now expects adjusted profit of $5.53-$5.55 a share, touching the low-end of the consensus forecast for $5.53. AbbVie guided to adjusted income of $6.37-$6.57 per share in 2018, lagging analysts' view for $6.62.Humira is AbbVie's biggest drug. During the quarter, sales grew 15.8% to $4.7 billion and were above the consensus for $4.6 billion, Porges said. Cancer drug Imbruvica posted a yearly sales gain of 37.3% to $688 million. In the U.S., Imbruvica sales of $574 million beat analysts' views by 1%, Porges said.And though Gilead struggled with its hepatitis C drug franchise, AbbVie's hepatitis C unit beat analysts' average by 24%, though sales declined by 26.8%. This followed the U.S. approval in August of Mavyret, which can treat all six genotypes of hepatitis C.RELATED:Celgene Results Called 'Alarming,' As Alexion, Bristol MixedBoston Scientific Dives As Abbott Rivalry Hits Pacemaker SalesThree Biotech Firms Top Third-Quarter Views — But Only One Pops

152,ABBV,"Dow Jones component Merck (MRK) remains Credit Suisse's top pick heading into the European Society for Medical Oncology conference in October, but drugmakers Allergan (AGN) and Eli Lilly (LLY) also look strong, the brokerage said Monday.Around that time, Merck is expected to unveil the results of its trial, dubbed Keynote-189, testing immuno-oncology drug Keytruda plus chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with advanced lung cancer. The combo received accelerated approval in May.""We expect continued discussions around the potential uses of Keytruda while awaiting the top-line data from the confirmatory Keynote-189 study in the September/October time frame, which we expect to be positive,"" Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said.On its second-quarter conference call in July, Merck confirmed a cyberattack could delay some products this year, saying ""full recovery from the cyberattack will take some time."" Still, Merck is best-positioned for the remainder of 2017, Divan said in a note to client.Merck shares ended the regular trading session up 0.5% to 62.67.Though investors seem to prefer AbbVie (ABBV) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Divan is placing his bets on Allergan and Lilly. Still, there are several months until Allergan is expected to unveil data in a migraine trial, he said.And though Lilly offers a diverse pipeline, more interest is on Novo Nordisk's (NVO) trial known as Sustain-7, which is looking at its diabetes drug semaglutide vs. Lilly's Trulicity. Divan sees Trulicity as safer than Novo's drug.Lilly is expected to unveil data from a trial of its drug abemaciclib in breast cancer during an upcoming oncology conference, Divan said. Lilly is also planning to file applications for a migraine drug and is driving adoption of new drugs in cancer and plaque psoriasis.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs have struggled lately and are now ranked seventh out of 197 groups tracked by IBD, down from fifth last week. The sector hit a seven-week low Thursday after hitting an 18-month high in July. Head to IBD Industry Themes for more on what happened.Meanwhile, Divan isn't as bullish on the commercial potential of drugs from AbbVie in inflammatory diseases and immuno-oncology. He also calls for ""relatively rapid erosion"" of sales from key drug Humira in the U.S. once generics enter the market, likely in 2022.In Bristol's case, rumors it could become a takeover target have limited its stock in the near term. But early assets in immuno-oncology and potential approvals in kidney and liver cancers could drive upside over time, Divan argued.Credit Suisse also reinstated coverage of Dow stock Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in July, but Divan noted its valuation may be limiting investor interest. This will likely change after J&J's release of data from its Compass trial during the European Society of Cardiology meeting.That meeting is set later this month. J&J is looking at the ability of its anticoagulant, Xarelto, to prevent major adverse cardiac events including cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke in patients with some heart diseases.""We expect Compass to be the star of the meeting and has the potential to dramatically increase uptake of Xarelto in the coming quarters, something that can move the needle even for a company J&J's size,"" Divan wrote.But Divan also noted he downgraded Pfizer (PFE) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) to neutral ratings from outperform during the quarter. Dow stock Pfizer is struggling with near-term catalysts and a lacking acquisitive appetite amid the potential for tax reform.Teva, on the other hand, is range-bound ""until a new leadership team is in place, a strategy to reduce their debt is more certain and more clarity on the potential of generic versions of Copaxone (a multiple sclerosis drug) 40-milligrams is obtained,"" he wrote.RELATED:Will Pfizer's Cancer Drugs Help It Grow Without A Merger?Generic Drugs Are Rebounding Despite Teva, Mylan Free-FallPerrigo's Beat-And-Raise Lifts Generic Drugs, Bucks Teva-Mylan Trend

HPE shares fell 8.3%.Arcade and restaurant chain Dave & Buster'sPLAY raised its full-year net income guidance to $109 million-$113 million from $107 million-$111 million previously but cut its same-store sales growth forecast to 1%-2% from a prior view of 2%-3%, after Q2 comp growth of 1.1% fell well short of estimates for 2.6%. EPS jumped 42% to 71 cents, easily topping views of 55 cents, as revenue climbed 15% to $280.8 million, narrowly missing views. Shares sank nearly 12% for the week.Insurance industry software provider Guidewire Software (GWRE) earned 59 cents a share excluding items in its fiscal fourth quarter, up 51% year over year, on revenue of $181.1 million, up 28%. Analysts expected 39 cents and $168.6 million. For its fiscal first quarter, Guidewire guided to a loss of 16 cents a share on $100 million in sales. Wall Street was modeling a profit of 4 cents a share on sales of $112.9 million. However, its full-year outlook was ahead of views. Guidewire shares rose to record highs, closing up 5.3%.Coupa Software (COUP) reported a narrower-than-expected fiscal Q2 loss and revenue that topped views amid competition with Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP). The enterprise software firm's stock initially popped but closed the week fractionally higher.Target (TGT) announced Friday that it was slashing prices on ""thousands"" of items as retail competition gets tougher. Target shares fell 2%. Wal-Mart (WMT) lost 1.5%.T-Mobile US (TMUS) announced an exclusive partnership with Netflix (NFLX) to include the popular video streaming service in family plans that provide unlimited data starting at two lines for $100 monthly.

154,ABBV,"September will be a ""make or break"" month for a number of biotechs, including Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY), Axovant Sciences (AXON) and Versartis (VSAR), which are expected to present Phase 3 data in the upcoming weeks.XBiotech stocks could be poised for another run, says Loncar Investments Chief Executive Brad Loncar. Year to date, they've risen 28% and hit a 20-month high on Sept. 1. Shares have risen following Gilead Sciences' (GILD) announcement that it would acquire Kite Pharma (KITE).All of that comes before an incredibly newsworthy September that will feature at least five major medical conferences, at least 10 big investor conferences and nearly a dozen Phase 3 trials expected to read out, Loncar told Investor's Business Daily.""This might be the most newsworthy month in biotech history,"" he said. ""What's so amazing this September is there are a ton of Phase 3 trials that are scheduled to read out. The company itself is either going to succeed or fail because of these trial readouts.""""I count seven of them that are make or break for the companies,"" Loncar said.Loncar counts 11 key trial readouts in September. But principal among them, he notes, is Alnylam, which is expected to unveil the results of a trial of a drug dubbed patisiran for a rare disease that causes the buildup of abnormal material called amyloid throughout the body.Success could be a major catalyst for the technologies known as RNA interference and antisense, which essentially turn off malfunctioning genes, Leerink analyst Paul Matteis wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: Novartis' IBD Relative Strength Rating was boosted Friday to 71 from 65 out of a best-possible 99. The grade shows how the stock's price moved over the past 52 weeks against all other stocks in our database. Head to IBD Data Stories to see how Novartis stacks up against its rivals.Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) is also working on a Phase 3 drug, known as inotersen, to treat the disease called TTR amyloidosis.Matteis calls for an upside of 5%-15% depending on the magnitude of success and safety, and a downside of 15%-20% if the drug proves effective but mixed on safety. He sees downside of 70% if Alnylam's drug fails completely in the trial.According to Loncar, ""Most people are convinced it's going to succeed."" He cited a note that saw the range of failure to success putting Alnylam's stock price at 25 to 105 per share. It closed at 86.80 on Tuesday.""For that company, that's a $7 billion window,"" he said. ""This is a bellwether biotech company. Everyone is counting on this one to succeed, and it probably will. But if that one trial fails, the stock will crash.""Behind Alnylam, Loncar notes that Axovant is expected to announce the results of its drug dubbed intepirdine in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Recently, Biogen (BIIB) stock broke out on strong Phase 1b data from an Alzheimer's trial.Axovant is working on a different theory of treating Alzheimer's. Intepirdine is known as a serotonin receptor antagonist, which has potential cognition, memory and learning-enhancing side effects. It was originally developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) but sold to Axovant.So far, nothing has worked in Alzheimer's, so there's always some excitement — and trepidation — around trial readouts for the disease, Loncar said. Last December, Eli Lilly (LLY) toppled when its drug, solanezumab, failed in a Phase 3 trial of Alzheimer's.""If Axovant does succeed, we could see a stock go from 20 to 100 in one day,"" he said. Axovant closed at 20.35 on Tuesday. ""That's extreme. But that's the kind of euphoria Alzheimer's can create.""He also notes trials from Versartis and Zogenix (ZGNX) in growth hormone deficiency and a form of epilepsy known as Dravet syndrome, respectively.But it won't just be September that's chock full of catalysts, Leerink analysts wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. After ""a solid year for returns of biopharma stocks"" there are still a number of catalysts in the back half of the year.Among large-caps, Leerink's Geoffrey Porges notes that AbbVie (ABBV) will have data from trials for anti-inflammatory and cancer drugs, and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) is expected to grab another approval for its drug Soliris to treat a disease in which the immune system attacks healthy cells.Amgen (AMGN) could update its label for LDL cholesterol-lowering drug, Repatha, to include its added benefit on cardiovascular outcomes. Meanwhile, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) are appealing a court decision vs. Amgen for their rival drug, Praluent.Celgene (CELG) will have readouts in ulcerative colitis and a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. FibroGen (FGEN) is expected to have data for fibrosis and anemia drugs. Analysts expect Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) to provide an update with data from its cystic fibrosis trials.Gilead-Kite's CAR-T drug will likely be approved to treat an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in November. This would follow the approval of Novartis' (NVS) Kymriah, a CAR-T drug that treats a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients up to age 25.""We expect CAR-T to remain one of the most closely followed emerging areas in biotech in the second half of 2017,"" Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt wrote in a note. The launch of Kymriah should read through to drugs from Bluebird Bio (BLUE), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Adaptimmune Therapeutics (ADAP).RELATED:Biogen's Alzheimer's Drug Shows Promise — Could It Break Out?How This J&J Partnership Bit The Dust On Gilead-Kite CompetitionCelgene Breaks Out; These 2 Biotech Giants Close On Buy PointsHow Novartis' Cancer Approval Validates Gilead's $11.9 Billion Kite DealGilead-Kite Deal Boosts Biotech ETF As It Clears Buy Point

156,ABBV,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) ""might end up doing nothing in oncology"" if the right takeover deal doesn't present itself, Chief Executive John Milligan reportedly told an analyst Wednesday.XThe third-largest biotech by market cap, Gilead has struggled with declining sales of hepatitis C drugs for several quarters. In the first quarter, Gilead hinted that it could be looking to buy an oncology player. But Gilead remained mum on a potential merger in the recent second quarter.It appears Gilead is looking for a ""transformative"" acquisition, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients after meeting with the biotech's management Wednesday. The firm is struggling to identify such an opportunity.""As CEO John Milligan explained it, he didn't think it made much sense to buy something small today in the hope it might grow into something large,"" Porges said. Instead, Milligan is looking for a company with ""substantial data, value and scale.""Analysts have suggested Gilead could look to acquire companies like Tesaro (TSRO), Incyte (INCY), Clovis Oncology (CLVS) or Kite Pharma (KITE) in cancer, or Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) in cystic fibrosis. Recently, United Therapeutics (UTHR) spiked on the potential that Gilead could take it over.IBD'S TAKE: The biotech industry is awaiting mergers and acquisitions to spike higher, says one industry observer. How does Gilead fit in? Visit IBD Industry Themes for a closer look.Gilead also noted that it's still interested in fibrosis programs. In 2015-16, it bought two firms with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) programs: Phenex Pharmaceuticals and Nimbus Therapeutics. NASH is a liver disease.In the meantime, Gilead is calling for declines in its hepatitis C unit, despite beating views in the second quarter. Porges sees revenue from hepatitis C drugs falling 30% in 2017 and then dipping 15%-25% annually through 2020.""This decline is likely to accelerate in 2017 and beyond as better competitive hepatitis C regimens come to market,"" he wrote. ""Our outlook for the company's HIV business remains positive, but this is not sufficient to offset the dynamics of the hepatitis C business.""Among those competitive regimens, AbbVie's (ABBV) Mavyret gained approval earlier this month to treat all genotypes of hepatitis C. Gilead acknowledged that AbbVie's biggest advantage is in the treatment of genotypes 2-6, rivaling Gilead's Epclusa and Sovaldi.Chief Operating Officer Kevin Young says the contracting cycle is now in full swing, but that doesn't mean every payer will defer to AbbVie's Mavyret over Gilead's drugs. Mavyret is being priced at a discount to Gilead's Harvoni and Epclusa, Porges said in a note last week.In its HIV unit, Gilead remains bullish on its chances of fending off GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), which is working on two drug combinations. Recently, concerns have emerged regarding the safety of Glaxo's double-drug for HIV and questions of the infection's ability to adapt to treatment.Gilead stock closed down 1.6%, at 72.70, on the stock market today.RELATED:Gilead Could Be Making An Acquisition — But It's Not What You ThinkHow AbbVie's 'Gauntlet' Could Squeeze Gilead's Drugs In Hepatitis CGilead's Hepatitis C Franchise Topples Again, But Shares Up On Beat

157,ABBV,"When biotechnology giant Gilead Sciences (GILD) bought Pharmasset in 2011, it inherited a compound then known as 7977, which Wall Street analysts expected to bring in $3.6 billion in peak sales by 2018.But just three years later, 7977 launched under the name Sovaldi at north of $1,000 a pill. It raked in $10.3 billion in 2014 sales alone and proved to be a nearly foolproof cure for hepatitis C virus, or HCV. Over three years, Gilead's flagship HCV drugs pulled in more than $44 billion. They also doubled the company's net margins, pushing them past the 50% level at one point in mid-2014.Trouble is, Gilead didn't just treat hepatitis C. For the most part, it cured patients after about three months. Sovaldi had an unheard-of success rate of up to 95% in some hepatitis C patients, and its follow-on treatment, Harvoni, proved more effective in some cases. Eventually, the patient pool was bound to get smaller, and it has. Sovaldi and Harvoni sales fell a respective 24% and 34% in 2016.""Think of it like an opening of a blockbuster movie in Hollywood and people wait in line,"" RBC analyst Michael Yee told Investor's Business Daily. ""Thus, there are less coming in right now than before.""Now the pressure is on Gilead to produce another big hit to drive its growth. And for biotech investors, its story is a cautionary tale to look beyond the initial fanfare of a hot new drug and consider the costs should it deliver on its promise.Hepatitis — unlike HIV, Alzheimer's disease and many types of cancer — can be a short-term temporary condition, said Kevin Young, Gilead's chief operating officer, on the company's Feb. 7 earnings conference call with analysts. Gilead says fewer patients are starting on HCV regimens and those that do are healthier than past patients.""And thanks to Harvoni, (HCV) can be cured in as little as eight weeks in a genotype 1 patient,"" Young said, referring to the most common type of hepatitis C.Gilead confirmed worries of the hepatitis C slowdown on Feb. 7 after releasing its fourth-quarter earnings. Shares toppled 8.6% the next day, nearly touching a three-year low. Whispers of the looming dip in HCV drug sales had plagued Gilead stock for the better part of a year.After climbing rapidly in 2013 and 2014, Gilead stock started to slip in 2015 and lost 31% in 2016 as analysts issued report after report modeling what Gilead would look like without HCV. Today, Gilead sees its HIV unit, which grew 13% last year, as its next big enterprise and has described its HIV drug bictegravir as its future ""Mount Everest.""Still, sentiment hasn't been this negative on Gilead stock since its $11 billion Pharmasset acquisition in 2011, says Evercore analyst Mark Schoenebaum. Then, 82% of analysts surveyed by Schoenebaum said Gilead paid too much for Pharmasset. Later on, analysts missed the potential and immediate demand for Sovaldi, and didn't even account for Harvoni.""Last time sentiment on Gilead's management was this bad, investors were wrong, very wrong,"" Schoenebaum wrote in a Feb. 16 research report. More than half, 51%, in the November 2011 survey said the Pharmasset buy would destroy Gilead's value.Sentiment obviously improved. Before Sovaldi, old-school hepatitis C treatments weren't as effective and often came along with flu-like side effects and anemia. Sovaldi was so successful that Gilead launched Harvoni in 2015 and saw similar results: $13.86 billion in Harvoni sales that year. Its newest addition to the hepatitis C line, Epclusa, brought in $1.75 billion in 2016.Gilead stock flew 106% in 2013 as Wall Street performed a 180-degree turn on Sovaldi ahead of its launch. Though activist groups and patients were incensed as inside discussions bumped Sovaldi's price to $84,000 from expectations for $36,000, the drug was a Wall Street dynamo.Harvoni launched with an even bigger $94,500 price tag. Gilead took its lumps in headlines for the price of both, but RBC analyst Yee says the price tags weren't particularly egregious, considering prior treatments and costs.""The high cost of treatment was not high relative to the existing prior therapy and was significantly better,"" he told IBD in an email. ""The costs have all come down by 50% given competition and other rebating.""For the fourth quarter, Gilead Chief Executive John Milligan noted Harvoni now sells for $15,000 in the U.S. Meanwhile, rivalries with Merck (MRK) and AbbVie will help curb prices. Merck itself signaled its expectations for lighter HCV sales in February when it took a $2.9 billion impairment charge on uprifosbuvir.Merck acquired uprifosbuvir from Idenix Pharmaceuticals in 2014. The company cut its value estimate on uprifosbuvir to $240 million. Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says Merck is signaling ""reduced value for its participation in the market, which is consistent with a declining market overall.""Merck has successfully defended its patents for HCV med Zepatier against Gilead, and AbbVie is working on a next-generation drug set to launch sometime in 2017-18.Wall Street suspected the HCV decline was coming, and modeled $28 billion in total Gilead sales with $11.5 billion in hepatitis C franchise revenue for Gilead in 2017.The company's guidance for $22.5 billion to $24.5 billion in total sales and $7.5 billion to $9 billion from hepatitis C drug revenue painted a starker picture.Along with that guidance, Gilead said it expects patient starts on HCV regimens to drop in 2017. In 2016, Gilead estimates 231,000 patients started on its hepatitis C drugs, about 25,000 fewer than in 2015. In 2016, HCV sales got a push after two large commercial payers opened access and amid a marketing campaign via the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.Gilead's Young doesn't expect those ""one-time"" drivers to repeat in 2017.""The guidance implies a 20%-30% lower EPS (earnings per share) than consensus was modeling,"" RBC's Yee wrote in a Feb. 8 research report. ""We think the stock is probably range-bound until they can hit at least one to two quarters, and demonstrate a handle on forecasts/visibility.""Yee also echoed other analysts' calls for acquisitions to bolster the top line while Gilead works through the HCV decline and works to launch drugs in its HIV and NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) units. Yee sees Incyte (INCY) as a smart, but unlikely, deal.Gilead withstood pressure before and after its Pharmasset buy and won't bend to public pressure for M&A, Evercore's Schoenebaum said in a Feb. 16 video. Investors are questioning CEO Milligan, but none have identified the specific deal he missed that would have prevented the HCV decline.IBD'S TAKE: For a strong drugmaking bet, check out Incyte, analysts say. Incyte's pipeline is brimming with potential blockbuster opportunities. Head to The New America for a deeper dive on Incyte and its upcoming catalysts.""What you have here is a company that's not just going to go do a deal so they can out a press release saying, 'We did a deal,' and hope they get a sugar high on the stock on it,"" he said. ""They're only going to do deals they have a high degree of confidence will work out and a high degree of confidence they're underpaying for the asset.""Meanwhile, Gilead is bolstering its HIV and NASH units. Gilead recently pitted HIV drug bictegravir against GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) incumbent dolutegravir, approved in 2013 and sold under the brand name Tivicay. The phase 2 trial showed bictegravir is numerically stronger than GSK's drug in certain combinations.Price is a bigger concern. GSK's medication is cheaper since it combines with a generic med, meaning the HIV regimen can be priced around $17,000 vs. the likely $30,000 price tag attached to Gilead's solution, Yee said in a Feb. 15 report.Other analysts say Gilead's HIV and NASH units are ""too late"" and offer ""little value."" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said on Feb. 8 that he expects hepatitis C sales to topple 45% in 2017 and then 12%-21% annually through 2020. Though his outlook on HIV is positive, those sales aren't on an HCV-like trajectory, Porges said.""This is not sufficient to offset the unusual dynamics of the HCV business and the relatively modest contributions from other products offer little to mitigate the boom and bust in HCV,"" he wrote. ""Those opportunities appear to be arriving too late, with too little value, in our view.""Yee, though, says Gilead isn't filling a hole left from its declining HCV unit. It's merely coming down off a ""massive bolus of hundreds of thousands of people who came in during the first two years.""""The drug is still set to do $8 billion in 2017 and is one of the largest drugs in the world. Not exactly a hole,"" he said.RELATED:Gilead Clobbered On Hep C; 'Little Value' In 'Too Late' NASH, HIV UnitsCan Gilead Swivel To HIV Amid Flounder Hep C Sales, GSK Rivalry?Gilead HIV Drug Tops GSK Combo But Rivalry 'Intense' With GSK Doublet

158,ABBV,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) sees HIV drug bictegravir as its ""Mount Everest,"" but rivals like Merck (MRK) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) will be able to price their rival drugs 10% to 55% cheaper, an analyst said Thursday.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges noted Merck and Glaxo are working on HIV regimens that include generic drugs. Gilead, on the other hand, ""has established premium pricing for their fixed-dose combinations based on all-branded component pricing,"" Porges wrote in a research report.As a result, Gilead will struggle to gain share in HIV — a much-needed sector as its lucrative hepatitis C franchise continues to dwindle. After two years and $40 billion-plus in sales, Gilead's hepatitis C drugs saw sales decline in 2016. The biotech is guiding to further declines in 2017.Over the past five years, Gilead has dominated the HIV landscape, Porges said. Its HIV unit brought in $12.9 billion in sales in 2016, up 16.2%. But the competitive landscape is shifting for HIV, with four new drugs set to launch in 2018-20.Gilead's bictegravir-based formulas are likely to be the ""gold standard"" for first- and second-line HIV treatments, Porges wrote. But with Gilead unlikely to budge on pricing, it's ability to hold share and/or price will erode, he predicted.UBS analyst Carter Gould is more bullish on Gilead's HIV enterprise. The Street expects bictegravir, which eventually will get a different brand name, to pull in $3 billion in 2017 sales, and $5 billion to $6 billion in peak sales when combined with the substance now known as filgotinib. Filgotinib is a drug developed by Galapagos (GLPG).But Gould downgraded Gilead stock to a neutral rating from buy and cut his price target to 72 from 118, citing the company's struggles with hepatitis C. Guidance suggests a 40%-50% dip in 2017 hepatitis C drug sales with 25%-35% fewer patients starting on one of Gilead's hepatitis C drugs this year.That is in line with Gilead's notes on its fourth-quarter earnings conference call. Old-school hepatitis C medications weren't as effective as Gilead's Sovaldi and Harvoni and carried a number of side effects. Today, there are fewer patients and many are healthier and thus put off treatment.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead's hepatitis C drug downfall didn't come out of the blue. Analysts had predicted it for the better part of a year. What were the warning signs? Visit IBD's Industry Themes for a closer look.Gilead is also experiencing competitive pressure from the likes of Merck and AbbVie (ABBV). Merck has successfully fought off patent litigation vs. Gilead with its HCV drug Zepatier. AbbVie is set to launch a next-generation asset in 2018.A merger won't fix Gilead's problems, Gould wrote. In 2002 and 2011 when Gilead acquired Triangle Pharma and Pharmasset, respectively, the stock trended down for roughly a month after the announcements. Gilead stock is now down 2.7% for the year.RBC analyst Michael Yee disagrees, arguing Gilead could do a number of ""string of pearls"" acquisitions to improve pipeline visibility. Kite Pharma (KITE) would be an interesting acquisition, he said. Meanwhile, the ""tail"" on hepatitis C sales should be significant enough to sustain demand.Yee has an outperform rating on Gilead stock. By the closing bell on the stock market today, Gilead stock fell 1.8% to 68.39. Merck was up marginally to 65.89 while Glaxo added 0.8% to 41.45.RELATED:This Pharma Is Beating The Pack In Getting Drugs To MarketAbbVie Strong Bet Than Gilead, Amgen — At Least Until 2020: AnalystGilead, Glaxo Pitted In HIV Battle; Both Struggle Vs.

159,ABBV,"Prescriptions for Gilead Sciences' (GILD) hepatitis C drugs have plunged since Jan. 1 — leaving at least one analyst waiting for industrywide revenue of the remedies to hit bottom — even as competition looms from rival Merck (MRK) and AbbVie (ABBV).Total prescriptions of Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa are flat week over week, but have fallen 16% from the beginning of the quarter on Jan. 1, RBC analyst Michael Yee wrote in a note to clients, citing health care tracker IMS. New prescriptions are down 3% vs. last week.Meanwhile, Merck's hepatitis C drug, Zepatier, has flourished. Total Zepatier scripts are up 11% quarter to date. New prescriptions climbed 9% week over week, though total prescriptions were down 1% vs. last week.Zepatier now has 16% of the new prescriptions market, Yee wrote. Merck has said it expects to grow its share in 2017 with overseas launches in Japan and Europe during the fourth quarter. Zepatier's list price for treatment is roughly $54,600, cheaper than any Gilead alternative at little more than half the $94,500 list price for Harvoni. Many drugmakers, however, have not been getting list price for their drugs.The company ""suggested that countries are opening up more access more,"" Yee wrote. That ""could be good for Gilead as well.""But even Merck isn't immune to the weakening hepatitis C market. Last week, Merck said it would take a $2.9 billion impairment charge on uprifosbuvir, a hepatitis C drug acquired in 2014.IBD'S TAKE: Among biotechs, Incyte is a strong bet with a number of potential blockbusters in its pipeline, analysts say. Can Incyte keep its lead? Visit The New America for a deep dive on the company and stock.After Gilead was first to market with a new class of highly effective hepatitis C drugs, prescriptions for the company's lineup topped out in 2015 after a major two-year run. During that time, Gilead's net margins more than doubled to roughly the 50% level at their peak.The disease is curable, though, meaning it's getting harder to find new patients. New patients are often healthier and procrastinate on beginning treatment, Gilead has said.Like Gilead, AbbVie's hepatitis C drug sales also are struggling. This week, AbbVie's Viekira Pak for hepatitis C fell 27% and is down 41% quarter to date, Yee wrote. Though new prescriptions grew 21% week over week.AbbVie is ""essentially a niche player now,"" but its second-generation drug could be a competitor in 2018, Yee wrote. That drug could be approved by year-end. For Gilead, it's yet another competitor in a slowing market.Earlier this year, Gilead guided to $7.5 billion to $9 billion in 2017 hepatitis C drug sales, missing expectations by $3.5 billion to $4 billion.""Guidance could actually be conservative, but Gilead will need to hit a couple of quarter and see scripts stabilize before investors gain confidence,"" Yee said. ""We are watching for HCV scripts to flatten, and for the slope of the curve to inflect and stabilize in order to establish a 'bottom' for the franchise.""In midday trading on the stock market today, Gilead stock was down a fraction, near 70. Shares of Merck and AbbVie were up a fraction each, near 66.50 and 63.50, respectively.RELATED:Gilead, AbbVie Could Perk Up On Merck's Hep C Downfall: LeerinkAbbVie Stronger Bet Than Gilead, Amgen — At Least Until 2020: LeerinkGilead, Glaxo Pitted In HIV Battle; Both Struggle Vs.

160,ABBV,"Eli Lilly's (LLY) pipeline has the best ""bang-for-the-buck,"" one analyst said Wednesday in an R&D comparison pitting Lilly against rivals Pfizer (PFE), Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said Lilly is outperforming the pack, achieving the best balance in R&D investment while limiting external investments over the past five years. Bristol and Pfizer trail whereas Merck struggles on these metrics, he wrote.Still, drugmakers like Lilly have struggled to gain FDA approvals. Only 9%-22% of drugs from 2011 pharma pipelines have gained approval. By contrast, biotechnology companies AbbVie (ABBV) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) have been more successful with 36% and 40% conversion rates.Among the top drugmakers, Bristol-Myers and Lilly have had considerably more success with phase three drugs. Meanwhile, Pfizer has only converted 20% of its late-stage pipeline in 2011 to drugs sold on the market.Pfizer has the broadest pipeline in the group -- with 57 disclosed new drugs, Fernandez wrote. But it has struggled with fallen megamergers and R&D disruptions, limiting its scale on productivity. Merck is the lowest in the pharma universe with 30.IBD'S TAKE: American Funds recently upped its stake in Bristol-Myers Squibb stock. Who else received American Funds' vote of confidence? Find out at IBD's Mutual Funds page.In his analysis, Fernandez also looked at ""churn,"" the turnover of new drugs from 2011-15, and ""burn,"" the percentage of attrition of the 2011 portfolio by 2016. Bristol has the highest burn rate and lowest churn rate.""The company appears to be focusing more on internal assets/partnerships/early stage M&A over mid- to late-stage external agents,"" Fernandez wrote in a note. ""Conversely, Merck's churn rate is among the highest in the group.""Merck's ""high overall R&D expenses are driven in part by the large Cubist and Idenix deals, which have so far struggled to generate the sizable returns management had hoped (for), as well the company's extraordinary investment behind Keytruda,"" he wrote.Though Merck isn't alone in its struggles with partnerships and acquisitions. Among big drugmakers and biotechs, only Gilead's purchase of Pharmasset in 2011 appears to have succeeded, Fernandez wrote.Pharmasset began development on Sovaldi, the hepatitis C drug that rocketed Gilead's sales in 2014-15. But Gilead's hepatitis C franchise began faltering in 2016 amid the high cure rates of its trio of drugs, Sovaldi, Harvoni and Epclusa.At the closing bell on the stock market today, Lilly finished trading up 0.8% to 83.41. Bristol-Myers rose 1.4% to 57.12. Meanwhile, Merck slipped 0.2% to 65.80 while Pfizer also lost 0.2% to 33.91.RELATED:Gilead Hepatitis C Sales Plunge As Merck Swipes Share: AnalystAbbVie Stronger Bet Than Gilead, Amgen — At Least Until 2020: LeerinkMerck, Roche Gouge Bristol's I-O Share After Lung Cancer Approvals

161,ABBV,"Here's your Investing Action Plan for Friday: what you need to know as an investor for the coming day.XThe busy earnings week continues with quarterly results for oil majors Exxon (XOM), Chevron (CVX), France's Total (TOT) and Italy's Eni (E). Pharmaceutical giants Merck (MRK) and AbbVie (ABBV) also report, along with consumer-credit reporting agency TransUnion (TRU).All will report before the market open. Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Merck are members of the Dow Jones industrial average.Estimates: Earnings up 46% to 99 cents with revenue up 12.2% to $33.82 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Stock: Chevron closed flat at 181.44 Thursday in the stock market today, still just in buy range after undercutting its 118.43 entry point last week.Break-even prices will likely be a major topic in the report as oil stays under $60 per barrel and companies look to lower costs and maintain the dividends that their investors expect.Chevron says it can break even this year at $50 a barrel, according to the Wall Street Journal. U.S. crude futures are trading around $52 a barrel, with Brent crude just above $58.Total said it would be able to break even if oil fell to under $30 in 2019, not including its dividend costs.

162,ABBV,"Its treatment for a common eye disease made Regeneron Pharmaceuticals a star. Now, a new dermatitis medication could bring superstardom to the fast-growing biotechnology company.XOther breakthrough Regeneron (REGN) drugs treat arthritis and cholesterol, and the company is developing promising asthma and cancer treatments.  Those are just some of the reasons that Investor's Business Daily named Regeneron a winner in the inaugural IBD Biotech Innovator Awards.Regeneron's financials back up the optimism. Earnings per share minus various items shot up 39% to $11.32 last year, impressive for a company that posted losses until 2012. Revenue has skyrocketed more than tenfold since 2011, to $4.86 billion last year.""Regeneron has been a fantastically successful company and story,"" said Piper Jaffray analyst Edward Tenthoff.Tenthoff began covering the company in 2007, ""when the stock was $14 and change."" Now, he estimates 2017 total revenue of $5.68 billion and EPS of $14.38 a share, rising to $6.43 billion and $16.01 in 2018.How IBD Chose The Biotech Innovator Award Winners: IBD asked equity analysts, ETF and mutual fund managers, and university professors to identify the top biotech companies based on their innovative research. We asked them to focus on companies with pioneering drugs likely to launch in the next several years and reach blockbuster, or near-blockbuster, sales of $1 billion or more a year. The award winners selected by IBD editors are the six most-cited companies. To find profiles of all the award winners and details of their work, go to our full Biotech Innovators special report.)Even in 2007, Regeneron stock was rolling, having traded below 11 as recently as 2006. A meteoric decade-plus found shares peaking above 600 in August 2015. The stock hit a 20-month high of 543 in June but now trades near 445 after taking a hit from potential competition in eczema from AbbVie (ABBV). Tenthoff's price target is 557.Regeneron's ascent began in 2011 with the approval of its drug Eylea, which treats a disease called wet-eye age-related macular degeneration, the major cause of blindness in the elderly.A relationship with French drug giant Sanofi (SNY), a suite of key development tools, and a focus on pure science have enabled Regeneron to grow into a biotech titan.Its future? A family of antibody drugs, some that can be used to treat a number of common diseases and thus address multibillion-dollar markets.All humans have antibodies, proteins that fight disease. Antibody drugs are proteins manufactured to fight specific diseases.Science is at the heart of Regeneron's corporate culture and success, according to analysts and company executives.""They've taken on the mantle of the purest scientific company in the industry,"" said Geoffrey Porges, an analyst with Leerink Partners. ""They pride themselves on the rigor of their scientific enquiry.""He rates the stock outperform, or buy, with a price target of 511.Porges says Regeneron's commitment to its research and development is ""virtually unique in the industry.""In 2016, Regeneron spent $2.052 billion on R&D, 42% of its total revenue. That's well above the norm. The 10 largest pharma companies averaged 17% of revenue for R&D last year, according to an April report by the online newsletter Fierce Biotech.Tarrytown, N.Y.-based Regeneron has had help funding R&D thanks to relationships with other companies, including a 10-year relationship with Sanofi.Regeneron and Sanofi have agreements for the ongoing development of immunotherapy cancer drugs. But their agreement for antibody drug development and licensing will terminate at the end of 2017. Under that pact, Regeneron got R&D funding and Sanofi certain licensing rights. The end of that pact poses no problems, say analysts and a Regeneron executive.Regeneron has become ""so big that they really don't need Sanofi,"" analyst Tenthoff said. ""They can make the discoveries on their own and commercialize them.""True, says Regeneron.""We have become a very self-sufficient end-to-end R&D house,"" David Weinreich, Regeneron's senior vice president of global clinical development, told IBD. ""We are self-reliant on our own income stream such that we don't need the Sanofi contribution to research.""He says the termination of this Sanofi pact will enable Regeneron to set up ""more partnerships"" where it makes sense.Weinreich cites the company's development platform, built internally, as key to enabling it to rapidly identify therapies.Two of Regeneron's key drug-development tools are VelociGene and VelocImmune. The first aims for rapid, automated manipulation of mouse DNA to speed up the modeling of human disease. The other aims to help identify a multitude of optimized antibody drug candidates efficiently and directly from immunized mice.""This technology allows us to very quickly screen through lots of antibodies and find ones that have the characteristics we want,"" said Weinreich.""We're not a huge company in terms of overall size,"" he said. ""But these technologies allow us to go after a large number of targets simultaneously. And that's how you wind up with 16 drugs in the development portfolio.""Regeneron's science focus helps it attract top talent, he says.""We live our motto that the science comes first. … There are not many places out there like us,"" said Weinreich. ""Our scientists can take novel study approaches.""IBD'S TAKE: Industry Snapshot gives an in-depth look at some of the most popular industries, including this recent look at a rise in medtech and decline in pharma.Regeneron grants every employee stock options, he says, so all employees can share in the company's success.Regeneron takes on some of the biggest drugmakers, including Roche Holding (RHHBY), Novartis (NVS) and Amgen (AMGN).In August, the company reported a 21% jump in Q2 revenue, to a record $1.47 billion. Earnings per share minus items rose 48% to $4.17. Analysts polled by Zachs called for $3.18.For Q3, analysts polled by Zachs are calling for EPS of $3.79, up 21% from the year-earlier quarter.Eylea continues to drive financials, and its Q2 sales beat Wall Street views. Tenthoff says U.S. sales could end the year up 10%, at $3.65 billion. He sees Eylea's U.S. sales rising 5.5% in 2018, to $3.85 billion.Eylea is sold by both Regeneron and its partner on the drug, German drug giant Bayer (BAYRY). Regeneron has exclusive rights to U.S. sales of Eylea. Bayer has exclusive marketing rights outside the U.S. The companies share equally in the profits from sales of Eylea, except in Japan where Regeneron receives a royalty on net sales.But while Eylea is the present, many industry observers say Dupixent is the future. It is being sold to treat atopic dermatitis in the U.S., after gaining FDA approval in March.Now, Regeneron seeks EU approval for this treatment — but its hopes for the drug go much further.""(Dupixent) has potential in a number of other diseases,"" said Weinreich. It could be used to treat asthma, nasal polyps, multiple allergies (including peanut allergies), esophageal inflammation and more.""This drug could very well be a pipeline unto itself,"" Weinreich said.Regeneron is conducting Phase 3 trials of Dupixent to treat asthma and could seek FDA approval next year.""Dupixent could be as big as, if not bigger, than Eylea,"" said analyst Tenthoff, who rates Regeneron stock overweight, or buy.Just as a treatment for asthma alone, annual global sales ""could be $5 billion,"" he said.If Dupixent does well in the asthma study, it could be ""one of the most notable new drugs"" this year, Amy Brown, of research firm Evaluate Pharma, wrote in an August report.Others, though, temper their enthusiasm.""Dupixent is a big drug … but people have come to overvalue it,"" said Brian Skorney, an analyst at Baird Equity Research. Skorney downgraded Regeneron to underperform from neutral in August.Regeneron has other potential drug hits. This year, the FDA approved its drug Kevzara for treating rheumatoid arthritis. RA affects 1.3 million Americans, according to the Arthritis Foundation and American College of Rheumatology.Another Regeneron drug, Praulent, is used to treat high levels of bad cholesterol. But Amgen has sued, saying the drug violates patents for Amgen's competing drug, Repatha. For a time, an injunction prevented Regeneron from selling Praulent. But the injunction was stayed. A ruling on the lawsuit could come soon.Skorney says that ""if Praulent were pulled from market, that would still be a surprise to Wall Street.""Tenthoff is not worried, saying the lawsuit's risks are already baked into Regeneron's stock price.RELATED:Get The Details On All 6 Award-Winning Biotech Innovators And Their WorkReasons Behind A Recent Biotech Stock RallyRegeneron Pharmaceuticals Eczema Drug Rival Shows Promise

165,ABBV,"Biotech stocks toppled last week following disappointing third-quarter results from the likes of Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), an analyst said Monday, noting that ""competition and pricing concerns started taking a toll.""XThe arrival of new competition in the form of AbbVie's (ABBV) Mavyret forced Gilead's hepatitis C drug franchise to lose share in the third quarter. Meanwhile, Celgene notes that its Otezla — which treats psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis — is in an ""increasingly competitive market.""Gilead topped total sales views, but revenue from hepatitis C drugs declined by a third and narrowly missed analyst forecasts. Celgene's ""alarming"" results were driven by a major miss in sales of Otezla, leading total sales to lag and guidance cuts.Instinet analyst Christopher Marai says the competitive and pricing concerns took a hit on the broad biotech market. The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index finished down 4.4%, though the Nasdaq and S&P 500 both wrapped the week at less than 1% higher.Meanwhile, IBD's 454-company Biotech industry group lost nearly 3% and slipped to third out of 197 groups tracked by IBD. Over the last two weeks it had been ranked first and then second.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene cut many elements of its 2020 guidance, including in inflammation and immunology drugs. Head to IBD Industry Themes for more on what Celgene's results could mean for the broader group.Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) and AveXis (AVXS) are more exposed to competitive concerns, Marai said in a note to clients. Alnylam is working on a drug called patisiran to treat a rare disease caused by the buildup of abnormal materials and will rival Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) and Prothena (PRTA).AveXis is working on therapy for spinal muscular atrophy. There, it rivals Biogen (BIIB) and Ionis, which sell Spinraza to treat the same condition. Marai lists Spinraza alongside Sarepta Therapeutics' (SRPT) Exondys 51 for Duchenne muscular dystrophy as ""fundamentally strong launches.""""We continue to look at strength in select names as an opportunity to take profits in biotech and reinvest in less macro-exposed names that are rich in potential (stock) catalysts over the next 12 months,"" he said. ""We could avoid priced-for-perfection names including Alnylam and AveXis.""Over the next year, Marai sees Prothena, Deciphera Pharmaceuticals (DCPH), Cellectis (CLLS) and MacroGenics (MGNX) as having a slew of potential catalysts.RELATED:Dow's Merck Plunges To 17-Month Low On Growing Keytruda WorriesGilead Beats Third-Quarter Sales, Earnings ViewsThree Biotech Firms Top Third-Quarter Views — But Only One Pops

166,ABBV,"AbbVie's (ABBV) Humira franchise is safe through 2023 after a patent settlement with Amgen (AMGN), an analyst said Monday as he upgraded AbbVie and predicted that its profits would outgrow other large-cap pharmas through 2021.XLeerink analyst Geoffrey Porges upgraded AbbVie to an outperform rating and upped his price target to 106 from 89. He noted that the upgrade missed AbbVie's recently strong performance, but ""we believe that there is still further upside.""""Our valuation for AbbVie is altered based on extending the U.S. market exclusivity for Humira in our model to 2023, from 2020-21 previously after the settlement with Amgen,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Under the settlement, Amgen will pay AbbVie royalties on sales of its Humira copycat. Humira is AbbVie's most important drug, bringing in 69% of total sales in the second quarter. Humira is an anti-inflammatory med.By the closing bell on the stock market today, AbbVie climbed 1.7% to finish at 90.39. Shares broke out of a flat base at a 75.14 buy point in late August, and have risen 18.3% since hitting that point.IBD'S TAKE: AbbVie is also working with Galapagos to develop treatments for cystic fibrosis. But analysts say Vertex Pharmaceuticals has a large lead. Head to The New America for a closer look at the market breakdown.The settlement allows Amgen to launch a biologic copy of Humira, known as Amgevita, in Europe next October. Its U.S. version, Amjevita, is set to launch in January 2023. Other rivals ""are likely to be offered the same 2023 market entry deal,"" Porges said.Boehringer Ingelheim and Coherus Biosciences (CHRS) are closest to entry with biologic copies of Humira. Boehringer's Cyltezo was approved in August, but the firm is in a patent battle with AbbVie. Coherus is still working to submit its application to U.S. regulators.Dow components Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE), in addition to Novartis (NVS) and Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA), are bound to file for approval of biologic copies of Humira in the coming quarters, but these will likely infringe on AbbVie's Humira patents.Any lawsuits would likely be resolved around mid-2022, removing the risk of a launch until right before the 2023 settlement date, Porges said. ""As a result, we believe the certainty of U.S. Humira patent protection until 2023 is nearly 100%.""Porges increased his 2018-19 Humira sales views by 1%-2%. Longer term, his Humira estimates increased 8% and 46% in 2020 and 2021, respectively. He expects AbbVie to hit 49%-50% operating margin from 2019-21.He projects AbbVie 2017-21 earnings per share commanding an annual growth rate of 15%, topping large-cap pharma peers projected at 11% and mature biopharmas set for mid-single-digit growth.""The growth horizon, along with the company's increasingly visible late-stage pipeline, suggests that AbbVie stock should continue to re-rate into the range of these large-cap biopharma peers,"" Porges said.RELATED:Why Amgen's Drug Win Sent AbbVie Stock Into The StratosphereThese Companies Gain If Trump's Foreign Profit Relief Plan PassesAbbVie's New Hepatitis C Drug Chipping Away At Gilead's Share

168,ABBV,"AbbVie (ABBV) threw ""the gauntlet down"" to Gilead Sciences (GILD) with the approval of a hepatitis C drug that could further hammer Gilead's multibillion-dollar franchise, an analyst said Friday.XLate Thursday, the Food and Drug Administration approved AbbVie's drug dubbed Mavyret with a coveted eight-week label for all genotypes of hepatitis C patients — most hepatitis C drugs are taken over a 12-week period. AbbVie is pricing the treatment at $26,400 for eight weeks, at a deeper discount than two prominent drugs now being prescribed for the condition: Gilead's Harvoni and Epclusa.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges estimates Mavyret will be offered at a 14% discount to what Gilead sees in revenue for a prescribed course of Harvoni and at a 63% discount to Epclusa.""This competitive dynamic, now solidified by the FDA, agrees with our forecasted market share and price erosion for Gilead, and our modeled rebound of AbbVie's hepatitis C revenue beginning in 2018,"" Porges wrote in a note to clients.Porges called for Gilead to remain competitive in the 75% of patients where Harvoni can be given for eight weeks, but it will still lose some share there based on contracts with payers. Two populations of patients treated with Mavyret will undergo treatment for 12-16 weeks.Other patients will likely migrate to Mavyret based on the convenience of the eight-week regimen, he predicted. Gilead's drugs Epclusa and Vosevi are dosed over 12 weeks. Harvoni is prescribed 12-24 weeks, but some patients can be treated in eight weeks.IBD'S TAKE: Whether Gilead makes an acquisition could be the linchpin in sending the biotech sector higher, one industry observer says. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at which companies Gilead might be considering.Mavyret's broad label gives AbbVie access to the vast majority of hepatitis C patients, with the exception of those who've failed on some drugs from Dow components Merck (MRK) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and a drug from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).The FDA is not requiring genotype testing ""which is a big advantage over Gilead and other participants in the market,"" he wrote. But Mavyret does have a black box warning on its label for the risk of hepatitis B reactivation in patients with both infections.Patients will undergo pretreatment testing for hepatitis B infection and then monitoring if they are found to have both hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Porges says this isn't a significant burden as most hepatitis C patients will have already been screened for hepatitis B.AbbVie will likely focus early efforts on the government segment where Mavyret's wholesale price is in line with Harvoni but undercuts Epclusa.""Conversely, for AbbVie, this pricing means that the revenue contribution from Mavyret is likely to be limited, and largely consistent with our existing forecast,"" he said.On the stock market today, AbbVie closed flat at 70.99. Gilead fell 1.6% to 73.16.RELATED:Gilead Could Be Making An Acquisition — But It's Not What You ThinkGilead's Hepatitis C Franchise Topples Again, But Shares Up On BeatHow AbbVie Could Hammer Gilead's Hepatitis C Franchise

169,ABBV,"Biogen (BIIB) clung to gains early Tuesday after its Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS)-partnered spinal drug nearly tripled expectations in the second quarter, leading to a 4% guidance boost.XSales of Spinraza, the Biogen-Ionis drug used to treat spinal muscular atrophy, came in at $203 million, obliterating analyst views for $70 million, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a note to clients. Revenue from that drug grew 328% quarter over quarter.U.S. sales comprised $195 million. Biogen has also built up $30 million in inventory. Raffat cautioned not to read through too far on Spinraza sales which are front-loaded. The first eight weeks cost $500,000 per patient with $250,000 over the next 32 weeks.For the second quarter ended June 30, Biogen reported adjusted income of $5.04 per share on revenue of $3.1 billion, topping consensus views for $4.41 a share on $2.81 billion in sales. On a year-over-year basis, revenue grew 6% though profits sank 3.3%.On the stock market today, Biogen fell 0.6% to close at 282.96, after gaining as much as 4.3% before the open. Shares hit their highest point since April 25 while biotech stocks were generally flat early Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs are now ranked fourth out of 197 groups that IBD tracks. What could send them higher? Head to IBD Industry Themes for a look at regulatory trends, clinical trials and the potential for mergers and acquisitions.""For instance, on Biogen's slides, they are already flagging that they expect 'revenue growth to slow,' "" he wrote. But Biogen upped its 2017 revenue guidance by 4% to $11.5 billion to $11.8 billion. Adjusted income is expected to be $20.80-$21.40 per share for the year.Biogen's multiple-sclerosis business brought in $3.03 billion from six branded drugs and interferon. Total sales grew 2.2%. Tecfidera grew 13% year over year, offsetting flat Tysabri sales.

171,ABBV,"Life was simple for Rachel Martin in 1991. By day, she worked at an accounting firm on her way to becoming a CPA, and by night she ran -- until she started to notice her feet felt strangely stiff.XThat led to three bits of news one day soon after. Two were good, yet the odds still stacked up against her. ""That day I got notice of the multiple sclerosis, I got notice we sold our condo and I got notice of receiving my CPA license,"" she told Investor's Business Daily.The numbers haven't gone Martin's way ever since. She was 27 when diagnosed, half a lifetime ago. She hasn't worked for 23 years and has spent zero hours of her life working as a CPA. She's taken at least four medications to treat her MS, and exactly none have fully contained the ailment.A barrage of new drugs are taking aim at MS, however, offering hope for Martin and others with the debilitating illness. The medications are offering the lower costs you might expect when a market heats up, but they offer prospects for fewer side effects and, most critically, greater effectiveness.Several heavy hitters in the industry are getting involved in this biopharma battle. Roche (RHHBY) has a new drug that could swipe share from market leader Biogen (BIIB). Meanwhile, Celgene (CELG) and a number of generic-drug manufacturers are expected to pile the pressure on another mainstay in the field, Novartis (NVS).Roche shares were down fractionally Monday to close at 32.15 while Biogen ticked up 0.6% to finish at 234.70. Celgene was up marginally to 137.84 while Novartis was down slightly to 84.29.The MS sector has been dominated by Biogen, which brought in just shy of $9 billion in sales during 2016 with six medications in its arsenal. Included in its inventory is one MS drug that Martin recently stopped using, Avonex, as well as two other top sellers, Tysabri and Tecfidera.Now there's ""a paradigm shift,"" especially where Roche's MS drug, Ocrevus, is concerned, according to Michael DiFiore, analyst for Evercore. Ocrevus was approved earlier this year as a treatment for both relapsing-remitting and primary-progressive forms of MS. Offering medication for primary progressive is a breakthrough, since that form of MS comprises just 10% of the market and has not been targeted by treatments in the past.Ocrevus' twice-a-year infusion looks attractive for patients like Martin, who discontinued using certain drugs due to MS-related tremors. Martin's first medication was an interferon in 1994. She was on the medicine for 22 months until the shaking in her hands became so severe that she couldn't administer the injection.Analysts say Roche's drug puts Biogen's Tysabri and Tecfidera at the greatest risk of market share loss. Some Wall Street estimates see Ocrevus taking away 40%-50% of Tysabri sales and 30%-40% of Tecfidera revenue over three to four years.""With Ocrevus on the market, you have the threat of share being stolen,"" DiFiore told IBD. ""You also have the possibility of looking at generic versions of (Novartis') Gilenya and (Teva Pharmaceutical's (TEVA)) Copaxone. So there's a lot of moving parts.""IBD'S TAKE: IBD's 438-company Biotech industry group is now ranked fourth out of 197 groups tracked as shares have risen 23% for the year, riding high on a June rally that could still see another 15% upside, according to some estimates. Who could benefit in that spike? Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look.In Novartis' case, Celgene is heaping pressure on the company with a potential blockbuster MS drug that now has the test-phase name of ozanimod. Celgene, the No. 2 biotech in market cap is billing ozanimod as a safer version of Gilenya and is targeting the latter half of 2017 to file an application for approval with the Food and Drug Administration.Both ozanimod and Gilenya belong to the class of drugs called S1P receptor modulators. They work by preventing specific white blood cells from moving into the central nervous system. Doing so has been shown to improve outcomes and reduce MS relapses.MS is a disease of the central nervous system that disrupts the flow of information within the brain and between the brain and body. Patients fatigue easily and have difficulty walking.""I went from running to walking, to the walker, and then to a wheelchair,"" said Martin. It wasn't muscular ability, she adds, it was balance.""I was able to exercise if I held on to something,"" she said.Medications have brought Martin moderate success to the point where she can generally walk with a cane. She belongs to an MS group called Let's Play in Los Angeles, and her disease is ""steady,"" says her doctor. But it took time in physical therapy and experimentation with four medicines.One medicine caused debilitating headaches. Another was a chemotherapy that, today, doctors know can cause heart damage. Martin managed to avoid that.Martin's current medication is Extavia, made by Bayer (BAYRY) and sold by Novartis. It requires a self-injection every other day. She began using that medicine in April when she quit using Biogen's Avonex after five years, due to headaches.Biogen has the most to lose in this battle with sales of Tysabri, Tecfidera and Avonex on the line. The second quarter is expected to be Biogen's first real test, Mizuho analyst Salim Syed told IBD. Results are due to be reported Tuesday.Like Biogen's drug Tysabri, Roche's Ocrevus is considered a highly efficient MS treatment. But Tysabri's label contains a black box warning against a deadly virus that attacks the brain. Ocrevus' label doesn't.One case of that virus, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, also called PML, has been recorded by a single Ocrevus user. But that patient had just come off Tysabri after three years and had only been treated once with Ocrevus. Most analysts don't consider the case to be related to Ocrevus.The risk of PML is likely enough to prod a number of Tysabri patients to switch to Ocrevus, Syed said. Further, Biogen has estimated that a third of patients on Tysabri test positive for an ailment known as the John Cunningham virus. Those patients have weak immune systems and are more susceptible to PML.Analysts say erosion of Tysabri use will be slow. And Biogen isn't particularly worried about its MS franchise. The franchise grew 2.9% in 2016 and expanded to include Zinbryta, launched with partner AbbVie (ABBV). In the first quarter ended March 31, Biogen's MS drug sales grew just 3.1% as all but sales of Tysabri and Zinbryta fell.Chief Executive Michel Vounatsos doesn't see Biogen's MS drugs as a declining franchise, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a June 29 note to clients after a meeting with Vounatsos.""He believes Biogen may lose some market share (to Roche's Ocrevus) but believes there will be 'plenty of opportunities to grow top line,' "" Raffat said. Vounatsos ""does not believe generic Copaxone (Teva's drug) or generic Gilenya (Novartis' drug) will impact Biogen's MS franchise.""Copaxone and Gilenya face their own battles from Celgene and others. Celgene's ozanimod successfully reduced relapse rates vs. traditional interferon treatment in a Phase 3 trial that the company presented in May. Both 0.5-milligram and 1-milligram oral doses were safe and tolerable over a two-year period.Novartis' Gilenya also has its ""own safety issues,"" Mizuho's Syed said. Per the label, patients must undergo monitoring for six hours immediately following their first dose to ensure that their heart rates don't slow to dangerous levels. Gilenya has also been shown to have a toxic effect on liver enzymes.""So Gilenya was not a perfect drug,"" he said. ""(Celgene) said this is a safer Gilenya. We just saw top-line data for ozanimod. That's going to come onto the market, if it gets approved, in 2018.""So ozanimod, if successful, could gouge some of Gilenya's sales, analysts say. In the second quarter, Gilenya sales grew 5% on a constant currency basis to $837 million. That followed major growth in 2016, up 14%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, to $3.1 billion.Celgene is optimistic about its chances in the multiple sclerosis market. In a May 30 report, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges noted that management hasn't committed to first-dose monitoring but says a unique dosing schedule could minimize the need for the requirement.""On safety, Celgene management expects to show multiple points of safety differentiation from Gilenya's safety profile and to have a label that will be consistent with its Phase 2 results,"" he said.Then there's the potential generic competition that Novartis faces in 2019. A slew of generics have been approved pending patent litigation from the likes of Teva and Mylan (MYL). Analyst consensus models see $1.92 billion in 2018 Gilenya sales dropping to $447 million in 2020.""If there's nine generics approved tentatively (for Gilenya), that's a price point that's waiting to break,"" Evercore's Raffat said in a May 7 video. But Raffat says it's unlikely Gilenya will go generic in 2019. Patent litigation will likely push generic entry to 2020.And even then, Gilenya has a patent set to expire in 2027 that hasn't really been vetted, he says. The 2027 patent covers the dosing schedule and it only currently faces one challenge. Earlier, it stood up to a challenge from Apotex.Novartis is also studying a low-dose version of Gilenya at 0.25 milligrams. Gilenya is now approved as a 0.5-milligram dose.""If this trial works, it's likely very patentable,"" Raffat said. ""As of 2010 when the FDA reviewed it, the FDA said it's not clear the 0.25-milligram dose will work. That alone is your reason of knowing if the 0.25-milligram (dose) does work (in Novartis' trial), it is patentable because it's not obvious.""A new patent on Gilenya would be another obstacle to generic competition, Evercore's DiFiore said, noting ""that could nullify Gilenya going generic in 2019"" and help the broader MS industry stave off cheaper generics tugging down on drug pricing across the market.Ultimately, the competition could be a godsend for patients like Martin who are hopeful for better MS medicines with fewer side effects.""(Multiple sclerosis is) something that's difficult to describe to people because most of us look like we're doing well,"" Martin said. ""It's like a bubble. I look fine on the outside, but inside I don't feel fine.""RELATED:How Biogen's Takeover Prospects Soured In Mere MonthsWill Novartis' MS Drug Stomp Celgene's Before It Even Hits The Market?How Roche's 'Game Changer' Drug Will Chip Away At Biogen, Novartis

172,ABBV,"AbbVie (ABBV) is likely to swipe significant hepatitis C drug share from Gilead Sciences (GILD) with an eight-week regimen — four weeks shorter than a triple-pill treatment from Gilead, an analyst said Wednesday.The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved Gilead's combination of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir as a 12-week regimen for patients of all genotypes. The combo has been recommended for approval as an eight-week course in Europe. It is approved in the U.S. for patients who've already tried one drug.Meanwhile, AbbVie's combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir looks likely to gain approval as an eight-week regimen in all genotypes of hepatitis C and in patients who've never undergone treatment. Gilead's Harvoni is approved as an eight-week regimen, but only in one subset of patients.""This label places Gilead at a competitive disadvantage to their rival AbbVie, since AbbVie is likely to get approval for all genotypes for an eight-week course,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients. Approval of one genotype is uncertain, he noted.Gilead is pricing its triple-pill, which will be branded as Vosevi, at $24,920 per bottle. At one bottle per month, that runs up to a 12-week price of about $75,000. That is less costly than Gilead's Harvoni and Sovaldi, but more expensive than Zepatier from Dow component Merck (MRK).IBD'S TAKE: As its Hepatitis C drug franchise declines, Gilead has said it would be open to an acquisition in the cancer space. But another biotech buy could be a better purchase, says one analyst. Visit IBD's Technology page for a closer look at what Gilead might buy and why.Most patients will take Vosevi after failing to respond to Harvoni, Zepatier or AbbVie's two-drug combination. AbbVie's drug, on the other hand, is likely to grab approval as a regimen for patients who have never undergone treatment.Porges expects AbbVie to price its two-pill drug like its Viekira Pak, another hepatitis C combination that goes for about $28,000 per month. AbbVie will aggressively market the two-drug combo against Gilead's Harvoni and Epclusa, he said.""This strategy is likely to result in significant market share for AbbVie, given the convenience and excellent efficacy of their two-drug combination,"" he said in a note to clients.Porges forecasts $140 million in U.S. sales for Vosevi for the second half of 2017 and $300 million per year until 2020, when he expects to see a gradual decline. Outside the U.S., he expects Vosevi to pull in $600 million to $700 million annually from 2018-21.At the same time, Porges models Gilead's Harvoni and Epclusa as losing market share to AbbVie. He calls for Gilead's hepatitis C drug franchise to represent just 12% of total sales by 2021, falling from half of all sales in 2016.On the stock market today, Gilead shares climbed 1.45 to close at 72.72. AbbVie popped 0.8% to finish at 72.77.RELATED:Vertex Hits Record High On Results Of Cystic Fibrosis TrialCould This Biotech Stir Takeover Interest After Cancer Drug Approval?'Stars Align' For These Biotechs To Crush Earnings Consensus

173,ABBV,"Biogen (BIIB) is paying Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) $300 million upfront to license a palsy drug with a $2 billion market opportunity and the potential to use that to treat Alzheimer's, an analyst said Thursday.The deal was announced early Thursday in conjunction with a separate agreement with Roche (RHHBY). Roche will license a Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug from Bristol, according to a news release from Bristol. Both agreements are expected to close in the second quarter.""Licensing these assets to Biogen and Roche will enable Bristol-Myers Squibb to prioritize the other promising opportunities for asset development that have advanced across our diversified portfolio,"" said Mike Burgess, head of Bristol's cardiovascular, fibrosis and immuno-science development.By the closing bell on the stock market today, investors only rewarded Biogen, which gained 1.1% to 271.88. Bristol was down a fraction 52.83. Roche stock fell 1%, to 31.92.Under the Biogen deal, the No. 4 biotech will pay Bristol $410 million in milestone payments and a tiered double-digit royalty to license a drug known only as BMS-986168. The drug just completed Phase 1 testing in progressive supranuclear palsy.The palsy, also called Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome, is a rare brain disorder that causes difficulty in walking, balance and eye movements, according to the Mayo Clinic. The drug Biogen is licensing is known as an anti-Tau. Anti-Taus have been investigated in the treatment of Alzheimer's.In Alzheimer's, Taus are proteins that build up in the brain. The process causes tangles in nerve cells, breaking down communication, experts say. The Bristol/Biogen drug cut down on Tau and plaque buildup in the brain by 65% to 96% in healthy volunteers during Phase 1 testing.IBD'S TAKE: Biogen shares have been in a flat base since reaching a high of 312.40 on Aug. 2. The stock gets a Composite Rating of 81 from Investor's Business Daily, meaning it outperforms 81% of all stocks. It currently ranks 19th in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech Group, with Celgene (CELG) in the top spot.A Phase 2 trial with 400 patients is underway with a readout expected in mid-2019. In the palsy drug, Biogen could see a $2 billion market, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat estimated. The market is bigger in Alzheimer's. There, Biogen is already working on two other drugs.In using an anti-Tau in both palsy and Alzheimer's treatments, Biogen will face off with AbbVie (ABBV).  AbbVie is also in Phase 2 testing with its drug, known as ABBV-8E12 and is on a similar timeline, Raffat noted. Its Phase 2 trial began in January with 400 patients.Per the second deal, Roche will license Bristol's drug, called BMS-986089. The drug is being developed as a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare disease characterized by muscle degeneration and weakness.Roche will pay $170 million upfront with potential $205 million milestone payments and a tiered, double-digit royalty if the drug is approved.RELATED:How Roche's 'Game Changer' Drug Will Chip Away At Biogen, NovartisThese Biotechs Could Save The Drug Sector In Q1 — Or NotCould Dow Stock Merck Undercut AstraZeneca In Lung Cancer?

174,ABBV,"XCelgene (CELG) stock toppled Thursday after the No. 2 biotech missed Otezla sales expectations by $95 million, leading to overall revenue that came in about $80 million light, though profits topped views by a nickel.On the stock market today, Celgene stock was down 1% to 123.97 after earlier dipping as much as 2.5%. Shares are forming a flat base with a possible buy point at 127.74.For the first quarter ended March 31, Celgene reported $2.96 billion in sales, up 18% vs. the year-earlier period, but that lagged the consensus for $3.04 billion. Adjusted profits of $1.68 per share climbed 27% and topped views by 5 cents.Among its key products, multiple myeloma drugs Pomalyst and Imnovid grew 33% to $364 million in sales. Cancer drugs Revlimid and Abraxane grew 20% to $1.88 billion in sales and 5% to $236 million, respectively.Otezla, a drug for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, grew 24% to $242 million in sales. But that lagged analysts for $337 million, Mizuho analyst Salim Syed noted in a research report. He kept his buy rating and 130 price target on Celgene stock, noting the biotech expanded its share in psoriasis vs. the prior quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Want the latest on IBD's biotech and pharma stocks coverage? Head to the Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News Page for the freshest news.""The company cited market contractions in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in the U.S., increased gross to net adjustments and a small inventory drawdown,"" for the first-quarter miss in Otezla sales. In the U.S., Otezla brought in $199 million, up 14%. International sales grew 105% to $43 million.Celgene raised its 2017 adjusted earnings per share target to $7.15-$7.30, up from earlier views for $7.10-$7.25 and in line with consensus expectations for $7.22. Celgene also expects to have data in a Phase 3 study for multiple sclerosis drug Ozanimod before the end of the second quarter.Also Thursday, AstraZeneca (AZN) topped earnings views, and had in-line sales. Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and AbbVie (ABBV) topped both metrics. Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) had an all-around miss.Late Wednesday, Amgen (AMGN) reported better-than-expected earnings but sales that fell short. Amgen shares dropped 1.15% to 162.72 after hitting 160 soon after the open. Early Tuesday, Biogen (BIIB) topped earnings and sales forecasts.

175,ABBV,"In a very busy week for news, stocks rallied solidly. Markets worldwide cheered the results of the first round of France's presidential election. Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Dow stock McDonald's (MCD) hit record highs on earnings, while Intel (INTC) and Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled, with hundreds of other companies reporting. President Trump's big tax-cut plan, which had lifted markets in anticipation, didn't move the needle when its outline was finally released.The major market averages jumped Monday and Tuesday after Emmanuel Macron led the first round of voting in the French presidential election, with polls suggesting he will easily defeat nationalist Marine Le Pen in the early May runoff. Stocks largely consolidated gains the rest of the week, though individual stocks and sectors were active amid a flurry of earnings. Internet, chips, restaurants and casinos were leaders, while Baidu (BIDU), Intel and Starbucks showed that even leading groups had losers. But the Nasdaq composite hit record highs during the week, climbing 2.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.9%, while the S&P 500 index was up 1.5%, just below all-time bests.The e-commerce giant said adjusted income rose 38% year over year to $1.48 a share, beating the consensus Q1 estimate of $1.12. Revenue rose 23% to $35.7 billion, topping views of $35.3 billion. That maintained a steady streak of double-digit revenue gains going back more than four years.Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud computing unit, continued to deliver huge, if gradually slowing, growth.Amazon shares rose to a record high Friday, clearing a new buy point, but closing well off intraday peaks.The earnings of Google-parent Alphabet rose 28% as revenue rose 22%, to $24.75 billion. Analysts expected the company to report earnings of $7.40 a share on sales of $24.22 billion. Revenue at Google's ""other"" non-advertising business — which includes its cloud computing unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store — rose 49%, to $3.01 billion. Mobile advertising growth was a bright spot, although Google's rising traffic-acquisition costs are a concern. TAC refers to what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, or what it pays partners like Apple (AAPL) that generate search traffic. Alphabet shares gapped up 3.8% to a fresh record high Friday.McDonald's first-quarter results beat views, and the burger giant talked up its tech efforts, including expanding delivery, trying out mobile order and pay and its new digitized restaurant layout. Shares jumped to record highs. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) also beat and said it was testing GPS-tracking technology. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) beat as well, and analysts debated its progress following a food-borne illness scare. Starbucks matched profit expectations, but missed on sales amid worries about stalling growth. Starbucks shares undercut a recent buy point intraday Friday, but closed above that level.Software leader Microsoft (MSFT) delivered earnings per share above views for its fiscal third quarter, but sales came in a tad short. Its sales guidance for the June quarter also was below analyst estimates. Microsoft earned 73 cents a share excluding items, up 18% year over year, on adjusted revenue of $23.56 billion, up 6%, in the March quarter. Analysts expected 70 cents and $23.62 billion. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to sales of $24.15 billion, up 7%, but Wall Street had been modeling for $24.51 billion.Intel earnings topped, but the chip giant's sales fell shy amid weakness in its data center market, sending shares gapping down 3.5% Friday. Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), Mellanox Technologies (MLNX), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) were chip plays that retreated. But Cavium (CAVM) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) rallied after the chipmakers topped Q1 earnings. Gear makers Teradyne (TER) and Ultra Clean (UCTT) boomed on results.Lockheed Martin (LMT) sees more international demand for its F-35 fighter and missile-defense systems as global tensions heat up and Raytheon (RTN) sees ""significant demand signals"" for its munitions on increasing military operations in Syria. Lockheed's Q1 sales fell short of expectations and it gave weak guidance. Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD) topped on EPS and sales. All four defense stocks were in buy range at some point in the week, but by Friday's close all were slightly below entry areas.Core Boeing (BA) earnings jumped 16% to $2.01, beating views, but revenue fell 7% as defense revenue fell 18%. Free cash flow soared to $1.63 billion from $527 million. The aerospace giant raised its full year EPS outlook, but the midpoint still fell below analyst views. Industrial conglomerate United Technologies (UTX) topped with slim EPS and sales gains, as Otis elevator revenue, aerospace system sales and Pratt & Whitney jet engine sales rose.Boeing shares rose toward a flat-base buy point. United Tech is at a 23-month high, at the edge of buying range.Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX), the two largest providers of disk drives, had differing earnings. Seagate revenue missed estimates, with the stock falling 17% in reaction. Western Digital's earnings beat on the top and bottom lines, and announced very bullish guidance, sending shares up 3.9% Friday.Wynn Resorts (WYNN) pulled ahead of forecasts with 99 cents EPS and $1.475 billion in sales, as Macau gaming activity continues to rebound. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) EPS rose 47% to 66 cents, topping, on 15% revenue growth, meeting views. MGM Resorts (MGM) topped handily on both the top and bottom lines, helped by the takeover of the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa and the MGM National Harbor opening. Wynn Resorts hit a two-year high, and MGM rose to its best since 2008, with shares in buy range. Sands advanced within a consolidation.Exxon Mobil (XOM) reported mixed first-quarter results but said it had no plans to adjust its capital expenditure guidance as the oil major has identified and captured capital efficiencies. Exxon warned that it still needed to be cautious on the rebalancing of the oil market. Chevron (CVX) swung to a profit in Q1 and revenue beat Wall Street estimates as overall production rose. Management said if oil remains around $50 a barrel then future spending would be near the low end of its capex forecast. U.S. oil prices are modestly below $50 a barrel as Baker Hughes announced the U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a 15th straight week, foreshadowing further production gains.T-Mobile US (TMUS) topped Q1 earnings estimates and continued its streak of grabbing the most new subscribers among wireless operators. T-Mobile added 798,000 postpaid phone subscribers vs. 877,000 in the year-earlier period; that topped estimates of 725,000. T-Mobile shares rose to a new high, in buy range. AT&T (T) is expected to ramp up advertising for bundled wireless and pay TV offers after reporting in-line EPS and revenue that fell more than expected. AT&T lost 348,000 wireless postpaid subscribers, more than expected. Subscriber growth at DirecTV Now's streaming service helped AT&T offset surprising weakness at DirecTV's traditional pay TV business. But AT&T shares fell to 2017 low.Separately, cable giant Comcast (CMCSA) rose to a new high on strength in its movie business and broadband-customer gains.Recall costs and slowing U.S. sales hurt Ford (F) earnings, which fell but still beat Q1 views. Ford said higher commodity costs, particularly in steel, could weigh but that the worst hit to profit and costs this year likely happened in Q1. General Motors (GM) beat forecasts on solid U.S. truck and crossover sales, while Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) held its full-year outlook and kept its debt in check. The results come amid concerns about slowing auto sales, rising inventories and falling used-car prices.Dow Jones industrial average equipment-maker Caterpillar (CAT) earned $1.28 a share in Q1, more than doubling estimates, and raised its 2017 revenue range by $2 billion to $39-$41 billion, vs. estimates of $38.3 billion. Caterpillar's good news comes despite lack of progress on President Trump's infrastructure program or border wall, two initiatives that have made Caterpillar a Trump stock. Ahead of earnings, Caterpillar finally broke a 51-month streak of falling retail sales, with a 1% gain that was driven by construction equipment sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Caterpillar shares soared into a buy zone.Biotechs and drugmakers reported en masse Thursday with AbbVie (ABBV), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) delivering across-the-board beats, pumping their stocks up that day. AstraZeneca (AZN) topped on earnings, but sales slid 12%, though adjusted profits grew 4% and topped by 17 cents. Top two biotechs, Amgen (AMGN) and Celgene (CELG), both reported lagging sales. On Thursday, Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) stock hit an 11-year low on light sales and an 8-cent per-share loss ex items that also missed.Even as the House made another push to repeal ObamaCare — with a plan that included steep cuts for Medicaid — a raft of insurers moved into buy zones, and flirted with breakouts or pushing to new highs. The catalyst was an especially strong earnings report from Anthem (ANTM), though investors may have judged that TrumpCare remains doomed. Humana (HUM) previewed its earnings and raised guidance. Centene (CNC) topped estimates and CEO Michael Neidorff said he expects the Medicaid-heavy insurer to thrive on any reform that can be passed by Congress, noting that ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid.""PulteGroup (PHM) topped earnings estimates, but revenue fell short. Meanwhile, President Trump imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood imports, which could raise construction costs by $1,200 per home. New-home sales rose in March to the second-fastest rate of the current business cycle. Pulte tumbled, but did not outright close below a prior buy point. D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) fell below their 50-day lines as well.

178,ABBV,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) stock pulled back Friday, but an analyst upgraded shares on the likelihood Vertex will succeed against competitors like Galapagos (GLPG) in treating cystic fibrosis.Needham analyst Alan Carr upgraded Vertex stock to a buy rating, with a 155 price target, as the top-10 biotech by market cap works to complete a triple-pill combination to treat the genetic mutations tied to cystic fibrosis, a lung disease.The ""CF landscape continues to favor Vertex, given substantial lead in a market with few competitors,"" Carr wrote in a research report. He expects Vertex's triple-pill combination for cystic fibrosis to launch in late 2020.But Vertex stock fell 1.5% to 133.50 on the stock market today as some biotechs took a breather after a rapid 5-day run-up.Carr expects Vertex to identify at least one safe and effective triple-pill for cystic fibrosis. The company is currently testing four candidates in combination with its drugs known as ivacaftor and tezacaftor.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs were on a run this week as generalist investors returned to the space amid subsiding worries that Trump would work to bring down drug prices. A number of companies saw double-digit and high-single-digit gains. For the rundown, visit IBD Industry Themes.Other programs are underway at Galapagos/AbbVie (ABBV), ProQR (PRQR) and Proteostasis Therapeutics, but patient recruitment in cystic fibrosis is a challenge, Carr said. Given Vertex's lead, competitors are likely to progress slowly, he said.Earlier this week, Galapagos said it's holding off trials of its own triple-pill to treat cystic fibrosis until the fourth quarter. This puts Galapagos more than a year behind Vertex, a Janney analyst said Wednesday.RELATED:Galapagos Stock Under Fire After Delaying Key Vertex-Rivaling DrugWhy The Biotech Rally Could Still Tack On Another 15% UpsideBiotechs Hit Pause On 5-Day Rally As Regeneron, Bluebird Topple

179,ABBV,"Bellwether Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) second-quarter report bodes well for the biotech sector, an analyst said Tuesday, after the Dow component topped profit expectations and narrowly lagged sales views.On the stock market today, J&J stock climbed 1.8% to 134.46, as biotech stocks dropped nearly 1% as a group. Generic drugmakers inched down 0.3%.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges remains bullish on the biotech sector and Needham analyst Mike Matson says J&J's second-quarter results point to a stable period for medtech players like Boston Scientific (BSX), Medtronic (MDT), Stryker (SYK) and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH).During the quarter, J&J's drug sales grew 4.7% sequentially, though they fell 2.6% vs. the year-earlier period. Porges partially blamed a one-time positive rebate adjustment in 2016 which eliminated 4% of year-over-year volume/price growth in the second quarter.Sales of J&J's immunosuppressant Remicade declined 14% year over year. But rivalry from biosimilars contributed to just 5% of that decline, which is lower than guidance for a 10%-15% decline in 2017, Porges wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Cancer and rare-disease specialists are expected to do well in the second half of 2017 as positive sentiment returns to the biotech space. Visit IBD's Industry Snapshot for a look at who may outperform in the second quarter.J&J also expects currency headwinds to subside in the second half of 2017 and called for acceleration in its pharmaceutical unit as well as positive trends in sales outside the U.S. Based on the presumed currency impacts, the firm raised its outlook for adjusted profits to $7.12-$7.22 a share.Outside the U.S., drug sales grew 7% sequentially in the second quarter, beating views for 3% growth, Porges said.""(This) supports our expectations for sequential outside-U.S. revenue growth for our companies due to a weakening dollar in the second quarter,"" he said.Porges expects guidance increases for biotechs during the second quarter. Earlier in the week, he called for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) to easily beat June quarter sales views and for Gilead Sciences (GILD) to handily top profit expectations.""Our covered companies will not be negatively impacted by the same prior period adjustments as J&J, and those with current or imminent biosimilar competition may surprise consensus if the Remicade market dynamics can be viewed as a proxy,"" he said.AbbVie (ABBV) could see some pain, though. Sales of cancer drug Imbruvica grew 40% in the U.S. and 64% outside the U.S., J&J said. J&J is partnered with AbbVie on Imbruvica in the U.S. J&J typically books 40% of U.S. Imbruvica sales, Porges said. This translates to about $501 million for AbbVie's Imbruvica sales.This would be a ""miss vs. consensus of $514 million and our estimate of $537 million,"" he said. ""For AbbVie, Imbruvica is considered the largest growth driver beyond the Humira patent cliff, but continued missed consensus expectations repeated in the second quarter would be a negative for the stock.""RELATED:'Stars Align' For These Biotechs To Crush Earnings ConsensusThese 2 Drug Giants In Buy Range Just Beat Earnings ViewsHow Novartis' FDA Win In Cancer Also Could Be A Boon For Its Rivals

180,ABBV,"Biotech Galapagos (GLPG) has a shot at making a dent in the cystic fibrosis market, but it will lag Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), analysts said Wednesday after Galapagos pushed out a key trial.Analysts heading into Galapagos' research and development event Tuesday expected the firm to outline its timeline for a trial examining a three-pill series to treat cystic fibrosis, Janney analyst Debjit Chattopadhyay said in a note to clients.Instead, Galapagos is holding off its trials until the fourth quarter, pending regulatory guidance, Chattopadhyay said. Its closest rival, Vertex, plans to roll out triple-combo data in the third quarter, putting Galapagos more than a year behind.""On the positive side, the CF portfolio has multiple shots on goal and when the program does get the green light, Galapagos is planning to execute on multiple triple-combinations mimicking competitor Vertex,"" he said.In midmorning trading on the stock market today, Galapagos stock fell 1.9% to close at 77.35, while shares of Vertex jumped 6.7% to 134.83.Both firms are taking a triple-pill approach to treating cystic fibrosis, a disease of the lungs and digestive system. The triplet combinations are expected to be able to treat the genetic mutations tied to cystic fibrosis.IBD'S TAKE: Vertex stock is among four biotechs that should be on your watchlist now. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at Vertex and its strongest peers.Galapagos is working to narrow down seven potential contenders for the final triplet. But the delay in beginning its trials will likely mean Galapagos and partner AbbVie (ABBV) can't finalize their selections until 2019, Chattopadhyay said.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan anticipated the delay given ""the relatively aggressive timelines the company had laid out previously."" Galapagos will first focus on the U.K. market before expanding its triplet to other countries, he said in a note to clients.According to a cystic fibrosis market, Galapagos' drug will need to show a 5% improvement over a non-drug placebo to be clinically meaningful in trials. She sees Galapagos grabbing an opening if it can prove its drug is equivalent to Vertex's.""She also sees a potential place for a new player on the market given the increased flexibility it will give patients and physicians in both terms of enrolling patients in new clinical trials and prescribing medicines once they are available commercially,"" Divan said.RELATED:Amgen, Gilead, Biogen Won't Lead The Biotech Boom — So Who Will?Vertex Rockets To 14-Month High On Cystic Fibrosis Drug ResultsGalapagos Cystic Fibrosis Drug Trials Vertex's 'Mega-Franchise': RBC

182,ABBV,"Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Tesaro (TSRO) could each deliver blockbuster ovarian cancer drugs and grab takeover interest, an analyst said Friday ahead of a key trial for Clovis, expected later this month.The duo rivals bigger AstraZeneca (AZN), whose $87.3 billion market cap is more than eight times that of Clovis and Tesaro combined. Clovis and Tesaro joined AstraZeneca on the PARP-inhibitor market within the last year.PARP inhibitors work by blocking a family of enzymes that cancer cells use to proliferate. Pfizer (PFE) and AbbVie (ABBV) are also working on PARP inhibitors. Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young sees the class of drugs also having an impact in prostate, breast and lung cancers.""We think that the PARP (inhibitor) market is big enough ($8 billion to $10 billion) that Clovis can have a blockbuster product as well,"" she wrote. ""We strongly believe that both companies are likely attractive targets for large global biopharma companies.""Later this month, Clovis is expected to unveil the results of its Phase 3 trial, dubbed Ariel-3, for its drug Rubraca. Tesaro previously set a high bar with a trial of its drug Zejula which had a benefit in all patients regardless of specific genetics.""On a top-line basis, we think Ariel-3 will work across the groups, but the focus will be on potential commercial differences like use of biomarker and safety,"" she wrote in a note to clients.Young expects Tesaro stock to be volatile following Clovis' trial, but notes that it will lift an overhang on shares. She has outperform ratings on both Tesaro and Clovis stocks. She rates Tesaro stock with a 198 price target and Clovis with an 88 price target, up from 74.On the stock market today, Clovis stock rose 0.45% to 59.97. Tesaro stock gained 0.1% to 144.31. AstraZeneca, Pfizer and AbbVie stocks were up 1.4%, 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: The American Society of Clinical Oncology laid out the battlefield fighting cancer. Companies like Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Incyte and Roche are working on combining drugs on the immuno-oncology spectrum. Get more at IBD Industry Themes.Shares of fellow cancer biotech Incyte (INCY) toppled 1.9% to 118.05, after sustaining a price-target cut. Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt trimmed his price target on Incyte stock to 129 from 134 after Incyte and Eli Lilly's (LLY) rheumatoid arthritis treatment was delayed in the U.S.In April, the Food and Drug Administration delayed approval for the drug, called baricitinib, instead asking for more information into a trial. Now, Schmidt says he expects $400 million in 2026 sales, down from $1.3 billion. He sees the drug launching in 2020.But, Schmidt was bullish on Seattle Genetics (SGEN) stock after the small biotech and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) unveiled strong data for a combination of their drugs Adcetris and Opdivo in classical Hodgkin lymphoma. All signs of cancer disappeared in 63% of patients.A series of trials for the combination could ""potentially provide a chemotherapy-free treatment option"" for patients whose Hodgkin lymphoma either relapsed or can't be treated with surgery.Schmidt has outperform ratings on Seattle Genetics and Bristol-Myers stocks.RELATED:Tesaro Crashes Despite Beating AstraZeneca With 'Stronger' DataBristol-Incyte Match Beats Dow's Merck In Combination TrialsConference Spotlights Drug Giant Donnybrooks In Cancer Treatments

183,ABBV,"A slew of biotechs and drugmakers might take a closer look at Epizyme (EPZM) after the small-cap biotech presented strong data in a lymphoma trial Wednesday in Switzerland, an analyst said Thursday.The findings at the International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma could attract the likes of Gilead Sciences (GILD), AbbVie (ABBV), Celgene (CELG), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) or Roche (RHHBY), Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients.Epizyme is testing its drug, dubbed tazemetostat, in two forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Interim data show tazemetostat had a clinically meaningful benefit in all patients with what's called follicular lymphoma, a buildup on cells in the lymph nodes.Tumors shrunk in 92% of follicular lymphoma patients and in 29% of patients with an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and a specific genetic mutation. Tazemetostat proved safe across all patient populations.Leerink's Porges called the study a ""proof of principle."" He expects the drug to win accelerated approval at the Food and Drug Administration in follicular lymphoma. Accelerated approvals allow a drug to be marketed while still in clinical trials.""Few cancer drugs have a 90% response rate, or a 100% clinical benefit rate, in any disease,"" he said. ""And while investors might debate about how big that group of patients really is, and how long treatment duration will be, we would not be surprised to see Epizyme start to show up on potential takeout candidate lists.""Epizyme could be appealing to AbbVie, Celgene, J&J and Roche, Porges wrote. Roche is among the leaders in immuno-oncology, a method of treating tumors by blocking certain interactions that hide cancer cells.Gilead is better known for its virology drugs, including those that target hepatitis C and HIV. But Gilead's hepatitis C franchise declined in 2016 amid high cure rates. Now, Gilead has said it's open to seeking an acquisition in oncology. Incyte and Tesaro are also rumored takeout candidates.""Now that the molecule (tazemetostat) has been de-risked, we expect more investors to get involved into the stock and to build positions ahead of further data disclosures,"" Porges said.IBD'S TAKE: Seattle Genetics Chief Executive Clay Siegall says his company is aiming to change the 40-year method of treating Hodgkin lymphoma. How? Head to IBD's Technology page for an exclusive with the CEO.The same conference saw Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Seattle Genetics (SGEN) team up for a Phase 1/2 trial in classical Hodgkin lymphoma, also with robust results. But only Epizyme stock spiked on its news.Bristol-Myers and Seattle Genetics, too, had strong data in classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Tumors shrunk in 85% of patients treated with a combination of Bristol's Opdivo and Seattle's Adcetris. All signs of cancer disappeared in 63% of patients. The combo proved safe as well, Bristol said.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Epizyme stock soared more than 13%, near 14.

184,ABBV,"AbbVie (ABBV) is a stronger stock bet than Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Amgen (AMGN), Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said Thursday after comparing the biopharmas' Q4 earnings, 2017 trajectory and typical R&D turnover.""This analysis suggests that AbbVie offers more attractive fundamentals based on earnings momentum and dividend yield, and is the only company of the three that is likely to show sustained improvements in operating margin and cash flow over the next four years,"" Porges wrote in a research report.Like Gilead, AbbVie's earnings growth is largely based on operating revenue increases. But, Porges notes, those increases are due to volume growth for Humira, Imbruvica and Viekira. Gilead has boosted its operating revenue by increasing prices on franchise hepatitis C drug sales, he said.Both companies derive the lion's share of their sales from a single segment. In 2014 and 2015, Gilead saw sales spike on its hepatitis C drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni. Because HCV is a curable disease, sales plunged in 2016. Humira, AbbVie's anti-inflammatory, has been stronger. In Q4, its sales rose 15.5%.The two are also pitted in a patent battle over AbbVie's claims that an Amgen biosimilar drug infringes on its Humira patents. Though AbbVie is shoring up to defend its IP on Humira, analysts expect biosimilars to come online over the next few years.IBD'S TAKE: Among biotechs, analysts broadly see Incyte as a strong stock option with a number of potential blockbuster drugs in its pipeline. Read on in The New America for better insight into the firm.""AbbVie is certainly facing growth and quality issues beyond 2020, when the outlook for Humira becomes increasingly uncertain, but all three companies face generic, biosimilar and branded threats that challenge their current blockbuster product franchises,"" Porges wrote.Still, earnings momentum looks good for AbbVie in 2017 and 2018. In January, AbbVie guided to $5.44-$5.54 earnings per share ex items in 2017, which would be up 14% at the midpoint. That outlook didn't chip at consensus views for 2018, which are at $6.44.Gilead's forecasts have declined significantly over the past 14 months, Porges wrote. ""It's possible these estimates could decline more given the recent trend,"" he noted. Amgen, on the other hand, appears stable.AbbVie stock closed up 1% at 61.94 on the stock market today, while Gilead and Amgen both rose 0.8%. AbbVie stock is just above its 50-day line but just below its 200-day line. On a year-to-date basis, Amgen stock is outperforming its peers, up 18%, with AbbVie and Gilead stocks down 2% and nearly 4%, respectively.RELATED:Gilead Crashes On Hep C Sales Decline, 2017 Views; Q4, 2016 Metrics TopAbbVie, Merck Pressure Gilead's 2017 Hep C Unit; GSK Battles HIV BizGilead HIV Drug Tops GSK Combo, But Rivalry 'Intense' With GSK Doublet

185,ABBV,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) and AbbVie (ABBV) will benefit from Merck's (MRK) decision to take a $2.9 billion impairment charge on a hepatitis C drug as the market and prices shrink, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said Friday.Merck also cut its value estimate for uprifosbuvir, a hepatitis C drug acquired from Idenix Pharmaceuticals in 2014, to $240 million, based on its upcoming three-drug regimen and a change in its view on the whole hepatitis C market.Regulators say Merck must complete separate trials showing an added benefit with its triplet over its high-dose doublet regimen, Porges said. That complicates matters. The high-dose doublet is in phase 2 testing, behind the triplet.""This write-down also suggests that the remaining value of the 'rest of Idenix' is now very small,"" Porges wrote in a research report. Merck is also seemingly indicating ""significantly reduced value for its future participation in the market, which is consistent with a declining market overall.""IBD'S TAKE: Analysts projected the downfall in hepatitis C drug sales. What were the warning signs and are other markets at risk? Read on in IBD's Industry Themes.Gilead, AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) compete in the hepatitis C market. Merck's charge signals the drugmaker expects to have lighter sales and a smaller share than initially forecast.Drugmakers are struggling with 2014-15 growing pains following a boom and subsequent bust in hepatitis C drug sales. Gilead is the poster child for the phenomenon. Sales of Sovaldi and Harvoni toppled in 2016. Now, Gilead is betting on its HIV drug, bictegravir.Merck, too, noted the changing patient population dynamics.""The company determined that recent changes to the product profile, as well as changes to its expectations for pricing and the market opportunity, taken together constituted a triggering event that required the company to evaluate the uprifosbuvir intangible asset for impairment,"" Merck wrote in its 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday.In morning trading on the stock market today, Merck stock was up a fraction to 66.16 at the closing bell.

186,ABBV,"To satisfy the Trump administration's calls to deal with high U.S. drug costs, one industry leader is proposing that the president lead negotiations with drugmakers to restrain prices.Allergan (AGN) Chief Executive Brent Saunders cited tactics used by President John F. Kennedy decades ago to keep down steel prices. The administration also could waive federal antitrust rules that currently prohibit drugmakers from discussing pricing so they could put together guidelines to follow, he said.Voluntary agreements that restrain prices are ""a very practical solution that doesn't, in my view, do anything to impede innovation,"" Saunders said Wednesday in an interview at Bloomberg's headquarters in New York. Convincing fellow drugmakers to agree with him, however, could be a challenge.""It would be difficult,"" Saunders said.Big Pharma is under intense pressure to come up with ways to reduce prices after President Trump accused the companies of ""getting away with murder"" and threatened to use the government's buying power to force prices down.Saunders has been outspoken against excessive price hikes in his own industry. At Allergan, an $80 billion company whose products range from wrinkle treatment Botox to stomach and schizophrenia medicines, the CEO has implemented a ""social contract"" that caps increases at 10% annually.Trump ""could model something like that with the pharmaceutical industry — maybe that could look like something like our social contract,"" Saunders said. ""It's easy for me to suggest when we're already doing it, just to be transparent,"" he added. Asked about a targeted amount under restraint agreements, he said low single digits, or about the rate of inflation.Pharmaceutical giants including Novartis (NVS), Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical and AbbVie (ABBV) also have taken voluntary actions to cap price increases. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Merck (MRK) have taken steps to increase transparency about their prices.""The industry has moved quite a bit in three months, four months,"" Saunders said. ""But it would need another big push.""Under Saunders, Allergan has transformed itself into a specialty pharmaceutical behemoth after a series of acquisitions and the sale of its generics business. After an attempt to merge with Pfizer (PFE) Inc. in a $160 billion megadeal that was abandoned last year, Allergan has focused on smaller purchases.Allergan's shares are down compared with the rest of the industry. Over the last 12 months, they've lost 14%, compared with a 7.6% gain in the 25-company Standard and Poor's 500 Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology & Life Sciences Index, which includes Allergan.Rather than another transformational deal, Saunders is more interested in building up Allergan's main therapeutic areas, including medical aesthetics and dermatology, eye care, central nervous system and gastroenterology. In the past two months, he's made two acquisitions worth a combined $5 billion to add to Allergan's aesthetic-medicine and cosmetic-surgery lines.Hair restoration and skin quality are the next frontiers, he said. The company is currently doing research in both of those areas.""Those are huge unmet needs,"" he said.When asked about Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) whose assets include the Bausch & Lomb eye-care company that he once led, Saunders says he's not interested — not even ""in pieces.""Valeant didn't respond to a request seeking comment.

187,ABBV,"AbbVie (ABBV) and Merck (MRK) are pressuring Gilead Sciences' (GILD) already-burdened Hepatitis C unit, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Monday, a day ahead of Gilead's much-anticipated Q4 earnings report and 2017 guidance.Broadly, analysts anticipate Gilead to guide 2017 sales down 7% to $28.01 billion which assumes $12 billion in Hep C sales. A guide of $27 billion or lower indicates a $1 billion dip in Hep C sales and $1 sloughed off earnings per share minus items, Yee said.Investors ""will likely have little confidence in higher revenues, so it could be seen as risky guidance,"" Yee wrote in a research report. ""So either way, we think Gilead needs to guide around $28 billion and hit some quarters, and HCV needs to stabilize.""Gilead stock was hammered in January. That followed a report from market tracker IMS that Hep C prescriptions fell 6%-7% sequentially in Q4.This month, shares have recovered minimally and are now flat for the year. In the stock market today, Gilead stock edged up 5 cents to 72.39. The No. 2 biotech by market cap, behind Amgen (AMGN), is slated to report its Q4 earnings after the close Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: Of the big biotech leaders, analysts have been most bearish on Gilead amid reports of slowing Hepatitis C drug sales. Dive in on the issue in IBD's Industry Themes.For Q4, analysts expect Gilead to post $7.15 billion in sales and $2.61 EPS minus items, down 16% and 21% vs. the year-earlier period. Analysts expect $30.2 billion in sales and $11.41 EPS minus items for the year, down 7.4% and 9.5%, respectively.But 2017 guidance is key, especially considering the struggles of its Hep C unit, Evercore analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote in a research note Monday. Hep C drug sales — Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa — comprised 45% of Gilead's total product sales in Q3.In the past, Gilead has commented on new patients being healthier, Schoenebaum said. Gilead is also likely to experience competitive pressure in 2017 from Merck's Zepatier, a Hep C pill, and approval of AbbVie's eight-week regimen.Yee expects investors to key in on HIV drug sales. Gilead is likely to have phase 2 data on HIV drug bictegravir during the annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) Feb. 13-16 in Seattle.There, Gilead faces competitive from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). GSK's dolutegravir, under the brand name Tivicay, is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration.""Gilead has said they will put 'everything' behind this launch and the 'might' of Gilead behind it,"" Yee wrote. ""And it will be the 'Mt. Everest' for years to come for them.""Yee has an outperform rating and 90 price target on Gilead stock.RELATED:J&J HCV Dips To 'Virtually Zero,' Mirroring Gilead; 2017 Views LagGilead Clobbered On Hep C; 'Little Value' In 'Too Late' NASH, HIV UnitsGilead Will Bulk HIV, NASH Units Amid Hep C Slump; Stock On 2-Week Dip

188,ABBV,"Tesaro (TSRO) stock rocketed to a record high Wednesday on reports the cancer biotech is currying takeover interest from several drugmakers, according to inside sources cited by Reuters.In the stock market today, Tesaro stock jumped 12% to 182.68, boosting IBD's 425-company Biomed/Biotech industry group to a 0.5% gain on the day.Although Tesaro isn't seeking bids, it has hired several investment banks, including Citigroup, to help it explore and respond to the offers, insiders told Reuters. There's still a significant gap between the bids and Tesaro's valuation.Tesaro has an extensive cancer and immuno-oncology pipeline, but its only drug in phase 3 testing is niraparib. Niraparib belongs to a class of drugs called PARP inhibitors, which block specific enzymes in order to treat cancer.IBD'S TAKE: Tesaro stock grew 157% in 2016, leading the biotech industry group among stocks that started the year above 10 and had a minimum average daily trading volume of 10,000 shares. Who else reigned? Head to IBD's Industry Themes.Niraparib is being examined as a treatment for ovarian and breast cancer. It likely will compete with other PARP inhibitors from AstraZeneca (AZN), Clovis Oncology (CLVS), AbbVie (ABBV) and Medivation (MDVN).Additional clinical trials with niraparib this year could help close the gap between Tesaro's and bidders' view of the biotech's valuation, insiders told Reuters.Tesaro declined to comment to IBD.Late last year, the Food and Drug Administration granted niraparib priority review. Analysts say niraparib could hit the market as early as 2018.RELATED:Tesaro, AstraZeneca Could Shrink Clovis' Ovarian Drug Cancer Pool

189,ABBV,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are most likely to beat Wall Street views for June quarter sales and profits, an analyst said Monday.XLeerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says the ""stars align for widespread beats in Q2 biopharma results."" Among large caps, he also sees AbbVie (ABBV), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead as most likely to top revenue expectations.Quarter over quarter, though, sales from AbbVie, Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Biogen and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are likely to be slow, he said.""Both AbbVie and Biogen are facing competition and pricing pressures, while Alexion and Vertex are still high-growth companies with temporary slowing in their revenue growth trajectory pending new indications, formulations or products,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Health tracker IMS sees AbbVie's leukemia drug Imbruvica and testosterone gel AndroGel as likely to come in materially north of the consensus, with immunosuppressant Humira landing about 0.6% above Street views. But other major projects are expected to miss.IMS data suggest Biogen's multiple-sclerosis drugs Tysabri and Tecfidera could beat Porges' estimates by 18.2% and 1.8%, respectively. Tecfidera, however, is expected to miss the Street by 1.3% and MS drugs Plegridy and Avonex are forecast to be light.This comes amid growing competition in the MS field from the likes of Roche (RHHBY), Novartis (NVS) and Sanofi (SNY). Roche's drug, Ocrevus, was approved earlier this year to treat both relapsing-remitting as well as primary progressive MS — a first for the industry.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks are ranked No. 6 out of 197 groups tracked, as sentiment ticks up ahead of the second-quarter earnings season. Make sure to bookmark IBD's Biotech Stocks To Watch And Pharma Industry News for the latest on the sector.Major drugs from Celgene are expected to top the consensus by 4.9% with chemotherapy Revlimid likely to come in 5.1% above the consensus, Porges wrote. Pomalyst, a drug to treat a blood cancer, is expected to be 5.8% higher than the consensus.Gilead is likely to be the biggest second-quarter surprise. Per IMS data, Gilead's sales could top by 10%, ""though this is largely dependent upon the reliability of recent hepatitis C data, which have been unreliable in the past."" Hepatitis C drug sales toppled in 2016 amid high cure rates.Without accounting for highly variable sales of hepatitis C drugs, Gilead's total sales would miss Porges' forecast by 0.1% and the analyst consensus target by 1.7%. At the same time, Gilead's Genvoya, an HIV drug, could beat the consensus by 7%-9%, Porges wrote in a note to clients.Amgen (AMGN) is most likely to match or slightly underperform the consensus, Porges said. Rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel is expected to be in line with consensus views, though it could top Porges' view by as much as 1.9%, per IMS data.Bone health drug Prolia and bone marrow stimulating Aranesp are projected to beat by 6%-7%, which could help offset expected sales misses by bone health drug Xgeva and other bone marrow stimulant drugs, Porges said.""However, the changing price dynamic for many of Amgen's products makes the IMS adjustment factors less reliable,"" Porges wrote. He calls for Amgen to hike some of its prices in July after bumping the price of cancer drug Kyprolis by 3.9% in April.On the adjusted profits per share side, Gilead has a chance to beat consensus views by 11.1%, Porges said. Regeneron and Vertex could also top expectations by 8.1% and 7%, respectively.But Biogen could miss earnings views by 10.6% due to a one-time research-and-development expense not fully recognized across analysts' estimates, Porges said. AbbVie, too, is likely to miss adjusted earnings per share by 3.2%, he said.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech group was down fractionally.RELATED:Could Q2 Surprise Spike This Beleaguered Biotech's Stock?Gilead Could Acquire This Biotech — But Vertex Is Still Better: AnalystWhy This Biotech Could Be Poised For A Run After Toppling 52% In June

191,ABBV,"Biotech stocks toppled midday Thursday in line with broader indexes, and included pitfalls from large players like Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), United Therapeutics (UTHR) and Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) as long-term views look weak or uncertain.XOn the stock market today, Vertex dove 4.4% to 156.19; United Therapeutics fell 4.8% to 125.10; and Spark dipped 3.3% to 70.29. Broadly, IBD's 439-company biotech industry group lost 2.3%, reflecting major indexes that trended down.This followed beats from Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Vertex, Celgene (CELG) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) this week. All but Vertex increased some of their 2017 guidance. Vertex kept its full-year view, but sees a slowdown in the third quarter.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges trimmed his third-quarter views for Vertex and cut his 2017 sales forecast by 2%. He kept an outperform rating on Vertex but his price target on the stock got a haircut to 187 from 188.Second-quarter sales of cystic fibrosis drugs Orkambi and Kalydeco beat expectations. But Porges noted some of that was due to inventory stocking ahead of the anticipated summer slowdown. Vertex is also working on a triple-pill in cystic fibrosis.Outside its cystic fibrosis franchise, Vertex said on its earnings conference call that it could look to make small technology-based early-stage acquisitions, but will likely avoid ""the large-stage or large investments many investors fear,"" Porges said in a report.For United Therapeutics, second-quarter sales were the highest the company has ever seen at $445 million, ""but resumption of growth is not guaranteed,"" Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz said in a note to clients.United is working on drugs to treat a rare blood disease known as pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. Schwartz increased his third- and fourth-quarter sales models by 5%-7% after the strong second-quarter report.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs are now ranked fourth out of 197 groups tracked by IBD. But mergers and acquisitions could send them higher with Vertex considered both a takeover target and an acquirer in some circles. Get the deep dive via IBD Industry Themes.""Due to lack of any curative therapy for PAH, providing a suite of PAH medicines could keep patients transitioning between United products,"" he said. ""However, we are reluctant to assume that a rebound in product sales this quarter will materialize resumption of growth trajectory in other United products.""Also Thursday, Alexion and Celgene topped expectations. Alexion rose 2.2% to 133.92, but Celgene still dipped 2.6% to 134.15.  Investors were likely looking for Celgene to raise its top-line guidance for 2017, but instead Celgene lifted its adjusted profits forecast for the year to $7.25-$7.35 a share.""The main surprise in this result is the lack of an increase in top-line guidance, which we would normally have expected at this time of year,"" Leerink's Porges said. ""Since the second quarter of 2010, this is only the their time that Celgene has not increased their revenue guidance in the second quarter.""Elsewhere in biotech, analysts were more bullish on Gilead which saw hepatitis C drug sales fall a collective 27.5% on slower revenue from Harvoni and Sovaldi. But that beat analysts' view, which predicted a fall of 32%, Porges said. He raised his price target to 83 from 74.The magnitude of the beat points to stabilizing hepatitis C drug sales, he said. But ""the windfall may be short-lived, however, as AbbVie's (ABBV) next-generation doublet is set to enter the market within weeks and is likely to represent the first real competition to Gilead's hepatitis C dominant market position.""RELATED:AstraZeneca Beats, But Stock Dives On Drug Failure; 4 More ReportThis Biotech Nearly Tripled Street Expectations For One Key DrugGilead's Hepatitis C Franchise Topples Again, But Shares Up On Beat

192,ABBV,"After breakouts from biotech stocks like Celgene (CELG), Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Bioverativ (BIVV), Ireland-based ethical drugs firm Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) is trying to return to its former Wall Street glory and launch another big run.The developer of specialty drugs for narcolepsy, oncology, pain and psychiatry earned an upgrade to its Relative Strength (RS) Rating Friday from 79 to 82. Over 100 years of market history reveals that the best-performing stocks tend to have an RS Rating of at least 80 in the early stages of their moves.Jazz Pharmaceuticals made a big, multi-year move before running out of steam in February 2014.

193,ABBV,"The medical sector has been gaining steam in recent weeks and AbbVie (ABBV) appears ready to capitalize on the strengthening industry trends despite a recent setback. AbbVie is facing increasing competition from its rivals over its biggest drug Humira after losing a key patent battle with Coherus Biosciences (CHRS) on May 16. The loss allows Coherus to create a similar…
"
194,ABBV,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) would be better off acquiring Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) than an oncology asset like Tesaro (TSRO) or Incyte (INCY), an analyst suggested Friday as he lamented Gilead's cautious approach to mergers.XThe No. 3 biotech by market cap has shown interest in making an oncology-centric buy as it struggles with declining hepatitis C drug sales. The hepatitis C franchise brought in north of $44 billion over three years, but fell in 2016 for the first time.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says Gilead should turn away from the obvious cancer biotech buys — Tesaro, Incyte, Clovis Oncology (CLVS) or Kite Pharma (KITE) — and instead set its sights on Vertex. But, he said, it's likely Gilead will ignore that advice.""We would view an acquisition of a growing and largely de-risked revenue stream, such as Vertex, much more positively than a comparable investment, or set of investments, into the intensely competitive and technologically uncertain field of oncology,"" he said.Vertex would offer Gilead a rare disease portfolio and a robust pipeline. Vertex is now working on a triple-pill combination to treat cystic fibrosis, a lung disease. It's about a year ahead of its nearest rivals, Galapagos (GLPG)/AbbVie (ABBV), and the regimen looks likely to launch in 2020.Gilead has $32 billion in cash, meaning the company wouldn't have to stretch too much to make a transformational acquisition, Porges said. Vertex has a market cap of about $32 billion to Gilead's $92.4 billion market cap.Porges expects Gilead could pay up to $230 per share of Vertex stock and still make the acquisition accretive by year two with realistic synergies. Together with Vertex, Gilead could feasibly expand growth to 11 to 13 times that of slow-growing major pharmas.IBD'S TAKE: Big biotechs like Gilead struggled in the recent biotech rally. Instead, analysts say, keep your eyes on the biotechs highlighted in this Industry Snapshot.With Vertex in tow, Gilead could reverse its revenue trajectory from a projected decline to a 1.9% compound annual growth rate from 2017-22. The transaction would similarly improve an expected fractional decline in earnings to an estimated 5.2% growth rate over those years.But it's more likely Gilead will make a series of small transactions for relatively early-stage assets, Porges said in his note to clients. Those won't be enough to diversify Gilead from the hepatitis C ""roller coaster"" even with the help of its nascent HIV drug bictegravir.""It has been apparent that Gilead would need major acquisitions since 2015, and possibly even before then, and it is inexplicable to us that the company has been so faint-hearted in exercising their cash-flow advantage until now,"" he said. ""The company still appears to be responding to opportunities presented to them, rather than initiating and creating opportunities ahead of their availability.""Even if Gilead went after any of the obvious oncology assets, investors will question why the company is paying a premium today when the potential of those companies was apparent last year when prices were 25% to 500% below their current levels.Porges has a market perform rating and 74 price target on Gilead stock. Its valuation, he says, is at an all-time low and would otherwise justify a recommendation. But ""substantial termination uncertainty makes it hard for us to see the stock recovering its multiple in the foreseeable future.""By the closing bell on the stock market today, Gilead stock dipped a fraction, near 70.78. Vertex popped as much as 4%, though settled to be up 1.3% to 128.87. Incyte stock fell 2.2% to 125.91, while Tesaro stock lost 0.8% to 139.86.RELATED:Why The Biotech Rally Could Still Tack On Another 15% UpsideAre Sanofi, Gilead In A Bidding War Over This Small-Cap BiotechEven An Upgrade Couldn't Save Vertex From The Biotech Deluge

195,ABBV,"With names like AbbVie (ABBV) and Celgene (CELG) on a tear the past week, many biotech sector ETFs hit 52-week or longer highs.On Friday, they took a breather but retained the bulk of their big weekly gains. Most biotech funds are extended from their buy points, but several are still in or have pulled back into their respective buy zones.For instance, iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB), which rose as much as 6.5% from its 303.84 entry, eased Friday and is near the top of its buy range. The $9.4 billion fund has rallied 19% this year through June 21, according to Morningstar Inc. That's well above the S&P 500's slight one-week decline and 10% YTD return for the same period.BioShares Biotechnology Clinical Trials (BBC), up 31% YTD, is in buy range from a 24.31 cup-base entry. The $24.5 million fund is thinly traded with an average daily volume of about 12,000 shares.VanEck Vectors Biotech (BBH), up nearly 20% for the year, was waffling near the top of the 5% buy zone from 123.25 entry. The 5-year-old fund has attracted $702.3 million in assets.Analysts attributed the rally to subsiding drug-price concerns. Could there be further growth ahead?""CFRA is positive fundamentally on the biotech industry and sees strong revenue growth in 2017 aided by a robust pipeline,"" Todd Rosenbluth, Director of ETF & Mutual Fund Research at CFRA, told IBD via email. ""We have buy recommendations on ABBV, Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB), BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN), CELG and Gilead Sciences (GILD).""Those stocks all fall in the big-cap category, with market caps north of $16 billion.""We are more favorable on larger-cap biotechs and as such think IBB offers the best exposure to these stocks,"" he said. ""(Some) other ETFs offer more stock diversification and smaller cap exposure, which provides potential rewards, but also additional risk.""Leveraged ETFs, which try to magnify returns by doubling or tripling their benchmark index each day, posted double-digit gains in the week ended June 21. For instance, Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bull 3X (LABU), which seeks investment results triple the performance of the S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index, led with a 26% return, bringing its year-to-date haul to 113.9%.ProShares UltraPro Nasdaq Biotechnology (UBIO), which aims for three times the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index's daily performance, rallied 20.8% on the week for a 60.4% YTD return. ProShares Ultra Nasdaq Biotechnology (BIB) scored a 13.7% gain for a 17.9% YTD return.All three are well extended. While such leveraged plays can make for big gains when the going is good, they tend to carry higher risk than most traditional biotech sector funds.On the other end of the spectrum are inverse ETFs, which are designed to give the opposite performance of the index they track. These funds provide a result similar to shorting the stocks in the index. The four shown in the accompanying chart have seen losses as biotechs have rallied. But they'd likely outperform if the sector heads south.""We don't have a view on leveraged and inverse ETFs other than that investors can easily get hurt if they hold on to them too long,"" Rosenbluth said. ""The risks are compounded much faster than investors can appreciate.""RELATED:Can Biotech Stocks Keep Their New Lead?This Top Biotech Stock Remains Just Within Buy Range

196,ABBV,"AbbVie (ABBV) expects its biggest drug, Humira, to hit peak international sales in 2018 and then face erosion as cheaper biosimilars enter the market, an analyst said Tuesday.But UBS analyst Marc Goodman kept his buy rating and 73 price target on AbbVie stock, which closed up 0.6% at 65.84 on the stock market today, back above its 50-day line.Humira is facing biosimilar competition outside the U.S. where price declines are about 2% per year, Goodman wrote in a note to clients. Outside the U.S. remains a volume-driven business whereas in the U.S. AbbVie has more pricing leeway.As competition erodes Humira sales outside the U.S., AbbVie plans to curtail sales and marketing spending in specific countries ""commensurate with sales erosion,"" Goodman said following a meeting with AbbVie executives during the UBS Global Healthcare Conference.After hitting peak outside-U.S. sales in 2018, AbbVie expects 15% sales erosion each year through 2020.IBD'S TAKE: First-quarter earnings just wrapped for a number of drugmakers, including AbbVie.

The ETF's five-year average annual return is 15.2%, almost in step with the S&P 500's 15.3%. But over a 10-year period, SDY has returned an average of 7.95%, slightly ahead of the S&P 500's 7.1%.The ETF's annualized dividend yield is 2.4%, ahead of the benchmark index's 1.9% payout. Top holdings in the fund include AT&T (T), Target (TGT) and AbbVie (ABBV). The three companies offer annualized dividend yields of 5.1%, 4.3% and 3.6%, respectively. Also making SDY's top 10 is a longtime Warren Buffett favorite, Coca-Cola (KO), which is paying out an annualized 3.3%.Coca-Cola has formed a long saucer-with-handle base with a 46.16 buy point. The start of the pattern dates back to April 2016.SDY's top three sector weightings were financial services, consumer defensive and industrials at about 16% each. Consumer cyclicals accounted for roughly 12% of assets, followed by utilities at just under 10%. SDY's net expense ratio is 0.35%.WisdomTree LargeCap Dividend (DLN), which tracks the index of the same name, also owns Coca-Cola. It holds several other Buffett stocks such as Apple (AAPL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Procter & Gamble (PG). The underlying index is made up of large-cap stocks that are weighted by the value of the dividend the company is projected to pay the next year.Top holding Apple has come under pressure recently. The stock has been trading below its 50-day moving average the past week, following a 4% drop June 9 amid a news report that Apple's upcoming iPhone 8 series handsets will have slower data download speeds vs. rival devices on the market. It also got hit with several analyst downgrades.

199,ABBV,"Tesaro (TSRO) stock plunged Thursday on ""sticker shock"" over its planned $177,000 annual price tag for ovarian cancer drug Zejula, putting it at a 7% premium to Clovis Oncology's (CLVS) Rubraca.On the stock market today, Tesaro stock dove to a 15-week low, losing as much as 11% before settling down 6.1% to 139.01. Shares have traded below their 50-day moving average since mid-March.Meanwhile, shares of Tesaro's closest rivals, Clovis Oncology and AstraZeneca (AZN) lifted, up 1.2% and 0.4%, respectively. All three make ovarian cancer drugs called PARP inhibitors that work to block specific enzymes to kill cancer cells.Janney analyst Debjit Chattopadhyay called the reaction to Tesaro mere ""sticker shock."" Tesaro listed the monthly price for a 200-milligram, daily dose of Zejula at $9,833. At the approved 300-milligram dose, the cost is about $1,000 higher than Clovis' Rubraca.But not every patient needs the full 300-milligram dose. A total 66% of patients enrolled in an earlier study needed a dose reduction; 26% received the 100-milligram dose, 46% received the 200-miligram dose and 28% received the full dose.""If the same numbers hold in the real world setting, the blended (wholesale acquisition cost) could decline to about $119,000 (per year), below our original assumption for $136,000,"" Chattopadhyay wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Tesaro has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 48, meaning it underperforms slightly more than half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. A better biotech bet is Celgene with a leading CR of 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup to scout out your next picks.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez estimated Tesaro's price as a 7% premium to Clovis' but ""given the frequency of dose reductions, we estimate the average pricing of $10,350 per month,"" he said. He cut his price target on Tesaro stock to 158 from 186.Tesaro's Zejula launch came Wednesday within hours of news from AbbVie (ABBV) that its PARP inhibitor, veliparib, had failed in two Phase 3 trials. Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says that's because veliparib ""is not competitive with other products in this class.""AbbVie was testing veliparib combined with chemotherapy in advanced lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. So far, PARP inhibitors are largely approved in ovarian cancer. Clovis' and AstraZeneca's drugs are approved for patients with the BRCA gene mutation.""We have always considered veliparib to be of weaker potency and more limited value than other PARPs,"" Porges said in a note to clients. But ""we still view AbbVie as having the best pipeline of the slow-growing large cap biopharmaceutical stocks.""Removing veliparib from AbbVie's 2021 pipeline cuts about $500 million in sales from his estimate, Porges said. AbbVie is continuing testing veliparib in lung cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer but Porges took his expectations down to 0% that AbbVie would succeed.He cut his price target on AbbVie stock to 71 from 72.

200,ABBV,"AbbVie (ABBV) stock plummeted to a 2017 low early Friday after the drugmaker reported light Q4 sales, though earnings met Wall Street's expectations and AbbVie maintained its guidance.In the stock market today, AbbVie stock fell 2.1% to 60.01, earlier falling as much as 2.8% to 59.55. Shares last hit that level in early December and continue to trade below both their 200-day and 50-day moving averages.For Q4, AbbVie reported $6.78 billion in sales minus items, up 6.7% vs. the year-earlier quarter but missing analysts' views for $6.91 billion. Earnings per share minus items of $1.20 rose 6.2% and met the consensus.Similarly, AbbVie's $25.56 billion in 2016 sales ex items, up 12%, was short of the $25.7 billion consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. EPS minus items of $4.82 for the year rose 12% and met views.AbbVie also kept its earlier 2017 guidance for $5.44-$5.54 EPS minus items, bracketing the consensus view for $5.47, though a bit light at the midpoint. Per the guide, EPS minus items would be up 14% at the midpoint of guidance.IBD'S TAKE: A rival of AbbVie was the top growth stock in 2016. The other four were IPOs.

201,ABBV,"Gilead Sciences (GILD), Amgen (AMGN) and AbbVie (ABBV) underperformed in Q4, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges predicted Monday — the fourth analyst in a week to hammer Gilead for declining hepatitis C drug sales.In the stock market today, Gilead stock slipped 0.45% to 70.69. Shares have fallen in 10 of the past 12 trading days amid Wall Street chatter over hep C sales. Market tracker IMS says hep C drug prescriptions declined 6% to 7% in Q4 from Q3.Hepatitis C drugs Harvoni and Sovaldi brought in 36% of total product sales in Q3, declining from 58% of total product sales in Q3 2015. Those drug sales toppled 44% year over year, though Gilead launched Epclusa, a third hep C drug, last summer.Gilead is facing competitive pressure in its hep C unit, as treatment times are shortening, Porges says. He sees Gilead's hep C sales declining 17% in 2017 and then by 24% to 44% per year through 2020.""This decline is being driven by patient presentation dynamics, price, duration and share trends for Gilead and is likely to accelerate in 2017 and beyond as better competitive HCV regimens come to market,"" he wrote in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Though Gilead is expected to struggle with declining hep C drug sales, cancer biotech Incyte is poised to outperform the broader industry. Dig into The New America for more on Incyte.Needham analyst Alan Carr last week said Gilead could bulk up again on its HIV and NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) units. Porges, though, isn't as bullish. Those opportunities are arriving ""too late, with too little value,"" he said.""Our outlook for the company's HIV business remains positive, but this is not sufficient to offset the unusual dynamics of the HCV business, and the relatively modest contributions from other products offer little to mitigate the effect of the boom and bust in HCV,"" he said.Porges expects Gilead's major units to narrowly miss consensus expectations. IMS data suggest better-than-expected Harvoni sales but worse-than-expected Epclusa sales. IMS data also predict that major products from AbbVie and Amgen will miss the consensus by 1.1% and 1.2%, respectively, he wrote.Porges kept his market perform ratings on shares of Gilead, Amgen and AbbVie.He boosted his price target on Gilead stock to 91 from 89, and on Amgen to 164 from 163. He maintained his 69 price target on AbbVie.Amgen, which has formed a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 161.10, fell 1.3% to 152.72 Monday.

202,ABBV,"Drugmakers Roche (RHHBY), Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE) will likely disappoint on 2017 guidance, but AbbVie (ABBV) stock remained a ""top pick,"" Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said in a Friday research report rundown ahead of Q4 earnings.On the stock market today, AbbVie stock fell 0.4% to 61.15. IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group fell 0.9%. Both fell below their 50-day moving averages this week.AbbVie is facing pressure as Amgen (AMGN), the No. 1 biotech by market cap, preps to deploy a Humira biosimilar. AbbVie's Humira, one of the world's top-selling drugs, is used to treat an array of diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.AbbVie's patents protecting dosing schemes for Humira are set to be deliberated in court Feb. 16. A patent on administering 40-milligrams of the D2E7 antibody every 13-15 days is set to expire June 2022. But that patent will likely be upheld, barring entrants like ""first-filer"" Amgen, Holford said.IBD'S TAKE: Though low on Holford's totem pole, Merck stepped alongside Eli Lilly and Biogen in 2016, each delivering two new drug approvals. Who else curried FDA support in 2016? Head to IBD's Industry Themes for more.""We see the 135 patent as a blocking patent for all potential Humira biosimilars in the U.S., given that it is assumed that all biosimilars must be developed to be dosed at the same concentration and frequency,"" he wrote.In a worst-case scenario, Amgen could launch a Humira biosimilar in mid-2018, which assumes the ""first filer"" doesn't launch at risk in 2017. Holford sees a $4 per share downside should a Humira biosimilar launch in 2018, given consensus expectations for a launch in 2019.Behind AbbVie, Holford lists Novartis (NVS), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and AstraZeneca (AZN) as strong picks. Pfizer, Merck, Novo Nordisk (NOVO) and Sanofi (SNY) are on the opposite end of Holford's list. But he expects disappointing guidance from nearly every big-cap drugmaker.""We expect disappointing 2017 guidance from the majority of U.S./EU large-cap pharma, with Roche, Novartis, Pfizer and AstraZeneca likely disappointing on revenue guidance and Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Merck and Roche also expected by us to disappoint on (earnings per share) guidance,"" he wrote.Upcoming catalysts include data from Roche's APHINITY trial examining its Perjeta regimen in HER2 positive breast cancer. Though Holford leans toward a positive outcome, ""we sense a high degree of uncertainty,"" he wrote.Merck's Keytruda in combination with Eli Lilly's (LLY) Alimta is also piquing investor interest. The combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy was granted priority review in first-line non-small cell lung cancer this month.Holford notes the FDA accepted the application on a small data set and, therefore, the combo is unlikely to see wide use. He also sees the consensus as too bullish on the combo and as undervaluing immunotherapy combinations from the likes of Bristol-Myers and AstraZeneca in first-line non-small cell lung cancer.RELATED:Gilead 2017 Outlook Hamstrung On Hep C, But RBC Bullish On Amgen, BiogenBristol-Myers Dives On Opdivo Setback, Will Get Keytruda RoyaltiesFDA Track Record Bodes Well For Merck Keytruda Plus Chemo: LeerinkTrump's 'Disastrous' Pharma View Doesn't Rattle JPMorgan Drug Conference

203,ABBV,"The biotech industry is slated to close 2016 down by double digits, but five top performers — a cancer specialist rivaling AstraZeneca (AZN) and AbbVie (ABBV), and four 2016 IPOs — are prepping to end the year with triple-digit gains.No. 12 biotech by market cap Tesaro (TSRO) outlasted bigger rivals like Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB) to top IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group for 2016. Tesaro stock rose 157% in 2016. The group, by contrast, fell 24%.Tesaro's performance makes it the seventh best-performing stock this year, of stocks that started the year above 10 and had a minimum average daily trading volume of 10,000 shares.This month, Tesaro's won priority review from the Food and Drug Administration for its ovarian cancer drug, niraparib. Niraparib belongs to a class of drugs called PARP inhibitors. Companies are studying whether inhibiting those enzymes could be a key to treating cancer.IBD'S TAKE: Donald Trump's election caused biotech and pharma stocks to yo-yo on Wall Street, first on relief that he wouldn't battle rising drug prices, then on worry over the president-elect's pledge to take up a fight that typically had been led by the Democratic party.Tesaro's FDA win came a day after the FDA approved Clovis Oncology's (CLVS) ovarian cancer drug. Previously, AstraZeneca was alone in the market, having a PARP inhibitor approved in 2014 for some uses. Medivation (MDVN) and AbbVie, too, are testing PARP inhibitors.Dermatologic biotech Novan (NOVN) and gene therapy firm Avexis (AVXS) followed Tesaro as top performers in 2016 among IBD's biotech group. Novan jumped 146% from its September IPO at 11. after rising 6% on Friday, while Avexis stock rose 139% following its initial public offering at 20 in February.Immuno-oncology biotech Merus (MRUS) filed its IPO at 10 in May and rose 111% in 2016. On the stock market today, Merus stock fell 1.3%, though, and it remained extended from a buy point at 19.73 achieved Dec. 21.Merus competes alongside Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Roche (RHHBY) and AstraZeneca, among others, in the immuno-oncology (I-O) market. Immunotherapies target the body's immune system to help fight cancers.Reata Pharmaceuticals (RETA) also filed its IPO at 11 in May and rose nearly 100% in 2016, falling 1.3% on Friday to 21.83.Reata works primarily on anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory drugs.After the top five, then come Theravance Biopharma (TBPH) (up 94.5%), Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) (up 87.9%) and Xencor (XNCR) (up 80%).Of IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group — down 24.7% for the year — only August IPO Protagonist Therapeutics (PTGX) landed on the list of the top 100 performers this year. Protagonist stock rose 83% in 2016.RELATED:Tesaro Bolts On Ovarian Cancer Drug Win Vs. AstraZeneca, AbbVie

204,ABBV,"Medical behemoths Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB) could square off to acquire muscle biologist Cytokinetics (CYTK), while more than a dozen potential players prep for an M&A donnybrook over small-cap Adamas Pharmaceuticals (ADMS), Needham analysts suggested Friday.Biotech M&A fodder heated up this week as Allergan (AGN) announced back-to-back deals to acquire Vitae Pharmaceuticals (VTAE) for $639 million and Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA) for $1.7 billion. The Tobira deal gives Allergan a leg up in the battle against nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), where Gilead (GILD) and Intercept (ICPT) Pharmaceuticals also compete.IBD's 420-company biotech industry group has climbed to No. 10 out of 197 groups tracked from No. 173 just 13 weeks ago. Collectively, the group has a $771 billion market cap, No. 11 among all groups. The group fell 0.7% Friday, its first decline in the past eight trading days. The group was up 3.8% for the week.Needham analysts reviewed R&D pipelines, business development areas of interest and M&A activity for 26 large companies to gauge how interested Big Pharma is in biotechs -- ""an important theme in the biotech space,"" they wrote in a research report.Since 2012, Allergan, Amgen, Bristol Myers-Squibb (BMY), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE), Roche (RHHBY), Shire (SHPG) and Valeant (VRX) have been most acquisitive, buying (or prepping to buy) more than 100 companies, collectively. Shire has been most active, with 14 acquisitions.""We believe late-development-stage and commercial-stage biotech companies are particularly attractive acquisition targets,"" they wrote in a research report titled, ""What does Big Pharma want to buy?"" Peak areas of interest include oncology and cardiovascular, Needham research showed.But that may not be where Big Pharma takes its beaucoup bucks for M&A. Needham analysts suggested central nervous system (CNS) players Adamas and Acadia Pharmaceuticals, and liver disorder drugmaker Intercept could be of prime acquisition interest.Eight firms overlap in potential interest for Adamas and Acadia: AbbVie (ABBV), Allergan, Eli Lilly (LLY), Lundbeck, Merck, Novartis Pharmaceuticals (NVS), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) and Takeda Pharmaceutical.Needham lists 13 potential acquirers for Adamas, but Allergan makes particular sense considering the duo already partner on the next-generation formulation of memantine and the fixed-dose combination product Namzaric, both of which battle Alzheimer's.By year's end, Adamas plans to file a new drug application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for ADS-5102, a treatment for levodopa-induced dyskinesia -- involuntary movements -- in Parkinson's disease patients and multiple sclerosis walking impairments, Needham wrote.Meanwhile, Acadia's 11 potential suitors could be interested in Nuplazid, a drug to ease psychosis associated with Parkinson's launched earlier this year. Needham suggests Acadia could be looking to expand the label for other uses.Similarly, Intercept could draw interest from nearly a dozen potential buyers including Gilead, No. 2 biotech by market cap. On Thursday, an RBC analyst posited Intercept would continue to lead Gilead and Allergan in the battle against NASH.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks notched higher this week, up about 4% since last week.

205,ABBV,"Recent Wall Street darling Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) isn't the only potential takeover candidate among hot, or potentially hot, biotech companies, says RBC Capital Markets.In a research report Wednesday, RBC analysts list Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA), Spark Therapeutics (ONCE), BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN), Aerie Pharmaceuticals (AERI), Intra-Cellular Therapies (ITCI), Tesaro (TSRO), Incyte (INCY) and Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) -- as well as Sarepta — as top takeover contenders, all on their late-stage or FDA-approved ""blockbuster franchises.""Sarepta stock rocketed 74% on Monday after the FDA approved its drug to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the first drug approved to treat the rare disease. Sarepta stock hit another all-time high Wednesday, above 58 for the first time since March 2002. Sarepta closed up 0.9% to 56.22 in the stock market today.After the close, Sarepta announced plans to offer up to $225 million in stock to finance further trials, production and other drug efforts. But shares were little changed late.IBD's 214-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group rose 0.5% Wednesday, its sixth straight gain and touching an eight-month high intraday. The group ranks No. 8 of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 175 just 13 weeks ago.The second half of 2016 is likely to prove a rallying point for biotech stocks, RBC analysts said.""Biotech sentiment should continue to improve and investors should 'climb the wall of worry' as we get through the year and past the election, which we believe has been mostly based on political rhetoric,"" the analysts wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Many biotechs, and a fair number of stocks overall, have recently hit 52-week highs, and you can check out these stocks — listed by Composite Rating — at IBD's New Highs listing. This is a good feature to check for winning stocks.M&A furor has been heating up in the biotech sector. Over the past 10 months, four biotech acquisitions valued at over $5 billion have been announced, RBC said, along with a smattering of smaller deals. On Tuesday, Allergan (AGN) announced an agreement to acquire liver-disease drugmaker Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA) for as much as $1.7 billion.Among the big deals pending, Pfizer (PFE) is buying Medivation (MDVN) for $14 billion and in June bought Anacor Pharmaceuticals for $5.2 billion. Also, AbbVie (ABBV) is acquiring privately held Stemcentyrx for $10.2 billion.

206,ABBV,"American Airlines (AAL) could cut its annual share buybacks more sharply next year, easing from capital returns that have been more aggressive than rivals, Raymond James said in a research note Wednesday.American in the second quarter returned more than $1.7 billion to shareholders through buybacks and quarterly dividend payments. In 2015, American returned $3.9 billion in dividends and buybacks.The prediction for smaller repurchases came a day after Microsoft (MSFT) OK'd a repurchase program of up to $40 billion and an 8% dividend increase to 39 cents.Overall, firms in the S&P 500 spent $125.1 billion on share buybacks during Q2, the smallest quarterly total since Q3 2013, FactSet said. This comes after Q1 set a post-recession high.Apple (AAPL) led the S&P 500 in buybacks last quarter, followed by General Electric (GE), Microsoft (MSFT) and drugmaker AbbVie (ABBV), FactSet said in a report Tuesday.American shares fell 1.4% in the stock market today, rebounding from intraday losses as the major averages rebounded after the Fed left rates unchanged. Delta Air Lines (DAL) closed 1.1% higher while United Airlines (UAL) dipped 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: Companies have been taking advantage of low interest rates to borrow money for stock repurchases, which also help boost a company's earnings per share by thinning its supply of outstanding shares.
"
207,ABBV,"Raymond James also downgraded American Airlines to market perform from outperform due to its valuation relative to rivals and slashed its earnings per share target to $4.35 from $5.30, largely due to a new labor agreement that was bigger than expected. The firm cut its 2016 EPS target to $5.20 from $5.25.American's labor deal announced in August provides ""significant pay increases"" to 30,000 maintenance, fleet service and other employees, the carrier said at the time. Other airlines have attempted to strike deals with their workers after the oil glut in 2014 lowered fuel costs and cushioned carriers' profits.""While labor cost pressures are being felt across the industry and y/y unit cost (CASM) headwinds at American in 2017 is unlikely to be among the highest, it follows two years of above industry increases,"" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth wrote in the note.Lower oil prices prompted a wave of competitive growth that hurt unit revenue, or how much money an airline makes compared to available seats, flights and flight coverage. However, Delta and Southwest (LUV) have signaled more operational discipline could be on the horizon, potentially improving the much-watched metric.American's unit revenue is also likely to improve, and a recent credit-card deal and better results from its Latin American region are also likely to help, Raymond James added.""However, we expect similar favorable trends at its legacy peers,"" Syth said.""Additionally, following the departure of Scott Kirby, considered the architect of last year's (ultra low-cost carrier) pricing strategy, we believe investors will question American's pricing strategy moving forward,"" Syth wrote. ""We expect the roll out of a product similar to Delta's Basic Economy to remain the priority with potential upside to our estimates beyond 1Q17.""Southwest shares rose 0.2%.

Revenue rose 51% to $8.8 billion, also topping views.RBC said Facebook continues to benefit from a surge in advertiser demand, driven by newer ad formats such as video and improved ad targeting tools.Facebook stock fell 1.8% to close at 130.84 on the stock market today after briefly going positive.Advanced Micro Devices had its price target raised to 14 from 13 by Canaccord Genuity, with a buy rating.

211,ABBV,"Biotechs have a lot riding on drug data in 2017.IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group plunged 25% in 2016 after a rocky election year. Relief that Hillary Clinton lost the White House spiked the group nearly 17% in the week following the election, but those gains have since dissipated on Donald Trump's pledge to tackle rising drug prices.The group has faced challenges at its 50-day moving average since April. Meanwhile, large caps like Amgen (AMGN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are trading at 10%-15% of their no-pipeline valuations, according to RBC analyst Michael Yee. Tugging sentiment out of its 12-month low will require either M&A or strong drug data.""M&A remains a potential coiled spring catalyst if one to two companies could go into play and many large pharmas continue to be on the hunt,"" Yee wrote in a Dec. 29 research report. He sees Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA), Incyte (INCY), Tesaro (TSRO) and BioMarin (BMRN) as possible acquisition targets.Outside M&A, Yee said, there's a ""lack of material catalysts to get the sector moving.""IBD'S TAKE: Five top biotechs ended 2016 with triple-digit gains, outplaying the broader industry. Are your biotech picks on that list? Check out IBD's Industry Themes for the deeper dive.But nearly two dozen biotech companies this year are slated to post key drug trials data in just four key arenas: drugs to treat spinal muscular atrophy, drugs to treat cystic fibrosis, PARP inhibitors to treat several types of cancers and therapies to treat lymphoma.Success could turn sentiment positive for the second, but failure could weigh on many drug stocks.Spinal muscular atrophy — which results in the wasting away of muscle and can lead to early death — will see the least new data in 2017 of the four sectors, but it also will host what Yee, in a recent research report, calls the overall drug industry's ""only new real launch"" this year.Biogen (BIIB) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) teamed up to develop Spinraza, the brand name for nusinersen, a drug that targets a single RNA to treat the symptoms of SMA, Ionis CEO Stanley Crooke told IBD in a recent Q&A.Biogen exercised its worldwide rights to Spinraza in August. The Food and Drug Administration approved Spinraza in late December. It's the first SMA treatment to get FDA approval and Crooke said he expects Biogen to bring the drug to market early this year.He describes SMA as a ""diabolical"" disease that chemically denervates the body. It can be fatal in infants and progresses in toddlers, robbing them of the ability to walk, eat or breathe on their own. It affects the motor nerve cells in the spinal cord, according to Cure SMA.After Spinraza's launch, midcap Cytokinetics (CYTK) is expected to release the results of a phase 2 trial on CK-2127107, which it describes as a ""novel skeletal muscle troponin activator"" that could help treat SMA patients and others suffering similar degeneration.CK-2127107 differs from Spinraza in that it aims to slow the rate of calcium release from the regulatory troponin complex of fast skeletal muscle fibers. It's in two phase 2 trials, one examining SMA patients and one looking at patients with chronic lung disease, with trial results for the latter further in the future.Cytokinetics is a lightly traded small cap, but has an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 79 out of a best-possible 99. The stock crept into a buy zone in late December, hitting a 12.65 entry point out of a cup-with-handle formation, but has slipped to 10.60 as of Thursday's close, triggering the sell rule anytime a stock falls at least 8% from a buy point Shares rose 16% in 2016.A handful of cystic fibrosis trials are expected to wrap up in 2017 — but Vertex's ""triple pill"" has sparked the most analyst chatter. Both Yee and Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan say phase 2 data for VX-152 and VX-440 are likely to be available in the latter half of 2017 and another trial's results out sooner.VX-152, VX-440 and VX-661 are being investigated as a three-prong treatment for cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that causes mucus to collect, blocking the airways and damaging the digestive system. VX-661 is in phase 3 testing with results from two patient populations expected in the first half of the year.Yee estimates VX-152, VX-440 and VX-661 could add $1 billion to $2 billion in long-term sales for Vertex. He sees ""a fairly good chance the 'triple' will work in the second half of 2017, driving the company's growth. But, he notes that investors remain wary. Vertex stock fell 41% in 2016, but it is up 9.8% this year after falling 2% to 80.91 on Thursday.Vertex is far from alone in the cystic fibrosis game. As many as seven other publicly-traded biotechs are expected to release clinical trial data in 2017. Mid-cap biotech PCT Therapeutics (PCTC) appears furthest along, with phase 3 data for its Translarna due this quarter.The PCT trial examines CF patients with nonsense mutations. According to Cystic Fibrosis News, Translarna could potentially make the cellular protein machinery run the ""so-called stop sign in the CF-causing CFTR gene, replacing it with amino acids similar enough to allow the protein to do its work.""Clovis Oncology (CLVS) pulled ahead of Tesaro in late December when the FDA granted accelerated approval to its PARP inhibitor, rupacarib. A day later, the FDA gave Tesaro's PARP inhibitor, niraparib, priority review. The two are duking it out to rival Lynparza, a PARP inhibitor approved in 2014 from AstraZeneca (AZN).Both are deadlocked in a race to treat ovarian and breast cancer. Clovis is on track to unveil phase 3 data for rupacarib — which will sell under the brand name Rubraca — in patients with a BRCA-like mutation in the latter half of 2017. BRCA mutations are often associated with breast cancer.Tesaro's niraparib is on deck for phase 3 breast cancer and phase 2 ovarian cancer data in the second half of 2017. Niraparib has a Prescription Drug Free User (PDUFA) date of June 30, according to Biopharma Catalyst's FDA tracker.Niraparib, rupacarib and olaparib (the chemical name for AstraZeneca's Lynparza) belong to a class of drugs called PARP inhibitors. Several forms of cancer are dependent on PARPs, a type of enzyme. By inhibiting those enzymes, companies like Clovis, Tesaro and AstraZeneca hope to treat several cancers.AbbVie (ABBV) and Pfizer (PFE), via its acquisition of Medivation, also are working on PARP inhibitors.AbbVie's veliparib missed several endpoints, including progression-free survival (PFS), in a phase 2 trial of recurrent and metastatic breast cancer with BRCA mutations unveiled in early December. Phase 3 testing is underway. Veliparib is also being investigated as a treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Pfizer acquired Medivation for $14 billion in September. Medivation's talazoparib is in development to treat breast cancer with germ line BRCA mutations. But neither AbbVie nor Pfizer's PARP inhibitors are expected to have data in 2017.Ariad, Kite Pharma (KITE) and Seattle Genetics (SGEN) look poised to lead 2017 in the lymphoma battle — though as many as 10 publicly-traded biotechs are expected to present data this year on varying drugs.Next month, Kite's KTE-C19 will likely come away with ""solid"" six-month durability data in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), says RBC's Yee. That could lead to a rolling Biologics License Agreement (BLA) in Q1 and a PDUFA date before year-end.KTE-C19 belongs to a class of drugs called CAR T-cell therapies. These drugs teach a patient's immune system to fight off specific cancers. Kite's drug is being investigated as a treatment for refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma.Ariad Pharma, on the other hand, already has a PDUFA date of April 29 for its brigatinib, a treatment for anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive (ALK+) metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) resistant to crizotinib, a Pfizer chemotherapy.Though the PDUFA date is in April, first-line data won't be available until 2018-19. Competitor Roche (RHHBY) has similar data for a rival drug due in that same time frame. Ariad completed the New Drug Application (NDA) for brigatinib in October.Also in 2017, Seattle Genetics is angling for a fourth indication for its 2011-approved Adcetris. Adcetris is being examined as a treatment for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). It will also unveil the results of a yearlong phase 3 trial of Adcetris and chemotherapy in front-line Hodgkin lymphoma.Seattle Genetics is trying to establish ""a redefined front-line therapy in Hodgkin lymphoma after nearly 40 years of the same therapy,"" CEO Clay Siegall told IBD in a recent interview.RELATED:Investors Siphon Biogen, Ionis Gains After Spinal Disease Drug's OKIonis Pharma Eyes Sustainable Profitability After FDA ApprovalAmgen Plans Robust 2017 In Alzheimer's, Migraines, Oncology: CEO ExclusiveBristol-Myers Won't Seek Accelerated Opdivo Lung Cancer OK

214,ABBV,"After a typically slow stretch in late August, biotech news is bound to pick up as companies prepare for the fall season of conferences and investor days. Some of the most stock-moving events will likely be updates on key clinical trials, with several expected in September.• Celgene (CELG) is due to release long-awaited midstage trial results on GED-0301, or mongersen, a drug for Crohn's disease that it licensed in 2014 for $700 million. The drug initially sparked some excitement on Wall Street because of its strong two-week remission rate, which beat even the leading injected anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs, such as AbbVie's (ABBV) Humira, Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Remicade and Amgen's (AMGN) Enbrel. But the next data set will cover a full year and evaluate patients by endoscopy rather than just symptoms.Investors' confidence was somewhat shaken when Celgene refused to provide an interim analysis on the trial, which some interpreted as a lack of confidence in the numbers. Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote that a close inspection of earlier data also raises red flags.""If the trial is consistent with the earlier phase I/II result (on which the original investment was made), the endoscopic remission rate would be in the 60-70% range, which is well above that seen with even the best biologicals or immunomodulators,"" Porges wrote in a July 25 research note. ""In fact, our assessment of the earlier results, and the lack of CRP (C-reactive protein) response, which is a biomarker of Crohn's disease inflammatory activity, suggests to us that the result could be materially lower than the anti-TNFs, with remission rates more likely to be in the 20-30% range.""He noted that since GED-0301 is oral rather than injected, it could still find a market niche, though it would not be the mega-blockbuster initially hoped for.IBD'S TAKE: The Medical-Biotech group has been on a roll lately, rising from No. 126 to No. 20 in IBD's Industry Group Rankings in the last eight weeks. To see what other industries are hot, follow our Industry Themes column.• Kite Pharma (KITE) is expected to release headline data from Zuma-1, a phase-two trial of its CAR-T cell therapy KTE-019 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. CAR-T cells, or chimeric antigen receptor-T cells, are genetically engineered to attack cancerous cells. The trial results are crucial because Kite hopes to use them to file for FDA approval of the treatment, which could make it the first CAR-T therapy to hit the market next year.RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee estimated Friday that the study would yield a 60% to 70% overall response rate (percent of tumors that shrank) and perhaps a 40% complete response rate (tumor disappearance) based on earlier data. But in an initiation report Tuesday, BTIG analyst Dane Leone wrote that much depends on how the data stack up against results from competitors Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Novartis (NVS), which is as yet unknown.""Novartis may present pivotal data sets at ASH 2016 along with the potential for first data from J&J's CD19 bi‐specific antibody,"" wrote Leone, referring to the American Society for Hematology conference in December. ""Juno is also expected to present clinical updates from ongoing CD19 trials.""• Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) should provide a report on its ""triplet"" pills for cystic fibrosis, consisting of its already marketed drug, ivacaftor (Kalydeco), combined with experimental drug VX-661 and one of two additional drugs, VX-152 and VX-440.Another trial of ivacaftor and VX-661 alone recently failed, but it did present a clean safety profile and analysts have been expecting a triplet to be the next-generation treatment in any case.Also this month, the FDA is due to render a verdict on whether to expand the label on Vertex's already marketed CF drug Orkambi to children aged 6 to 11.RELATED:Is EpiPen's Price The FDA's Fault?

215,ABBV,"Big U.S. pharmas AbbVie (ABBV) and Merck (MRK) traded higher Friday after both reported estimate-beating Q2 results Friday, while their French counterpart Sanofi (SNY) closed virtually flat.AbbVie's quarterly sales of $6.45 billion grew 18% from the year-earlier quarter and passed analysts' consensus by $250 million, largely on the strength of U.S. sales of immunology drug Humira. U.S. sales of blood-cancer drug Imbruvica also beat expectations.AbbVie slightly increased and tightened its full-year EPS guidance, calling for 11% growth over last year.Shares finished 2.3% higher at 66.23 on the stock market today.Merck also beat estimates, though more narrowly, and raised the low end of its full-year EPS guidance range. Merck also announced Friday that its hepatitis C drug Zepatier had been approved in the European Union, six months after its U.S. approval. Zepatier sold $112 million in Q2, beating the consensus by $3 million.Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum noted that Merck's best-selling diabetes drug Januvia seems to be holding up against competition from Eli Lilly's (LLY) Jardiance. Cancer drug Keytruda beat consensus largely on international sales.""Recall Merck recently announced the success of their Keynote-024 trial in first-line NSCLC (non-small-cell lung cancer), and the attentions of investors in the coming year will focus on performance in that indication,"" Schoenebaum wrote in an email.Merck stock edged up 0.4% to 58.66.IBD'S TAKE: AbbVie ranks No. 2 in IBD's Medical-Ethical Drugs group for its solid financials and decent stock performance, but the group overall is just No. 166 out of 197 total. Check out IBD Industry Themes to take the temperature of stocks' industry groups.Sanofi, meanwhile, missed sales estimates for the quarter, though it affirmed its full-year EPS guidance. In contrast to Merck, Sanofi's diabetes franchise has been shrinking in the face of competition, dropping 7% in the U.S. and 3% worldwide.In other noteworthy news, Japan's Astellas, the marketing partner to Sanofi's takeover target Medivation (MDVN), reported its quarterly financials suggesting that Medivation's lead drug Xtandi missed its U.S. sales consensus, though globally they were in line.Medivation stock rose 2.4% to 63.98, hitting a 14-month high and edging past a 63.04 buy point. Sanofi closed up 3 cents to 42.63.

216,ABBV,"Specialty drugmaker Insys Therapeutics (INSY) popped Tuesday after the FDA approved its cannabis-derived drug for AIDS-related weight loss and nausea induced by chemotherapy.The drug Syndros is a liquid formulation of dronabinol, a pharmaceutical version of the active ingredient in marijuana. A capsule form of the drug called Marinol is sold by AbbVie (ABBV), but Insys CEO John Kapoor said in a press release that the liquid form ""is easy-to-swallow and allows for the dosage to be titrated to clinical effect. Once Syndros has been opened, it does not need to be refrigerated for 28 days.""Insys said that it expects to convert ""a large portion"" of the dronabinol market to Syndros, which it will launch sometime before year-end. The announcement continued the recent march of good news for cannabinoids, following GW Pharmaceuticals' (GWPH) positive trial results for a different cannabinoid treating epilepsy, an area that Insys is also studying.Insys stock jumped as much as 29% on the stock market today, touching a three-month high of 17.34. The stock closed up just 8.3% to 14.59, just above the stock's 50-day moving average.Last week, the stock was down some 70% from its Aug. 5 all-time high, dogged by issues related to its lead product Subsys, a form of the opioid painkiller fentanyl. The company and some of its employees have been investigated for marketing the drug beyond its indication for cancer-related pain, a serious issue since a number of people have died from fentanyl overdose, including the pop star Prince.The bad publicity contributed to sales missing estimates in Q1, falling year over year for the first time since the company went public in 2013.

217,ABBV,"With the official start of summer just a few days away, mid- and large-cap funds have turned in some of the best performances so far this year.Small caps and techs went on early break, taking a beating during the week and contributing to the market outlook's downgrade to market uptrend under pressure. But the Dow Jones industrial average has continued climbing to new highs.Leading among U.S. diversified stock funds was iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor (MTUM), with a one-month gain of 4.5% through June 13, according to Morningstar Inc. The $3.1 billion ETF boosted its year-to-date return to 18.9%, well ahead of the S&P 500's 10% advance. It's also captured an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 74, second best among the top-performing U.S. diversified stock ETFs.Other top performers for the one-month period included Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG), up 3.5%; Guggenheim S&P 500 Pure Growth (RPG), up 3.1%; and  VanEck Vectors Morningstar Wide Moat (MOAT), up 3%.Click Here To See A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2017What are expectations for earnings as we head into the second quarter?""2017 earnings momentum is strong,"" Richard Turnill, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist, wrote in a June 12 note. ""Prospects of tax reform have been fading, but depressed expectations lower the bar for positive surprises. We like value, financials, technology, selected health care and dividend growers.""He also has a positive view on overseas earnings in Europe. The European Central Bank recently maintained its dovish policy stance, he points out, lifting its growth forecasts and trimming its inflation outlook.""We see global reflation and an improving earnings outlook supporting cyclicals and exporters, particularly industrials and multinationals with emerging-market exposures,"" he said. ""We see the level of support for populism in European elections partly shaping investor sentiment.""Here are three ETFs in key asset classes that have produced big gains so far this year and in the past month.MTUM, mentioned above, came in first among U.S. diversified stock ETFs. Its top holdings include blue chips such as Apple (AAPL), Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan (JPM) and Microsoft (MSFT). Despite a heavy tech presence (31%), its biggest sector weighting, MTUM is still near all-time highs and is well extended from a February breakout and the subsequent bounce off its 50-day line.The fund, which turned four years old in April, has outperformed the S&P 500 over the longer haul. Its three-year average annual return was 14.4% vs. the benchmark index's 10.3% gain.Though tech stocks got battered recently, tech-focused funds were among the top sector performers, with social media, robotics and semiconductors making a showing. Medical tech play SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) rose 2.9% for the month, bringing its YTD return through June 13 to 21.8%, thanks in part to big recent gains from stocks such as AbbVie (ABBV) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN).The $3.3 billion fund, launched in January 2006, has produced solid returns for the respective three-, five- and 10-year periods: 14.4%, 22% and 15.8%. Shares are near a 72.68 flat-base buy point after climbing past the entry intraday Wednesday.In the foreign-stocks space, SPDR S&P China (GXC) gained 4.3% for the month, for a YTD return of 23.7%. The 10-year-old ETF, which has attracted $890.1 million in assets, counts among its top holdings Tencent (TCEHY), Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD).While recent economic data show signs that China's economy is slowing down, BlackRock's Turnill doesn't expect a hard landing.""There may be good news in China's slower growth,"" he said. ""A modest slowdown from the first quarter's unexpectedly strong 7% pace is welcome, in our view, as China rebalances its economy and downshifts to a more sustainable pace of growth less reliant on credit.""RELATED:Strategist's 3 Best Picks Include These Bond, Emerging-Market ETFsSocial Media, China Internet Stocks Fuel Top ETFs In May

218,ABBV,"Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi's (SNY) rheumatoid arthritis drug is 15% to 30% cheaper than rival drugs from Amgen (AMGN), AbbVie (ABBV) and Roche (RHHBY), an analyst said Tuesday after the duo's Kevzara grabbed Food and Drug Administration approval.Kevzara's approval comes seven months after the FDA delayed its approval on issues with manufacturing at a French factory where the drug is filled. The approval is for patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who don't respond to other anti-rheumatic drugs.""The approval came on time and with a label that more or less matches our expectations,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients. Kevzara can be prescribed alone or in combination with FDA-approved methotrexate. It is a self-administered injection.Like Roche's Actemra, which belongs to the same class of drugs, Kevzara is associated with an increased risk of serious and minor infections, liver issues and injection-site reactions. But it's also at a 15% discount to Actemra at $39,000 annually.""With discounts, (it) should offer a cost-effective treatment option for payers in this setting,"" Porges said. Kevzara costs 30% less than Amgen's Enbrel and AbbVie's Humira, which are widely prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis, though belong to a different drug class.IBD'S TAKE: Regeneron could be among those leading a biotech resurgence this year, analysts say. Head to IBD's Technology page for a deeper dive on why Amgen, Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB) aren't expected to be at the forefront of the revitalization.Regeneron and Sanofi expect European approval to come later this year and see Kevzara hitting the market in the U.S. within a few weeks. But Porges sees the drug as a minimal driver and forecasts $37 million in sales this year, growing to $456 million in 2021.A number of drug classes address rheumatoid arthritis, he noted. The field is likely to become more crowded later this year when Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) adds its drug sirukimab to the lineup and as more in a class dubbed JAK inhibitors arrive in 2018-19.""Kevzara contributes approximately 11% of our expected sales of joint Sanofi-Regeneron products in 2018, but this falls to 5% long term as expected growth of (eczema drug) Dupixent and even (cholesterol-lowering drug) Praluent rapidly eclipse Kevzara's importance,"" Porges said.The consensus forecasts Kevzara sales at $56 million this year, growing to $705 million by 2020 and hitting $1.1 billion by 2025.On the stock market today, Regeneron stock rose 0.1% to 461.37, as Sanofi stock fell 0.2% to 49.07. Shares of rivals Amgen and AbbVie were up 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively, while Roche dipped 0.4%.RELATED:Will 'Comeback Kid' Regeneron Survive Amgen's Cholesterol Squeeze?Regeneron Pops On 'Better-Than-Feared' Eye, Cholesterol Drug Sales

219,ABBV,"Coherus Biosciences (CHRS) stock rocketed to a two-month high Wednesday after a U.S. board tossed out a key patent protecting AbbVie's (ABBV) most important drug, arthritis medication Humira, thus clearing an obstacle for a similar treatment from Coherus.Late Tuesday, the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board ruled against AbbVie in a patent review and invalidated the dosing patent for Humira in rheumatoid arthritis. This increases the chance of a launch by Coherus in 2019 of what is known as a biosimilar. Like generics, biosimilars are intended to be cheaper alternatives to patented drugs, but are produced using living material rather than chemicals.Small-cap biotech Coherus and No. 1 biotech Amgen (AMGN) are working on copycats of AbbVie's top moneymaker. Humira is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, Crohn's disease and an arthritis that affects the spine.""This does not mean that Coherus or Amgen or anyone can launch tomorrow, but it does trigger a process that is likely to result in launch at least one year, and possibly two years, earlier than consensus expects,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said.Still, Porges kept his market perform rating and 72 price target on AbbVie stock. At the close on the stock market today, Coherus was up 7.9% at a two-month high of 23.80. AbbVie stock fell 2.2% to 65.37.IBD'S TAKE: AbbVie stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 88, meaning it is outperforming nearly nine in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it still trails Zoetis (ZTS) stock with a CR of 93 out of a best-possible 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for the latest.In 2016, Humira brought in $16.08 billion in sales, accounting for 63% of AbbVie's total revenue. Last year, the patent protecting Humira's composition of matter expired. So the patent invalidated Tuesday was seen as the main obstacle for biosimilars.Biosimilars can now use the same bi-weekly 40-milligram injection technique that AbbVie uses for Humira without infringing on AbbVie's patent. But AbbVie also has prevailed in protecting three formulation patents set to expire in 2022.""And since they were upheld, either a biosimilar needs to wait till 2022, or try to work around them,"" Raffat wrote in a note to clients. ""To our knowledge, Coherus has been very public about their intent to do so.""Meanwhile, AbbVie is also fending off a patent battle with Amgen. Amgen's biosimilar, Amjevita, was approved in September, but Amgen has said it won't launch amid litigation. A district court trial date has been scheduled for fall 2019.""Technically, just the act of going through district court and appeals court could drag into a 2021 time frame,"" Raffat said.Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young says the decision was simply ""a positive for Coherus and a negative for AbbVie."" She notes that Coherus is also working on a copy of Amgen's bone-marrow stimulant, Neulasta.Young questions whether AbbVie's pipeline is robust enough to offset a decline in Humira sales. Evercore's Raffat notes that AbbVie is about ""to enter a very data-rich period for its pipeline.""RELATED:Vertex Big Winner In Biopharma Q1 As AbbVie, AstraZeneca Dip

220,ABBV,"Two exchange traded funds that offer market-beating dividends are in new high ground and hovering near their buy points.SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY) climbed past a 90.02 flat-base buy point intraday Friday, before settling just below the entry. On Monday, it closed fractionally lower. The current three-month pattern began forming two weeks after a February breakout from a flat base. It advanced 2% between the two bases.X The $15.6 billion fund tracks the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index, which comprises companies that have raised their dividends for at least 20 consecutive years.SDY is underperforming the broader market this year with a 5.5% return through June 2 vs. the S&P 500's 9.9% gain, according to Morningstar Inc. The ETF's five-year average annual return is 15.8%, closer to the S&P 500's 16.3%. But over a 10-year period, SDY has returned an average of 7.6%, just ahead of the S&P 500's 7%.The ETF's annualized dividend yield is 2.5%, ahead of the benchmark index's 1.9% payout. Top holdings in the fund include AT&T (T), Target (TGT) and AbbVie (ABBV). The three companies offer annualized dividend yields of 5%, 4.3% and 3.8% respectively. Also making SDY's top 10 is a longtime Warren Buffett favorite, Coca-Cola (KO), which is paying out an annualized 3.2% of its Friday stock price.WisdomTree LargeCap Dividend (DLN), which tracks the index of the same name, also owns Coca-Cola. It holds several other Buffett stocks such as Apple (AAPL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Procter & Gamble (PG). The underlying index is made up of large-cap stocks that are weighted by the value of the dividend the company is projected to pay the next year.The fund, launched in June 2006, has attracted $1.95 billion in assets. It's slightly underperformed the S&P 500 index with YTD, five-year and 10-year average annual returns of 6.9%, 14.5% and 6.15%, respectively. DLN's annualized yield is 2.4%.Shares cleared an 84.59 flat-base entry on Friday and closed Monday a penny below the buy point. The ETF gained 4% from its prior flat-base breakout in February to the start of the current pattern in March.Checking in on Monday's ETF picks, the four India-focused funds closed largely unchanged to remain in buy range from recent rebounds off their respective 50-day lines. They are: iShares MSCI India (INDA), PowerShares India Portfolio (PIN), VanEck Vectors India Small-Cap (SCIF) and WisdomTree India Earnings Fund (EPI).RELATED:These 4 Plays Offer Chances To Ride India's Stock Market RallyMiss Thursday's Breakouts? 2 Fresh Ideas As Market Hits Highs2 ETFs On Breakout Watch Hold Buffett Dividend Stocks

221,ABBV,"Loxo Oncology (LOXO) stock defied a broad biotech dip Monday and spiked to a record high after showing its drug, larotrectinib, shrunk tumors in a number of different cancers.Shares of Loxo ended Monday's regular session catapulting higher by 43.2%, to 70.12, following the presentation Saturday during the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting in Chicago. Companies like Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche (RHHBY) were in attendance.Loxo's drug belongs to a class of immuno-oncology agents that aim to inhibit a family of proteins. Loxo is now setting up to begin a Phase 1 and 2 trial of larotrectinib after an adult with colon cancer and a child with a tissue tumor responded to treatment.But the big-cap names weren't the big winners on Wall Street. Instead, companies like Bluebird Bio (BLUE) surged. Bluebird stock got an 8.5% jump to 91.30 after it presented strong data for its drug, dubbed bb2121, for treating multiple myeloma.On Monday, Bluebird said all 15 patients in a trial of bb2121 responded to treatment with no relapses. The therapy was well-tolerated, Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said in a report. He has an outperform rating on Bluebird stock.IBD'S TAKE: Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 97 out of a best-possible 99 based on key growth metrics. It leads IBD's 431-company Biomed/Biotech industry group. Keep tabs on the industry leaders with IBD Stock Checkup.And Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) stock lifted 2.1%, at 83.65, after rival Roche unveiled the results of a yearlong test of its drugs in a specific group of breast cancer patients. The results were on the ""low end of investors' expectations,"" RBC analyst Matthew Eckler said.This bodes well for Puma, which is working on a drug called neratinib that could address the same group of patients, Eckler said. Roche drugs Herceptin and Perjeta were tested as an adjuvant treatment — treatments that are added to decrease the risk of relapse.""We now assume adoption of neratinib will be largely unencumbered by the adjuvant use of Herceptin plus Perjeta,"" Eckler wrote in a note to clients. He kept his sector perform rating on Puma stock, but boosted his price target to 88 from 60.However, Puma Bio shares closed well off its intraday high of 92, their highest since November 2015.TG Therapeutics (TGTX) stock also cut a wide berth Monday. It rose as much as 10.8%, but gave those gains back to close down 6.1%, at 13. Earlier in the day, TG had positive results of a trial with AbbVie (ABBV) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in a form of leukemia.RELATED:Dow's Merck 'Clearly Won' Vs.

222,ABBV,"Big biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) beat Q2 earnings estimates but lowered its full-year revenue guidance late Monday, sending the stock down more than 3% in after-hours trading.Gilead's sales and earnings both declined from last year, but hepatitis C drug Sovaldi outperformed expectations, while its newer cousin Harvoni came up short. Epclusa, the next-generation HCV pill that was approved in the U.S. just two days before the end of the quarter, already brought in $64 million.Gilead priced Epclusa much lower than its previous drugs, reflecting new competition from AbbVie (ABBV) and Merck (MRK). While Sovaldi and Harvoni officially retain their higher price tags, Gilead has been rebating them heavily, and it said Monday that the rebates have continued to increase.The HIV franchise was also a mixed bag, with the perennially popular Truvada beating estimates though most other drugs underperformed.The company trimmed its full-year product sales guidance by $500 million, now $29.5 billion to $30.5 billion.It also lowered its guidance for sales, general and administrative expenses while raising its research and development guidance slightly, leaving overall costs looking more or less the same. Gilead does not provide EPS guidance, but the lower sales suggests a possible margin squeeze.Gilead stock rose 2.3% in Monday's regular session, to 88.55, but shares are down 12% this year.

224,ABBV,"The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved Gilead Sciences' (GILD) latest hepatitis C pill, which the company priced significantly lower than its previous drugs.The drug, Epclusa, improves upon Gilead's previous drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni in that it treats all six major genotypes of the hepatitis C virus (HCV), both enlarging the market and eliminating the need for genotype testing. For most patients, the regime is one pill a day for 12 weeks, although patients with decompensated cirrhosis (i.e. very advanced liver disease) must take it with ribavirin, a standard generic HCV medicine.Gilead representative Cara Miller told IBD in an email that the wholesale price for a 12-week regimen of the drug is $74,760. That's down quite a bit from Sovaldi's $84,000 and Harvoni's $94,500, which raised an outcry when those drugs were launched in 2013 and 2014, respectively.The HCV business, however, has gotten more competitive since then, with AbbVie (ABBV) and Merck (MRK) both launching treatments at a significant discount. Those treatments are for genotype 1, but that strain makes up 70% of the market. Merck's Zepatier also is approved for genotype 4.Miller noted that the current standard treatment for patients with genotype 3 is Sovaldi combined with Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Daklinza, which together cost twice as much as Epclusa.Gilead has said that in the U.S. it will position Epclusa mainly as a genotype 3 treatment, as that is one of the most difficult to treat. While it may sound like it would obviate the need for Sovaldi and Harvoni, the company has engaged in extensive rebating to keep those drug competitive. Also, many patients take Harvoni for only eight weeks, and Gilead said it has no plans to study a shorter-duration treatment with Epclusa.""Despite Gilead's positioning, we anticipate some cannibalization of Sovaldi revenue for GT2 and GT3 patients and some Harvoni revenue for GT1 patients due to more friendly regimens (e.g., potential to omit ribavirin; shorter duration for GT3 patients),"" wrote Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges in a research note.Porges forecast $1.8 billion in Epclusa sales this year, jumping to $10.3 billion next year, though he expects a quick drop-off as next-generation treatments start to come out. He noted that his estimates are almost double consensus, however.The FDA approval was widely expected, but Gilead stock shot up 5.2% to 82.31 on the stock market today. Gilead stock hit a two-year low Monday below 78, as shares tumbled 6% Friday and Monday amid the Brexit vote fallout.

225,ABBV,"Biotech Tesaro (TSRO) soared to a record high in early trading Wednesday after its drug candidate aced a late-stage trial in ovarian cancer.Tesaro divided its patients, who all had recurrent ovarian cancer after responding to platinum therapy, into three groups based on the type of cancer they had. Those with a germline mutation of the BRCA gene (the one better known for its association with breast cancer) had a median progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 21 months when they were on Tesaro's drug niraparib, compared with just 5.5 months for the control arm.Patients who did not have this mutation also enjoyed a longer PFS, though not as much: 9.3 months vs. 3.9 months for the control group. Of those patients, those with homologous recombination deficient (HRD) tumors, as identified by Myriad Genetics' (MYGN) myChoice HRD test, showed a PFS of 12.9 months.Tesaro stock more than doubled to close at 77.40 on the stock market today. Myriad Genetics rose 3.35% to 30.57.The results were a bit of surprise since the class of drug niraparib belongs to, called Parp inhibitors, have a checkered history. Some previous candidates failed clinical trials, but in 2014 AstraZeneca (AZN) managed to win conditional approval for its drug Lynparza after a re-analysis of previous data.Lynparza is still on the market for ovarian cancer, though it failed a trial for stomach cancer last month. Other Parp inhibitors in testing include AbbVie's (ABBV) veliparib, in late-stage testing for breast and lung cancer, and Medivation's (MDVN) talazoparib, also in late-stage testing for breast cancer.Medivation, an IBD 50 stock, finished up 5.5% Wednesday, while AbbVie added 3% and AstraZeneca gained 2.6%.
"
226,ABBV,"Swiss pharma giant Novartis (NVS) cut a licensing deal with California biotech Xencor (XNCR) on two early-stage blood-cancer treatments that could be worth up to $2.41 billion, the companies announced Tuesday.Novartis agreed to pay $150 million upfront, with the rest in clinical, regulatory and sales milestones should the two drug candidates, XmAb14045 and XmAb13676, make it to market. The two candidates, for acute myeloid leukemia and B-cell malignancies, are both set to begin clinical development this year.Novartis will pay a royalty on foreign sales, while Xencor retains U.S. commercialization rights. Novartis also has the right to select four more candidates for development and to use Xencor's bispecific antibody technology to develop up to 10 more drugs.Bispecific antibodies are fragments of two different antibodies used to direct the body's immune system to attack cancer cells by deploying the body's T cells. It's a new technology being pursued by several companies, including Amgen (AMGN), which made its own licensing deal with Xencor in September, as well as AbbVie (ABBV) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN).""We view the favorable terms received by Xencor as consistent with our thesis that bispecific antibodies are poised to play a more important role in cancer immunotherapy,"" wrote Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt in a research note praising the ""great economics"" of the deal for Xencor.The deal also enlarges Novartis' toolkit in blood cancer. The company has been one of the leaders in developing the much-watched chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapies, its most advanced candidate being CTL019 for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Xencor stock catapulted by 32.1% at the close on the stock market today, to 16.56, after touching a nine-month high of 18.19. Novartis stock was up 3% to 79.59.

Merck and Bristol-Myers are locked in a battle over the non-small cell lung cancer market with drugs that leverage a patient's immune system to battle the cancer.Holford downgraded Merck stock to underperform, with a 48 price target. He expects strong Keytruda performance in 2017, followed by pressure in 2018 as rival drugs from Bristol, AstraZeneca and Roche chip away at Keytruda's market.IBD'S TAKE: Next year will be marked by a new presidency. What path will Donald Trump take on drug prices?""Merck screens poorly on many valuation metrics to us, and we have downgraded the shares to underperform,"" Holford wrote in a research report. In the same note, he upgraded Bristol stock to a buy, with a 69 price target.Holford expects two Opdivo trials to secure Bristol's future in 2017.More broadly, he prefers AbbVie (ABBV) and Eli Lilly (LLY) stocks in the U.S. and AstraZeneca and Novartis (NVS) stocks in Europe.He sees Pfizer (PFE), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck, Sanofi (SNY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) as the least preferred stocks.RELATED:Gilead Must Pay Merck $2.5 BillionFor Hep C Patent; Agios Stock Anemic

Shares remain about 7% below a 9.14 entry point, but are up 31% over the past 11 months. IBD's 121-company Medical-Products industry group, up 15% this year, fell 1.5% Thursday, on a day most tech and drug groups fell.Massaro kept his buy rating on OraSure stock but boosted his price target to 11 from 10 following the company's analyst day on Wednesday. OraSure didn't identify the foreign government, but said three other governments are expected to order 100,000 hep C test kits. He upped his 2017 sales view to $137 million and his model for earnings per share ex items to 25 cents from 19 cents. The consensus of five analysts polled by Thomson Reuters currently models $126.8 million and 19 cents.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech and drug stocks initially rose on Donald Trump's election, helping pull up several related ETFs.

Visit the ETF Center for the best bets under a Trump presidency.""Basically, all of our raised 2017 revenue estimate is related to the announcement that OraSure officially completed its large $18 million HCV and HIV order with a large international government that seeks to eradicate hepatitis C in its country,"" Massaro wrote in a note.The contract is for $18 million in product for a testing and treatment program to eradicate hep C within the country by 2020. OraSure will provide $16 million of OraQuick HCV Rapid Antibody tests and $2 million of OraQuick Rapid HIV-1/2 Antibody tests.Outside the hep C/HIV win, OraSure announced personal genomics firm Helix will use saliva DNA-collection devices by OraSure subsidiary Genotek in an exclusive contract. Massaro classifies Helix's decision as a major platform win for OraSure.Helix was formed in 2015 by Illumina (ILMN) to provide individual sequencing at affordable prices. It's backed by Warburg Pincus, Kleiner Perkins and others. Over the next three years, Massaro expects the firm to add thousands of new customers and perform more than 1 million tests.""For OraSure, we think Helix could become a $10 million-plus revenue-per-year customer in around five years,"" he wrote.Besides Helix, OraSure announced it is also working with China-facing companies, including WuXiNextCode, WeGene and Genesis Healthcare.But OraSure didn't announce a replacement to AbbVie (ABBV), which is withdrawing from its hep C co-promotion agreement with OraSure at the end of this month. The duo agreed to end the agreement in July. It was originally slated to run through 2019.RELATED:Amgen, Gilead, Eli Lilly Eat Into AbbVie's Humira Sales: Analyst

231,ABBV,"Regeneron's (REGN) Eylea will become the default blurry-eye drug after Ophthotech's (OPHT) Fovista failed in a late-stage trial Monday, sending that stock down to a record low, RBC analyst Adnan Butt said.Ophthotech stock plummeted 86% to 5.29 on the stock market today. Regeneron stock, on the other hand, rose 3.8% on its rival's news, retaking its 50-day moving average.The news had little impact on Roche (RHHBY) and Novartis (NVS), though. Novartis acquired the rights to ex-U.S. sales of Genentech drug Lucentis in 2003 before Genentech was acquired by Roche. Ophthotech's trial tested Fovista in conjunction with Lucentis.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech and drug stocks are underperforming a recent rally on Donald Trump's election after the president-elect said he would go after rising drug prices. Get the full scoop on IBD's Technology page.Novartis and Roche stocks dipped 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively, Monday. The duo would have split outside-U.S. sales of Ophthotech's Fovista, which aims to treat wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Ophthotech tested Fovista plus Lucentis vs. Lucentis alone.Patients on the combination regimen gained a mean 10.24 letters of vision on the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart after a year of monthly treatments. Their counterparts on Lucentis monotherapy gained an average 10.01 letters.The results weren't statistically significant, Ophthotech said. On the secondary endpoint — change from baseline — 24.2% of combination patients gained 20 or more ETDRS letters at the 12-month mark compared with 22.1% of Lucentis monotherapy patients.Following Ophthotech's flop, RBC's Butt posited Regeneron's rival treatment, Eylea, would become the standard of care for wet AMD and diabetic macular edema. Butt has an outperform rating and a price target way up there, at 626, on Regeneron stock.""Overhang was that Fovista success and approval could disrupt the market for Eylea as more doctors tried combining nearly free Avastin (off-label) with Fovista to improve outcomes with patients,"" he wrote in a research report.Still, other overhangs persist, Butt wrote. Regeneron remains in patent litigation over LDL-buster Praluent, developed with Sanofi (SNY), against Amgen (AMGN). Amgen's Repatha was approved in summer 2015 and also belongs to a class of drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors.Manufacturing concerns linger regarding eczema treatment dupilumab and rheumatoid arthritis med sarilumab, Butt noted. Sarilumab was developed in conjunction with Sanofi and could compete against AbbVie's (ABBV) Humira, currently the No. 1 drug in sales.RELATED:Ophthotech's Eye Disease Med Could Beat Down Rival RegeneronRegeneron Pharmaceuticals Falls As Combo Therapy Worse Than Eylea Alone

232,ABBV,"Drug giant Eli Lilly (LLY) is poised for a jolly December, if data and rulings come in positive.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan says all eyes are on new data for Eli Lilly's Solanezumab, an Alzheimer's disease drug that he predicts has a 60% probability of success. Legal decisions and regulatory rulings surrounding Lilly's Jardiance, Alimta and Trulicity also are expected next month.Eli Lilly stock could use a year-end bounce. Shares are down about 10% this year, falling 0.82% to 76.01 on the stock market today. IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group fell more than 1% Tuesday.Phase 3 data from Lilly's Sola is due ""any day now and definitely by year-end,"" Divan wrote in a research report Tuesday. Sola could act as a neuroprotector for patients with Alzheimer's. Its success could boost rival Biogen (BIIB), which has a similar drug in development.Divan predicts Lilly stock could soar more than 20% if Sola shows significant functional benefit, 10% if it shows a trend on function and 5% even if it shows no functional benefit. He predicts a 10%-15% drop if Sola misses on cognition.IBD'S TAKE: December could be jolly for more than just Eli Lilly. Drug stocks have rallied since the election of Donald Trump, who is seen as more business friendly than Hillary Clinton. But what happens if Trump makes good on his promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act? The outlook isn't as certain. Grab IBD's Industry Themes for a deeper dive.In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is due to make a decision in December on whether to expand the label on Jardiance, a type 2 diabetes med. The risk is ""skewed to the downside"" as most observers are expecting FDA approval, Divan said.Also, patent litigation is ongoing for Lilly's Alimta, a chemotherapy for cancer in or near the lungs. But most expect the patent to expire in 2021-22, regardless, Divan noted.Also, in coming weeks Lilly is due to release an interim analysis of a study on type 2 diabetes drug Trulicity.But the news flow won't end there. Initial 2017 guidance is expected Jan. 4 and the FDA could approve baricitinib, a rheumatoid arthritis drug in conjunction with Incyte (INCY), by mid-January, he wrote.Baricitinib belongs to a class of drugs called JAK inhibitors. Gilead Sciences (GILD) is working on a JAK inhibitor, as is AbbVie (ABBV). Pfizer (PFE)has one approved and is currently in trials to expand its use. Incyte also has a JAK inhibitor on the market. Janus kinase (JAK) is a family of enzymes. Drugmakers believe blocking these enzymes could treat certain cancers and inflammatory diseases.Editor's Note: Corrects last graph on which companies are working on a JAK inhibitor or already have one on the market.RELATED:Gilead Could Scoop Up Incyte After Cancer Drug Proves 'Not Good Enough'Amgen, Gilead, Eli Lilly Eat Into AbbVie's Humira Sales: Analyst

233,ABBV,"With an average earnings growth rate of 23% the past four quarters, AbbVie (ABBV) is an income stock with solid profits.In fact, the pharmaceutical company's 89 EPS Rating is the best among 16 stocks in Friday's Dividend Leaders screen. That's the result of a three-year average EPS growth rate of 13% and annual earnings increases of 6% and 30% the past two years. Other Dividend Leaders have EPS Ratings below 70 or even 50.AbbVie pays a quarterly dividend of 57 cents a share, for an annualized yield of about 3.5%. Since last year, AbbVie has made a rapid increase in the dividend, hiking it four times from 40 cents a share in early 2015. That's one of the highest dividend growth rates in IBD's database.But the company does have a big debt burden as it develops new drugs. In Q2, long-term debt and lease obligations totaled $37.33 billion, or more than six times shareholder equity of $5.64 billion.AbbVie's biggest product is Humira, a drug for various digestive ailments. It accounted for $2.7 billion in sales in the second quarter, or more than 40% of adjusted total revenue.A few days ago, the Food and Drug Administration warned of recurrence of hepatitis B among patients who are taking some newer medicines for hepatitis C, the Wall Street Journal reported. Those include AbbVie's Viekira Pak, which is part of a new generation of drugs that can cure hepatitis C in a 12-week course, much less time than older treatments that last up to a year.The stock has been in a long consolidation since it peaked in July 2015. It has declined as much as 36.5%, which is not at all severe for an institutional-quality stock. While the stock was volatile in the second half of 2015, when shares were in decline, it has been trading much more steadily, especially since a June low around 58. That indicates larger participation by major investors, which is ultimately a plus for the stock.AbbVie is no doubt an institutional favorite, being a holding of more than 2,200 mutual funds. That includes dozens with IBD performance ratings of A.

234,ABBV,"Medical-related exchange traded funds have racked up healthy gains this year amid the ongoing quest for longer and healthier lives.One of the outperformers is iShares US Medical Devices (IHI), which gained 20.9% year to date through May 30, well ahead of the S&P 500's 8.7% gain for the period. The $1.4 billion fund boasted a five-year average annual return of 21.6% vs. the benchmark index's 15.4%, according to Morningstar Inc.IHI, launched in May 2006, tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Medical Equipment Index. Top holdings in the ETF included Medtronic (MDT), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO). Abbott, a developer of generic drugs, disease screening systems and other products, is in buy range after clearing a 45.94 flat-base entry on Thursday.XIHI was one of three ETF picks featured in IBD last month by Oscar Pursche, chief executive of Bruderman Brothers and Bruderman Asset Management. ""As opposed to taking a broad view of the health care sector, which we do like overall, we see some great opportunities in the medical device space, to which investors can get exposure through the iShares Medical Device ETF,"" he said.He also noted that the fund's top five holdings account for nearly 40% of the portfolio, which may increase the risk profile. IHI is extended past a 152.83 buy point cleared in April.IBD'S TAKE: Find out which biotechs stand to benefit the most under President Trump's proposed tax reform in this recent tech column.SPDR S&P Health Care Equipment (XHE) returned 16.2% YTD through May 30 and 19.4% for the five-year average. The 6-year-old fund, which tracks the S&P Health Care Equipment Select Industry Index, has gathered $120.6 million in assets.Its top 10 holdings included Align Technology (ALGN), Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW), and accounted for about 21% of the portfolio. XHE is trading at record highs and is extended after two recent bounces off the 50-day line.SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI), up 14.4% this year, has an average annual gain of 21% for the past five years. The $3.2 billion fund, launched in January 2006, is forming a flat base with a 72.68 buy point. It's 2% below the entry, but still about 20% off of its July 2015 peak.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and AbbVie (ABBV) are among top names held by XBI. The top 10 holdings make up 27% of assets.RELATED:Are You In The Best Health Care ETF? GOP Moves To Replace ObamaCareBiotech ETF Rides Industry's Recovery

235,ABBV,"The ethical drugs industry group has been seeing increasing strength over the past six weeks.

Merck's Keytruda drug continues to show substantial sales growth, up 15% in April vs. the prior month. Its market share rose to 33% in the same…
"
236,ABBV,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB) would benefit the most among biotechs under President Trump's proposed tax reform, a measure that would cut the corporate tax rate by 20%.Under Trump's proposal ""no business of any size, from a Fortune 500 to a mom-and-pop shop to a freelancer living job to job, will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes,"" making corporate inversions unnecessary."" The U.S. corporate tax rate is currently 35%.That means Regeneron, Gilead and Biogen — all of which have guided to adjusted tax rates at or above 25% in 2017 — could see a serious boost in cash if Trump's proposal passes. Though, analysts say, it's all about compromise inside the Beltway, so that 15% rate is still up in the air.Trump's approval rating jumped to 39% in May from 34% in April, and he gained 7% in the IBD/TIPP Presidential Leadership Index after unveiling his tax reform proposal. It was the first month-over-month increase since Trump became president.But that doesn't mean Big Pharma and biotech are totally sold on Trump's proposal — a four-page document released April 26. Shares of biotechs and drugmakers collectively lifted less than 1% that day, though generic drug stocks popped 2.8%.Gilead Chief Executive John Milligan noted uncertainty in Washington is the norm.""So I think we've kind of learned to filter that out and focus on the things that are right for the company,"" he said on Gilead's May 2 first-quarter earnings conference call. ""There may be tax reform. There may be repatriation. But you can't count on it and you can't wait for it, either.""Trump's plan would slash the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15% from 35%, benefiting companies whose consolidated tax rates remain well above that level. Consolidating taxes allows a firm to treat a group of wholly- or majority-owned companies as a single entity for tax purposes.U.S.-domiciled drugmakers typically pay 37%-40% in consolidated taxes, Canaccord analyst Dewey Steadman told Investor's Business Daily. But companies that acquire a foreign firm can move their tax domicile outside the U.S. to the acquired company's often lower-tax homeland.When Mylan (MYL) acquired a generics manufacturer from Abbott Laboratories (ABT) in 2014, it kept its operational headquarters in Pennsylvania, but reincorporated in the Netherlands. In March, Mylan said it expected to pay a 16.5%-18.5% tax rate in 2017.Similarly, Allergan (AGN) guided in February to a 13.5% adjusted tax rate in 2017. Allergan's corporate headquarters are in Ireland. In April 2016, Pfizer (PFE) scrapped its $160 billion attempt to acquire Allergan a day after the U.S. Treasury unveiled new rules to curb inversions.Former President Barack Obama called global tax avoidance a ""huge problem"" and urged Congress to close the loophole for good. Trump, on the other hand, says his tax reform proposal would make inversions unnecessary ""by making America's tax rate one of the best in the world.""Regeneron, Gilead and Biogen would be among the biggest winners of this cut, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in an April 26 report. Regeneron has guided to an effective tax rate of 32%-38% in 2017. Gilead sees 25%-28%. In the first quarter, Biogen paid 23% in adjusted taxes.Among drugmakers, Pfizer, Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) all guided to effective tax rates between 20%-25% for 2017. Canaccord's Steadman and Mizuho analyst Salim Syed told IBD everything in politics is subject to negotiation.""Smaller biotechs say it's obviously positive for the future, but everyone is taking a wait-and-see approach,"" Steadman said. ""A 20%-22% rate is probably what's going to happen, but they're not changing their capital expenditures or organizational structure in the meantime.""IBD'S TAKE: Looking for the latest on biotech and drug news? Be sure to bookmark IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.A second facet of Trump's plan would allow the one-time repatriation of corporate cash parked overseas at a discounted 10% tax rate. This would be followed by an end to the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad.Evercore's Raffat says Amgen (AMGN) would benefit the most among drugmakers under this provision. Amgen has $34.4 billion in cash stashed overseas. That's money Amgen could use to help boost its war chest amid generic rivalries and a battle with Regeneron/Sanofi (SNY) on the cholesterol front.The same could be said for Gilead — $27.4 billion in overseas cash — which is facing dwindling sales in its hepatitis C drug franchise. Gilead had been under pressure for months amid analyst chatter that it should buy something to bolster sales. Incyte (INCY) is a likely candidate, analysts say.According to Raffat, Merck and Pfizer have a respective $21.9 billion and $15 billion in cash outside the U.S. Lilly, Bristol, Celgene (CELG), Biogen and AbbVie (ABBV) each have under $10 billion parked overseas. That cash could be repatriated for research and development, or used to fuel M&A.Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read offered a similar view as Gilead's Milligan on the company's May 2 first-quarter earnings conference call. Though he expects industry consolidation to continue over time, the political atmosphere remains a major deterrent.""I believe there is simply too much redundancy and fragmentation, both globally and in the U.S., for the sector to continually efficiently deliver medicines to society,"" he said. ""However, there is a lack of clarity on potential tax reform, health care policies of the U.S. and uncertainties in the European markets.""Canaccord's Steadman doesn't expect a wave of M&A even if Trump's tax reform passes muster with Congress. There's no need to attempt Pfizer-Allergan-like mergers for inversion purposes, he said. Though the appetite for U.S. biotechs looks healthy.""We'd see a decline in those big inversion-type mergers that were not necessarily strategic, but you could see an appetite for U.S. biotech assets just because the tax picture looks better,"" he said. ""The net result is actually a decrease in large mergers but maybe an increase in valuations for biotech, but I don't think it drives much more M&A.""There's much that's still murky in Trump's tax proposal, analysts say.""The general theme is tax reform would be a good thing for biotech,"" Mizuho's Syed told IBD. ""But we don't exactly know what tax reform is going to be. There are still a lot of pieces moving around. Repatriation? A border tax? We don't have all the components of it.""A border tax, though, could be an extreme drawback for U.S. companies with manufacturing in less expensive countries. Such an adjustment could exempt exports from taxation, while taxing imports, PwC analysts Doug Strang and Kathy Michael wrote in a Feb. 6 report.In a January speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said a tax would eliminate the tax incentives for U.S. companies to move their manufacturing overseas.""Coupled with the new lower GOP tax rates on local businesses and ending double-taxation of U.S. earnings overseas, this establishes America as a 21st century magnet for new jobs, technology breakthroughs and headquarters,"" he said. ""The GOP tax plan is already driving companies to ask themselves, 'How soon can we bring our suppliers back to the U.S.?'""For most companies, relocating their operations back to the U.S. would be a ""paperwork nightmare,"" Canaccord's Steadman said. In the current plan — which doesn't include a border tax provision — there's nothing to incentivize companies to bring operations back to the U.S.But it could be enough to keep newer and smaller companies from re-domiciling overseas, he said.""It's probably enticing future companies to not leave the U.S., I think that's the core goal of what they're trying to do,"" he said. ""If they were U.S.-domiciled at a lower rate, they wouldn't have to leave cash in a foreign subsidiary and that cash would be based in the U.S. which would encourage investment in the U.S.""RELATED:Did Gilead Just Provide Some 'Incyte' Into A Potential Deal?Dow's Pfizer Tops Earnings Views But Sales Come Up ShortHow Lilly's New Drug Could Spark A Deeper Rivalry With Pfizer, Novartis

237,ABBV,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) was the big winner Friday in the wake of a slew of biotechs and drugmakers issuing first-quarter reports Thursday.On the stock market today, Vertex rose 0.75% to 118.30 after climbing as much as 2.6% to its best level since January 2016. Meanwhile, IBD's 425-company Biomed/Biotech industry group edged higher.Celgene (CELG) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) rose 0.1% and 0.7%, respectively.AbbVie (ABBV) stock dropped below a buy point temporarily achieved Thursday at 66.89. Shares fell 0.2% to 65.94 on Friday. AstraZeneca (AZN) stock fell 2% to 30.250.For Vertex, investors are now keyed in on its triple-pill treatment for cystic fibrosis, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a report Friday. He sees an 80% chance of Vertex successfully bringing the triple-pill regimen to market.IBD'S TAKE: Navigating the biotech trading world can be tricky when relatively unknown names like Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) launch nearly 200% in mere months. Head to IBD's Technology page for a primer on the industry and which players look good for 2017.Vertex will decide on the Phase 3 strategy for the triple-regimen in the latter half of 2017. The biotech is currently evaluating four next-generation drugs to be used in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor, two cystic fibrosis drugs.Porges raised his price target to 132 from 128 and kept his outperform rating on Vertex stock. He noted investors likely prodded Vertex stock on its raised 2017 guide for cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco to $710 million to $730 million.In a separate report, Porges boosted his price target on Celgene stock to 146 from 141 and kept his market perform rating. Though a 26% miss in sales of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis drug Otezla led to an overall sales miss, Porges noted catalysts in Celgene's future.""Celgene's portfolio is undoubtedly broader than its peers,' and management appears to be focused on creating long-term shareholder value through a focus on later-stage clinical programs,"" he wrote, noting Celgene has key trials in multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, brain tumors and Crohn's disease.""We have generally been cautious in our view of the several late-stage candidates in Celgene's pipeline; however, we now expect several key inflection points from late-stage candidates in Celgene's pipeline in the next couple of years,"" he said.AbbVie ""bucked the rocky earnings season trend,"" meeting consensus views for first-quarter sales and growing revenue from immunosuppressant Humira by 23% in the U.S., Porges said in another report. Adjusted income beat by 2 cents.""Results from the other biopharma names with drugs in the immuno-oncology market have been volatile with some notable misses mainly attributed to overall market weakness,"" he said. ""AbbVie's result suggests that part of the trend may also come from share loss.""Given the solid performance of Humira, AbbVie's biggest moneymaker, Porges is more constructive on AbbVie's outlook for the year. For the year, AbbVie sees sales topping $2 billion in the U.S.Porges boosted his price target on AbbVie stock to 72 from 71 and kept his market perform rating.RELATED:Acorda Topples To 11-Year Low On Street-Lagging Q1 Sales, LossesAlexion Beats On First-Quarter Sales; Profits Top By 15 Cents

238,ABBV,"AbbVie (ABBV) stock rocketed to an eight-month high and hovered around a breakout Thursday after the top 10 drugmaker reported first-quarter sales and profits that topped Wall Street's expectations.On the stock market today, AbbVie rose 1.6% to 66.07, closing below a 66.89 buy point of a flat base that began in mid-March. Shares rose as high as 67.50 intraday.For the first quarter ended March 31, AbbVie reported adjusted income of $1.28 a share on $6.54 billion in sales, up a respective 11.3% and 9.7% vs. the year-earlier period. Analysts had modeled $1.26 a share and $6.48 billion in sales.Sales of the immunosuppressant Humira, AbbVie's biggest moneymaking drug, grew 15.1% to $4.12 billion. Humira sales were 1% above consensus views for $4.092 billion and in line with Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges' $4.118 billion view.""The pricing and volume challenges noted by biopharma companies with immunology drugs do not seem to have impacted Humira to the same degree which suggests to us Humira's formulatory position has remained largely unchanged and reduces the risk of subsequent revenue misses in 2017,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) first-quarter report was expected to have highlighted ""multiple issues"" for biotechs and drugmakers. But on Thursday, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) also delivered across-the-board beats. Head to IBD's Technology page for a deeper dive on J&J's results.Porges kept a market perform rating on AbbVie stock.Imbruvica, a cancer drug, brought in $551 million in sales, up 44.7% on a year-over-year basis. In the U.S., Imbruvica brought in $457 million, in line with consensus views for $459 million, though 6% below Leerink's forecast, Porges wrote in a note to clients.AbbVie note the FDA accepted an application for Imbruvica as a treatment in graft-versus-host disease during the quarter. Graft-versus-host disease can occur when foreign tissue is introduced into the body via organ transplants. The drug is being developed with Johnson & Johnson.The company later confirmed its 2017 guidance for adjusted earnings of $5.44-$5.54 a share, up 13.9% at the midpoint of guidance.Also Thursday, Celgene (CELG) reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, but sales came out short. Fellow biotech giant Amgen (AMGN) beat on earnings, missed on revenue late Wednesday. Celgene and Amgen fell 1% and 1.2%, respectively.RELATED:Amgen Trips Amid Rivals: Sales Miss By $100 Million, But Earnings TopCelgene Earnings Top, But Biotech's Sales MissBiogen Earnings Top As $125,000 Drug Starts Well

239,ABBV,"Biogen (BIIB) reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and sales early Tuesday, helped by a strong start to its new $125,000 drug.Consensus: The consensus was for Biogen to report $2.74 billion in sales and $5 adjusted earnings per share.Results: Biogen reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.20, up nearly 9%,  on revenue of $2.81 billion, up 3%. Sales for $125,000 drug Spinraza, the only medication approved to treat spinal muscular atrophy, reached $47 million in its first quarter.Payers are pushing back at the $750,000 first-year treatment cost. Though Spinraza is approved for three types of spinal muscular atrophy, most payers are only reimbursing costs for patients with the most severe form.Stock Action: Biogen stock rose 3.6% to close at 286.89 on the stock market today.Tysabri drug sales rose 15% worldwide, but most of Biogen's multiple sclerosis franchise showed declines. Its MS drugs will soon see competition from Roche (RHHBY). Roche's drug, Ocrevus, was approved in late March for both primary-progressive and relapsing-remitting forms of MS.Drugs from Biogen, AbbVie (ABBV), Novartis (NVS) and Sanofi (SNY) are only approved for the relapsing-remitting form of MS. Ocrevus is entering the nascent primary-progressive MS market where it is the only drug approved.Ocrevus is likely to gouge share from rivals in the second quarter, analysts have said.IBD'S TAKE: Biogen was considered a takeover last year with a strong multiple sclerosis franchise, the potential for Spinraza still in the air and a six-month span without a chief executive. Today, Biogen looks much different.

240,ABBV,"AbbVie (ABBV) will get some breathing room in rheumatoid arthritis after Eli Lilly (LLY) and Incyte's (INCY) drug was hit with delays by the Food and Drug Administration over the weekend, leaving Lilly to instead focus on a Pfizer (PFE)-rivaling breast cancer med.On Friday, the FDA asked for more dosing information for Lilly and Incyte's rheumatoid arthritis drug, baricitinib, causing what could be a lengthy delay in its release. So Lilly's breast cancer drug known as abemaciclib is now especially important for Lilly, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said.Abemaciclib could compete against Pfizer's Ibrance and Novartis' (NVS) Kisqali in the CDK4/6 inhibitor market. These drugs aim to inhibit a specific set of enzymes thought to be tied to breast cancer.""In our Lilly model, we are currently forecasting $1.5 billion global sales of abemaciclib by 2026 with the overall CDK4/6 market reaching more than $10 billion,"" Fernandez wrote in a note to clients.Fernandez said abemaciclib could be the next major catalyst for Lilly's stock. Phase 3 data on abemaciclib is expected in June.""We believe abemaciclib's ability to dose continuously together with a safe and manageable tolerability profile likely will make abemaciclib highly competitive with Novartis' Kisqali — and provide opportunities to differentiate from Pfizer's Ibrance on secondary efficacy measures like response rate,"" Fernandez said.The analyst kept his outperform rating and 91 price target on Lilly stock.Lilly shares toppled as much as 5.6% on the stock market today, closing down 4.1% to 82.38, below its 50-day ling and a 83.34 buy point. Incyte stock tumbled 10.5% to 126.07. The delay on baricitinib means it likely won't get FDA approval until 2018 and launch until 2019. That removes a near-term rival for AbbVie's Humira. It also puts Lilly/Incyte seven to eight years behind Pfizer's Xeljanz, and more in line with generic-like competition.Analysts expect the drug to be delayed at least a year, and shares of Lilly and Incyte toppled early Monday. Baricitinib already has been approved for use in Europe.While baricitinib is likely delayed, Fernandez expects $1.7 billion in peak U.S. sales when it is approved. And Lilly still benefits from sales in Europe where the drug has attained approval.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's 43-company Ethical-Drugmakers industry group has risen to No. 150 out of 197 groups tracked from No. 184 just four weeks ago. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the top-rated drugmakers.Other analysts agreed on the one-year delay for baricitinib, but were more cautious on Lilly's breast cancer drug. BMO analyst Alex Arfaei called abemaciclib ""the biggest remaining uncertainty for Lilly in 2017."" He sees the data as likely to disappoint.""We still have not seen much data that would indicate CDK4/6 inhibitors are meaningfully differentiated,"" he wrote in a report. ""Data from (the American Association for Cancer Research) 2017 suggests abemaciclib is not as selective as ribociclib (Kisqali) and Ibrance.""Arfaei cut his price target on Lilly stock to 71 from 73, though he maintained his forecast for 5% sales growth for Lilly in 2017 on its diabetes drugs Trulicity, Jardiance and Basaglar, and psoriasis drug Talz.These drugs ""should offset the decline of mature franchises,"" he wrote. ""However, from 2015-20, we forecast revenue compound annual growth rate of 4%, below Lilly's guidance of 5% partly because more conservative assumptions for the mature franchises.""RELATED:Eli Lilly, Incyte Stocks Break Key Levels After FDA Drug SetbackHow Biogen's Takeover Prospects Soured In Mere MonthsBiotechs Split: Axovant Rides CEO Swap, But Celgene Partner Dives

241,ABBV,"Drug stocks toppled to a five-month low Tuesday after Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) reported first-quarter pharma sales that only advanced 0.8%, offering a weak harbinger for the sector.In late afternoon trading on the stock market today, IBD's 43-company Ethical Drugs industry group was down a fraction after earlier losing as much as 1.4%, touching a low not seen since November.Biotech stocks were less injured, but were still down 1.2% after collectively losing as much as 1.8% after J&J reported light first-quarter sales, despite a 6-cent beat on the bottom line.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says J&J's results highlight ""multiple Q1 issues for large biotechs."" Worldwide pharma sales of $8.25 billion grew just 1% vs. the year-earlier quarter and missed expectations by 1%.International drug sales beat by 2%, but U.S. pharma sales missed by 5%, Porges wrote in a research report. Oncology sales led growth while legacy products — Remicade, Stelara and Xarelto — offset volume declines or low growth with price hikes.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), AbbVie (ABBV) and Celgene (CELG) — which derive a large portion of sales from international markets — should benefit if J&J's worldwide pharma growth is reflected across the sector. Porges has an outperform rating on Alexion stock and market perform ratings on AbbVie and Celgene stocks.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Ethical Drugs industry group is now ranked No. 161 out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 182 just 13 weeks ago. But the biotech industry group is performing much better, ranked seventh this week. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the strongest stocks.But higher utilization of independent patient assistance programs, timing of Medicare Part D costs and higher drug access discounts will leave Celgene and Amgen (AMGN) vulnerable among biotechs, Porges said, citing commentary by J&J. He has a market perform rating on Amgen stock.""While pricing power appears to remain strong, J&J did report that lower prices in government managed care channels impacted annual comparisons,"" he wrote. ""We do not anticipate that these issues will be isolated to J&J alone, but should impact the broader biopharma industry.""For drugmakers, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat noted J&J's struggle in its diabetes unit — Invokana sales were down 17% year over year — could be reflected in Eli Lilly's (LLY) diabetes franchise. Though Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez earlier said the unit could help Lilly overcome struggles with its rheumatoid arthritis drug.Raffat noted pricing pressure for cardiovascular drug Xarelto could be reflected in Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Eliquis. Xarelto sales fell 9.5% vs. the year-earlier period.As a silver lining, J&J reported 56.7% year-over-year growth for Imbruvica, a cancer drug in partnership with AbbVie. The companies are now looking to have Imbruvica approved to treat patients suffering from graft-versus-host disease — which can occur when foreign tissue is introduced into the body via organ transplants.RELATED:Dow's Johnson & Johnson Sets Up Lackluster Results For SectorCan Lilly Survive Rheumatoid Arthritis Flop With Breast Cancer Drug?

242,ABBV,"Eli Lilly (LLY) and Incyte (INCY) shares plunged Monday morning after the Food and Drug Administration failed to approve their rheumatoid arthritis drug baricitinib, saying more data are needed.Eli Lilly and Incyte ""disagreed"" with the FDA's Friday decision, which came somewhat as a surprise after European regulators approved baricitinib in February. If Lilly and Incyte have to conduct more clinical trials to satisfy the FDA, the delay could set their drug behind several rivals.Lilly reaffirmed its earnings and sales guidance for the year, while Incyte will discuss the matter in its Q1 conference call.Eli Lilly fell 4.1% to close at 82.38 on the stock market today. Eli Lilly has fallen below an 83.34 buy point cleared in early March.Incyte tumbled 10.5% to 126.07, plunging through its 50-day moving average.The setback for Lilly and Incyte is good news for Dow Jones industrial average component Pfizer (PFE), which has the only oral JAK inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis on the market, Xeljanz. Gilead Sciences (GILD), has a similar oral drug to baricitinib in Phase Three trials. Fellow Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), AbbVie (ABBV) and Amgen (AMGN) have injectable drugs.Pfizer, Gilead, Amgen, Johnson & Johnson and AbbVie rose less than 1% in morning action.

"
244,ABBV,"Drug giants Eli Lilly (LLY) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) both face key Food and Drug Administration actions this Tuesday that will affect the future of their leading disease-treatment franchises.An advisory committee to the FDA will meet to discuss expanding the label of Jardiance, Lilly's 2-year-old drug for treating type 2 diabetes. What Lilly wants to add to the label is that the drug also reduces death by cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, and the risk of death in general.Those claims are based on a large, long-term trial called EMPA-REG, the results of which surprised the industry last year. Patients on Jardiance showed a 38% reduction in death from cardiovascular causes, a 35% reduction in hospitalizations for heart failure, and a 32% cut in deaths from all causes. If the FDA approves the label expansion, Lilly's sales reps will be able to use this in marketing the drug.The problem, according to Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez, is that those were not the primary endpoints of the trial; they were secondary, ""exploratory"" endpoints. The primary endpoint was a three-point measurement of major adverse cardiac events (MACE): the time to the first cardiovascular-related death, non-fatal heart attack and non-fatal stroke. On that, results were more mixed: Only on the first point did Jardiance achieve a statistically significant difference, while the non-fatal stroke incidence was actually slightly higher than in the placebo group.When the FDA released its briefing documents for the panel Friday morning, in fact, the conclusion affirmed that the study does show a reduction in CV death, but advised against including the MACE, heart-failure and all-cause death info on the label. This was nonetheless interpreted positively by analysts, and Lilly stock was up 0.5% on the stock market today despite the general Brexit sell-off.""The panel also consists of a substantial portion of cardiologists, which will help tilting the balance towards highlighting the CV benefit during the panel, in our view,"" Fernandez wrote in a research note Friday. Previewing the event on June 2, Fernandez had predicted the panel would be ""a battle of 'statistical purists' vs 'clinicians,' "" adding that ""clinically, the large and consistent CV death benefit seen in the EMPA-REG trial is viewed to be precedent-setting.""That precedent will also be of interest to Novo Nordisk (NVO), which recently reported that a similar study of its diabetes drug Victoza also brought a reduction in cardiovascular deaths, though not to the extent that Jardiance did. Novo Nordisk has said that it will also file for a label addition but hasn't yet decided on the language. The Danish diabetes specialist fell 4.4% Friday.Tuesday will also be the deadline for the FDA to decide whether to approve Gilead's latest hepatitis C pill. Gilead's last two hepatitis C launches, of Sovaldi and Harvoni, broke financial records, but those were restricted to certain genotypes of the virus. The new pill would be approved for all genotypes, not only enlarging the market, but also removing the need to test the patient's genotype before writing a prescription.Wall Street has no doubt that the FDA will approve the drug, but the interesting question is how Gilead will price it. When it launched in December 2013, Sovaldi gained notoriety for its price of $84,000 for a 12-week regimen, while Harvoni (launched in October 2014) was more than $94,000.However, when AbbVie (ABBV) launched its competing Viekira Pak in December 2014, the two companies started a rebating war that hit Gilead's income.Then this January, Merck (MRK) priced its new HCV drug Zepatier well below both, which both Gilead and AbbVie acknowledged hit their Q1 financials. It remains to be seen how Gilead values the pan-genotypic nature of the new drug.Gilead stock was down 3.5% Friday, hitting a 2-year low. AbbVie sank 2.4% and Merck 3.1%
"
245,ABBV,"Jerry Dodson's Parnassus Endeavor Fund (PARWX) proves that you can have your socially responsible cake and eat it too.The $1.5 billion mutual fund favors companies that provide employees with ""outstanding workplaces."" So do the five other funds at Parnassus Investments, which Dodson founded in 1984. That includes things like offering workers profit-sharing, time off for working parents, paid time off for volunteer work, fair treatment and clear communication.The investment team at Parnassus, which has $16.5 billion under management, also screen out companies engaged in the extraction, exploration, production, manufacturing or refining of fossil fuels.None of those criteria have prevented Endeavor from outperforming its peers or the broad market in the past 10 years.It is the top-performing environmental, social and corporate-governance (ESG) fund over the 10 years ended June 30, with an 11.57% average annual return in that decade, says Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500 averaged a 7.42% yearly gain in that span.The fund also ranks in the top 1% of all large-cap growth mutual funds in that period and the top 2% over the past five years.And it is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, glowing in three categories — U.S. equity funds, growth funds and large caps. It outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.Through Q2, it was ahead of roughly 42% of all U.S. diversified stock funds so far this year.Dodson's affinity for ESG investing has deep roots. He founded Parnassus Investments at the age of 41 with those goals in mind. Earlier work was a harbinger of what was to come: A political science major as UC Berkeley, he got his MBA from Harvard Business School in 1971, then went on to work for a nonprofit outfit that helped minority-owned businesses. He helped organize Continental Savings of America, becoming the president and CEO of the S&L, which developed an innovative product for depositors to invest in solar energy projects.Dodson is lead manager on Parnassus Fund (PARNX) and Parnassus Asia Fund (PAFSX) and sole manager of Endeavor. From his office in San Francisco, 73-year-old Dodson talked with Investor's Business Daily about the ins and outs of his investment approach and how he began to use social screens.IBD: You're juggling two tough tasks: You not only use ESG criteria, you also run a concentrated portfolio. Which is tougher?Dodson: You know, the hard part was getting the philosophy and tweaking it with simulations, which was done over many years. Once we understood the strategy would work, the size of the portfolio just followed.You'll be surprised that we took advice from a journalist (about the size and strategy). I was social friends with Milton Moskowitz, who was writing a news story that started as a book. It was about the 100 best places to work.I looked at the returns of the 50% to 60% that were publicly traded ... and thought I should start a fund based on that. Milton thought I should stick with 100 companies. I disagreed. He said I'd screw it up.Anyway, it took years (of looking for fundamental metrics that correlated to good stock performance). It took about two years of back-testing on paper, then five more years of running the portfolio (before opening it to the public).IBD: Aside from ESG criteria, it looks to me as if you seek large-cap companies with wide moats or strong competitive advantages, and quality management teams that act in the best interests of shareholders. Have I got it right?Dodson: That's it, succinctly.IBD: Information technology is your largest sector, with a 50% weighting as of March 31. Is that a typical exposure to tech?Dodson: It's usually been our largest sector, but not 50%. Normally it's around 30%. The reason is that we know the sector well. Silicon Valley is down the road from us and more and more right here in the city.Also, in terms of workplace, technology companies seem a step ahead in providing a good environment. Google -- Alphabet (GOOGL) now -- has generous maternity leave, a gym where you can work out, days off for doing charitable events.Compared to, say, the steel industry, workplace issues score stronger at tech companies.IBD: Speaking of Alphabet, it's been trending sideways since late April. Do you still like the stock?Dodson: We started buying at 525 in December 2014. Now it's up to (the low 700s). We think it will make more gains. But you're right, it's been pretty flat. We regard it as a long-term holding. It's got a great moat and a good social story.IBD: Why do you think it has more room to run?Dodson: Primarily because of its moat, and it's looking to develop new products. It has a huge cash stake, a talented workforce. Its search engine gives them (revenue and earnings) stability. I don't know what new ideas they're working on, but I know they're looking for new products and they'll find something.IBD: In general, you emphasize some ESG criteria more than others, right?Dodson: We are more focused on the workplace, how a company treats employees. Then the environment. Workplace is a component of ""social.""IBD: How is workplace part of ""social""?Dodson: The word ""social"" covers a lot. For us, it means how a company treats its employees. It can mean safety record, privacy policy, relationship to the community where the company operates, diversity programs and good, clear, honest communication.IBD: Do you ever invest in a stock because its E, S or G features are very attractive, even though its financial performance is not so bright?Dodson: In the past we've done that. I did it before Endeavor Fund, with Parnassus Fund (PARNX). The stock was Control Data (a supercomputer company). They would hire former prisoners, do great social things. But the business strategy was just OK. We invested, and it was one of the worst mistakes I ever had. It cured me of picking for environmental or social reasons alone.IBD: Let's talk about individual holdings as of your latest disclosure. Citrix Systems' (CTXS) earnings per share rose 51% and 82% the past two quarters. A lot of people think the enterprise software developer, specializing in desktop virtualization, lost its focus. It's in a reorganization that has involved layoffs of staff and contractors. How does this situation look to you?Dodson: The reason we invested was because of their GoToMeeting app (which is being spun off). GoToMeeting is similar to Citrix's XenApp. You can be thousands of miles away from your server, doing applications, and you can use it on your smartphone or laptop, and it delivers it safely on your mobile device. That's what makes them successful. People want applications, this company delivers them where you want.IBD: Your stake in Applied Materials' (AMAT) is up. Are you satisfied with their progress?Dodson: It was in the doldrums when we initiated a position in May 2009 at 11.22. Equipment used to make semiconductors tends to be volatile. Sales and earnings are very cyclical. We tried to buy at a time when the stock had fallen off, then ride it up. Now it's (rising). We believe Applied will benefit from significant order growth with its leading etch and deposition tools.IBD: Ciena's (CIEN) earnings per share have slowed from 625% growth three quarters ago to 50% growth and a 3% decline the past two frames. Everything OK there?Dodson: We've owned it quite a while. It's more volatile than we expected. It makes communication glass wires, equipment that moves impulses, whether they are voice or data, along transmission lines. Earnings have been lumpy because any time you have an equipment maker, it has ups and downs. We've held it through cycles. It's more volatile than we expected. But we like the company, and we think it has more upside.IBD: Why do you own C.H. Robinson Worldwide (CHRW)? It's not a tech story. And revenue has declined three quarters in a row.Dodson: It's a freight forwarder, focusing on trucking. You're right. It hasn't done well. That's primarily because shipping has not picked up as much as anticipated. The economy is growing (at an annualized rate of) 2% or less. To get trucking and freight forwarding growing, the economy has to grow more. So it's a play that the economic recovery will accelerate. But our average cost is 55. The stock is in the mid-70s, so we've done well.IBD: Charles Schwab's (SCHW) EPS grow has accelerated for two quarters, but share price has been weak. What's your play here?Dodson: We're tied in to them. We pay Schwab if customers come in through them.But the key? A lot of brokerage firms, including Schwab, collect interest on margin loans. With interest rates so low, they don't make much. But if interest rates increase, then there's a huge earnings increase for Schwab. It's in the mid-20s now. It would go to the 40s.If our economy gets better, rates will go up and Schwab will take off.IBD: Intel's (INTC) EPS growth is speeding up. Where's the growth for their computer chips coming from?Dodson: They make chips for personal computers, smartphones and other applications. They also make chips for servers. Those sales are going up.They've been trying for years to get into the mobile (devices) market. They finally have semiconductors going into the iPhone. They're trying to get more into communications and other growth areas. With this Apple (AAPL) chip and other missions, that's what we're banking on to move Intel higher.IBD: Procter & Gamble (PG) is the classic defensive stock. But revenue per share has declined for eight quarters. Is this what you want?Dodson: You're right about revenue declining. They've got these amazing brands: Crest, Tide, Gillette, Head & Shoulders. But they need a new growth engine. We're looking at it. Does it have growth ahead? We haven't reached a conclusion.IBD: IBM (IBM) EPS is down four straight quarters. Sales are down 16 frames in a row. Why invest in it?
"
246,ABBV,"Dodson: My only defense is that Warren Buffett owns a lot more than I do. I first bought it at the end of 2013. I expected it to turn around as they cut emphasis on hardware. At some point, growth in (consulting and) software will offset declines in hardware. But it hasn't happened yet. At 10.7 times (forward) earnings, we believe share price is on the bargain table.IBD: Is Buffett selling?Dodson: No. We look when there's a filing, but we've seen no sign of (Buffett selling). I'm sure he's having the same regrets I have.IBD: W.W. Grainger's (GWW) EPS and sales finally notched gains after declining for two quarters. But shares are not making headway.Dodson: Grainger makes everything under the sun (for maintenance). This in some sense is a play on the overall economy. If the U.S. economy can grow fast enough, Grainger will do well because its products touch almost every sector of the economy.IBD: Gilead Sciences' (GILD) EPS and revenue growth have slowed in recent quarters. Do you still like this stock?Dodson: I was expecting sales to increase quite a bit for their hepatitis C product. But they had to cut prices because of competition. Both AbbVie (ABBV) and Merck (MRK) make therapies for hep C. Gilead is a great lab. They will develop new therapies. In time, the company should do well.IBD: This fund began with a different name. Why the name change, Jerry?Dodson: The way we pick stocks hasn't changed. We started out as the Workplace Fund. We had good performance early on, but the name Workplace Fund was not getting the attention we thought it should.People on our staff said we got strange reactions from brokers and advisors, who weren't sure what the name meant. ""Why not pick a more general name?"" they said. They said that would get more shareholder money, more acceptance.IBD: And why is the fund concentrated?Dodson: Primarily because I can't find enough companies that are undervalued that meet the workplace and social criteria.IBD: The fund has 25 names. How typical is that?Dodson: We would like to have 35 to 40 names. We're looking for more. The last couple years we went down to 25 or so.IBD: The fund had an 11% cash weighting as of May 31. Was that because it's hard to find your kind of stocks?Dodson: That's correct. I try to stay as fully invested as possible.IBD: Jerry, make my day: Before running this fund, did you run a totally non-PC fund -- you know, one that only invests in ammo, tobacco, oil?Dodson: Before Endeavor, I managed each of six (including one that no longer exists) other Parnassus funds prior to finding a manager for each of them. I founded Parnassus Investments in 1984. Prior to that, I worked for six years as president of a small bank in San Francisco. Before that, I spent four years as a foreign service officer with the Department of State, serving in Panama and Vietnam.IBD: What was your investment style before you embraced ESG?Dodson: We've embraced ESG since the firm was founded. It was one of our founding principles.IBD: What got you into ESG?Dodson: My personal philosophy had always revolved around ESG, but I wasn't sure it could be used as a business philosophy. At Continental, I started a program to allow savers to put their money into special savings accounts that would be lent out for solar energy installations. Much to my pleasant surprise, the program was very popular.It convinced me that there was a market out there for investors who wanted to make a positive impact with their money. This led to the founding of Working Assets Money Fund (1983-1984), which took ESG factors into account in investing in money market securities.This, in turn, led to the formation of Parnassus Investments.I took the ESG from my experience, then added the value-oriented philosophy of Benjamin Graham, whose writings I admired. These two strains formed the basis of the Parnassus investment philosophy.IBD: How did you come up with the Parnassus name?Dodson: I lived on a street near Parnassus Avenue in San Francisco. I looked up the mythology around Mount Parnassus in Greece and discovered it was the site of the Oracle of Delphi. I liked the image of the oracle often going against the prevailing wisdom. It fit my contrarian, value-oriented investment philosophy.IBD: Since you're 73, do you have plans to retire?Dodson: I plan to retire as chief executive officer in 2018 at 75. However, I plan to stay on indefinitely as manager of Endeavor until I find someone well-qualified to take over.

247,ABBV,"Big pharma AbbVie (ABBV) tumbled on the stock market today, as so-so data on its newly acquired cancer drug sparked a downgrade.On Sunday at the annual American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting, researchers presented early-stage data on Rova-T, a drug being developed by Stemcentrx, which AbbVie agreed to acquire in April for $5.8 billion. The study treated patients with recurrent/refractory small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) showing high expression of the biomarker DLL3.AbbVie said that 39% of patients showed tumor shrinkage, while 32% were alive after a year, with the median overall survival (OS) being 5.8 months. This is significant, given that the five-year survival rate of SCLC is only 5%. Still, the results compared unfavorably with the 7.7-month OS of another study combining Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) drugs Opdivo and Yervoy, although the latter had toxicity issues.""Similar to chemotherapy, Rova-T appears to deliver responses that are transient and don't translate into long-term survival benefits,"" wrote Cowen analyst Steve Scala in his note downgrading AbbVie stock to market perform from outperform. ""In contrast, (the Bristol-Myers combo) showed more durable responses with early signs of OS-curve flattening.""AbbVie fell 3.35% to 62.86 on the stock market today, undercutting a recent 63.97 buy point. AbbVie stock broke out last week, reaching a 9-month high of 65.37 on Friday intraday, reflecting high expectations for the Rova-T data, according to analysts.Bristol-Myers Squibb stock rose 1.9% to 74.29, soaring to a long-time high of 75.12 after consolidating for several weeks. Bristol-Myers cleared a consolidation on April 28.

249,ABBV,"French drugmaker Sanofi (SNY) and Danish pharmaceutical firm Novo Nordisk (NVO) saw their stocks diverge sharply Friday on the firms' differing outlooks for declining insulin prices in the U.S. as American drugmaker AbbVie (ABBV) toppled on its $130 million Q3 sales miss.Novo Nordisk stock plunged 13% to close at 35.66 on the stock market today, splitting from Sanofi stock which instead rose 4.3% to 38.84, on a sweeping Q3 beat and upbeat 2016 guidance. AbbVie stock fell 6.3% to 57.60.For Q3, AbbVie reported $6.43 billion in sales and $1.21 earnings per share ex items, up 8% and 7%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. EPS topped the consensus of analysts polled by FactSet for $1.20, but sales missed the $6.56 billion model.AbbVie's immunosuppressant Humira brought in $4.06 billion in sales, up 11% year over year, but missed consensus expectations by $100 million, Evercore analyst John Scotti wrote in a research report. Late Thursday, rival Amgen (AMGN) reported light sales of Enbrel, a competing immunosuppressant, he noted.AbbVie also narrowed its full-year view to $4.80-$4.82 EPS minus items -- which still brackets analysts' $4.82 model -- and increased its quarterly dividend to 64 cents from 57 cents, up about 12%, beginning in February 2017.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group has seen slightly better days, toppling to No. 159 out of 197 groups tracked from No. 126 just four weeks ago. But other sectors are on the precipice of a rebound. Keep tabs on the Industry Snapshot to find out which industries are heating up and which could already be red hot.Sanofi and Novo Nordisk diverged Friday on Q3 results. Sanofi boosted its 2016 EPS view and announced a 3.5 billion Euro repurchase program by the end of 2017. Novo, on the other hand, expects low-single-digit growth in total 2017 sales.Novo acknowledged declining insulin sales and prices in the important U.S. market. Insulin sales declined 1% in the U.S. during Q3. For 2016, Novo now expects 5% to 6% growth in local currencies on robust sales of diabetes treatments Victoza and Tresiba.But Novo also will contend with ""contract loss in the USA for NovoLog and NovoLog Mix 70/30, the loss of exclusivity for products within hormone replacement therapy in the USA, further intensifying competition within diabetes and biopharmaceuticals especially in the USA,"" the company said in its press release.For Q3, Novo reported sales of DKK (Danish krone) 27.54 billion (roughly $4.1 billion) and $3.87 EPS minus items, up a respective 2.7% and 19% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Sales missed the consensus of analysts polled by FactSet for sales of DKK 28.03 billion ($4.2 billion), but EPS ex items beat the $3.79 view.However, Sanofi topped analysts' Q3 expectations with 9.65 billion euros (roughly $8.8 billion) in sales, up 3% vs. last year, and $1.79 EPS minus items, up 11% year over year. Analysts polled by FactSet had broadly modeled 9.46 billion ($8.6 billion) euros and $1.61.Based on the strong Q3, Sanofi expects total EPS to grow 3% to 5% at a constant exchange rate in 2016.RELATED:Eli Lilly, AbbVie Top 2017 Rankings; Pfizer, AstraZeneca Flailing

250,ABBV,"Eli Lilly (LLY), Pfizer (PFE) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are chipping away at AbbVie's (ABBV) Humira sales, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said Monday after AbbVie missed Q3 expectations Friday, primarily on declining Humira sales.Divan downgraded AbbVie stock to neutral and cut his price target to 60 from 70. He models immunosuppressant Humira pulling in $18.1 billion in 2018 sales, declining to $11.3 billion and $5.2 billion in 2022 and 2025, respectively.Humira accounted for 63% of AbbVie sales in Q3. The drug is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and irritable bowel disorder — markets where branded rivals are already on the market and biosimilars are pressuring AbbVie's patent on Humira.AbbVie is working to protect that patent, but Divan expects Amgen (AMGN) and others to have biosimilars on the market by 2022.""Whether it is in 2020, 2021, 2022 or some other year, at some point Humira will start to decline,"" Divan wrote in his research report. To cope with Humira's decline (it missed Q3 expectations by $100 million), AbbVie has eight late-stage drugs capable of bringing in $25 billion to $30 billion in combined sales.IBD'S TAKE: AbbVie's earnings have grown an average 20% over the past five quarters, but have also declined for the last three periods. Get the full scoop in IBD's Income Investor.Pfizer, Eli Lilly/Incyte (INCY) and Gilead are all working on a class of drugs called JAK inhibitors that could compete in arthritis.Celgene (CELG), Novartis (NVS) and Eli Lilly have IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors for psoriasis, and all three expected to become blockbuster drugs within five years of their launches.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) already has a JAK inhibitor and is in the IL-23 field. AbbVie has its own IL-23 drug in development, but ""it will be entering into a crowded market where it will have more competitive and pricing challenges,"" said Divan.In the irritable bowel disorder market, Celgene's mongersen and ozanimod could put pressure on Humira sales as soon as 2020-22, Divan wrote.But UBS analyst Marc Goodman says the pressure on AbbVie stock is overdone. Shares touched a seven-month low Friday after AbbVie reported its Q3 earnings, which fell 6.2%. In the stock market today, AbbVie stock fell 3.2% to 55.78.Goodman kept his buy rating and 73 price target on AbbVie stock, though the company's 2017 earnings guidance for 13%-15% growth in 2017 implied $4.43-$5.53, which was lower than Wall Street's $5.62 view.Still, Goodman wrote that ""based on management's commentary on Humira volume and pricing, we think the concerns appear overdone. The earnings for next year are a little light, but we think the investment in the pipeline should drive growth in the longer term.""RELATED:Eli Lilly, AbbVie Top 2017 Rankings; Pfizer, AstraZeneca Flailing

251,ABBV,"Eli Lilly (LLY) and AbbVie (ABBV) topped a Credit Suisse evaluation of pharmaceutical companies heading into 2017, leaving more challenged Pfizer (PFE), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) in the dust.But the PharmaValues 2017 list did little for IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group, which fell a fraction on the stock market today, a fifth consecutive down day. The group is down more than 20% this year, touched a three-month low Monday and is trading below its 50-day moving average.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech and pharmaceutical stocks have been trampled in the last month. With Q3 earnings reports coming up, can they climb the ""wall of worry?""Credit Suisse ranked 48 Big Pharma stocks on factors like enterprise value/net present value, pricing and replacement powers, and sales growth. Overall, Eli Lilly topped the list, with Europe-based Sanofi (SNY) and Novartis (NVS) trailing closely.AbbVie ranked highest on fundamentals, with investors likely assuming a long life span for Humira, Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a research report. Humira is the brand name for adalimumab, Abbvie's drug to treat arthritis, plaque psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.AbbVie stock, though, slipped a small fraction Monday, while Lilly stock fell nearly 1%.Meanwhile, Pfizer was ""weak across the board,"" AstraZeneca has a high EV/NPV (enterprise value to net present value) and Novo Nordisk is exposed to U.S. pricing pressure.For AstraZeneca, investors are potentially factoring in its oncology pipeline, Credit Suisse says, but ""recent results from others demonstrate significant risk.""Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) scored well in EV/NPV valuation, with most of its sales power driven by its generic division. Gilead Sciences (GILD), Incyte (INCY) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are all trading at a discount with Vertex only needing ""minimal further pipeline success to justify the current valuation,"" the report said.Among biotechs, Vertex topped Credit Suisse's list, with Amgen (AMGN) flailing at the bottom. Like pharmaceuticals, IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group, has been down this month. The group fell a fraction Monday and, like the ethical drugs group, also fell for a fifth straight trading day, and fell for the seventh day of the past eight trading days.Though near the bottom overall, AstraZeneca scored well in terms of pricing power with its shift toward oncology products. But Novo Nordisk is in ""the eye"" of the diabetes-rebate storm in the U.S., Credit Suisse said.Pricing power, Credit Suisse analysts note, is important as it helps ""companies to resist discount pressures from formulary managers and governments."" In that regard, Allergan (AGN) is the clear winner, with only Shire (SHPG) rivaling it in the dry-eye market.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), which focuses on rare diseases, is the most exceptional biotech, the analysts said, while Biomarin (BMRN), Incyte and Vertex also get high marks for being unique.Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Eli Lilly beat out the cohort on R&D productivity and ability to drive the current pipeline.This follows the dramatic seesaw between Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck (MRK) after Bristol-Myers' lung cancer drug, Opdivo, failed to meet a key endpoint. Eli Lilly scored well on its launches of Trulicity for diabetes and Taltz for psoriasis.

252,ABBV,"The main indexes were volatile Friday as Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) gave the Nasdaq some lift.The Nasdaq quickly erased a midday gain and was down 0.2%. Alphabet rose 1.5% in strong volume, adding some room above its 813.98 buy point.  The company beat Q3 estimates late Thursday. Facebook was up 2% in some of the most active trading in today's market. It climbed back above the 132.08 buy point of a week-old breakout.But Amazon.com (AMZN), another big component of the Nasdaq, acted as a drag. The online retailer gapped below its 50-day moving average in heavy volume after missing profit expectations.The S&P 500 also fell 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average was 0.1% lower. The small-cap Russell 2000 was up 0.3%, however. Volume was lower compared with the same time Thursday.Ellie Mae (ELLI) surged 11% in heavy volume. It is back above a 102.73 buy point but nearly extended from that entry. Support at the 50-day moving average, which was in doubt Thursday, now looks to have worked. Late Thursday, the mortgage processing software company beat Q3 expectations and raised its full-year forecasts.Some medical stocks were routed as the sector continued to go through a bad earnings season.McKesson (MCK) was the single most heavily sold stock, with shares down 24% in volume about 1,820% times higher than normal. Its quarterly results missed estimates and the drug distributor sharply cut its full-year forecast amid pricing pressures. Peer Cardinal Health (CAH) plunged in sympathy, falling 11.5% to the lowest level since May 2014. AmerisourceBergen (ABC) plunged 13%.The damage spread beyond the drug distribution industry. Generic drugs, biotech, managed care and medical services were some health care industry groups down more than 1% and in the bottom rungs of Friday's performance table.AbbVie (ABBV) gapped down sharply in volume more than 4 1/2 times the average as earnings topped views but sales missed analyst targets.Novo Nordisk (NVO) gapped to the lowest level since November 2013, accelerating a price deterioration that started in August. The drugmaker missed sales estimates and cited declining sales and prices for insulin.RELATED:Q3 Bottom Line: Google A Cash Machine, Amazon A Free SpenderEllie Mae Has Inside Track To Help Mortgage Lenders Go Digital McKesson Drags Down Sector With Earnings Miss, Lower OutlookAbbVie Topples On Humira Miss; Sanofi, Novo Diverge On Insulin Panic

253,ABBV,"Tesaro (TSRO) stock rocketed to an all-time high Monday on Phase 3 results showing its ovarian cancer drug could benefit 70% of all patients, making it ""the PARP inhibitor to beat,"" according to RBC analyst Adnan Butt.Tesaro stock flew as much as 24%, near 123, on the stock market today, and closed the day at 119.23, up 20%. Shares more than doubled in June thanks to earlier win for niraparib, its ovarian cancer drug.IBD'S TAKE: Tesaro stock wasn't alone hitting a new high Monday. Check out IBD's list of New Highs.In a late-stage trial, Tesaro said niraparib increased progression-free survival (PFS) in four subsets of patients with ovarian cancer regardless of whether they had the BRCA gene or homologous recombination deficient (HRD) tumors.Those with the germline mutation of the BRCA gene (associated with breast cancer) topped the group with a median PFS that was 15 and a half months better than the control arm.But all four groups benefited, meaning niraparib could potentially treat 70% of ovarian cancer patients vs. 50% if BRCA, HRD positive or biomarkers had been required, Butt wrote in a research report.Tolerability also appeared manageable. Less than 15% of patients dropped out. Of those who experienced Grade 3 or 4 adverse effects (thrombocytopenia, anemia or neutropenia), all were resolved with dosing changes, Butt wrote.Tesaro plans to complete the rolling new drug application in Q4 for patients with recurrent, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer and will file with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for broad appeal, Butt wrote.Butt sees no near-term rivals for niraparib, a PARP inhibitor. According to BMC Medicine, a publisher of peer-reviewed journals, PARPs are enzymes used to repair damaged DNA. Companies like Tesaro are studying whether inhibiting those enzymes could be key to treating ovarian, breast and other cancers.AstraZeneca's (AZN) PARP inhibitor, Lynparza, won conditional approval in 2014. Clovis Oncology (CLVS) stock lost 18% on Friday after data showed its ovarian cancer drug might be inferior to Lynparza, but Clovis shares rose 10% to 32.40 on Monday, on Tesaro's stock pull.Medivation (MDVN) and AbbVie (ABBV), too, are testing PARP inhibitors. AbbVie stock rose a fraction Monday, while Medivation was basically flat.Butt kept his outperform rating on Tesaro stock and boosted his price target to 128 from 122. At least three other analysts hiked their price targets Monday on Tesaro stock.
"
254,ABBV,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) remains ahead of Galapagos (GLPG) in developing a triple of drugs to treat cystic fibrosis, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Thursday after Galapagos unveiled positive phase 2 data for its first CF pill.Galapagos' GLPG-1837 lowered FEV1 ""in-line"" with data from Vertex's Kalydeco. FEV1 is a ratio used in the diagnosis of obstructive and restrictive lung disease. GLPG-1837 and Kalydeco belong to a class of drugs called potentiators.But developing a triple is no easy feat, Yee wrote in a research report. Galapagos' and AbbVie's (ABBV) backup potentiator moved into phase 1 testing earlier this year. Its corrector, GLPG-2222, is currently in phase 1/2 testing.""This is only one CF drug and in order to have a 'triple pill' the companies have to have all three drugs look good and in combination all together in patients -- and have minimal drug-drug interactions or safety issues when dosed all at once,"" Yee wrote.Galapagos' third piece of the triple pill hasn't yet started phase 1 testing, Yee wrote. And its phase 2 test involved only seven patients who had previously been treated with Kalydeco. It's a little early to say GLPG-1837 has been derisked, Yee says.""So three drugs will not be in combination until back half of 2017, in our view,"" he wrote. He estimates Vertex is one to two years ahead after already derisking two of its three drugs. VX-152 and VX-440 -- in contention to become the third -- will begin phase 2 testing before year's end.Yee kept his outperform rating on Vertex stock. He sees the ""mega-franchise"" in CF as having a $1 billion potential upside. Vertex stock fell 3.65% to close at 75.84 on the stock market today, hitting the lowest in more than two years. Galapagos fell 2% to 62.68.IBD'S TAKE: The biotech sector isn't looking so hot now after IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group sank to No. 21 out of 197 groups tracked from No. 9 over four weeks. The 54-company Aerospace/Defense industry group, though, could be a better bet.

255,ABBV,"Bristol-Myers Squibb vs. Merck, Pfizer vs. Lilly and a unique treatment from AbbVie (ABBV) will take the spotlight next week at the biggest drug conference focused on treatments for one of the biggest diseases: cancer.The annual meeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology in Chicago on June 3-7 is a prime opportunity to check up on some potential blockbuster drugs.The abstracts for most of the presentations were released to the public on May 18, giving the gist of study results but leaving details for the conference itself. And some of the most interesting items for investors will be among the late-breaking abstracts.As in the past several ASCO meetings, the battle of the immunotherapies will be a major theme. The two marketed PD-1 inhibitors, Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo and Merck's (MRK) Keytruda, are already big sellers in skin and lung cancer, with Opdivo ahead in market share. But ongoing research will give an idea of their true market potential, as well as how they stack up against each other.As is often the case for cancer drugs, Opdivo and Keytruda were both approved for advanced cases of the disease first, but the largest market opportunity is for front-line treatment of newly diagnosed patients. Among the cancers, one of the largest market opportunities is in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which Bristol-Myers and Merck are targeting.In the first abstract release, Merck's Keynote-021 study of Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy yielded improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) of 10 months overall, and 14 to 15 months in patients whose tumors showed high expression of PD-L1, the ligand the PD-1 inhibitors indirectly target.""Here we continue to see solid ORR (overall response rate, or percentage of tumors that shrank) and PFS data, and look to the meeting to better understand the durability of the response over longer periods of time,"" wrote Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan in a May 19 research note.Bristol-Myers is also conducting first-line NSCLC studies. Its most significant might be Checkmate-012, which combines Opdivo with another Bristol-Myers immunotherapy drug, Yervoy. If that proves to be the most effective combo, then that would be huge for the company, since Bristol-Myers would wholly own the treatment and thus gain all the revenue from it.There was no new Checkmate-012 info in the early abstracts, but analysts hope it will be among the late-breaking data.Morningstar analyst Damien Conover says he also wants to see data on Tecentriq, Roche's (RHHBY) entry into a sister class of drugs that target the PD-L1 ligand directly. By coincidence, the FDA approved Tecentriq for a type of bladder cancer called urothelial carcinoma on the same day the ASCO abstracts were released.""They were first to file in bladder (cancer),"" Conover told IBD. ""Bladder's a big indication -- not as big as lung cancer, but having that niche for Roche will really help drive that drug's sale.""Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez, however, notes that Tecentriq could soon have competition, as shown in other ASCO presentations.""Initial data for Bristol Myers’ Opdivo and AstraZeneca's (AZN) durvalumab show higher response rates in this indication,"" Fernandez wrote in his May 19 research note. ""Beyond the smaller patient numbers in both data sets, baseline characteristics to be presented at ASCO should be closely watched.""A newer battle seems to be shaping up in a different drug class, called the CDK 4/6 inhibitors, used to treat breast cancer. The CDK stands for cyclin-dependent kinase, an enzyme tied to cell division, encoded in genes CDK4 and CDK6. The inhibitors help stop the cancer cells from multiplying.The first of these, Pfizer's (PFE) Ibrance, launched in early 2015 and took in $723 million last year. That's expected to swell into the billions eventually.Eli Lilly (LLY), however, has made some noise with its CDK 4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib, which showed a much higher response rate -- 25% -- in refractory patients than did Ibrance. In the ASCO abstract on Lilly's Monarch-1 trial, after eight months of treatment that number was only 17%, still better than Ibrance but a slight disappointment to Wall Street.At Lilly's R&D day on Tuesday, though, the company said it will also be presenting 12-month data at ASCO, so there could still be an upside surprise. Nonetheless, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote that Lilly executives didn't seem that enthusiastic.""Lilly seemed to not want to boost investor expectations with regards to the 12-month data, and therefore reiterated the 17% ORR results (reported at eight months) when asked,"" Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients. ""Additionally, Lilly encouraged investors to also look at overall clinical benefit and duration of response during the presentation at ASCO.""Hovering in the background, though not at ASCO, is the Novartis (NVS) announcement May 18 that it had stopped its late-stage trial of its own CDK drug early because it had already hit its primary endpoint of improvement in PFS. The details on that will have to wait for a later medical meeting.""That's also a positive development for the space,"" analyst Divan told IBD. ""There's room for more than one winner.""Meanwhile, Pfizer scored a hit for its treatment with late-stage data showing that Ibrance in combination with estrogen blocker letrozole yielded PFS of more than 20 months, or 10 months more than letrozole alone.This prodded analyst Fernandez to raise his 2025 sales estimate for the whole CDK 4/6 class to $13 billion from $10 billion, and his 2021 estimate for Ibrance sales alone to $8.3 billion from $6 billion.Among the late-breaking data in other fields, one study that many on Wall Street are eyeing is the midstage trial of Rova-T, a drug that AbbVie is acquiring through the $5.8 billion buyout of biotech Stemcentryx. Rova-T is a treatment for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), a smaller market than the enormous NSCLC population but a definite opportunity since it lacks a specifically approved treatment.Previous studies have shown a 44% response rate in relapsed patients with high expression of delta-like protein 3 (DLL3), which appears in 80% of SCLC patient tumors. The presentation at ASCO is particularly important because Stemcentryx will be reporting long-term survival data, which is the gold standard in cancer trials as far as the FDA is concerned.Analyst Schoenebaum says Rova-T will have to improve survival enough to differentiate itself.""We know that chemotherapy produces around six months' OS (overall survival) in the setting that they're testing Rova-T in,"" Schoenebaum said in a video recorded for clients on May 23. ""And we know that there was some data in the ASCO abstracts (showing) PD-1 plus Yervoy produced about eight months, but (with) a lot of toxicity.... But the punchline is we need to see OS data well in excess of six months.""AbbVie has estimated that peak annual sales of Rova-T could hit $5 billion.
"
256,ABBV,"Big Pharma AbbVie (ABBV) said Tuesday that a recently licensed drug candidate succeeded in a phase-two trial of Crohn's disease, as the company seeks to refresh its blockbuster immunology franchise.In the late morning at the Digestive Disease Week conference in San Diego, AbbVie's researchers presented results from an ongoing phase-two study of risankizumab, a drug AbbVie licensed from Boehringer Ingelheim during the first quarter, in Crohn's disease. They said that after 12 weeks of treatment, 24% to 37% of patients were in remission -- depending on the dose -- compared with just 15% in the placebo group. The treated group also had fewer adverse events than the placebo group.Risankizumab is one of a newer group of drugs targeting interleukins, small proteins in cells associated with inflammation, among the proteins is TNF, or tumor necrosis factor.""These results are particularly encouraging because of the difficult-to-treat population within the study,"" researcher Brian Feagan said in a statement. ""Our patients had endoscopically confirmed moderate or more severe disease activity at study entry and the majority had previously failed treatment with one or more TNF antagonists.""The most popular TNF blocker happens to be Humira, AbbVie's flagship drug treating Crohn's disease as well as other immunological conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Humira's patents are under fire, however, and last week AbbVie's stock tumbled when the patent board agreed to review a challenge to a methods patent brought by Coherus BioSciences (CHRS).Other drugs targeting interleukins include Novartis' (NVS) Cosentyx, launched early last year for psoriasis, as well as Eli Lilly's (LLY) Taltz, approved for psoriasis in March.Those drugs target interleukin (IL) 17, while risankizumab targets IL-23 through a novel mechanism of action.""The efficacy of this drug looks to be as good (as), or perhaps even better than IL-17,"" Evercore ISI analyst John Scotti said in a video for clients recorded May 3. ""And remember, Cosentyx peak sales in consensus right now are about $4 billion.""AbbVie stock ended trading up 2.4% on the stock market today to 60.70, and shares in the past week have found support at the 50-day moving average line.

257,ABBV,"Investors scoffed at the ""sell in May and go away"" adage and sent stock ETFs higher in the past month. A sharp oil rally offset both a dismal employment report and more evidence that corporate America's profits are getting crushed.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) set a string of 2016 highs in June, as the U.S. stock market built on its rebound from the February market bottom.Still, caution is the word at the world's largest investment manager.Click Here To See A List Of Top Performing ETFs In 2016In the U.S., the latest job growth figures -- the weakest in almost six years -- cast doubt on the recovering economy's ability to absorb an interest-rate hike this summer. In the U.K., a key June 23 referendum will decide whether Britain stays in the European Union.Those uncertainties add up to big risks for global markets, according to BlackRock.""We believe now is a good time to dial down equity and credit risk,"" Richard Turnill, BlackRock's  global chief investment strategist, wrote in a June 6 research note. He favors dividend growers in an unstable environment, to be found in an exchange traded fund such as ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (NOBL). NOBL invests exclusively in S&P 500 companies with the longest track records of year-over-year dividend growth. These ""aristocrats"" include medical device maker Medtronic (MDT) and drugmaker AbbVie (ABBV).In the month ended last Tuesday, United States Oil (USO), a best-performing ETF of 2016, added 11.5%. The commodity ETF invests in crude futures, which on June 8 surged to their highest level in nearly a year.Among equities, technology stocks emerged from their recent sloth to help lead the S&P higher.IShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) jumped 11.7% in the past month, as No. 1 holding Broadcom (AVGO) climbed to a 52-week high after its fiscal Q2 report. Ambarella (AMBA), parts supplier to GoPro (GPRO), also soared after its earnings report.SPY posted a 2.9% gain in the past month as the market resumed its uptrend.IShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), holding foreign developed-market stocks, rose 3.6% in the same time. Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO) tacked on 5.2%.For ETF investors, the key question is whether the S&P 500 can hold above the 2,100 resistance level in the second half of 2016. We asked two money managers for their best investing ideas so that portfolios aren't range-bound, even if the broad market moves sideways:Kimberly D. Woody, senior portfolio manager, Globalt Investments in Atlanta, Ga.; assets under advisement: roughly $1.8 billion.The S&P 500 remains sandwiched in a multiyear trading range, which calls for more nimble tactical trading, not large strategic tilts. The choice before American voters is as stark as ever, with far-reaching implications for the economy as well as for multiple industries. We believe it unlikely that markets race higher before global risks abate and until more clarity is seen on the U.S. political front. Positive developments in the global economy, currency and commodity markets have led to calmer global equity and bond markets. We remain hopeful for increased economic momentum, but more evidence of recovery is needed to justify increasing risk in portfolios.Robert Davis, partner and chief investment officer, Round Table Wealth Management in New York City; assets under management: $1 billion.Our near-term view is cautious as it relates to stocks. Earnings have been significantly reduced since the start of the year, and valuations remain at a premium in certain defensive sectors. Growth is not absent, however, as the small-cap growth sector is demonstrating increased earnings, and we believe this is an area of opportunity after a meaningful sell-off in the first half of the year. We also view high-yield bonds as an attractive area, as those securities are higher in the capital structure and provide a meaningful yield to get investors through what could be a flat market leading up to the presidential election.

258,ABBV,"Stocks rallied modestly after Janet Yellen signaled that a June rate hike was off the table and oil prices rose above $50 a barrel, but those gains reversed. Tesla Motors (TSLA) faces new safety concerns, but shares still rose on hopes that it will meet production targets. Apple (AAPL) revamped its App Store business model. Amazon.com (AMZN) doubled down on India. American Airlines (AAL) and other carriers rose despite mixed news. Niche retailers Lululemon (LULU) and Dave & Buster's (PLAY) reported strong earnings.Stocks rallied much of the week on no-hike hopes. The S&P 500 rose to a 10-month high, less than 1% below an all-time best. The Nasdaq approached 5,000 for the first time this year, while the Dow topped 18,000. Shares pulled back slightly on Thursday and especially Friday as bond yields hit or neared record lows around the world and Brexit fears revived. The S&P 500 closed the week down 0.1% and the Nasdaq 1%. The Dow industrials eked out a 0.3% gain.Days after a dismal May jobs report, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said the economy is making progress. But she dropped a hint in late May that a hike would be appropriate in the ""coming months."" Yellen's comments, along with cautious statements from other policymakers, signaled a June 14-15 meeting move is off the table.The CME FedWatch Tool now sees a 2% chance of a move next week, a 20% chance in late July and 35% in September. In fact, the odds don't favor a move until the December meeting (55%). Before the May jobs report, investors saw a 30% chance of a June move and 60%-plus by July.Meanwhile, April job openings rose by 118,000 to 5.788 million, matching a record high reached last July.

260,ABBV,"Shares of big pharma AbbVie (ABBV) nosedived Monday after the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office agreed to review a challenge to a patent on its best-selling drug.The Patent Trial and Appeal Board accepted a request for inter partes review (IPR) by generic-drug startup Coherus Biosciences (CHRS) on patent 8,889,135, or the ""methods"" patent, for rheumatoid-arthritis treatment Humira. The patent is due to expire in 2025, but if Coherus is successful, it could launch its biosimilar version of Humira earlier. That might not happen too soon, though, since the review normally takes a year and is then open to appeal.AbbVie stock, which had opened flat on the stock market today, abruptly dropped 4% after the news came out mid-morning, to near 60, and ended Tuesday's session at 60.23, down 3.6%. Coherus' more lightly traded stock jumped 16%, to 18.85.AbbVie is No. 1 in its Industry Group -- find out more at IBD Stock Checkup.Humira is currently the top-selling drug in the world, with $14 billion in sales last year. Coherus is one of several companies developing biosimilars of Humira -- others include privately held Boehringer Ingelheim, which has some outstanding IPR requests on several different patents, and Amgen (AMGN), whose IPR request on a different Humira patent was denied back in January. Coherus has also filed IPR requests on two other patents.""Keep in mind AbbVie also has methods patents which cover other approved Humira indications, such as Crohn's (disease), and we would expect additional IPRs/litigation to commence prior to potential biosimilar approvals (Amgen's Humira biosimilar could be approved later this year),"" wrote Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum in an email. ""Thus, these IPRs will likely be the first of many legal actions against AbbVie's methods patent estate.""
"
261,ABBV,"Leerink Swann analyst Geoffrey Porges is ""tired of waiting"" for Gilead Sciences (GILD) to acknowledge slowing hepatitis C patient volume and competition from rivals AbbVie and Merck.Porges downgraded Gilead stock to a market perform rating from outperform and cut his price target to 94 from 112. Long cautious, Porges is now bearish on the ""flash-in-the-pan"" hepatitis C market. He cut his hepatitis C sales expectations by 17% in 2017 and 20%-25% after.""Our existing HCV estimates were already materially below (the) consensus,"" he wrote in a research report. ""We now think that HCV revenues will decline faster and farther than we previously estimated, and than (the) consensus currently forecasts.""It briefly had a stranglehold on the market, but Gilead now faces competition from AbbVie (ABBV), which has sold Viekira Pak since April. Merck (MRK) shook up the market even more when it started selling its own medication well below the high costs of Gilead and AbbVie earlier this year.Gilead caused a stir in the biotech world when it released its first hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi, in late 2013. The drug cost $84,000, or $1,000 a pill for a 12-week regimen but offered a near guarantee that patients who used the drug would be cured. Gilead saw triple-digit jumps in profits throughout 2014 as a result.In late 2014, Gilead released Harvoni, its follow-on to Sovaldi that cost even more, beyond $90,000. Profits continued to grow at a double-digit pace throughout 2015. That slowed to a single-digit increase in the first quarter of this year and a 2% drop in profits in the second quarter. Shares of the company now trade below 80 after reaching a peak of more than 123 in mid-2015.AbbVie started selling Viekira Pak for around the same price as Sovaldi, but Merck's Zepatier goes for much less, at $54,600.On the stock market today, Gilead stock dipped 1.7%, to 79.25, hitting its lowest point in a week and falling below the key 50-day moving average support line after five straight down days.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead stock has a Composite Rating of 62, meaning it underperforms 38% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group is on a recent hot streak amid the potential for M&A by Big Pharma.The hepatitis C market in the U.S. appears to be in steady, secular decline, Porges said. Despite a large pool of treatable patients, the U.S. and Europe will likely only see 60,000 to 70,000 patients apiece annually in the long-term vs. a record high 270,000 in 2015.Through 2020, Porges forecasts 15% patient erosion per year, 5% erosion of revenue per unit and a 7% dip in treatment erosion. He also expects Gilead to lose 10% market share and sees hepatitis C sales toppling nearly 90% by 2020 to $1.7 billion from peak $13 billion in sales in 2015.Gilead should have seen it coming, Porges said. But, he said: ""Gilead has been surprised by the slowing in patient volume around the world, as well as price erosion in the U.S. and other developed markets.""""We fear that the company has become paralyzed by its size and good fortune, and the uncertainty about its outlook and its capabilities,"" he wrote. Gilead appears unwilling to match the market's price for high-quality assets or to invest in a pipeline for its future.Outside hepatitis C, Porges has kinder words for Gilead's HIV business. But that is contingent upon the success of its development of bictegravir. He currently models $3.4 billion in sales for a bictegravir combination in 2020.Gilead also has a rheumatoid arthritis treatment, filgotinib, for which Porges sees a 65% probability of success, up from 35%.RELATED:Gilead, Allergan Seen Trailing Intercept In Ongoing NASH BattlePfizer Will Buy Cancer Drugmaker Medivation For $14 Billion

262,ABBV,"Cash-rich Apple (AAPL) led the S&P 500 in stock buybacks in the second quarter, as the information technology sector overall led the field.Apple was followed by General Electric (GE) in buybacks, then came Microsoft (MSFT) at No. 3 and drugmaker AbbVie (ABBV) at No. 4, FactSet Research said in a report Tuesday.After the close Tuesday, Microsoft said its directors had authorized a new stock buyback program of as much as $40 billion, and the company reaffirmed that it is on track to complete its current $40 billion buyback authorization by year-end. Microsoft stock was up more than 1% in after-hours trading, after the buyback announcement.Overall, firms in the S&P 500 spent $125.1 billion on share buybacks during Q2, the smallest quarterly total since Q3 2013, FactSet said. This comes after Q1 set a post-recession high. Aggregate buybacks in Q2 represented a 6.8% decline from Q2 2015, the largest year-over-year decrease since Q1 2015. The Q2 decline came during a quarter that saw the S&P 500 index hit a record high.IBD'S TAKE: Share repurchases are a popular way to return capital to shareholders, tending to boost a stock and per-share earnings, while dividends put cash in shareholders' hands. The strategy has been embraced by firms and outside investors, because it drives up share prices and improves per-share earnings by reducing the number of shares outstanding. Current and annual earnings are keys to IBD's CAN SLIM.Although aggregate share buybacks fell last quarter, there were still some big spenders. Apple led with $10.9 billion worth of shares purchased, up 9% from the year-earlier quarter.General Electric bought back $7.6 billion worth of shares in Q2, after repurchasing less than $150 million of its stock in the year-ago quarter. FactSet said GE has used $17 billion out of its massive $50 billion repurchased program, which was funded by the sale of GE Capital.Microsoft spent $3.6 billion on buybacks, and AbbVie shelled out $3.42 billion.The buybacks among the S&P 500 helped contribute to a 5.5% reduction in its total shares outstanding. FactSet said 350 companies bought back shares, down from 380 in Q2 2015.While IT, as usual, led the way, the sector's buybacks fell 15.4%, to $30.3 billion, year over year. The industrials and consumer discretionary sectors ranked No. 2 and 3 in buybacks, respectively.

He pointed out that Lilly has a deep pipeline of Alzheimer's drugs beyond solanezumab, as well as new drugs in other disease areas.""We see a range of new product opportunities at Lilly that should support the company's growth targets, and are forecasting 6% top-line growth through 2020 (5% excluding risk-adjusted solanezumab sales) supported by a number of $1+ billion product opportunities such as Trulicity, Jardiance, Taltz, baricitinib and abemaciclib,"" Schott wrote in a research note upgrading Lilly stock to overweight from neutral. ""In aggregate, we forecast recent/upcoming new product launches to generate $11.4 billion in sales by 2020.""Lilly stock was up about 1.5% in late-afternoon trading on the stock market today, near 80.IBD'S TAKE: Despite JPMorgan's actions, AbbVie is rated No. 1 in IBD's Medical-ethical drugs group, while Lilly is No. 16. To see why, read about the CAN SLIM Investing System.Meanwhile, Schott downgraded AbbVie to neutral from overweight, saying that he still likes its long-term prospects but there aren't enough near-term catalysts to offset the erosion of its lead drug Humira in the face of biosimilar competition.""While it is possible Humira could see no or limited biosimilar competition through 2021/2022, we expect little clarity on potential outcomes over the next 12-18 months,"" Schott wrote.AbbVie stock was down about 1.5% in late-afternoon trading Thursday, near 64.RELATED:Lilly Breast Cancer Drug Study Rolls On

264,ABBV,"Biotechs Celgene (CELG) and Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO) were trading up Wednesday after the companies said they'll be filing for FDA approval of their blood-cancer drug earlier than expected.Agios said in an SEC filing ahead of its presentation at Citi's (C) annual biotech conference that by year's end Celgene will file an application for enasidinib, or AG-221, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Previously the timeline for the filing was unclear. The newest batch of clinical-trial data isn't expected until next year, with the last batch coming out over a year ago.Data on another cancer drug, AG-120, should also be out by year's end, and Agios and Celgene will also file for early approval of that drug in 2017, the filing said.Agios' stock catapulted up nearly 26% to close at 46.98 on the stock market today. The stock has taken an even bigger beating than most biotechs over the last 12 months as analyst commentary has generally been cautious in the face of strong-looking competition in AML from AbbVie (ABBV) and Roche's (RHHBY) Venetoclax, as well as Seattle Genetics' (SGEN) SGN-CD33A.Celgene stock was up 0.2% to 106.96 at the close.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene has been cranking out steady financial growth, but its stock is still looking for a buy point after spending over a year consolidating.

So it's wise to keep abreast of upcoming drug trial data from biotech companies. Gilead's shares have languished, but the company is expected to release some key data on a possibly big hep B drug later this year, as IBD reported. ""The VA has budgeted $1 billion HCV drug spending for fiscal year 2016,"" wrote Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum in an email Friday, noting that Gilead has historically had a 70% share of VA prescriptions. ""VA revenues this quarter will be important in helping Gilead not miss consensus estimates.""Gilead Sciences shares rose 0.3% in late morning trade on the stock market today.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez lifted his Opdivo sales estimates in a Q2 preview note last week.""Together with Yervoy, Bristol-Myers maintains 85% share of the checkpoint inhibitor market,"" Fernandez wrote, referring to the class of cancer drugs to which Opdivo belongs. ""Based on these trends, we have increased our full-year 2016 Opdivo sales by $450 million (to $3.8 billion) and expect strong uptake in Japan will improve royalty revenue from Ono.""Bristol-Myers Squibb stock fell 0.5% intraday.""We have lowered our near-term estimates for Keytruda and the Januvia franchise based on sales and prescription data, respectively; however we see greater long-term opportunity for each relative to our previous forecasts,"" Fernandez wrote.

269,ABBV,"An FDA panel unanimously endorsed Amgen's (AMGN) biosimilar version of AbbVie's (ABBV) blockbuster immunology drug Humira late Tuesday, making approval likely though it's not clear when it will launch.All 26 members of the panel endorsed approving Amgen's ABP 501 for all of the conditions it applied for, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, irritable bowel disease and ulcerative colitis. (Amgen did not apply for the most recent indications Humira had acquired, which include pediatric Crohn's disease and uveitis, since they're still covered by regulatory exclusivity.)Essentially, the panel found that there were no meaningful clinical differences between ABP 501 and Humira, though the two drugs are not identical.Humira is currently the world's best-selling drug, taking in some $14 billion worldwide last year, so AbbVie has been vigorously defending its intellectual property against Amgen and other challengers in court. Therefore, even though the FDA could approve ABP 501 by its Sept. 25 deadline, Amgen might not take the risk of launching it. If AbbVie prevails in its trials, Humira could be patent-protected into the 2020s.Amgen itself has been facing biosimilar competition to its drugs in Europe, and last summer Novartis' (NVS) Sandoz unit launched Zarxio, a version of Amgen's Neupogen that was the first biosimilar drug to be cleared in the U.S.On Wednesday, Novartis will go before an FDA panel itself to defend its biosimilar version of Enbrel, Amgen's flagship rheumatoid-arthritis drug.Analysts had expected approval of both the Amgen and Novartis biosimilars.""Given the broad support Pfizer (PFE)/Celltrion's biosimilar Remicade received at the FDA earlier this year and the data we have seen for both of these biosimilars, we expect similar levels of support for both biosimilars next week, although the ongoing legal process for both will likely be a better determinant of when we will see the biosimilars actually enter the market,"" wrote Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan in a research note last Wednesday.

With oil prices falling back toward $40 a barrel, corporate spending may remain weak going forward.U.S. crude oil futures tumbled 5.9% to $41.60 a barrel, hitting three-month lows as the crude tumbled 13.9% for July. U.S. crude and gasoline supplies rose again, according to the Energy Information Administration, which also reported higher U.S. production. The number of U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a fifth straight week, suggesting further production gains. But a glut of gasoline and refined products, suggesting less refinery demand for crude ahead. Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP) reported weaker-than-expected results.Mobileye (MBLY) reported Q2 EPS jumped 70% to 17 cents, while revenue grew 51% to $83.5 million. Both topped views. The maker of driver-assistance systems said that its relationship with Tesla Motors (TSLA) is ending. That news sent Mobileye down 8% on Tuesday, but the stock pared losses for the week to 3.4%. Tesla rose 5.6%.Boeing (BA) reported its first quarterly loss in years due to various charges, but it wasn't as deep as feared. Free cash flow was better than expected on big jet deliveries. Northrop Grumman (NOC) reported modest earnings and sales growth that topped views, but weaker tech services revenue hurt margins. Raytheon (RTN) beat views and raised profit guidance. General Dynamics (GD) topped on earnings and raised EPS guidance, but Q2 revenue missed.McDonald's earned $1.45 a share, beating analysts' expectations for $1.38. Total revenue fell 3.6% vs. a year earlier to $6.265 billion. Analysts had expected $6.27 billion. Global same-store sales, excluding currency effects, rose 3.1% vs. estimates for about 3.6%. U.S. same-store sales rose just 1.8%.

Its stock hit a one-year high at 108.49, above a 107.07 buy point. Caterpillar's (CAT) Q2 EPS and revenue both fell as the mining and construction equipment giant deals with an energy and mining downturn. Its stock hit a roughly one-year high at 84.29, rising above an 80.89 entry point. Chemicals giant DuPont (DD), which is merging with Dow Chemical (DOW), crushed earnings estimates but was light on revenue. Shares rose to 69.87, the highest point since mid-December, triggering its 69.50 buy point. Meanwhile 3M (MMM), which makes tapes, adhesives, medical supplies and other products, also reported higher EPS and lower revenue, beating estimates on both. But its shares fell 1.1%.Analog Devices (ADI) agreed to buy Linear Technology (LLTC) in a cash-and-stock deal worth around $14.8 billion to create a microchip-industry giant. The deal is expected to close within the first half of 2017. Meanwhile, Oracle (ORCL) said it would buy cloud-services provider NetSuite (N) in a $9.3 billion deal. Oracle's Larry Ellison is the leading shareholder of NetSuite. Meanwhile, Citrix Systems (CTXS) will merge its Go To Meeting unit with LogMeIn (LOGM). Citrix was already planning to spin off Go To Meeting.Verizon Communications acquired struggling the core assets of Yahoo for nearly $6 billion, including $1.1 billion in stock compensation costs. ""Despite the massive execution challenges ahead, the Yahoo acquisition demonstrates that Verizon recognizes its own limitations as a consumer brand,"" said research firm The Diffusion Group. Verizon reported Q2 revenue that missed views and in-line EPS, and added fewer wireless postpaid phone subscribers than expected.T-Mobile US (TMUS) in Q2 added 646,000 postpaid phone subscribers, topping Sprint (S) at 173,000 and Verizon's 86,000. AT&T (T) lost 160,000 postpaid phone subscribers. T-Mobile's earnings fell 40% but still beat expectations. Revenue rose nearly 13% to $9.2 billion. ""TMUS revenue growth continues to significantly outpace peers,"" said Matthew Niknam, a Deutsche Bank analyst, in a report.Under Armour (UA) met top-line and bottom-line expectations when it reported per-share earnings of a penny, down 75% from the prior-year Q2, and 28% revenue growth to $1 billion. The Nike (NKE) rival announced several assertive plans, including its takeover of the FAO Schwarz space in Manhattan, as well as a partnership with Kohl's (KSS). But shares tumbled 7.9% for the week.Amgen (AMGN) beat and raised, but its stock slipped as its growth continued to be driven by price increases rather than volume. Celgene (CELG), meanwhile, jumped as only a third of its growth was price-driven, making up for a hit earlier in the week when its drug Revlimid failed a lymphoma trial. AbbVie (ABBV), Merck (MRK) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) also rose on solid reports. AstraZeneca (AZN) was the biggest winner stock-wise when it jumped 9% Thursday on rumors that Swiss pharma Novartis (NVS) was thinking of acquiring it. The biggest loser was Gilead Sciences (GILD), which trimmed its guidance as its hepatitis C franchise continued to decline.Meanwhile, top-rated medical device companies Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and orthopedics giant Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) each hit new highs after beating estimates and raising guidance. Big Cap 20 stalwart Boston Scientific (BSX) hit a 10-year high after it reported its strongest quarter of sales growth in nearly a decade.

271,ABBV,"Big biotech Amgen's (AMGN) biosimilar form of AbbVie's (ABBV) Humira seemed to get support from the FDA on Friday, when the agency released briefing documents for the advisory committee panel meeting on Tuesday.The panel will discuss ABP 501, a knockoff of AbbVie's mega-blockbuster used to treat several forms of arthritis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis. Since biosimilars, unlike generic pharmaceuticals, are not identical to the drugs they're copying, the approval process isn't as simple as for generics. But in the briefing documents, the FDA sounded convinced that Amgen had made its case.""In considering the totality of the evidence, the data submitted by Amgen support a demonstration that ABP 501 is highly similar to U.S.-licensed Humira, notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and support a demonstration that there are no clinically meaningful differences between ABP 501 and U.S.-licensed Humira in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product to support the demonstration that ABP 501 is biosimilar to the U..S-licensed Humira in the studied indications of RA (rheumatoid arthritis) and PsO (psoriasis),"" said the document.Amgen shares climbed 2.9% to 161.10 on the stock market today. AbbVie, meanwhile, added 1.15%. Both Amgen and AbbVie shares are approaching 11-month highs.The FDA has until Sept. 25 to make its ultimate decision on approval, but that won't necessarily mean an immediate launch. Amgen and AbbVie are currently tied up in litigation over Humira's intellectual property, and while some generic drugmakers have launched ""at risk"" before such suits are settled, some wait for more certainty.""Recall, Amgen went through the patent dance with AbbVie, and AbbVie has said that they plan to file a public case against Amgen in the next few months and assert many patents,"" Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients. ""If AbbVie were to file and subsequently win a preliminary injunction, Amgen would be barred from marketing either (1) until litigation completes if the biosimilar is ultimately found not to infringe, or (2) until the expiry of the infringed patent if AbbVie were granted a permanent injunction (thus at least 2022 depending on the patent).""Coherus Biosciences (CHRS), Novartis (NVS) and Pfizer (PFE) also have Humira biosimilars in development.Coherus stock rose 4.8% on Friday. Novartis advanced 0.4% and Pfizer 1%. Pfizer set a 12-year closing high.

272,ABBV,"Big-cap drugmakers Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Merck (MRK) were moving in opposite directions in Thursday trading after their Q1 earnings reports, though both companies raised guidance.Regeneron's quarterly revenue rose 38% over the year-earlier period to $1.2 billion, beating analysts' consensus by about $240 million, according to Thomson Reuters. Earnings of $2.57 a share were a penny short of estimates and down 11% from last year's Q1.But on the crucial metric of U.S. sales of flagship drug Eylea, Regeneron reported 44% growth to $781 million, beating consensus by $11 million, and the company raised its full-year growth estimate to 20% to 25% vs. its previous 20%.The earnings miss stemmed from higher spending for selling, general and administrative costs, though spending guidance for the year remained unchanged.Also, cholesterol drug Praluent, which was launched last July, missed consensus again, but its numbers remained small ($13 million) as the company awaited the results of a cardiovascular outcomes trial of both Praluent and rival Amgen's (AMGN) Repatha later this year. Regeneron said that payer coverage for Praluent is good so far, with 74% of the commercially insured and 91% of those on Medicare having access to the drug.Regeneron stock was up 5% in midday trading on the stock market today, near 380.Merck posted earnings of 89 cents a share, up 5% from the year-earlier period and beating consensus by 4 cents. Sales declined 1% to $9.31 billion, missing Wall Street's number by $150 million. Merck stock was down 1.5% midday Thursday, near 54.Merck added a few cents to its 2016 EPS guidance range, now $2.65 to $3.77, and also raised the low end of its revenue guidance, now $39 billion to $40.2 billion. Echoing a number of global pharmas this earnings season, Merck cited improving foreign-exchange rates.The revenue shortfall was spread around a number of different drugs, including blockbuster diabetes drug Januvia and immunology drug Remicade. More interesting to analysts was up-and-coming cancer drug Keytruda, which missed estimates in the U.S. but beat slightly worldwide, especially after rival Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo beat consensus last week.Bristol-Myers also moved up its reporting date for a trial of Opdivo as a first-line treatment for lung cancer to Q3 from its previously guided Q4, eroding the advantage for Merck, which expects to report results for a similar trial of Keytruda at midyear. Both drugs are now approved only for previously treated patients, so first-line approval could significantly expand the market.Merck also reported $50 million in sales for its hepatitis C drug Zepatier, which just launched in late January. Although that's tiny compared with the $2.1 billion reported by market leader Gilead Sciences (GILD), both Gilead and AbbVie (ABBV) said on their earnings calls last week that Merck's aggressive discounting had affected their own businesses.Nonetheless, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee wrote that this may not have been directly responsible for Gilead's miss.""(Merck) suggested negotiations for important parity access remain ongoing, with the exception of the Veterans Administration (10% of the market), which they have good access on ... but interestingly suggested many of the commercial payor access deals are for 2017 impact, since 2016 contracts were already completed,"" Yee wrote in a research note. ""So what Gilead said about their lower sales in U.S. (being) mostly due to just higher gross-to-net from healthier patients coming in (not so much from competition) could be true, realizing price competition is still ongoing and coming and needs to be watched.""
"
273,ABBV,"Two giants in cardiac devices agreed to merge Thursday, as Abbott Laboratories (ABT) announced an agreement to acquire St. Jude Medical (STJ) in a deal worth $25 billion.Abbott agreed to pay $46.75 plus 0.8708 Abbott share for every St. Jude share. Based on Abbott's five-day average share price, the deal valued St. Jude shares at $85 apiece. St. Jude stock was up more than 25% in morning trading on the stock market today, near 78, while Abbott stock was down more than 7%, below 41.Abbott said that the deal will add 21 cents to its EPS next year and 28 cents the following year. It expects to save $500 million in costs from the combination by 2020. Abbott will also assume or refinance St. Jude's $5.7 billion in debt.The move will greatly enlarge Abbott's cardiovascular device business, which now represents 19% of its revenue.""St. Jude Medical's strong positions in heart failure devices, atrial fibrillation and cardiac rhythm management complement Abbott's leading positions in coronary intervention and transcatheter mitral repair,"" said Abbott's press release. ""Together, the company will compete in nearly every area of the cardiovascular market and hold the No. 1 or 2 positions across large and high-growth cardiovascular device markets.""Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy agreed. St. Jude's flat-to-negative sales growth over the last few years picked up to 8% in Q1, and she wrote in a research note that it's set up to continue, while Abbott looked to be growing only in the low single digits.Antalffy also wrote that a competing bid is unlikely.""The most logical buyer beyond Abbott in our view would be Johnson & Johnson (JNJ),"" Antalffy wrote. ""In our meetings with J&J in mid-2015, management emphasized that the company is not interested in what they deemed 'value' markets within MedTech, specifically calling out cardiac rhythm management (nearly 30% of St. Jude's total sales) and drug-eluting stents.""The deal announcement came on a busy day for M&A in medical field. Biotech Medivation (MDVN) confirmed that it had received an unsolicited $9.3 billion bid from big pharma Sanofi (SNY), while AbbVie (ABBV), which used to be Abbott's biopharma division before it was spun out, agreed to buy another cancer-focused biotech, Stemcentrx, for $5.8 billion.

274,ABBV,"Stocks tumbled in and out of mixed trade Thursday morning as earning reports, economic news and overseas factors all had a say in early action.The Nasdaq held up a 0.2% gain, buoyed primarily by Facebook (FB). The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.4% and the S&P 500 dipped 0.2%.Volume rose mildly, up 1% on the NYSE and 8% higher on the Nasdaq, vs. action at the same time Wednesday.The stock market today felt early pressure from overseas markets, which traded generally lower after the Bank of Japan held its monetary policy unchanged and sent the yen soaring and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 to a 3.6% loss Thursday. Economic news increased that weight, after the Labor Department estimated Q1 GDP growth at 0.5%, sharply below Q4 growth and below the consensus view for 0.7%.Nearly all Dow stocks declined at the open. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) led the few advancing issues, up 0.9%. DuPont (DD) shouldered the heaviest loss, down more than 2%, possibly affected by investor response to Q1 results from its pending merger mate Dow Chemical (DOW). Dow's results topped expectations, but the economic outlook appeared wobbly. Dow shares slipped 2%.Facebook easily led the Nasdaq 100 with a 10% advance. Facebook's Q1 earnings report late Wednesday triggered a handful of analyst price target increases Thursday morning. The gain sent shares 2% past a 117.09 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.At the weak end of the Nasdaq 100, chipmaker Xilinx (XLNX) tanked 10%. The company reported late Wednesday its Q1 earnings and revenue narrowly topped consensus views. Management guided Q2 EPS in line with views, but guidance for flat revenue disappointed expectations.Acquisitions news powered a healthy piece of early trade. St. Jude Medical (STJ) opened 24% higher after fellow heart-device maker Abbot Labs (ABT) agreed to buy the company in a $25 billion deal. Abbott's shares fell more than 8%.Facebook's technical and fundamental vital signs are avaible using IBD's Stock Checkup featureBiomed Medivation (MDVN) scribed an early 9% advance, ignited by a $9.3 takeover proposal from France's Sanofi (SNY). Sanofi shares shed 2%.Chicago-based drugmaker Abbvie (ABBV) slumped almost 5% after announcing plans to acquire privately held cancer treatment biomed Stemcentrix in a deal valued at $5.8 billion.Outside of the medical territories, Comcast (CMCSA) sealed its deal to ingest Dreamworks Animations (DWA) for around $3.8 billion. Dreamworks traded flat on Thursday, after spiking 19% on the news in Wednesday's session. Comcast traded a fraction lower Thursday, and was down 0.3% on the week.Haynesbrands (HBI) jockeyed 9% higher after announcing it would pay $835 million to acquire leading Australian undergarment maker Pacific Brands.Companies scheduled to report after today's close include Amazon.com (AMZN), Baidu (BIDU), Netsuite (N), LinkedIn (LKND) and Western Digital (WDC), among many others.
"
275,ABBV,"On slate for Thursday are quarterly earnings reports from Amazon (AMZN), LinkedIn (LNKD), Baidu (BIDU) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) after the close. Before the market open, investors will get their first look at first-quarter economic growth.The e-commerce giant is expected to earn 58 cents a share in Q1, swinging to a profit from a 12-cent loss last year. Revenue is projected to climb 23% to $27.99 billion.Last quarter, Amazon fell well short of earnings estimates and came up light on revenue, sending shares down as much as 32% from their high in the following weeks. But its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services, is a bright spot. It hauled in $2.4 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 69% year over year.Shares are flirting with being within the lower boundary of a buy range from a cup-with-handle base with a 603.34 buy point, which it initially broke out of a few weeks ago. Amazon fell 1.7% to 606.57 after falling to 601.28 intraday.The professional social network's earnings are projected to grow 5% to 60 cents ex items, a sharp drop from the 54% growth that it saw in the prior quarter. Revenue is expected to jump 30% to $828.5 million.Shares dropped 44% on LinkedIn's last quarterly report, which showed weak Q1 guidance. LinkedIn stock has climbed off of its low, reached in the following days, and is now trading 54% below its 52-week high.Social networking leader Facebook (FB) crushed Q1 earnings and revenue projections late Wednesday, sending shares up 9% in late trade.If Facebook's positive action continues into Thursday's session, the stock will likely be in buy range from a cup-with-handle base with a 117.09 buy point.China Internet giant Baidu is projected to see Q1 EPS ex items fall 11% to 5.96 RMB (92 cents). Revenue is estimated to rise 24% to 15.83 billion RMB ($2.4 billion).Baidu's mobile ecosystem is strong, according to ITG Research analyst Henry Guo. He said this week that his firm's data indicates “that Baidu’s Mobile Search app dominates the mobile search market with more than 23% installation penetration among Chinese mobile users, well ahead of its key competitors Sogou Search (1.7%) and Qihoo 360 Technology (QIHU) Search (0.2%).”Baidu is trading just below buy range from a cup-with-handle base that it broke out of recently. It's trading 13% below its 52-week high.The biotech's earnings are estimated to rise 6% to $3.13 a share, slower than last quarter's 37% growth. Revenue is seen rising 7% to $8.1 billion, also a deceleration from the prior quarter. Comparisons are getting tougher after Gilead earnings and sales skyrocketed on hepatitis C treatments.Gilead retook its 200-day line last week but breached that level in Wednesday's session. Shares are trading 18% below their 52-week high.Fellow big-cap biotech Amgen (AMGN) also reports quarterly results Thursday, with analysts expected a 5% EPS gain. Amgen, which fell 1.1% to 161 on Thursday is near a buy point at 165.33 in cup-shaped base.Before the market open, biotechs Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Celgene (CELG) report, along with big pharma Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and AbbVie (ABBV) makes a rival hepatitis C treatment.After Q4’s OK but not great 1.4% gain, coupled with ongoing issues regarding a strong dollar, weak energy sector and sluggish manufacturing, weak growth is expected in Q1. Wall Street expects a scant 0.7% annualized gain.
"
276,ABBV,"Big biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) hit a two-month high Monday after two analysts delivered bullish outlooks for the company.On Sunday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee lifted his Q1 EPS estimates due to a stock buyback and noted several recent pieces of ""incremental"" good news. For one, he cited late Friday the successful patent suit brought by Merck (MRK) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), which had resulted in a somewhat lower damages award ($200 million) than Wall Street had expected.He also noted that weekly prescription data from IMS Health (IMS) suggest Gilead's hepatitis C drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, were holding up reasonably well in the face of competition from Merck's Zepatier, which launched in late January. This point was made more emphatically Monday in a research note by Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges, who called Merck a ""pretender to the HCV (hepatitis C  virus) throne."" Porges noted that a survey of top payer plans backed this up.""Seven weeks after the launch of Zepatier, Sovaldi and Harvoni retain a relatively favorable position in 65% of the top 20 largest commercial plans and 70% of the top 10 largest government plans relative to AbbVie's (ABBV) Viekira Pak (20%, 30%, respectively) and Zepatier (0%, 10%),"" Porges wrote. ""Further, in the top 20 Medicare plans, while Harvoni is covered by 100% of plans, 85% of plans do not cover Viekira Pak, and none cover Zepatier.""Porges affirmed his outperform rating on Gilead stock, with a price target of 127.In midday trading on the stock market today, Gilead stock was up more than 2%, near 93, and earlier rose above 94. The stock has climbed about 14% from the 20-month low it hit on Feb. 2, but still has a weak IBD Relative Strength Rating of 29, meaning the stock's performed in the lowest 29% of all stocks the past 12 months, with an emphasis on the most recent six months.Merck stock was down a fraction midday Monday.

278,ABBV,"Biotech Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO) got a couple of upgrades Monday after it presented promising, though early, data on its anemia drug over the weekend. However, new data from Seattle Genetics (SGEN) and AbbVie (ABBV) could bring new competition to its cancer drugs.On Saturday at the European Hematology Association meeting, Agios presented data from Drive-PK, an ongoing midstage study of AG-348, a drug candidate treating sufferers of a rare genetic form of anemia called pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD). After 18 patients had been treated for at least three weeks, Agios said that it had achieved ""proof of concept"" due to increased hemoglobin levels of at least two grams per deciliter in nine of them.Although there were some increased levels of sex hormones among men, the drug appeared to be well-tolerated, which answered some concerns raised last week about a potential follow-on drug called AG-519. On Thursday, Agios stock plunged 15% when a case of thrombocytopenia, or a drop in platelet count, appeared in a small trial after 14 days of treatment.Agios stock rose 3.2% to 51.97 on the stock market today, but early rose as much as 8.6%.Canaccord Genuity analyst John Newman upgraded Agios Pharma stock to buy from hold, lifting his price target to 90 from 50, writing that the thrombocytopenia now appears to be a ""one-off event."" He estimated peak annual sales of $800 million for the drug.JPMorgan analyst Anupam Rama raised his rating to overweight from neutral and his price target to 62 from 50, noting that both the positive data and the stock sell-off fulfilled his previously stated conditions for getting more constructive on the stock. He added that there are still ""outstanding questions"" about the program, including about the long-term impact of elevated sex hormones on patients who are frequently diagnosed in childhood.""But the reality is hemoglobin increases observed in DRIVE PK/AG-348 are meaningful and we believe this is derisking for the PKD program overall,"" Rama wrote in his research note.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez raised his peak annual sales estimate on the PKD franchise to $755 million, but at the same time he lowered estimates on Agios' cancer drugs AG-120,  AG-221 and AG-881, leaving his market-perform rating unchanged.The latter move came based on Seattle Genetics' multiple presentations at the same conference on its drug SGN-CD33 for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), treating a similar population as Agios' drugs. AbbVie and its partner Roche (RHHBY) also published data from a similar population treated by their drug Venetoclax.""Both competitors are initiating pivotal trials ahead of Agios, putting both agents on market earlier than either of Agios' compounds in earlier stage disease,"" Fernandez wrote in his research note. ""As a result of these changes, we have decreased our 2026 estimates for AG-221 from $754 million to $429 million, for AG-120 from $537 million to $221 million, and for AG-881 from $377 million to $112 million.""Seattle Genetics stock fell 2.65% Monday, while AbbVie stock skidded 1.75%.

280,ABBV,"Big pharma Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) motored to a 17-year high on the stock market Monday, as the company continued to roll out positive trial data on its cancer drugs, though Merck (MRK) is putting up some stiff competition, say analysts.At the annual American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting over the weekend, Bristol-Myers presented a number of studies using its new immunotherapy drug Opdivo to treat various cancers. One of the most closely watched was the Checkmate-012 trial of Opdivo in combination with another Bristol-Myers drug, Yervoy, to treat newly diagnosed cases of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Results were particularly strong in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1, which Opdivo targets in order to destroy the cancer cell's ability to protect itself from the immune system. Some 90% of those patients taking Yervoy every 12 weeks along with Opdivo every two weeks were still alive after a year. Among those patients with greater than 50% PD-L1 expression, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 13.6 months.Merck's combination of its similar drug, Keytruda, with chemotherapy in first-line patients showed a PFS of 14 to 15 months in high PD-L1 expressors, or 10 months for patients overall. Both studies were relatively small, however, so Wall Street is still watching for the outcomes of larger studies to clarify which has the advantage.""The potential of the Opdivo + Yervoy combination remains controversial in the eyes of many investors, but we were very impressed by what we saw this weekend,"" Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote in a research note. ""We assume the positive data presented by Merck for the Keytruda + chemotherapy combination in first-line NSCLC may lead some to wonder if this may limit Bristol-Myers's potential in this indication, but we would highlight the size of the overall market and believe a degree of exclusivity for Bristol-Myers in a large portion of the market would be a significant long-term positive.""Bristol-Myers also presented positive results for the combo in gastric, colorectal and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), the latter a smaller market than NSCLC but also an underserved one. An underwhelming report from AbbVie's (ABBV) potential competitor Rova-T might also have boosted Bristol-Myers' stock Monday.Bristol-Myers stock rose as much as 3%, to 75.12, in early trading on the stock market today, touching a 17-year high for a second straight trading day. Shares closed up 1.9% at 74.29. Bristol-Myers stock hit an all-time high of 75.45 in October 1999.Merck rose 0.9%.
"
281,ABBV,"Shares of pharma major AbbVie (ABBV) were sliding Wednesday after Morgan Stanley downgraded it on concerns of increasing competition.Analyst David Risinger downgraded AbbVie stock to equal weight and lowered his price target to 65 from 73, noting that the nature of AbbVie's pipeline has become clearer since its R&D day on June 1 and its presentations on its cancer drugs over the weekend, including its negatively received report on Rova-T. In the meantime, AbbVie still depends on its immunology drug Humira, the analyst said.""With 2015 sales of $14 billion, Humira is the world's best-selling drug and generated 61% of AbbVie's 2015 total sales (and we estimate the vast majority of profits),"" Risinger wrote. ""Humira not only faces challenges from several biosimilar players (including Amgen (AMGN), Novartis' (NVS) Sandoz, and Pfizer (PFE)), but also from novel branded injectables and orals.""If AbbVie can score a string of patent litigation victories, that may allay investors' concerns, but we are unable to make that call,"" Risinger wrote.Humira's market exclusivity already suffered one setback last month, when the patent board agreed to review a challenge to a Humira patent brought by biosimilar developer Coherus Biosciences (CHRS), though that likely will take years to resolve.Risinger wrote that newer classes of drugs treating the same conditions that Humira does, including Novartis' Cosentyx and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Taltz and baricitinib, should slow down Humira's growth in the near term.This threat gained some support Wednesday, when Novartis said that among its presentations at the European League Against Rheumatism conference, running Wednesday through Saturday, are ""new long-term analyses suggesting Cosentyx may lead to higher responses than Humira in improving the signs and symptoms of people living with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) at 52 weeks."" Novartis said it will initiate head-to-head trials to confirm this.""That said, AbbVie's own novel autoimmune disease products should help offset moderation, including JAK ABT-494 and IL-23 risankizumab,"" Risinger wrote. ""We expect both to launch in 2019.""AbbVie stock fell 2.1% at the close on the stock market today, to 61.73.

285,ABBV,"AbbVie (ABBV) says that four years will pass before it begins to accrete earnings from its $5.8 billion purchase of Stemcentrx, but AbbVie stock reversed an early loss and was up early Thursday afternoon after the companies announced the acquisition.AbbVie stock fell as much as 5.2% early in the stock market today, but it was up a fraction, near 61, in afternoon trading, 15% off a record high of 71.60 set July 21.South San Francisco, Calif.-based Stemcentrx's lead late-stage asset is called rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T), and it's already in registrational trials for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). AbbVie says that it will pay $2 billion of the $5.8 billion purchase price in cash and the rest in stock. Stemcentrx will also receive up to $4 billion in cash milestone payments.""AbbVie expects this transaction to be approximately (20 cents) dilutive to our ongoing earnings per share in 2016, with accretion beginning in 2020,"" the company said in its announcement, lowering its 2016 EPS guidance to $4.62 from $4.82.AbbVie said that it would execute an ""accelerated"" share repurchase program of up to $4 billion as soon as the completion of the purchase, which is expected this quarter.Meanwhile, AbbVie early Thursday reported Q1 earnings that beat Wall Street estimates while falling a tad short on revenue. AbbVie said that it earned $1.15 per share minus items in Q1, up 22% and two cents better than analysts expected, on $5.958 billion in sales, up 18%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $5.966 billion.Global Humira sales rose 19% excluding foreign exchange impacts, AbbVie said. Humira is AbbVie's best seller, generating 60% of total revenue. It treats immunological disorders, primarily rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.In a Thursday research note to investors, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum cited an approximately 7%, $151 million beat on U.S. Humira sales as ""largely offset"" by a $111 million miss on global Viekira revenue, ""primarily driven by a U.S. miss, possibly due to competition from Merck (MRK) as well."" AbbVie put total Humira sales at $3.577 billion for Q1, with U.S. sales up 32% to $2.195 billion.Viekira, which treats hepatitis C, is AbbVie's No. 2 drug, generating $414 million globally, or about 6.9% of total sales, AbbVie said.AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez said the purchase of Stemcentrx is a mark of AbbVie's ""innovation in oncology, a critical component of our long-term growth and an area of significant need to millions of patients worldwide.""Stemcentrx's trial drug Rova-T, which has been submitted to the FDA for breakthrough therapy designation too, is under investigation as a third-line treatment in SCLC, which has no approved therapy, AbbVie said.""Rova-T is the first predictive, biomarker-based therapy associated with drug efficacy in small-cell lung cancer, and that is a big deal for this difficult disease,"" Charles Rudin, chief of thoracic oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said in AbbVie's announcement.Stemcentrx also has four novel compounds in clinical trials for triple-negative breast cancer, ovarian cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer, other compounds ""advancing toward clinical trials in 2016, and a proprietary technology platform that leverages stem cell biology to identify and screen potential targets against live tumor tissue to more predictably advance discovery and development of new assets,"" AbbVie said.Brian Slingerland is privately held Stemcentrx's co-founder and CEO. Scott Dylla is co-founder and chief scientific officer.

286,ABBV,"Big biotech Amgen (AMGN) beat Wall Street's Q1 estimates and raised guidance Thursday after the close, though its stock went sideways in after-hours trading. Its peer Gilead Sciences (GILD), however, was down sharply after a weak quarter.Amgen reported adjusted earnings of $2.90 a share, up 17% from the year-earlier quarter and 30 cents ahead of analysts' consensus, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue increased 10% to $5.53 billion, more than $200 million above consensus.The company lifted its full-year guidance, though not by quite as much as the Q1 beat. Its EPS range is now $10.85 to $11.20, up from $10.60 to $11. The revenue guide is $22.2 billion to $22.6 billion, vs. $22 billion to $22.5 billion.Last year, Amgen made $10.38 in EPS on $21.66 billion in revenue.Amgen's best-selling drug Enbrel, for rheumatoid arthritis, beat expectations by growing 24% to $1.39 billion, almost $140 million above consensus, according to Evercore ISI. Its second-biggest drug Neulasta, for neutropenia, modestly beat estimates by gaining 4% to $1.18 billion.On the other hand, some of Amgen's newer drugs came up short. Cancer drug Kyprolis grew 43% but was still $19 million shy of consensus with $154 million in sales, while newly launched cholesterol drug Repatha continued its underperformance with a $16 million take.Gilead, meanwhile, reported earnings of $3.03 a share excluding one-time items, up 3% from last year's Q1 and 12 cents below Wall Street's average estimate. Revenue rose 2.6% to $7.79 billion, about $325 million below consensus.Gilead nonetheless made no change to its full-year guidance, calling for $30 billion to $31 billion in product sales and 88% to 90% gross margin.Gilead's blockbuster hepatitis C drugs Harvoni and Sovaldi accounted for most of the shortfall, though for opposite reasons: Harvoni missed badly in the U.S. but outperformed abroad, while Sovaldi did the opposite. Earlier in the day, AbbVie (ABBV) reported that Harvoni's chief competitor Viekira also came up short of consensus, which the company attributed to Merck's (MRK) unexpectedly aggressive pricing of recently launched rival Zepatier. (Merck will report its Q1 on May 5.)The quarter also brought a screeching halt to Gilead's two-year stretch of double- or triple-digit sales and profit growth, starting with the Dec. 2013 launch of Sovaldi. Analysts expect growth will totally flatten unless the company makes a transformative acquisition.Gilead stock was down more than 6% after hours Thursday, after it closed the regular session down 3.7%, at 97.

287,ABBV,"Big money was moving in the medical field Thursday as three giant companies announced -- or attempted -- multibillion-dollar buyouts.Abbott Laboratories (ABT) announced an agreement to acquire fellow cardiac-device maker St. Jude Medical (STJ) in a deal worth $25 billion. Meanwhile, AbbVie (ABBV), which used to be Abbott's biopharma division before it was spun out, agreed to buy biotech Stemcentrx, for $5.8 billion upfront and up to $4 billion in milestone payments.Another cancer-focused biotech, Medivation (MDVN) confirmed that it had received an unsolicited $9.3 billion bid from big pharma Sanofi (SNY) after weeks of rumors.Abbott agreed to pay $46.75 plus 0.8708 Abbott share for every St. Jude share. Based on Abbott's five-day average share price, the deal valued St. Jude stock at $85 apiece.Abbott said the deal will add 21 cents to its EPS next year and 28 cents the following year. It expects to save $500 million in costs from the combination by 2020. Abbott will also assume or refinance St. Jude's $5.7 billion in debt.The move will greatly enlarge Abbott's cardiovascular device business, which now represents 19% of its revenue.""St. Jude Medical's strong positions in heart failure devices, atrial fibrillation and cardiac rhythm management complement Abbott's leading positions in coronary intervention and transcatheter mitral repair,"" Abbott said in a press release. ""Together, the company will compete in nearly every area of the cardiovascular market and hold the No. 1 or No. 2 positions across large and high-growth cardiovascular device markets.""Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy agreed. St. Jude's flat-to-negative sales growth over the last few years picked up to 8% in Q1, and she wrote in a research note that it's set up to continue, while Abbott looked to be growing only in the low single digits.Nonetheless, Abbott's share fell 7.8% to close at 40.42, while St. Jude's rose 25.6% to 77.79.IBD's Take: How healthy is Abbott  Labs' stock? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupAbbVie and Sanofi, meanwhile, are both big pharmas looking to fill out their pipelines with innovative drugs as their lead products face slowdowns. AbbVie's immunology drug Humira is one of the best-selling drugs in the world, but it patents could start expiring inside of five years. Sanofi has had to scale back expectations for its diabetes franchise as the increasingly competitive space has pushed down prices.Stemcentrx's lead late-stage asset is called rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T), and it's already in registrational trials for small-cell lung cancer. AbbVie says that it will pay $2 billion of the $5.8 billion purchase price in cash and the rest in stock. Stemcentrx will also receive up to $4 billion in cash milestone payments if the drug successfully clears its regulatory and development hurdles. In the meantime, however, it will be a financial drain.""AbbVie expects this transaction to be approximately (20 cents) dilutive to our ongoing earnings per share in 2016, with accretion beginning in 2020,"" the company said in its announcement, lowering its 2016 EPS guidance to $4.62 from $4.82.Meanwhile, AbbVie early Thursday reported Q1 earnings that beat Wall Street estimates while falling a tad short on revenue.

Medivation has been the subject of takeover rumors in recent weeks, with AstraZeneca (AZN) and Sanofi among the rumored suitors.Medivation's sole commercial product is prostate-cancer drug Xtandi, marketed by Japan's Astellas. Xtandi's success since its 2012 launch has helped drive Medivation's stock to an excellent Composite Rating of 98.The proposed purchase price represents a premium of over 50% to Medivation’s two-month volume weighted average price before the buyout talk began, Sanofi said. Medivation stock rose 7.9% Thursday to 56.18, suggesting that investors think that bids will go higher. Sanofi stock finished down 1.8%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

288,ABBV,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT) agreed to buy St. Jude Medical (STJ) in a deal that values the maker of heart devices at $25 billion, making its biggest ever acquisition as the industry consolidates to gain bargaining power with hospitals.St. Jude Medical shareholders will receive $46.75 in cash and 0.8708 share of Abbott common stock, representing a total of approximately $85 per share, according to a statement Thursday.Medical devices makers are merging to get access to new technology as hospitals push for lower prices. St. Jude last year acquired Thoratec for $3.4 billion, adding left ventricular pump devices that take over for a failing heart.The combined Abbott-St. Jude medical company will have a pipeline of new medical device products across cardiovascular, diabetes, vision and neuromodulation patient care, according to the statement.Abbott said in the statement it has financing for both St. Jude Medical and for its planned acquisition of Alere (ALR) for $5.8 billion, sending Alere shares higher in early trading on the stock market today. Abbott Chief Executive Officer Miles White declined to reiterate his commitment to the Alere deal last week on the company’s earnings call. Alere hasn’t yet filed its 10-K report with U.S. regulators and has been subpoenaed by the Justice Department.St. Jude Medical closed Wednesday at $61.95, giving the company a market value of about $17.6 billion. The stock jumped to $78.66 before the markets opened in New York. Abbott dropped 5 percent to $41.65 in early trading, while Alere rose 3.5 percent to $44.35.The acquisition will further reshape Abbott, which split off its brand name pharmaceutical business to AbbVie (ABBV) in 2013. Since then, the company has shied away from major acquisitions and pursued many smaller deals, even as the CEO talked often about his desire for larger purchases.Abbott has cash on hand, obtained by selling its generic drug business for medicines marketed in Europe and the developed world to Mylan (MYL).

289,ABBV,"Horizon Pharma (HZNP) offered up worse-than-expected sales guidance Tuesday morning for its first and second quarters, sending shares gapping below their 50-day line.The drugmaker delivered a Q1 net sales guidance range indicating 79% year-over-year growth at its midpoint, and a Q2 net sales outlook of 35% growth at the midpoint -- both well below current estimates for 138% in Q1 revenue gains and 51% in Q2 growth from the previous year.Management said in its Q4 earnings call that it sees Q1 having ""the highest operating expenses as a percentage of sales for the year, with leverage building as we move throughout the year. This will result in a lower adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin in the first quarter, which we would expect to sequentially increase as we move through the year.""Horizon also confirmed full-year 2016 sales guidance of $1.025 billion-$1.05 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters anticipate $1.03 billion in revenue for the year.Shares slid crashed 26.3% on the stock market today, slicing downward through the key moving average. The stock has been trading below its 200-day level since September.The company is a member of IBD's Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group, joined by AbbVie (ABBV), Pfizer (PFE) and group leader Zoetis (ZTS).AbbVie shares rose 2.4%, Pfizer 0.2% and Zoetis 0.7%.RELATED:‘Egregious’ Depomed Soars After Activist Starboard Targets Drugmaker.

290,ABBV,"Update: Apple (AAPL) stock rose 1.2% to 111.75 on Wednesday morning, retaking its 200-day moving average after several big-cap peers did so on Tuesday. But can the iPhone maker finally close above this level, and turn resistance into support?* * *Netflix (NFLX), Schlumberger (SLB), AbbVie (ABBV) and MasterCard (MA) all rose above their 200-day moving averages Tuesday, while Apple shares continued to close just below that support level.It's not a huge surprise that several big-cap stocks retook their 200-day lines. The Nasdaq also did so on Tuesday. The Dow and S&P 500 have been above that level for weeks. Still, it's a key step on the road to recovery.Netflix, which reports Q1 earnings on Monday, rose 4.2% on the stock market today to 107, its best level since late January. Netflix had run into resistance for several sessions just below  the 200-day. Netflix has been consolidating since peaking at 133.27 on Dec. 7.  (Netflix jumped 3.3% Wednesday morning to its highest since mid-January.)Schlumberger rallied along with the energy sector, as crude futures rose above $42 a barrel to a 4-month high. Schlumberger rose 2.7% Tuesday to 75.90, topping its 200-day line for the time since last June. (Schlumberger rose fractionally Wednesday morning.)AbbVie rose 2.4% Tuesday, just getting above its 200-day line. It hasn't been consistently held above that level since last August. Late Monday, the FDA approved a leukemia drug by AbbVie and Roche (RHHBY) unit Genentech. (Wednesday morning, AbbVie fell 1.6%, once again dropping below the 200-day.)MasterCard rose 0.4% Tuesday to 93.86. The stock has been finding support at or above its 200-day line for the past few weeks. The stock is forming a cup-with-handle base going back to Nov. 11.  (On Wednesday morning, MasterCard rose 1%.)As for Apple, shares rose 1.3% to 110.44 on Tuesday, just below the 200-day line at 110.78. Apple crossed its 200-day on April 4 intraday, but has yet to close above that level since early November, and then only briefly.

291,ABBV,"It was a busy week for business, economic and investing news. The stock market came under more pressure as Apple (AAPL) reported its first sales decline since 2003, while Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN) turned on the gas. The Federal Reserve signaled it's in no rush to raise rates, while the U.S. economy crawls.The market rally came under more pressure amid a slew of earnings reports and big economic news. The Nasdaq tumbled 2.7% for the week, falling through its 200-day line on Thursday and its 50-day average on Friday, as losers such as Apple, Twitter (TWTR) and First Solar (FSLR) trumped big gains for Facebook and Amazon. The S&P 500 and Dow are well above those support levels, but also tumbled, with all of the losses coming Thursday-Friday. Oil prices continued to march higher, helped by a weaker dollar and further declines in U.S. production. The 10-year Treasury yield gave up much of its recent gains.How healthy are shares of Amazon and Facebook, and how do they compare to rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupThe tech titan certainly wasn't a growth company in its fiscal second quarter, reporting its first revenue decline since 2003 as iPhone unit sales tumbled. Earnings per share fell 18%, worse than expected. And Apple gave weak guidance for the current quarter. Apple hasn't had a huge product since the big-screen iPhone 6, and smartphone sales generally are stagnating. At this point Apple is so huge it will be hard for a new product to really move the needle.In another sign of its shift from rapid growth to a more mature model, Apple added an additional $50 billion to its shareholder return program, with more buybacks and a higher dividend.Meanwhile, activist investor Carl Icahn decided to cash out of Apple stock, and so did others. Apple stock fell 11.3% for the week, nearly settling at its worst close since mid-2014.Apple chip suppliers generally fared relatively well, in part due to diversifying away from Apple or smartphones generally.Apple Investors Worry Glory Days Are OverThe Federal Reserve, as expected, voted to leave interest rates unchanged at its latest policy meeting and gave no hints that it would tighten before the fall at the earliest. The Fed noted that labor markets have strengthened even as economic growth slowed. And that's true, for now. The U.S. economy rose at a 0.5% annual rate in the first quarter, the weakest in two years. Meanwhile, jobless claims are near 42-year lows. If the economy is barely growing, it's hard to see how the U.S. can continue to add 200,000 jobs a month. But that's what analysts are expecting in Friday's April employment report.The Fed's go-slow approach -- coupled with the Bank of Japan's unexpected decision not to increase its stimulus efforts -- pushed the dollar to big losses. That could boost U.S. multinationals' profits and give a further lift to dollar-priced oil and other commodities.The e-commerce giant sees Q2 sales of $28 billion-$30.5 billion, largely above Wall St. views and a 26% gain at the midpoint. While that would mark a slowdown from Q1's 28% pop, the highest in nearly 4 years, it would still be faster than what was typical the past three years. Q1 earnings also crushed estimates, as cloud unit Amazon Web Services remained hot. China's version of Amazon, Alibaba (BABA), reports Thursday.Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google, Ford Motor (F), Uber, Lyft and Volvo announced Tuesday the formation of a coalition to advocate for self-driving cars. The lobbying effort comes as automakers race to develop autonomous technologies. Alphabet is in late-stage talks with Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) about a partnership regarding autonomous cars, according to multiple reports. Meanwhile, Tesla Motors (TSLA) already has self-driving features in its electric cars, but has not unveiled plans to join the coalition. Tesla will report earnings on Wednesday, with autonomous tech firm Mobileye (MBLY) out Thursday.Social networking kings Facebook and LinkedIn had a good week, as both posted Q1 earnings that topped estimates and sent the stocks higher. Facebook reported its third straight quarter of accelerating earnings and revenue growth. Despite concerns about slowing user engagement, advertisers are definitely using Facebook. Mobile advertising accounted for 82% of Facebook's $5.2 billion in ad revenue, up from 73% in Q1 2015. Facebook stock spiked Thursday to a record high of 120.71, but pulled back to close the week modestly above a 117.09 buy point.LinkedIn renewed investor confidence after a harrowing Q4 that saw its stock plunge 44%. LinkedIn turned in a solid Q1 earnings that investors applauded.With the U.S. and global economy growing at a tepid pace, companies are stressing cost cuts to prop up earnings as revenue flatlines or falls. In the latest week, defense contractor Lockheed Martin, snack giant  Mondelez International (MDLZ) and Procter & Gamble (PG) announced recent or new efforts to curb expenses, restructure or sell assets. They join the likes of Coca-Cola (KO)  and banking giants JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC). While cuts may help companies in the short run, they need stronger top-line growth to fuel earnings longer term.Shifting priorities for media companies came into play last week, as a handful of megamergers captured the spotlight and served as an attempt to keep growing or simply cling to survival. Cable and content titan Comcast (CMCSA) sought to grow in foreign markets via a $3.8 billion deal to buy DreamWorks Animation (DWA), the studio responsible for ""Shrek"" and ""Kung Fu Panda."" Meanwhile, it looks like Comcast rival Charter Communications (CHTR) will be able to keep up, as its $55 billion bid to buy Time Warner Cable (TWC) won regulatory approval. But survival in the struggling newspaper industry was on the mind of USA Today parent Gannett (GCI) as it bid $815 million to buy Tribune Publishing (TPUB), owner of the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune.Crude oil futures continued to rise, hitting 2016 highs. But Big Oil is still adjusting to lower prices. Saudi Arabia aims to reduce its oil dependence and float less than 5% of Saudi Aramco in an IPO, valuing the world’s largest oil company in excess of $2 trillion Meanwhile,  ConocoPhillips (COP) slashed its 2016 capital spending even further and BP (BP) said it was considering further cuts in '17.  Baker Hughes (BHI) warned that N. American rig counts still have room to fall, but the U.S. count may stabilize later this year. Chevron (CVX) swung to a loss in Q1. While U.S. production falls overall, output for most majors rose even as investment fell. Exxon (XOM) lost its AAA rating at S&P, but still kept its commitment to its dividend, raising it to 75 cents from 73 cents.Quarterly results from shale players Continental Resources (CLR), EOG (EOG) and Carrizo (CRZO) are out this week.Medical merger activity took off Thursday. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) inked a $25 billion buyout deal with cardiac device giant St. Jude Medical (STJ). Abbott's former biopharma arm AbbVie (ABBV) agreed to buy biotech startup Stemcentrx for $5.8 billion plus up to $4 billion in possible milestone payments. Big French pharma Sanofi (SNY) made an unsolicited $9.3 billion cash bid for smaller drugmaker Medivation (MDVN). Medivation rejected Sanofi's offer, but Sanofi vowed to press on, and Medivation's stock traded as if investors are expecting Sanofi (and perhaps another bidder) to go higher. Both Stemcentrx and Medivation are focused on cancer treatments, a field that has provided some of the biggest drug launches of recent years.Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) recovery might be slow-going, with April same-store sales down 26% to date, surprising many. The burrito king logged its first-ever quarterly loss -- of 88 cents per share -- in Q1, though Wall Street expected worse. A revenue decline to $834.5 million missed views, as comps plummeted 29.7%.But another fast-casual chain, Panera Bread (PNRA), reported strong results. Its stock is setting up in a short consolidation going back to March 8.Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) turned in mixed results, Domino's Pizza (DPZ) missed completely and Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) edged past forecasts.

292,ABBV,"Most U.S. stocks retreated as investors dived into haven assets including gold and the dollar after deadly terrorist attacks in Brussels killed at least 31 people. The Nasdaq composite index edged higher as drugmakers climbed.While transport-related shares led the Standard & Poor’s 500 index lower, the benchmark’s losses were eased somewhat by advances in health-care and technology companies. The pound slid amid speculation that the explosions at a Brussels airport departure hall and a downtown subway station may boost the case for Britain to leave the European Union. Gold advanced for the first time in four days and yields on 10-year German bunds touched their lowest level in almost two weeks. Treasuries fell as Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago chief Charles Evans called U.S. economic fundamentals “really quite good.”The S&P 500 fell 0.1% to 2,049.80, with the gauge still trading near its highest level of the year. Transportation stocks posted the biggest decline out of 24 groups, with Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) and Carnival (CUK) losing at least 2.1%. Biotechnology and technology hardware companies, such as Apple (AAPL), Amgen (AMGN) and Abbvie (ABBV), contributed the most to gains in the benchmark measure Tuesday.The Nasdaq composite index rose 0.3% in its fifth straight gain to cap its longest advance in 11 months.Activity was light again in this holiday-shortened week after Monday marked the lowest U.S. volumes this year. Trading on U.S. exchange listed shares was 26% below the three-month average. That follows two of 2016’s slowest sessions -- last Monday and Tuesday before the Fed’s March meeting. U.S. stock markets will be closed for a holiday Friday.The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the greenback against 10 major peers, added 0.1% in a third day of gains. The gauge slid 1.3% last week after the Fed dialed back its outlook for interest-rate increases this year. The presidents of the San Francisco and Atlanta Feds said Monday that tighter borrowing conditions could be warranted as soon as April,  given improvements in the U.S. economy.Benchmark German bunds rose, while Belgian bonds were little changed. Ten-year German yields fell as much as five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 0.18%, while the rate on Belgian debt due in a decade dropped two basis points to 0.6%.Yields on similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries added three basis points to 1.94%, after falling to as low as 1.88%.

294,ABBV,"A drug candidate that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) jointly developed has beaten AbbVie's (ABBV) best-selling rheumatoid-arthritis (RA) drug in a late-stage study, the companies said Friday.Regeneron and Sanofi said that their monoclonal antibody sarilumab met the trial's main goal of improving symptoms after 24 weeks of a biweekly dosing regimen. Some 72% of patients on sarilumab achieved at least a 20% improvement in signs and symptoms based on American College of Rheumatology criteria, in contrast to 58% of the patients in the Humira group. Both groups experienced about the same rate of negative side effects, though the sarilumab group showed a higher rate of neutropenia, or lowering of white blood cells.Humira is currently the top-selling RA drug and, indeed, the top-selling drug of any kind in the world today, but its number of competitors is rising. Last fall baricitinib, a drug that Eli Lilly (LLY) and Incyte (INCY) co-developed, also beat Humira in a head-to-head trial; unlike the injectable Humira and sarilumab, it is delivered orally. Roche's (RHHBY) intravenous medicine Actemra has also bested Humira in trials.Regeneron and Sanofi have already applied for FDA approval of sarilumab based on earlier data, with a decision due by Oct. 30.RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt called the news a ""modest positive"" but added that investors are still concerned with some nearer-term issues with Regeneron's stock. Among them is a pilot program to test changes in Medicare Part B, announced this week, that could affect a great deal of the reimbursement for Regeneron's flagship drug Eylea, and a patent lawsuit that Amgen (AMGN) filed over another monoclonal antibody in the Regeneron/Sanofi partnership, Praluent.""All else being equal, beating Humira is certainly better than not beating it, but at least some of the discussed overhangs may need clearing before the pipeline receives more credit,"" wrote Butt in a research note.By late morning on the stock market today, AbbVie stock was up almost 3% near 58. Sanofi was up 2% near 41, while Regeneron stock was up a fraction near 381.

295,ABBV,"Big pharma AbbVie (ABBV) said Monday that it was acquiring rights to two immunology drugs developed by German counterpart Boehringer Ingelheim, but its stock was flat as Goldman Sachs warned of increasing competition.AbbVie agreed to pay $595 million upfront plus undisclosed milestone payments and royalties for the right to commercialize BI 655066, a drug in late-stage testing for psoriasis, and in earlier testing for Crohn's disease, psoriatic arthritis and asthma. A phase-two trial comparing BI 655066 head to head with Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Remicade found that after nine months of treatment, 69% of patients on Boehringer's drug had clear or almost clear skin, compared with 30% in the Remicade arm.AbbVie also acquired rights to BI 655064, an earlier-stage drug that attacks the CD40 protein, which may be connected to lupus nephritis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. AbbVie said in its press release that it will decide whether to go forward with that drug ""after completion of certain undisclosed clinical achievements.""AbbVie said that its success in developing and commercializing Humira, currently the world's top-selling immunology drug, gives it the expertise to do the same with Boehringer's products. Humira is nearing the end of its patent life, leading to much speculation on Wall Street about when biosimilar competitors might launch and how much of an impact they might have.Goldman Sachs analyst Salveen Richter took a pessimistic view of the matter Monday, saying that the current political focus on lowering drug prices will probably encourage cheap Humira knock-offs.""We are not changing our 2016-2020 AbbVie forecasts and continue to believe that Humira will remain a durable asset free of U.S. biosimilars, at least until the end of the decade,"" Richter wrote as he removed AbbVie stock from his Conviction Buy list and cut his price target to 68 from 80.  ""However, we adjust our terminal value growth rate (from +1% to 0%) and model a faster decline curve post introduction of Humira biosimilars in the U.S. after 2020 through 2025.""AbbVie stock fell as much as 2.4% in early trading on the stock market today, but by midday it was flat, near 56.Meanwhile, Richter put BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN) on his Conviction Buy list in AbbVie's place, setting his price target at 129.BioMarin, Richter noted, has guided that it will go into the black next year even without a contribution of its recently FDA-rejected muscular-dystrophy drug Kyndrisa, ""showing opex restraint and a commitment to profitability."" He added that several data releases this year could bring upside for medications including BioMarin's gene therapy for hemophilia and treatments for the rare diseases achondroplasia and phenylketonuria.BioMarin stock was up 2.5% midday Monday, near 89.Image provided by Shutterstock.

296,ABBV,"U.S. companies are still desirable, but less popular targets for those in an acquisitive mood as the first quarter comes to a close.Mergers in the U.S. are down 40% year-over-year, marking the nation's lowest total global share for the January-March time frame since 2012, despite the competing bids to buy Starwood Hotels (HOT), according to Dealogic.U.S. target mergers and acquisitions volume totaled $248.2 billion, a 40% reduction from the $415.4 billion last year. U.S. target M&A comprised 36% of total volume during the quarter.Overall, global M&A volume fell 25% compared with a year ago, slipping to $701.5 billion. The number of deals has fallen 19% to 8,347. It's a year of tough comparisons, as 2015's first quarter at $934.5 billion was the biggest for deal making since 2007's record high of $1.1 trillion.Mergers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) fell 19% to $217.9 billion, the least of the three major global regions that Dealogic tracks. EMEA-targeted M&A comprises 31% of the global total, its highest quarterly share since the second quarter of 2013. Asia-Pacific targeted mergers comprises 28% with $195.9 billion of the global total, on par with 2015's first quarter.Chinese companies are among those with the biggest appetites for deal making, with ChemChina's $48 billion bid to buy Syngenta (SYT) being the largest on record for the quarter. The Johnson Controls (JCI) bid to buy Tyco International (TYC) for $16.6 billion is the quarter's largest U.S. telecom deal. Overall, telecom deals fell 50% to $39.7 billion via 151 deals, its lowest first-quarter volume since 2012.Starwood Hotels (HOT) finds itself in the middle of a merger love triangle, of sorts, with China's Anbang Insurance's $14.7 billion bid competing with Marriott International's (MAR) $13.6 billion bid for its rival hotel chain. The dining and lodging sector had its biggest first quarter for mergers since 2006, with $25.6 billion via 198 announced deals, much of the total dollar amount boosted by the Starwood bid.Technology was the quarter's top sector with $100.3 billion spent on 2,115 deals, up 10% year over year -- and containing its highest first quarter since 2000's $190.8 billion. Real estate was the second-largest sector, with $69.5 billion on 440 deals, though that was down 22% compared with 2015.Health care mergers plunged 56% to $58.7 billion, its lowest volume in four years, though it's the victim of tough comparisons as the sector had back-to-back record-breaking years in 2014 and 2015.Oil and gas volume was $24.9 billion via 208 deals, down 41% year-over-year and its lowest volume since 2005 and its lowest first-quarter activity since 2003. TransCanada's (TRP) $13.2 billion purchase of Columbia Pipeline (CPGX) is the biggest Canadian outbound deal in the energy sector on record.Finance M&A total $58.4 billion via 470 deals, making up 8% of the global total, its highest Q1 share since 2012. In that sector, Deutsche Boerse's $14.3 billion deal to acquire London Stock Exchange Group is the largest securities and commodity exchange targeted M&A on record.Goldman Sachs (GS) led global M&A among banks who advised on deals with $214.2 billion, followed by JPMorgan Chase (JPM) with $153.1 billion and UBS (UBS) with $98.7 billion.In comparison, some of the megadeals during the first quarter of 2015 were the $46 billion merger of Kraft Heinz (KHC), AbbVie's (ABBV) $21 billion bid for Pharmacyclics, and UnitedHealth Group's (UNH) $12.8 billion deal to buy pharmacy benefits manager Catamaran.

298,ABBV,"During the drug-stock boom, the newer biotech companies tended to get the most play as growth stocks. But last year, one of the top-performing large-cap drugmakers was none other than 140-year-old Eli Lilly.Like other big pharmas, Lilly (LLY) has spent the last few years climbing out of an earnings trough brought on by the loss of patent protection on some of its biggest drugs. While growth is still slow, investors have gotten ever more interested in the company's pipeline:Lilly's late-stage drug candidate solanezumab could bring a breakthrough in a currently untreatable disease -- Alzheimer's.Psoriasis treatment ixekizumab is expected to launch anytime now and eventually achieve blockbuster sales. Another immunology drug, baricitinib, which Lilly co-developed with Incyte (INCY), was also recently filed with the FDA.Meanwhile, the already marketed diabetes drug Jardiance shocked Wall Street last year by reducing deaths from heart failure by 32% in a large-scale study called Empa-Reg.Recently, Lilly CEO John Lechleiter sat down with IBD to explain Lilly's strategy for 2016 and beyond.IBD: I'm interested in your immunology strategy. Given that there are a lot of medicines out there in that area, how do you see yourself fitting into the space?Lechleiter: Well, I think the only way we can enter that space -- and lay claim to any of these disease areas -- is to offer something better. And I believe the data we have on ixekizumab, which is our anti-IL17 antibody for psoriasis, is excellent. You look at clearance rates: 31% to 41% of people across three studies had 100% clearance of their plaque. So while there are competitors there, we feel very good about the profile of that product.I think with baricitinib, in four studies we established, in one of them superiority to methotrexate, which is the current first-line standard of care; and in another study, superiority in terms of signs and symptoms of RA (rheumatoid arthritis) to (AbbVie's (ABBV)) Humira, which is the biggest drug in the world.I think we’re bringing something new to these categories. In the case of RA, we know people cycle between different courses of therapy, and I think there’s no question, even with the drugs we have in that space today, there’s still an unmet need.IBD: In the diabetes area, you have this impressive data from Jardiance, and people are wondering is this going to be a class effect? If it is, do you have a point of differentiation?Lechleiter: Well, I think first of all, the people (who are) asking if it’s a class effect (meaning the entire class of drugs would all perform the same) are the people who don’t have Jardiance. The fact is, we have the data. Anything else about any of the other ones is speculation. So I think the advantage we have is first-mover advantage. Obviously, as soon as we get the label changed, we will exercise that. We filed that with the FDA ... (and) expect to get updated labeling reflecting the outcome of Empa-Reg later this year.IBD: The overall diabetes market has been under pressure lately. Sanofi (SNY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) have been warning of slower growth. Is this true of the market in general or just certain segments?Lechleiter: I think that several categories are still growing in the diabetes space. It’s very competitive. Each of these drug categories has three or four different players. We happen to be the only company that has a complete spectrum across the treatment paradigm, along with Boehringer Ingelheim.The growth of insulins is slowing a bit, because we believe that more and more people using insulin are using an sglt2 inhibitor like Jardiance that are lowering insulin requirements. So I think there’s some interplay between the drugs. But we also know that SGLT2 category growth is coming at the expense, in many cases, of generic sulfonylureas. So that brand category is expanding.I think from a market standpoint, there’s a lot of competition. That’s great for consumers (and) great for physicians. But it remains for us to differentiate our products and to compete in that mix.IBD: Building the complete portfolio of diabetes medicines -- what is the advantage of that? Is it a marketing advantage?Lechleiter: Well, at a fundamental level, we can work with physicians to address, “What’s the right drug for a given patient?” vs. “How do you fit the patient into our drug?” if that makes sense. Let’s understand, diabetes is a progressive disease. So understanding where the patient is in that journey, and how our medicines can best help the patient. We can be agnostic about what choice a physician makes, because we have an offering at every step of the way.Ultimately, we can also, hopefully, better understand what the right combinations are. We have a fixed-dose combination of a DPP4 along with Jardiance -- we’re the only company that offers that today. We have not just orals, we have insulins. We have not just insulins, but our GLP-1 drug Trulicity. So I think there’s some advantages in terms of being able to optimize treatment. And ultimately there may be some marketplace advantages to having a full basket of products -- if you think about negotiating with payers and insurers, for example.IBD: In Alzheimer’s, you have different programs going. Do you anticipate there will be multiple drugs in this category?Lechleiter: First of all, if solanezumab is positive -- we’ll know by the end of the year -- that’s going to generate a tremendous amount of interest in companies developing BACE inhibitors, antibodies and other drugs. We believe that ultimately this will probably be treated with a combination, not unlike the way diabetes is treated today, not unlike the way cancer is treated. It may be an antibody with an oral BACE inhibitor, for example. But we’re also developing agents that act against tau (protein), which is a downstream aspect of the disease progression.It remains to be seen, but our best guess is that it will be a combination. If (solanezumab) is successful, others will follow, and we aim to be in that group.IBD: In oncology, again I’m thinking about your positioning -- there's been lot of drug industry activity in cancer. Can you talk about your strategy?Lechleiter: The pillar of our oncology business, going back eight or nine years ago, was Alimta, and it still is today. We bought ImClone in October of 2008. We’ve had two drugs approved from that ImClone pipeine: Cyramza, which now has four indications -- two gastric cancers, colorectal cancer and lung cancer -- and then late last year we got approval for Portrazza, and that’s indicated for squamous-cell non-small-cell lung cancer. And that’s a type of lung cancer that, in the first line, has not seen an improvement in survival for 20 years. So we’re excited about that.We have a third ImClone product that we’ve commenced filing with the FDA, called olaratumab. That is for soft-tissue sarcoma. Behind that we have three drugs in the clinic today that have immune-system components associated with them, as we begin to build an immuno-oncology portfolio. We also have a drug that I think everyone is excited about called abemaciclib. That’s a CDK4/6 inhibitor. We’ll have the phase-two data for breast cancer this year. We also have a phase-three (trial) underway. We also have a phase-three underway for our CDK4/6 inhibitor in lung cancer.So we’re focused on immuno-oncology, microenvironment -- which would be Cyramza, in other words anti-angiogenesis drugs -- and cell cycle inhibitors. So it’s a three-pronged approach, and I think we’ve got a good portfolio of products in the pipeline to address all three.

301,ABBV,"Big biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) beat analysts' Q4 estimates Tuesday but its guidance was soft, sending the stock up more than 1% in after-hours trading, in a day when several large drugmakers reported.Gilead's earnings rose 37% over the year-earlier quarter to $3.32 per share, topping analysts' EPS consensus by 32 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue increased 16% to $8.51 billion, vs. analysts' expectation of $8.13 billion.For the full year, EPS rose 56% to $12.61 while revenue gained 31% to $32.64 billion.Gilead guided 2016 product sales, which covers nearly all revenue, at $30 billion to $31 billion. Analysts had expected $30.68 billion in product sales and total revenue of $31.68 billion. Gilead does not provide total revenue or EPS guidance, but it did provide guidance on expenses, which were slightly above expectations on the R&D and sales, general and administrative lines. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum calculated that the implied EPS guidance for 2016 is $10.48 to $11.92, which would miss consensus of $12.23.In Q4, the hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni both beat estimates, though entirely due to sales outside the U.S., where analysts have less visibility. Next year's expected revenue decline is due to an anticipated decline in U.S. HCV market, which had an enormous lift-off when the two drugs were approved but has flattened as ever-larger numbers of patients have been cured of the disease.On the conference call with analysts, commercial-operations chief Paul Carter said that they could expect the HCV market in 2016 to behave similarly to how it did in the second half of 2015, essentially flat in the U.S. while growing in foreign markets where it is still being launched. He said that it might see some growth as payers seem to be loosening their restrictions on the drugs, which initially strained their finances due to their high prices and the enormous volume of patients. However, he acknowledged that revenue per patient was likely to fall as less-sick patients came aboard, requiring shorter treatments.Carter also sounded confident about Gilead's ability to fend off competition, which got a new entrant last week when Merck's (MRK) Zepatier was approved last week and priced well below both Gilead's and AbbVie's (ABBV) HCV drugs.""We're confident our label is very strong, and we're very much supported by the real-world data we've seen since the launch of Harvoni,"" Carter said.Earlier in the day, big pharma Pfizer (PFE) said Q4 revenue rose 7% over the year-earlier quarter to $14.05 billion, beating analysts’ consensus by about $45 million. Earnings, excluding one-time items, slipped 2% to 53 cents a share, beating estimates by a penny.For the year, EPS declined 3% to $2.20, while sales slid 2% to $48.85 billion.However, Pfizer’s 2016 profit guidance missed Wall Street’s expectations of $2.20 to $2.30 a share. Analyst Schoenebaum blamed foreign-exchange headwinds.“Excluding a roughly negative $2.3 billion top line ($0.8 billion of top line FX impact due to Venezuela currency impact alone) and $0.16 bottom line impact due to FX, both 2016 top and bottom line guidance would have bracketed the Street,” Schoenebaum wrote in an email. “We spoke with Pfizer, and they believe that the Street underestimated the FX impact in 2016.”S&P Capital IQ analyst Jeffrey Loo raised his rating on Pfizer to buy from hold, saying the valuation has become attractive after it, like almost every other drug stock around, has sold off in recent months.""We view growth within its Global Innovative Products unit positively, driven by Prevnar 13 and Ibrance,"" Loo wrote in a research note. ""We expect its pending acquisition of Allergan (AGN) to be completed in the second half of 2016.""Pfizer stock closed down 0.1% at 30.14.Mallinckrodt (MNK) rose 5.7% to close at 65.71, after the specialty drugmaker reported fiscal-first-quarter earnings of $2.09 a share, up 17% from the year-earlier quarter and topping consensus by 31 cents. Sales climbed 19% to $914.8 million, some $25 million above the Street’s average estimate.Mallinckrodt raised its full-year EPS guidance to $7.85 to $8.30, up from $7.70 to $8.20.Baxter International (BAX), a leader in dialysis products, also beat expectations in the most recent quarter, pulling off a sharp increase in earnings despite a decline in sales. Fourth quarter profit from continuing operations jumped 54% to 43 cents a share, 11 cents past Wall Street’s consensus. Revenue dropped 7% to $2.6 billion. Baxter stock rose 1.8% Tuesday to close at 37.95.Baxter said it expects EPS this year of $1.46 to $1.54, beating consensus of $1.42.

"
361,ABBV,"Shares of big biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) were off more than 1% midday Wednesday after the attorney general of Massachusetts threatened legal action against the company for its drug pricing.The Boston Globe reported that Attorney General Maura Healey had sent a letter to Gilead saying that its pricing of hepatitis C drug Sovaldi and Harvoni ""may constitute an unfair trade practice in violation of Massachusetts law."" Sovaldi was launched in December 2013 at $84,000 for a 12-week round of treatment, while Harvoni was launched in October 2014 at $94,500 for the equivalent-length treatment, though a large minority of patients have been successfully treated for eight weeks.Gilead and its defenders have argued that the price is justified by the vast superiority of the drug over previous treatments, curing upward of 95% of patients and preventing expensive medical problems down the road. However, for Healey the curative powers of the drugs only make the high prices more egregious, since ""pricing the treatment in a manner that effectively allow (hepatitis C) to continue spreading through vulnerable populations, as opposed to eradicating the disease altogether, results in massive public harm.""The prices of Gilead's drugs have been criticized ever since their launch, and in fact a Senate investigation last year culminated in a December report saying that the prices placed an inordinate burden on state Medicaid programs, which was also the focus of Healey's letter. However, no one's been able to do anything about them expect AbbVie (ABBV), whose competing treatment Viekira Pak sparked a rebate war with Gilead after its December 2014 launch. Thus, while the drugs still have the same official price tags, they're actually selling for around 40% less.Analysts are expecting further price erosion with the arrival of Merck's (MRK) own competing treatment, which is due for an FDA decision by Thursday. Gilead has said in the last few earnings calls that the U.S. hepatitis C market has flattened, but it is planning to launch a new version of its treatment in June that could potentially treat all genotypes of the disease, thereby broadening the market.Gilead stock has been hammered since the re-ignition of the drug-price debate in the presidential race last fall, though that has focused more on practice of specialty drugmakers like Turing Pharmaceuticals and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) of raising prices on older drugs without any improvement in their quality. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform had planned a hearing on the subject for Tuesday, but the big East Coast blizzard led them to reschedule it to Feb. 4.

363,ABBV,"Alphabet, the world's Internet search leader, is prospecting beyond its core business to strike success in the health care world.The company's glucose monitoring contact lens for diabetics is inching closer to drugstore shelves, while sales of its $200 self-stabilizing spoon, designed to help people with uncontrollable hand tremors eat comfortably, topped 1,000 in the first six months.Google — which restructured last year to become the largest operating unit within a new parent, Alphabet (GOOGL) — bought biotech company Lift Labs in 2014, just a few months after the health-focused startup began product sales.Pointing to its broadening emphasis on that and other health and medical advancements, Alphabet last month renamed its Google Life Sciences division Verily Life Sciences. The division brings together clinicians and scientists and is focused on understanding and improving chronic conditions that impact massive numbers of people — health issues including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative disease and mental health.""This is a development in health care that I think is far-reaching and will be long-lasting because we are seeing a period of convergence between the technology companies and the health care companies,"" California Life Sciences Association trade group CEO Sara Radcliffe told IBD.She said changes driving health care and tech firms into partnerships include ""the explosion of Big Data"" and the resulting demand for ways to manage all that patient information.Growth of access to data via the Internet cloud and mobile technologies such as Fitbit (FIT) wearables are ""shifting health care to maintaining and tracking health, rather than simply treating disease,"" she said.Companies Teaming UpRecent notable health-tech partnerships include Alphabet's Verily division teaming up last month with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) to develop surgical robots. That news followed a September 2014 announcement that Google life-science spinoff Calico had entered a 10-year collaboration with North Chicago, Ill.-based pharmaceutical firm AbbVie (ABBV) to research age-related diseases.Verily has another partner, too. Medical device firm Dexcom linked up in Q3 with Verily to create a new class of disposable 24/7 glucose monitoring systems that are faster, cheaper and smaller than the products that are currently available.Johnson & Johnson and Verily announced last year that they had created Verb Surgical to develop a new surgical robotics device that's smaller and less expensive than the Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) da Vinci system, which now controls that minimally invasive surgery segment.Others looking to join forces across the health-tech divide include medical device maker Medtronic (MDT), which is collaborating with Big Data solutions provider IBM (IBM) Watson Health to analyze the waves of information gleaned by diabetes insulin pumps.Data Vs. DiseasesAlphabet is not the only tech heavyweight seeking to blend medical altruism with Big Data and big moneymaking plans. Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and others are also using their deep technology expertise to create medical-related products and services.This year, Apple introduced health-tracking tools that monitor users' footsteps, heart rates and sleep activities. Microsoft and Samsung already offer a number of so-called wearable devices that also allow people to monitor their daily movements.Advances in mobile computing, artificial intelligence and new analytics software are driving their efforts.""In recent years, there has been increased interest in health care applications from companies that traditionally are seen to be consumer-focused companies,"" said Iain Simpson, a drug delivery specialist at Cambridge Consultants. ""Companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook (FB) and Amazon.com (AMZN) have built consumer-focused businesses based on the creation of a compelling and sustainable user experience.""Now, Simpson said, various tech companies are heading into health, driven ""by the increasing relevance of these capabilities in a market which creates new high-value business opportunities for them, particularly when they work in collaboration with established health care players such as pharma and medical device companies.""With U.S. health care spending weighing in at $3.2 trillion in 2015 and projected to reach $5.1 trillion by 2023, according to the California Health Care Foundation, profit potential is an obvious incentive.But other factors are also at work. Part of the reason behind Alphabet's focus on moving the needle on Parkinson's treatment is personal.Google co-founder and now Alphabet president Sergey Brin's mother Eugenia has Parkinson's, and Brin himself was diagnosed in 2006 as carrying a mutation of the LRRK2 gene, which has been associated with higher rates of the degenerative disorder of the central nervous system.""Generally the pace of medical research is glacial compared to what I'm used to in the Internet,"" Brin told Wired in a 2010 interview about how Google could amplify the process. ""We could be looking lots of places and collecting lots of information. And if we see a pattern, that could lead somewhere.""Legislative changes are another factor that has helped open the door for tech firms to put their massive computing muscle into health care.Data-driven medicine is a key element of the Affordable Care Act, the federal law that ushered in President Barack Obama's health care reforms and is a major force at the center of the boom in new health technology.The law provides major financial incentives for doctors and hospitals to prove their care is effective. Those ""value-based"" payment rules are sparking demand for new software that can track and analyze patient data, says Lynne Dunbrack, research vice president at IDC Health Insights.Patients Prescribed SoftwareFor example, Dunbrack said, ""some hospitals are finding it cheaper to send Medicare patients who have congestive heart failure home with a weight scale, an electronic tablet and a connected app rather than risk too many readmissions within 30 days of discharge, which would result in the hospitals getting federal reimbursement rate cuts.""""There have been some real financial incentives for health care organizations to purchase and use these technologies, which is then helping to drive demand, and is why companies are now seeing new opportunities,"" Dunbrack said.Along with the shift to value-based care, other top areas of focus for the health care industry include sequencing the human genome and digitizing health care data, said Cowen and Co. analyst John Blackledge in a September report about Alphabet's health care strategy.All three of those health care trends ""are not occurring in a vacuum, but are being accommodated by technology advances in areas such as social, mobile, analytics and cloud computing. These are all areas of Google's expertise,"" Blackledge said.The swirl of changes and tech advances is also helping fuel medical ambitions of tech heavyweight Apple.At its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June 2014, Apple introduced a new HealthKit app, which monitors users' heart rates, sleep, weight and blood pressure, among other health-related measurements, and lets home health devices such as heart monitors and fitness monitors exchange data.

364,ABBV,"Only a few stocks remain on IBD's IPO Leaders screen, a reflection of the difficulties new issues are having in the market correction.Indexes and exchange traded funds (ETFs) tracking new issues aren't doing much better. In fact, investors would be better off picking some of the individual stocks in the screen than using funds.The IBD New Issue index is about 20% off its prior high. This week it touched the lowest level since October 2014. The index, which tracks stocks that went public in the past 15 years, has not fared much better than a couple of ETFs that follow the IPO market.First Trust U.S. IPO Index Fund (FPX) is 23% off its peak, and earlier this week it sank to its lowest level since November 2013, if you exclude the Aug. 24 mini-crash. Renaissance IPO (IPO) is 35% off its high and at all-time lows, excluding Aug. 24.Although both ETFs are flagging, the difference in their top components has affected performance.Renaissance IPO's largest holdings include stocks that have sold off sharply, such as Synchrony Financial (SYF) (nearly 11% of the fund), Alibaba (BABA) (9.8%), Citizens Financial Group (CFG) (8%) and JD.com (JD) (about 5%).  All those stocks are at least 30% below their 52-week highs.First Trust U.S. IPO's top holdings, such as Facebook (FB) (11% of the fund) and Kraft Heinz (KHC) (6.2%), are within 14% of their prior highs. AbbVie (ABBV), another top holding at 9.5%, has swooned 26% and hurt the fund relatively more.Renaissance IPO's top components had their IPOs since 2014. First Trust U.S. IPO has companies that went public farther back. General Motors (GM), certainly no new kid on the block, is on the First Trust portfolio. It started trading again after its reorganization in 2010.Within the IPO Leaders screen, Physicians Realty Trust (DOC) has faltered since it cleared the 17.23 buy point of a cup with handle last month, but shares are just 7% off the prior high.Store Capital (STOR) is near a new high, extended from a breakout past 23.23. Rexford Industrial Realty (REXR) has been trying to break out to new highs. All three stocks are real estate investment trusts, which have fared better as defensive investments.

366,ABBV,"Generic-drug giant Mylan (MYL) agreed to develop six biosimilar drugs with biotech Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA) Friday while also announcing the retirement of its CFO. Momenta got an upgrade as a result.Mylan agreed to pay $45 million upfront plus up to $200 million in milestone payments should the candidates be successful, in exchange for commercialization rights. Momenta has the option to ""co-commercialize in a supporting commercial role, any approved products in the United States,"" according to a company statement.Momenta didn't name any of the candidates expect M834, which is a biosimilar version of Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) rheumatoid arthritis drug Orencia. Orencia sold $1.7 billion last year and is projected to sell $2.7 billion by 2020, Momenta CEO Craig Wheeler said on a conference call with analysts. However, its main patent is due to expire in 2019, so Wheeler expects to launch M834 commercially in 2020.Momenta stock rose nearly 12% in early trading on the stock market today; by late afternoon, it was up more than 9%, near 15. Momenta partnered with Novartis (NVS) to launch the first U.S. biosimilar last year, but its future was uncertain after Baxalta (BXLT) decided not to pursue any more joint projects with Momenta following the development of a biosimilar of AbbVie's (ABBV) Humira.Maxim Group analyst Jason Kolbert lifted his rating on Momenta to hold from sell.""Recall that one element of our sell thesis was based on our view that a move away from complex generics (copaxone) to biosimilars was a significant transition for Momenta,"" Kolbert wrote in his research note.

368,ABBV,"Alphabet, the world's Internet search leader, is prospecting beyond its core business to strike success in the health care world. The company's glucose monitoring contact lens for diabetics is inching closer to drugstore shelves, while sales of its $200 self-stabilizing spoon, designed to help people with uncontrollable hand tremors eat comfortably, topped 1,000 in the first six months.Google — which restructured last year to become the largest operating unit within a new parent, Alphabet (GOOGL) — bought biotech company Lift Labs in 2014, just a few months after the health-focused startup began product sales.Pointing to its broadening emphasis on that and other health and medical advancements, Alphabet last month renamed its Google Life Sciences division Verily Life Sciences. The division brings together clinicians and scientists and is focused on understanding and improving chronic conditions that impact massive numbers of people — health issues including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative disease and mental health.""This is a development in health care that I think is far-reaching and will be long-lasting because we are seeing a period of convergence between the technology companies and the health care companies,"" California Life Sciences Association trade group CEO Sara Radcliffe told IBD.She said changes driving health care and tech firms into partnerships include ""the explosion of Big Data"" and the resulting demand for ways to manage all that patient information.Growth of access to data via the Internet cloud and mobile technologies such as Fitbit (FIT) wearables are ""shifting health care to maintaining and tracking health, rather than simply treating disease,"" she said.Companies Teaming UpRecent notable health-tech partnerships include Alphabet's Verily division teaming up last month with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) to develop surgical robots. That news followed a September 2014 announcement that Google life-science spinoff Calico had entered a 10-year collaboration with North Chicago, Ill.-based pharmaceutical firm AbbVie (ABBV) to research age-related diseases.Verily has another partner, too. Medical device firm Dexcom linked up in Q3 with Verily to create a new class of disposable 24/7 glucose monitoring systems that are faster, cheaper and smaller than the products that are currently available.Johnson & Johnson and Verily announced last year that they had created Verb Surgical to develop a new surgical robotics device that's smaller and less expensive than the Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) da Vinci system, which now controls that minimally invasive surgery segment.Others looking to join forces across the health-tech divide include medical device maker Medtronic (MDT), which is collaborating with Big Data solutions provider IBM (IBM) Watson Health to analyze the waves of information gleaned by diabetes insulin pumps.Data Vs. DiseasesAlphabet is not the only tech heavyweight seeking to blend medical altruism with Big Data and big moneymaking plans. Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and others are also using their deep technology expertise to create medical-related products and services.This year, Apple introduced health-tracking tools that monitor users' footsteps, heart rates and sleep activities. Microsoft and Samsung already offer a number of so-called wearable devices that also allow people to monitor their daily movements.Advances in mobile computing, artificial intelligence and new analytics software are driving their efforts.""In recent years, there has been increased interest in health care applications from companies that traditionally are seen to be consumer-focused companies,"" said Iain Simpson, a drug delivery specialist at Cambridge Consultants. ""Companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook (FB) and Amazon.com (AMZN) have built consumer-focused businesses based on the creation of a compelling and sustainable user experience.""Now, Simpson said, various tech companies are heading into health, driven ""by the increasing relevance of these capabilities in a market which creates new high-value business opportunities for them, particularly when they work in collaboration with established health care players such as pharma and medical device companies.""With U.S. health care spending weighing in at $3.2 trillion in 2015 and projected to reach $5.1 trillion by 2023, according to the California Health Care Foundation, profit potential is an obvious incentive.But other factors are also at work. Part of the reason behind Alphabet's focus on moving the needle on Parkinson's treatment is personal.Google co-founder and now Alphabet president Sergey Brin's mother Eugenia has Parkinson's, and Brin himself was diagnosed in 2006 as carrying a mutation of the LRRK2 gene, which has been associated with higher rates of the degenerative disorder of the central nervous system.""Generally the pace of medical research is glacial compared to what I'm used to in the Internet,"" Brin told Wired in a 2010 interview about how Google could amplify the process. ""We could be looking lots of places and collecting lots of information. And if we see a pattern, that could lead somewhere.""Legislative changes are another factor that has helped open the door for tech firms to put their massive computing muscle into health care.Data-driven medicine is a key element of the Affordable Care Act, the federal law that ushered in President Barack Obama's health care reforms and is a major force at the center of the boom in new health technology.The law provides major financial incentives for doctors and hospitals to prove their care is effective. Those ""value-based"" payment rules are sparking demand for new software that can track and analyze patient data, says Lynne Dunbrack, research vice president at IDC Health Insights.Patients Prescribed SoftwareFor example, Dunbrack said, ""some hospitals are finding it cheaper to send Medicare patients who have congestive heart failure home with a weight scale, an electronic tablet and a connected app rather than risk too many readmissions within 30 days of discharge, which would result in the hospitals getting federal reimbursement rate cuts.""""There have been some real financial incentives for health care organizations to purchase and use these technologies, which is then helping to drive demand, and is why companies are now seeing new opportunities,"" Dunbrack said.Along with the shift to value-based care, other top areas of focus for the health care industry include sequencing the human genome and digitizing health care data, said Cowen and Co. analyst John Blackledge in a September report about Alphabet's health care strategy.All three of those health care trends ""are not occurring in a vacuum, but are being accommodated by technology advances in areas such as social, mobile, analytics and cloud computing. These are all areas of Google's expertise,"" Blackledge said.The swirl of changes and tech advances is also helping fuel medical ambitions of tech heavyweight Apple.At its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June 2014, Apple introduced a new HealthKit app, which monitors users' heart rates, sleep, weight and blood pressure, among other health-related measurements, and lets home health devices such as heart monitors and fitness monitors exchange data. HealthKit will allow clinicians at the Mayo Clinic to send that health information to a user's app, which can in turn transmit the data to a user's physician.HealthKit is ""a logical extension to Apple's existing products and digital ecosystem keeping users engaged and increasing Apple's App Store business,"" while also keeping ""Apple's products and services relevant in a growing but increasingly competitive consumer health market,"" said Simpson, of Cambridge Consultants.Another Apple tech framework, ResearchKit, lets people who want to remotely participate in clinical medical trials do so using specially-designed apps on their iPhone instead of having to show up in person.In March, Apple displayed apps that it says helps diagnose a range of conditions, from diabetes to heart disease.

369,ABBV,"Big biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) agreed to license an immunology drug from smaller counterpart Galapagos (GLPG) Thursday in a deal that could be worth more than $2 billion.Galapagos' drug is filgotinib, which is due to start phase three trials in rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease next year. Gilead agreed to pay a $300 million license fee and buy $425 million in Galapagos stock upfront, and promised up to $1.35 billion in milestone payments should the drug succeed in clearing the regulatory process. If it launches, Gilead will pay a tiered royalty starting at 20% of sales and split the profits.Filgotinib is a JAK1 inhibitor, a class that AbbVie (ABBV) and several other drugmakers are developing. AbbVie once had its own licensing deal with Galapagos but in September opted out of its right to license filgotinib so it could focus on developing its in-house drug.At the time, AbbVie cited a rat study indicating that filgotinib could be toxic to the testicles, leading Galapagos into discussions with the FDA before it could proceed with the new trials. However, the phase two results in humans were positive and competitive with other rheumatoid arthritis drugs in development, wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee in a research note. He added that in Crohn's disease the results seem to lag Celgene's (CELG) GED-0301, ""although (it's) hard to compare cross-trial, different geographies.""Galapagos stock jumped 7% in early trading on the stock market today but by midafternoon was down more than 2%.

370,ABBV,"The long-awaited report from the Senate Finance committee on Gilead Sciences' (GILD) pricing of its hepatitis C drugs came out Tuesday, and as expected, it was highly critical.Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said in the spring of 2014 that they would investigate Gilead's pricing policies after Gilead priced its new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi at $84,000 for a 12-week regimen. Their criticism of the price led Gilead and nearly every other biotech stock into a brief nose-dive, though the group recovered until presidential candidate Hillary Clinton raised the drug-pricing issue more broadly this September.In Tuesday's report, the senators said they'd examined more than 20,000 pages of internal Gilead documents and interviewed dozens of health care experts to conclude that Gilead priced Sovaldi, and its successor Harvoni, for maximum profit rather than broad access. They said that, in fact, Gilead had underestimated how much health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers would restrict access.""When confronted with the widespread initiation of access restrictions, Gilead refused to offer substantial discounts and did not significantly modify its contracting strategy to improve patient access,"" the senators went on in their press release summarizing the report's findings. ""For example, Gilead offered Medicaid programs supplemental rebates of up to 10 percent; however, its offer came with the precondition that states had to drop some or all of their access restrictions.""For states already facing a steep financial burden, accepting that precondition in most cases would have increased the budgetary impact rather than easing it.""The senators admitted that the price of both Sovaldi and Harvoni had dropped after AbbVie (ABBV) launched its competing treatment last December, but said that ""concerns remain, particularly in the public payer community, about high costs for treating millions of people in the U.S. infected with Hepatitis C, as well as the budgetary effects of a future single source innovator that might not face competition as quickly.""Not surprisingly, Gilead disagreed with these conclusions.""Around the world, more than 600,000 individuals have been treated with Gilead's HCV medications since their introductions in 2013 and 2014,"" Gilead said in an emailed statement. ""Gilead responsibly and thoughtfully priced Sovaldi and Harvoni.""The products were initially priced in line with the previous standards of care. With the rebates and discounts now in place, the prices today are less than the cost of prior regimens, even though our therapies have significantly higher cure rates and very few side effects.""Gilead stock reacted little to the news, dipping a fraction in late-afternoon on the stock market today.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

371,ABBV,"Hillary Clinton has promoted her drug pricing plan as a way to take on an industry she says is guilty of ""outrageous"" prices. But it's her friends in the media who could take the hit.While Clinton's plan wouldn't go as far as some have suggested in banning consumer-directed drug advertising, she would, in effect, tax advertising dollars as if they were after-tax profits.The hope is that doing so would restrain unnecessary prescription drug spending because patients wouldn't ask their doctor if they should be trying out some wonder-cure they learned about on TV, or reading a newspaper.""This would ostensibly decrease pharma ad spending in order to make branded drugs less prevalent in the minds of consumers over cheaper generics,"" wrote Cowen & Co. health care analyst Charles Rhee.An even more certain result would be a hit to media-company profits — or an expansion of their losses.Last year, drugmakers spent $3.2 billion on TV ads, $1.2 billion on magazine ads and $127 million on newspaper ads, according to Kantar Media. Pfizer (PFE) spent more than $1 billion on ads, roughly the same as the combined total of the next three biggest advertisers AbbVie (ABBV), Eli Lilly (LLY) and AstraZeneca (AZN).Yet, Rhee wrote, ""even if the overall pie were to shrink, we think more of the ad pie would shift in favor of digital advertisers in an even accelerated manner as advertisers seek greater return on investment.""In particular, Rhee names WebMD (WBMD) and Everyday Health (EVDY) as potential winners in this scenario, though he sees it as unlikely to come to pass under a Republican-dominated Congress.Still, maybe there's hope that Hillary's plan would help her great friends in the blogosphere.

375,ABBV,"A week after announcing a corporate restructuring to break up the search leader's wide-ranging operations into smaller, most-focused pieces, Google (GOOGL) said it has separated its life sciences division into a stand-alone entity, giving that division more freedom.The search firm's 3-year-old life sciences group has graduated from the hush-hush Google X experimental unit dedicated to big technology breakthroughs, or ""moonshots,"" to reside under Google's new parent firm, Alphabet, Google co-founder Sergey Brin wrote in a Google+ post late Thursday.Google stock, however, was down 2.5% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 663.Andy Conrad, head of Google Life Sciences, will be CEO of the new life sciences group, Brin wrote.""While the reporting structure will be different, their goal remains the same.

376,ABBV,"The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ruled Wednesday against a patent challenge to Biogen's (BIIB) blockbuster drug Tecfidera, holding out hope for denial of similar challenges against other drugs by hedge fund manager Kyle Bass. Biogen stock rose.The USPTO declined to hold a trial in response to Bass's request for inter partes review (IPR) on Tecfidera's patent with a number ending in 514, which expires in 2028. The office cited a ""failure to establish a likelihood of success as to any challenged claim"" as the reason. Another challenge on a shorter-lived patent, '393, is still pending. That patent expires in 2019.The IPR filing was made by the Coalition for Affordable Drugs, a group created by Bass as part of a ""short activist strategy"" that he claimed would also reduce drug prices. The group has also filed IPRs against Jazz Pharmaceuticals' (JAZZ) Xyrem, AbbVie's (ABBV) Imbruvica, Celgene's (CELG) Revlimid, and Shire 's (SHPG) Lialda and Gattex, among others.Last month, however, the USPTO also denied an IPR against Acorda Therapeutics ' (ACOR) Amypra.

377,ABBV,"2015 was a year with two distinct parts for drug stocks: The first seven months continued the bull run of the last four years, while the sudden resurfacing of the drug-pricing debate led to a rocky five months after that.But overall, the group came out ahead — and these top-performing big caps show that a solid story can make up for political worries in the eyes of investors.•Incyte (INCY) is up 49% — as of Wednesday's close — after a year of steady gains for its lone marketed product, Jakafi, as well as its pipeline of potential blockbusters. In March, Jakafi won EU approval in the blood cancer polycythemia vera, for which it is already approved in the U.S., along with another blood cancer, myelofibrosis. Both those diseases are rare, but Incyte is shooting for much bigger markets with its late-stage candidates baricitinib and epacadostat.Baricitinib, which Incyte is developing in partnership with Eli Lilly (LLY), tested successfully in phase-three trials in rheumatoid arthritis against a placebo, methotrexate and the current market leader, AbbVie 's (ABBV) Humira. In his Nov. 18 initiation report on Incyte, Goldman Sachs analyst Salveen Richter estimated peak annual sales of more than $2 billion after an expected 2017 launch.Richter added that a more important future driver of shares will likely be Incyte's entries into the budding field of immuno-oncology. Incyte has been testing its lead candidate in the field, epacadostat, in combination with Merck's (MRK) Keytruda in a variety of cancers. In early November, Incyte's stock fell after a small study of the combo in patients with advanced cancers disappointed Wall Street, but Richter wrote that 2016 will likely bring more clarity as more results come out.Incyte has been operating at a loss due to all this research spending, but analysts expect it to turn its first annual profit next year. The stock's current IBD Composite Rating is 60.•Danish diabetes giant Novo Nordisk (NVO) is up 39% as it ends the year with a flat base following early gains. In March, the stock rose sharply after Novo said it would refile for U.S. approval of its long-acting insulin analogue Tresiba, along with its shorter-acting sister drug Ryzodeg. The two drugs suffered a surprise rejection in 2013 as the FDA sought more data on their possible risks to the heart. This time around, the agency was convinced, and it approved them on Sept. 25.Also boosting the stock early in the year was Novo's February release of positive clinical-trial data on its latest glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, OG217SC. Novo has been selling its earlier GLP-1 agonist Victoza since 2010, but the market has gotten more competitive in the last couple years with new GLP-1s launching from Sanofi (SNY), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Eli Lilly. Those drugs are all injectable, however, while Novo's new candidate is oral. Novo announced further positive results for the drug in July and September.Novo's financial results in U.S. currency suffered from the foreign-exchange headwinds that hit all global drugmakers this year, but it still managed a solid IBD EPS Rank of 85 and a Relative Strength rating of 87.•Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) continued its multiyear run on the stock market, hitting a lifetime high of 605.93 on Aug. 4 before getting caught in the larger biotech sell-off. It's still up 34% for the year.Regeneron's flagship eye drug Eylea continued to perform well, aided by a new approval for diabetic retinopathy in March. But drawing more attention was the launch of its cholesterol drug Praluent in July.Praluent was not only the first of a new class of cholesterol drugs — though it was followed shortly to the market by Amgen 's (AMGN) Repatha — it's also the first of a number of novel monoclonal antibodies that Regeneron has been developing in a partnership with Sanofi. The next entry, dupilumab, is in late-stage testing for asthma and eczema and is also expected to attain multibillion-dollar annual sales.Regeneron is also the highest-rated stock on this list, with the highest-possible Composite Rating of 99.• Eli Lilly is the top-performing traditional big pharma of the year, with a 25% gain. While its sales growth has been flat due to its aging drugs, as well as currency headwinds, the company has improved profit margins through cost controls and gotten a lot of investors excited about its pipeline. As noted above, its partnership with Incyte has borne fruit in the baricitinib trials. Lilly doesn't have much of a presence in rheumatoid arthritis or other immunology diseases, but Lilly is planning to change that not only with baricitinib but with ixekizumab, a psoriasis treatment it's planning to launch next year that is expected to sell in the billions eventually.Lilly's already-launched diabetes drug Jardiance yielded one of pharma's biggest upside surprises this year, when a giant study of its effects on cardiovascular health showed that it reduced death from heart failure by 32%. That drove the stock to a 14-year high of 92.85 in September, which turned into a cup-with-handle base.The stock holds a 72 CR.• Baxalta (BXLT) is up 23% since it started trading July 1 in a spin-off from Baxter International (BAX), which sought to unlock the shareholder value of its biopharma arm. Just 10 days later, the company received an unsolicited $30 billion buyout offer from British drugmaker Shire (SHPG), which saw Baxalta's hemophilia franchise as an ideal addition to its rare-disease portfolio.Baxalta rejected the offer, but the situation remains unresolved. Last week, rumors were buzzing that Shire would up its bid, though it hasn't yet. Baxalta's financials have been slow and steady, leading to an EPS Rank of 62, but the acquisition hopes have lifted the stock's RS Rating to 94.

Yahoo's board met this past week to mull various options. The directors could reaffirm plans to spin off Alibaba holdings into a separately traded company, Aabaco. But that could lead to proxy fight from Starboard, Starboard initially pushed for the Alibaba spinout, but changed its mind after the IRS decided not to rule in advance that the move would be ruled tax-free. Starboard now says Yahoo should instead sell its core operations — such as Yahoo Mail.Yahoo has a $33 billion market cap, but that includes $30 billion in Alibaba shares, $8 billion for its Yahoo Japan stake, plus several billion in cash. The market essentially values Yahoo's core operations, at least with Mayer and the current strategy, at negative value.Cancer Fighting Gold From ASH?Meanwhile, the American Society of Hematology (ASH) begins its four-day conference on Saturday in Orlando. Blood-cancer drugs, notably cutting-edge chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) treatments. CAR-T treatments engineer immune cells so they recognize cancer cells. Presentations from Cellectis (CLLS), Bluebird Bio, Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), Novartis and Kite Pharma (KITE) are among the ASH CAR-T presentations.Many of these CAR-T treatments are similar, so investors will be looking for indications of which win regulatory approval first.Also presenting will be AbbVie, touting new research on Imbruvica. AbbVie paid $21 billion for Pharmacyclics, mostly on hopes for Imbruvica. Johnson & Johnson will still share in Imbruvica revenue.Follow Ed Carson on Twitter @IBD_ECarson and on Facebook.

381,ABBV,"Big pharmas Merck (MRK), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) were trading up Tuesday after getting upgrades from Barclays, while AbbVie (ABBV) seesawed on a downgrade.Analyst Geoff Meacham assumed coverage of a newly combined U.S. Pharmaceuticals sector in Barclays' coverage, and while he left most ratings the same he made a few tweaks. Lilly was upgraded to overweight from equal weight, and its price target lifted to 95 from 75, based on the promising pipeline and management's commitment to lowering expenses. Meacham said that Lilly could be building a ""major autoimmune disease franchise"" with its late-stage drug candidates ixekizumab (for psoriasis) and baricitinib, a rheumatoid-arthritis drug it's developing with Incyte (INCY).""Based on the solid Phase 3 data, we view baricitinib as having significant market share potential in rheumatoid arthritis,"" Meacham wrote. ""Our model conservatively projects 2025 risk-adjusted sales of $1.2 billion vs. peak sales of $1.5 billion for (Pfizer 's (PFE) Xeljanz.""Meacham called diabetes drug Jardiance Lilly's ""most important commercial asset over the intermediate term"" since its recent study results showed it sharply reduced deaths from heart failure . He admitted that this has been an overhang for Merck, as it derives a lot of its revenue from competing drug Jardiance, but argued that the stock has overreacted.""While we acknowledge there are multiple headwinds and risks that make Merck a 'show me' story, we think even under most potential negative scenarios that there is too much underlying value to ignore,"" Meacham wrote as he raised Merck's rating to overweight from equal weight and hiked its price target to 66 from 65. ""Even if pipeline assets aren't blockbusters, they add up and are nearly free at the current valuation.""Lilly stock was up almost 5% near 86 in afternoon trading on the stock market today, while Merck stock was up 2% near 54.Meacham also raised J&J to overweight from equal weight, with the price target rising $14 to 155. As with Merck, he felt that the market is undervaluing J&J.""J&J has underperformed the S&P 500 and DRG over the past 12 months due to concerns about the impact of biosimilars on Remicade, low near-term earnings growth, and a lack of significant near-term pipeline catalysts,"" Meacham wrote. ""This has led to calls to break up the conglomerate, but we believe this to be premature.""In Meacham's view, J&J would be better off acquiring growth assets, especially in pharma.J&J stock was up 1% in afternoon trading, near 102.Meanwhile Meacham downgraded AbbVie to equal weight from overweight and trimmed the price target to 72 from 73. Like many analysts, he thought that AbbVie's projections for recently acquired blood-cancer drug Imbruvica and similar drugs in the pipeline — some $20 billion a year at peak — are too high.""Imbruvica and other oncology assets likely to succeed, but the field is highly competitive,"" Meacham wrote.AbbVie stock initially dropped almost 2% in Tuesday's trading, but by afternoon was up about 1.5% near 59.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

382,ABBV,"The managers of $2.1 billion Columbia Mid Cap Growth Fund spun their wheels a bit in a difficult third quarter, but have kept their mutual fund on course. After outperforming the broad stock market and peer group tracked by Morningstar in the first and second quarters, the mutual fund lagged its peers in Q3. Some of that underperformance came from holdings in the energy sector.To cope, the fund has cut its energy weighting. It also saw energy holdings lose value. Its energy weighting of 1.56% as of Sept. 30 was more than 5 percentage points lower than a year earlier.In the case of trims, proceeds were recycled into stocks where the managers see better risk-reward opportunities for investors, says lead manager George Myers. ""We invest in growth companies, but we aren't willing to overpay,"" Myers said.The approach has worked long-term as well as recently. The fund's 7.09% gain this year going into Tuesday topped 94% of its peers. The S&P 500 was up 3.27%.The fund carries a B+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, having performed among the top 20% of all mutual funds in that period.One stock they added to in Q3 was Signature Bank (SBNY), which is on IBD's Leaderboard. ""We like this bank because, unlike big bank competitors, they offer customers a single point of contact,"" Myers said. ""You don't get passed from one person to another. And the bank continues to take market share.""Myers said the bank's pay package attracts talented employees, who bring their books of business.And Signature stands to benefit from any Federal Reserve interest rate hike.All-Weather StocksThe fund aims for growth stocks that are able to grow earnings no matter where we are in an economic cycle. To do that, a company needs a unique or at least superior product or service.""For example, higher interest rates won't impact people's need to buy products from Incyte (INCY), the oncology (and rheumatoid arthritis) company,"" Myers said.The managers like the prospects for Incyte to build on revenue from new products in addition to its cancer treatment Jakafi. It is working to develop a cancer immunotherapy. And Myers says tests have been promising for a rheumatoid arthritis drug it is developing in a partnership with Eli Lilly (LLY).""We think Incyte's product is superior to (AbbVie (ABBV)'s) Humira, which sells for north of $15 billion globally,"" he said.LinkedIn (LNKD) is another stock that the managers like. ""Our long-term thesis is that the talent solution segment, which is 60% of the business, will be better than people expect,"" said co-manager Brian Neigut. ""The marketing solution segment, which was under pressure in 2015, will also continue to do better than Wall Street expects based on new product updates and ancillary products.""Roper Technologies (ROP) is another favorite that the fund shifted money into. Co-manager William Chamberlain likes the company's knack for making accretive acquisitions such as legal software firm Aderant, in October. He also likes its wide variety of products.Chamberlain calls Roper an industrial firm that he increasingly thinks of as a tech stock.Ultimate Software Group (ULTI) is another fund favorite. The company benefits from an ongoing shift of payroll services to the cloud. ""In 2016 we expect accelerating revenue growth, which will set them apart from many other tech companies, Myers said.

399,ABBV,"Halozyme Therapeutics has been one of 2015's hotter biotech stocks, but it's not exactly because of developing a drug. Halozyme's (HALO) one marketed product, Hylenex, aids in the delivery of injectable drugs.
"
400,ABBV,"Halozyme has also licensed Enhanze for the same purpose to such drug companies as Pfizer (PFE), Roche (RHHBY), Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Janssen division, AbbVie (ABBV) and Baxalta (BXLT) for the development of injectable products.
"
401,ABBV,"San Diego-based Halozyme is also testing a product called PEGPH20 in combination with other drugs as a treatment for various cancers.
"
402,ABBV,"Analysts don't expect these efforts to yield steady annual earnings until 2017, but even after the recent biotech stock selloff, Halozyme is trading at double where it was at the start of the year.
"
403,ABBV,"In a recent interview with IBD, Halozyme CEO Helen Torley explained the company's business model and why it's catching Wall Street's attention.
"
404,ABBV,"IBD: You have two drug-delivery products, Hylenex and Enhanze, that seem similar. What is the difference between them?
"
405,ABBV,"Torley: Our one marketed product is Hylenex, and that is the basic rHuPH20 enzyme which degrades hyaluronan, which is a sugar that is present under your skin. If you've ever had a subcutaneous injection, as they're injecting it you probably get sore because they're coming up against some resistance. That resistance is caused by the hyaluronan that's under the skin.
"
406,ABBV,"Our product, which is rHuPH20, in Hylenex and also in Enhanze, temporarily breaks down the hyaluronan, which releases the water molecules that are attached to the hyaluronan, and allows the creation of passages underneath the skin that allow whatever you're injecting there to have a bigger surface area for absorption into the bloodstream or the lymphatics.
"
407,ABBV,"Hylenex is the product that Halozyme went and got approved, and it's promoted by a small field force that we have in the U.S.
"
408,ABBV,"It basically is the rHuPH20 that is used for the dispersion of fluids that can be given under the skin and also with some drugs as well. That is a modest part of our business in terms of generating some revenue.
"
409,ABBV,"Now we also have the part of the business that we call the Enhanze platform. And that's where we allow partners like Pfizer, Roche, Janssen, AbbVie and Baxalta to license the use of our enzyme, which, in most of those cases, they combine with their molecule.
"
410,ABBV,"I'll use Roche's Herceptin and MabThera (Rituxan in the U.S.) as two examples. They created a new product that was a mixture of Herceptin and our enzyme, and went through a different regulatory path to get approved. So when that new product, which is called Herceptin SC, is injected, our enzyme works to allow the herceptin to be absorbed underneath the skin because it's breaking down that hyaluronan barrier and allowing there to be a bigger surface area for absorption. So instead of Herceptin having to be given into the vein, as an IV, when it's co-administered with our drug you can give it as a subcutaneous injection.
"
411,ABBV,"It's the same base sugar. It's just that when it's licensed, it's called Enhanze, and when it's our product, it's called Hylenex.
"
412,ABBV,"IBD: And the drug you're developing for cancer treatment is also based on the same substance?
"
413,ABBV,"Torley: When we give Hylenex in the marketplace today, we give it subcutaneously. If we were to give it into the vein, it would be digested in the liver very rapidly. So it wouldn't have a big effect if it were given into the vein.
"
414,ABBV,"(So) we pegylated it. (Pegylating) is a not-uncommon approach taken to have drugs have a longer time that they can circulate in your body before they get digested and degraded by the liver. The PEGPH20 is basically a pegylated version of the rHuPH20 enzyme. We can give it into the vein and it will last in the body for several days, so it can exert its effects for several days.
"
415,ABBV,"Some examples would be Amgen's (AMGN) Neupogen, which is given pretty frequently for patients who have low white (blood) cells from receiving chemotherapy. They peglyated it and created Neulasta, which only had to be injected every couple of weeks, which was obviously a better convenience for patients.
"
416,ABBV,"That's exactly what we're trying to do here: have the drug last longer so it doesn't have to be given as frequently.
"
417,ABBV,"IBD: So is it necessarily combined with another drug, or does it do anything by itself?
"
418,ABBV,"Torley: PEGPH20 has some modest anti-cancer effect. But for the type of effects that we believe are important for patients, it needs to be used with another therapy.
"
419,ABBV,"I'll give an example of the data we just presented in late May, a study of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. These are patients who generally have a life expectancy of about six months after they're diagnosed.
"
420,ABBV,"We are looking at PEGPH20 in addition to one of the current best-available therapies, which is a combination of Abraxane, Celgene's (CELG) drug, and gemcitabine, which is a generic drug. What we did was look at PEGPH20 on top of Abraxane and gemcitabine vs. Abraxane and gemcitabine alone.
"
421,ABBV,"The theory as to why PEGPH20 is working is that for patients who are at a high level of this sugar hyaluronan in and around their tumor, it acts as a barrier to the cancer therapies' ability to get to the tumor where they need to work. And it does that by binding water molecules, creating high pressure in and around the tumor that compresses the blood vessels, so that when you get an injection of Abraxane, for example, the theory is the Abraxane cannot get into the tumor where it needs to work because there's low blood flow in the tumor.
"
422,ABBV,"We administer our PEG0H20, it breaks down the hyaluronan, opens up the blood vessels, opens up the blood flow. And so if after you give PEGPH20 you give Abraxane and gemcitabine, there's a much higher concentration of the chemotherapies that get into the tumor where they need to work.
"
423,ABBV,"Early data from our phase two study (showed) patients who received PEGPH20 before they got the gemcitabine and Abraxane had a doubling of their progression-free survival (and) a doubling of their response rate, and we saw an interesting early trend toward an improvement in survival — in the patients who had high levels of hyaluronan. (We) estimate that about 40% to 60% of pancreatic-cancer patients have high levels of this sugar.
"
424,ABBV,"Today with Abraxane and gemcitabine, which is one of the best standards of care, the median survival is just about eight months. What we're hoping to do for these patients of high levels of hyaluronan is to get a good improvement over and above that.

427,ABBV,"Medivation is paying $410 million upfront for talazoparib, which is currently in phase three testing for advanced or metastatic breast cancer involving germline mutations of the BRCA gene. If the drug succeeds, BioMarin is due up to $160 million in milestone payments along with midsingle-digit royalties on sales.
"
428,ABBV,"Talazoparib is a PARP inhibitor, one of a new class of cancer drugs that includes AstraZeneca's (AZN) recently approved Lynparza and AbbVie's (ABBV) late-stage candidate veliparib. Medivation is still riding the successful launch of prostate-cancer drug Xtandi in 2012, but the acquisition gives it a chance to diversify, wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Simos Simeonidis.
"
429,ABBV,"""With Medivation being essentially a one-trick pony in the eyes of most investors (the promise of the in-licensed PD-1 inhibitor, MDV9300, notwithstanding), we think this move makes sense,"" Simeonidis wrote in a research note Monday. ""Although AstraZeneca's Lynparza (recently approved in ovarian cancer and currently in phase three in breast cancer with BRCA1/2 germline mutations), along with Tesaro's (TSRO) niraparib (currently in phase three in breast cancer with BRCA1/2 germline mutations), provide competition in the space, we view this as a reasonable bet for Medivation as they look for another late-stage oncology asset.""

443,ABBV,"Big pharma Pfizer (PFE) was reportedly near a deal to acquire Ireland-based Allergan (AGN) on Thursday, even as the Treasury Department said it would put out new guidance to cut the economic benefits of such deals.Pfizer and Allergan confirmed rumors that they were in such talks late last month, but details such as price were left to Wall Street speculation. Late Wednesday, however, Bloomberg and Reuters both reported that the price had been set in the range of $370 to $380 a share, which would total up to $157 billion. Bloomberg said the deal could be announced ""as soon as Monday,"" but CNBC said Thursday that the announcement is expected the following Monday.All this came just hours after Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew sent a letter to the Senate Finance Committee criticizing tax-inversion deals, in which a U.S. company acquires a smaller company in a lower-tax domicile in a sort of reverse acquisition that allows the U.S. company to relocate and cut its tax bill. Pfizer already tried to do this last year by acquiring British drug giant AstraZeneca (AZN) but was rebuffed, so the pursuit of Dublin-based Allergan is generally seen as an alternative inversion deal.Lew said in his letter that later this week Treasury will issue ""targeted guidance to deter and reduce further the economic benefits of corporate inversions."" Treasury had previously issued guidelines to that effect back in September 2014, which, as Evercore ISI policy analyst Terry Haines points out, never resulted in any actual changes of rules.""The 2014 'guidance' said Treasury would — but never did — propose new regulations to combat hopscotch loans; prevent restructuring of foreign subsidiaries; prevent inverted companies from transferring cash or property from a controlled foreign corporation to avoid U.S. tax; and strengthen its interpretation of the ownership rule,"" Haines wrote in an email to clients. ""Treasury also said it intended to take comment on earnings stripping: That also was not done.""Just What Can Treasury Do?In his letter, Lew boasted that his guidelines did slow down the previously torrid rate of tax-inversion deals — indeed, it torpedoed AbbVie's (ABBV) planned takeover of Shire (SHPG), with AbbVie deciding to pay a hefty termination fee rather than take the risk of the rules materializing. Haines' Evercore colleague, specialty-drug analyst Umer Raffat, wrote in a separate email that Lew might follow up with actual guidelines this time, and/or address the issue of earnings stripping, in which the inverted company's foreign HQ issues an intercompany loan to its U.S. subsidiary and charges tax-deductible interest.""In my prior conversation with legal experts, Treasury may not have the mandate to change the 50% cap on interest expense deduction,"" Raffat wrote. ""It will be very interesting to see if Treasury comes out and changes this threshold in the guidance anyways — and lets any concerned parties litigate it out (hoping that the timelines for litigation will be long enough to prevent an inversion transaction).""Raffat added that Treasury might also propose modifying the definition of ""debt"" to exclude such intercompany loans. After the 2014 guidelines came out, Allergan CEO Brent Saunders said that this seemed like the most plausible avenue of attack, and in the ""worst-case scenario"" it could hit the company's tax rate to the tune of 300 basis points, as Allergan (then called Actavis) was itself the product of a tax inversion and had a large U.S. presence.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote that it's hard to tell how much tax Pfizer could save under current inversion rules, but the deal price now on the table would still yield accretion for Pfizer.""We modeled conservative tax benefits going forward with a 2017 anticipated tax rate of 22% subsequently dropping to 18% in 2019,"" Divan wrote in a research note. ""Our initial cost-synergy assumptions are also relatively conservative, with an assumption of $1.2 billion in cost synergies realized in 2019. It is possible Pfizer would be able to extract greater cost synergies from a deal, with each incremental $1 billion in synergies representing an additional 3 to 5 cents to yearly EPS from 2017 to 2019.""In midmorning trading on the stock market today, Allergan stock was down about 2.6% near 302.50, while Pfizer was down more than 3% near 32.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

446,ABBV,"Pfizer (PFE) is near a massive deal to buy Allergan (AGN) and redomicile in Ireland, multiple reports said, even as the Treasury Department plans to impose new restrictions on tax inversions.Pfizer are discussing a deal that would pay $370-$380 a share for Botox maker Allergan, Bloomberg and Reuters reported late Wednesday. Allergan rose 4.5% to 310.83 on Wednesday, but retreated after hours following news of the inversion rules. Allergan traded as low as 237.50 on Oct. 21 before Pfizer-Allergan deal buzz picked up. Pfizer rose 1.3% to 33.31 on Wednesday, and was little changed late Wednesday.At $380 a share, it would be a $150 billion takeover, the largest health care deal ever and the biggest takeover of any kind this year.Bloomberg said the companies want to announce a deal as soon as Monday while Reuters said an announcement was not necessarily imminent. Both said that the Treasury's Wednesday announcement to issue ""targeted"" tax inversion guidance later this week could affect the timing of any agreement.By acquiring the Irish drugmaker, Pfizer would be able to limit its exposure to the punitive U.S. corporate tax system. America's corporate rates are the highest in the industrial world and the country taxes U.S. companies' overseas profits when they are repatriated.The Treasury issues restrictions on tax inversions in September 2014. That stopped an AbbVie (ABBV) acquisition, but deals involving Burger King (now Restaurant Brands (QSR), Medtronic (MDT) and Mylan (MYL) went ahead.It's unclear what new limits Treasury will impose, but the Obama administration can't ban inversions outright. In addition to the inversion benefits, Pfizer would beef up its brand-name drugs, and boost its pipeline of treatments in mid- or late-stage trials.Pfizer could use the Allergan deal to lead to a Pfizer breakup into two or three companies.Follow Ed Carson on Twitter @IBD_ECarson and on Facebook.

"
473,ABBV,"With U.S. companies headed for a record year of share repurchases, experts are split over whether buybacks are the logical result of excess capital, or if they come at the expense of growth initiatives.
"
474,ABBV,"A number of high-profile companies have implemented aggressive buyback programs in recent quarters, spanning all sectors of the economy.
"
475,ABBV,"They include tech giants such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), health care leaders like Express Scripts (ESRX) and AbbVie (ABBV), manufacturers like Boeing (BA) and General Motors (GM), financial leaders like Wells Fargo (WFC), and consumer stocks such as Nike (NKE) and Wendy's (WEN).
"
476,ABBV,"Nike announced a $12 billion buyback program on Thursday, along with a 14% dividend hike.
"
477,ABBV,"Apple bought back $36 billion in shares in fiscal 2015 after buying $45 billion in stock in 2014.
"
478,ABBV,"Not surprisingly, buybacks have become the focus of intense media coverage in recent weeks.
"
479,ABBV,"Critics say more of that money should be reinvested into research and development initiatives as well as new products, technologies and services. This would contribute to long-term growth and feed economic expansion, they say. Critics also say that executives use buybacks to flatter financial results.
"
480,ABBV,"But defenders say returning money to shareholders is a good use of money that's left over after capital has already been allocated to normal business expenses.
"
481,ABBV,"In today's environment, many companies are ""still left with a large amount of excess capital,"" even after investing in growth initiatives, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors' U.S. Intermediary Business Group.
"
482,ABBV,"""They are choosing to redeploy the money to investors,"" he told IBD. ""When done the right way, buybacks are a good capital allocation. There are a lot of misperceptions around share buybacks.""
"
483,ABBV,"Record Buyback Pace
"
484,ABBV,"What's certain is this: A whole lot of money is going toward buybacks and dividends lately.
"
485,ABBV,"The total dollar amount of dividends and stock buybacks is on track to reach a new high this year and could soar above $1 trillion for the first time, according to industry estimates.
"
486,ABBV,"The percentage of operating cash flow used to buy back shares is at its highest level since 2007, Arone says. He calls that a ""watershed year"" for buybacks. That was also just before the U.S. fell into a sharp recession and bear market.
"
487,ABBV,"""Some look at 2007 as a kind of peak year,"" he said. ""This year's percentage of operating cash flow used for buybacks is still below 2007. But (2015) would be the largest year of all time in absolute dollar terms.""
"
488,ABBV,"A recent investigative report from Reuters noted that nearly 60% of the 3,297 publicly traded non-financial U.S. companies it examined have bought back shares since 2010.
"
489,ABBV,"In fiscal 2014, spending on buybacks and dividends surpassed the companies' combined net income for the first time outside of a recessionary period, Reuters said. Spending kept climbing higher for the 613 companies that have already reported for fiscal 2015. That suggests that corporations are relying more heavily on cheap interest rates to use debt to fund buybacks and dividends.
"
490,ABBV,"FactSet Research reports that 75% of all companies in the S&P 500 bought back shares and paid dividends in the trailing 12 months at the end of the second quarter, the most recent data available. About $555 billion was spent by S&P 500 firms on share repurchases in the same period.
"
491,ABBV,"The information technology sector spent the most money on buybacks in the second quarter, FactSet said, led by Apple, Microsoft, Qualcomm (QCOM) and Oracle (ORCL).
"
492,ABBV,"Meanwhile, U.S. companies issued $107.9 billion in dividends during Q3. That was up 23% from Q2 and established a new record, according to data from Henderson Global Investors.
"
493,ABBV,"Why is all this money going toward buybacks and dividends?
"

"
501,ABBV,"Reuters reported that among the 1,000 or so firms it tracked that buy back shares and report R&D spending, the share of net income spent on innovation has averaged less than 50% since 2009. That com pares to over 60% during the 1990s.
"
502,ABBV,"But not all data show such a grim view, Arone said. ""There's a bunch of data showing R&D growing at its fastest level in 50 years. There's this misperception that companies are not reinvesting or spending on business growth. But many companies do continue to reinvest in their businesses.""
"
503,ABBV,"He also says that while buybacks can boost a company's EPS, research from S&P Dow Jones Indices shows that on a weighted basis, recent S&P 500 EPS gains ""are built on profits — not buybacks.""
"
504,ABBV,"A recent report from Deutsche Bank found that S&P 500 per-share profits since 2012 have risen by 6.2% annually on average, of which just 1.6 percentage points are from buybacks. That fell to 1.2 points in Q3.
"
505,ABBV,"Misperceptions about buybacks are due to a couple of factors, Arone says.
"
506,ABBV,"""Global economic growth has been sluggish, and therefore folks equate that sluggishness with a lack of business investment,"" he said. ""There's also been a lack of any meaningful wage growth. There's this view that we would be accelerating much more quickly had businesses been investing more, but I'm not convinced that's accurate.""
"
507,ABBV,"If economic growth is sluggish, the return on capital may be low, so returning cash to shareholders may be a sound decision.
"
508,ABBV,"That's not to say there aren't cases where companies issue buybacks and dividends at their detriment.
"
509,ABBV,"""If a company is borrowing aggressively or levering its balance sheet to buy back stock, that is not necessarily a good strategy,"" Arone said. ""Or if a company buys back its stock to offset the dilutive effects of stock-based compensation of employees, that's not a good strategy, either.""
"
510,ABBV,"But those are the exceptions rather than the rule, he said. ""To say that's what's happening broadly is, in my mind, an exaggeration.""With U.S. companies headed for a record year of share repurchases, experts are split over whether buybacks are the logical result of excess capital, or if they come at the expense of growth initiatives.A number of high-profile companies have implemented aggressive buyback programs in recent quarters, spanning all sectors of the economy.They include tech giants such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), health care leaders like Express Scripts (ESRX) and AbbVie (ABBV), manufacturers like Boeing (BA) and General Motors (GM), financial leaders like Wells Fargo (WFC), and consumer stocks such as Nike (NKE) and Wendy's (WEN).Nike announced a $12 billion buyback program on Thursday, along with a 14% dividend hike.Apple bought back $36 billion in shares in fiscal 2015 after buying $45 billion in stock in 2014.Not surprisingly, buybacks have become the focus of intense media coverage in recent weeks.Critics say more of that money should be reinvested into research and development initiatives as well as new products, technologies and services. This would contribute to long-term growth and feed economic expansion, they say. Critics also say that executives use buybacks to flatter financial results.But defenders say returning money to shareholders is a good use of money that's left over after capital has already been allocated to normal business expenses.In today's environment, many companies are ""still left with a large amount of excess capital,"" even after investing in growth initiatives, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors' U.S. Intermediary Business Group.""They are choosing to redeploy the money to investors,"" he told IBD. ""When done the right way, buybacks are a good capital allocation. There are a lot of misperceptions around share buybacks.""Record Buyback PaceWhat's certain is this: A whole lot of money is going toward buybacks and dividends lately.The total dollar amount of dividends and stock buybacks is on track to reach a new high this year and could soar above $1 trillion for the first time, according to industry estimates.The percentage of operating cash flow used to buy back shares is at its highest level since 2007, Arone says. He calls that a ""watershed year"" for buybacks. That was also just before the U.S. fell into a sharp recession and bear market.""Some look at 2007 as a kind of peak year,"" he said. ""This year's percentage of operating cash flow used for buybacks is still below 2007. But (2015) would be the largest year of all time in absolute dollar terms.""A recent investigative report from Reuters noted that nearly 60% of the 3,297 publicly traded non-financial U.S. companies it examined have bought back shares since 2010.In fiscal 2014, spending on buybacks and dividends surpassed the companies' combined net income for the first time outside of a recessionary period, Reuters said. Spending kept climbing higher for the 613 companies that have already reported for fiscal 2015. That suggests that corporations are relying more heavily on cheap interest rates to use debt to fund buybacks and dividends.FactSet Research reports that 75% of all companies in the S&P 500 bought back shares and paid dividends in the trailing 12 months at the end of the second quarter, the most recent data available. About $555 billion was spent by S&P 500 firms on share repurchases in the same period.The information technology sector spent the most money on buybacks in the second quarter, FactSet said, led by Apple, Microsoft, Qualcomm (QCOM) and Oracle (ORCL).Meanwhile, U.S. companies issued $107.9 billion in dividends during Q3. That was up 23% from Q2 and established a new record, according to data from Henderson Global Investors.Why is all this money going toward buybacks and dividends?The most basic answer is that the money is there, and something has to be done with it.""You have low interest rates and record profits,"" Arone said. ""This has resulted in corporations at peak levels in terms of having a lot of cash on hand.""In some cases, activist investors are pressuring companies to reward investors with that money, analysts say.

511,ABBV,"Big biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) got a price-target increase Tuesday as big pharma Merck (MRK) released new data on its hepatitis C regimen that could be a rival to Gilead's blockbuster franchise.Oppenheimer analyst Wendy Lam lifted her price target on Gilead to 124 from 120, writing that after the stock's considerable sell-off — it's down 17% from its June 24 high — investors are due to revisit Gilead's strong fundamentals. She acknowledged that investors are nervous that the launch of Merck's grazoprevir/elbasvir ""doublet"" therapy for hepatitis C could result in another price war similar to that when AbbVie (ABBV) released its own rival therapy late last year. But she maintained a positive outlook on the hep C franchise.""In the near term, we expect continued growth in patient volumes as payers continue to lift restrictions on treatment,"" Lam wrote in her research note Tuesday. ""On the Merck threat, we believe Merck's entry will be less disruptive than thought, as we suspect Merck will be less incentivized than AbbVie to instigate another all-out pricing war. We expect Gilead to defend its share aggressively — as it already has been — and maintain the vast majority of payer contracts.""Merck Testing Hepatitis C Drug ComboMerck, meanwhile, is testing its next-generation combo of the doublet along with MK-3682, a drug in the same class as Gilead's blockbuster Sovaldi. On Tuesday the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) released the late-breaking abstracts for presentations at next month's annual Liver Meeting, which showed that the triple therapy had achieved cure rates above 90% in genotypes 1 and 2 of the hepatitis C virus after eight weeks of treatment, and a similarly high rate in genotype 3 after 12 weeks of treatment.Gilead's Harvoni is approved only in genotype 1, while its Sovaldi is also approved for types 2, 3 and 4 but with lower rates of success and typically a longer treatment duration than eight weeks. However, last month Gilead announced that a new drug combo had succeeded in treating six genotypes, so the field remains hotly competitive.""From the data in the abstract, the efficacy data for eight-week triple combo therapy in GT1, GT2 and to a lesser extent GT3 appears encouraging and potentially feasible although we await further details (including baseline patient characteristics) with the actual presentation,"" Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients.Neither stock was helped much by the news, though. By early afternoon on the stock market today, Gilead stock was down nearly 2% near 101, while Merck stock was down a similar amount near 50.30.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

512,ABBV,"Biotech Halozyme Therapeutics (HALO) jumped as much as 18% Tuesday morning, nearly touching an all-time high, a day after the company beat Q2 estimates and provided an update on its pipeline. But shares reversed to close lower.Late Monday, Halozyme reported revenue of $43.4 million, up 136% from the year-earlier quarter and $18 million more than analysts expected. More than half the revenue came from a $23 million milestone payment from AbbVie (ABBV) in June. A partnership between the two firms, announced June 3, incorporates Halozyme's Enhanze technology into injectable drugs that AbbVie is developing.Other revenue came from sales of another injectable-drug booster, Hylenex, and from manufacturing agreements with Roche (RHHBY) and Baxalta (BXLT).The company turned a profit of 2 cents a share, where analysts expected a loss of 9 cents. However, Halozyme doesn't expect to make consistent quarterly profits until it launches its lead drug candidate, PEGPH20, which is in midstage testing for pancreatic cancer and early-stage testing for lung cancer.""The phase-three study of PEGPH20 in pancreatic cancer remains on track for a 1Q 2016 start following feedback from European Medicines Agency on trial design and continued progress on the companion diagnostic,"" wrote UBS analyst Andrew Peters in a research note Monday.On the other hand, he noted, enrollment in the phase-one lung-cancer trial was behind schedule, which pushes out a potential stock catalyst.""We still see initial efficacy data (overall response rate is secondary endpoint in phase 1b portion) as likely to be reported in 2016 (or earlier), which given the significant risk-adjustment in our model still suggests meaningful upside,"" Peters added.Due to the AbbVie deal, Halozyme lifted its full-year revenue guidance by more than $20 million, now $110 million to $115 million. Operating-expense guidance also went up, but the firm said that the added revenue will cut the cash burn by about $15 million. Halozyme expects to have $105 million to $115 million in cash at the end of the year.Halozyme stock has been having quite a good 2015, rising more than 160% from New Year's Day to a record high of 25.25 on July 23. Halozyme, up as high as 25 intraday on the stock market today, closed down 1.3% at 20.83.Connect with Amy Reeves: @IBD_Areeves and Facebook.

619,ABBV,"Sellers were in the stock market again Thursday as Wall Street digested another avalanche of second-quarter earnings reports. At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average had lost 0.7%, the S&P; 500 fell 0.6% and the Nasdaq had shed 0.5%. Preliminary data showed NYSE volume coming in higher than Wednesday's level. Nasdaq volume edged lower.Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on both exchanges by more than 2-to-1 in the stock market today.After the close, Amazon.com (AMZN) surged 15% in after-hours trading after the online retailer reported an unexpected profit of 19 cents a share. Sales rose 20% to $23.18 billion.Visa (V), meanwhile, also shot higher after hours after Q2 profit handily beat expectations.During the regular session, two earnings winners were Valeant (VRX) and Under Armour (UA).Valeant,a member of the IBD 50, gapped up out of a late-stage base after reporting strong earnings before the open. Shares jumped 6%. The Canada-based drugmaker reported sales and profit above expectations and raised its full-year guidance above analyst consensus views.Under Armour surged 7% after the sportswear company reported better-than-expected earnings and lifted its sales guidance.Another top gainer in the IBD 50 was software security name CyberArk (CYBR), up 7%. IBD's Computer Software-Security group was one of the day's top performers, rising more than 3%, helped by strong earnings from Fortinet (FTNT).At the New York Mercantile Exchange, September crude oil lost 75 cents, or 1.5%, to end at $48.45 a barrel, near a four-month low.In economic news, weekly jobless claims slipped to a 41-year low. Economic indicators were also rosy, with the Conference Board's Leading Indicators Index gaining 0.6% in June. That was below the index's downwardly revised 0.8% advance in May, but well above consensus forecasts for a 0.2% increase.June new-home sales data are due Friday at 10 a.m. ET.

620,ABBV,"Three top-20 industry groups from the Medical sector showed nice price action Monday. All three groups have been long-time market leaders and a number of stocks within the groups are shaping late-stage bases.
"
621,ABBV,"Shares of generic-drug giant Allergan (AGN), formerly know as Actavis, cleared a 315.10 cup-with-handle entry Monday. Volume was modestly above average. Allergan's latest base corrected a mild 12%, but is late stage. The stock's relative strength line touched a new high as it broke out, which adds confirmation to the move.
"
622,ABBV,"Allergan will report Q2 earnings before the open on Aug. 6. Analysts are looking for per-share earnings to climb 28% to $4.39 on sales of $5.72 billion, up 117%. Sales estimates are boosted by the recent Allergan acquisition.
"
623,ABBV,"Also from the generic-drug camp, Mallinckrodt (MNK) is tracking sideways in a consolidation that dates back to March. In May the stock cleared a short handle buy point at 130.35, but reversed lower and triggered an 8% loss sell signal a few weeks later. The handle can only be seen on a daily chart. For now, Mallinckrodt faces a test of resistance at its 50-day moving average.
"
624,ABBV,"From the biotech group, Celgene (CELG) briefly cleared a 121.57 handle buy point intraday, but retreated by the close. Volume was light. A flaw in its latest base pattern is that the majority of the base was formed below the 10-week moving average line. The base also showed one week of net distribution. Celgene will report Q2 earnings results before the market open on July 23.
"
625,ABBV,"Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) is approaching a 544.10 buy point in a late-stage flat base. The stock is finding support at its 10-week line, but has already made a huge run, which makes it a riskier buy if the stock breaks out.
"
626,ABBV,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) jumped Monday and is trying for a sixth straight weekly advance as it climbs the right side of a consolidation pattern. The stock is back near an all-time high it set in December after months of sideways action and a sharp drop in the spring.

627,ABBV,"From the ethical drugs group, Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) is climbing the right side of a new late-stage flat-base pattern. Shares hit a peak in May and have largely found support at the 10-week moving average in its latest pullback. The stock has a highest possible 99 Composite Rating. Valeant will report second-quarter results July 23 before the open.
"
628,ABBV,"AbbVie (ABBV) remains in buy range from a 66.76 cup-with-handle breakout in May. Monday, Jefferies raised its 2015 earnings estimate for the stock and reiterated a buy rating and 90 price target.
"
629,ABBV,"Analysts expect AbbVie on July 24 before the open to report EPS growth of 28% for a second straight quarter of double-digit growth. Sales are expected to climb 14%, which would be a second quarter of acceleration and the best quarterly revenue growth in over three years. AbbVie was spun off from Abbott Laboratories (ABT) in early 2013.Three top-20 industry groups from the Medical sector showed nice price action Monday. All three groups have been long-time market leaders and a number of stocks within the groups are shaping late-stage bases.Shares of generic-drug giant Allergan (AGN), formerly know as Actavis, cleared a 315.10 cup-with-handle entry Monday. Volume was modestly above average. Allergan's latest base corrected a mild 12%, but is late stage. The stock's relative strength line touched a new high as it broke out, which adds confirmation to the move.Allergan will report Q2 earnings before the open on Aug. 6. Analysts are looking for per-share earnings to climb 28% to $4.39 on sales of $5.72 billion, up 117%. Sales estimates are boosted by the recent Allergan acquisition.Also from the generic-drug camp, Mallinckrodt (MNK) is tracking sideways in a consolidation that dates back to March. In May the stock cleared a short handle buy point at 130.35, but reversed lower and triggered an 8% loss sell signal a few weeks later. The handle can only be seen on a daily chart. For now, Mallinckrodt faces a test of resistance at its 50-day moving average.From the biotech group, Celgene (CELG) briefly cleared a 121.57 handle buy point intraday, but retreated by the close. Volume was light. A flaw in its latest base pattern is that the majority of the base was formed below the 10-week moving average line. The base also showed one week of net distribution. Celgene will report Q2 earnings results before the market open on July 23.Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) is approaching a 544.10 buy point in a late-stage flat base. The stock is finding support at its 10-week line, but has already made a huge run, which makes it a riskier buy if the stock breaks out.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) jumped Monday and is trying for a sixth straight weekly advance as it climbs the right side of a consolidation pattern.

630,ABBV,"While drugs for treating and curing hepatitis C have made one biotech company the envy of the industry, another biotech — Celgene — is poised to break ahead of its peer pack over the next few years.
"
631,ABBV,"Celgene's (CELG) sales and profit growth is seen rising in double digits through at least 2019 from multiple drugs for multiple disorders.
"
632,ABBV,"Meanwhile, Gilead Sciences (GILD) — the biotech firm behind hepatitis C drug Harvoni and its predecessor Sovaldi — is expected to see earnings slow to low single digits over that time starting in 2016 as patients cure out of the liver virus.
"
633,ABBV,"Other big-cap biotechs, such as Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB), will also fall far short of Celgene's expected growth rate, analysts say.
"
634,ABBV,"""Celgene has the best top-line growth in all of large biotech right now and will have the fastest revenue and earnings growth over the next five years,"" said Michael Yee, managing director and analyst with RBC Capital Markets.
"
635,ABBV,"'Next Major Mover'?
"
636,ABBV,"Piper Jaffray analysts told clients in a recent research report that Celgene is ""positioned to be a next major mover among large-cap biotech stocks.""
"
637,ABBV,"They noted that Celgene is a returning name ""as a top large-cap pick for us."" Its shares have climbed 19% this year.
"
638,ABBV,"Celgene has been especially active in developing drugs for various cancers and immune-inflammatory diseases.
"
639,ABBV,"Two drugs that fight at least one common disease, multiple myeloma, are among its fastest growing.
"
640,ABBV,"The first, Revlimid, is Celgene's top-selling drug, with $1.44 billion in sales in the second quarter, 19% higher than a year earlier. The oral drug is used to treat anemia and multiple myeloma, a cancer of the blood that affects plasma cells.
"
641,ABBV,"Sales of Pomalyst, similar to Revlimid but more potent, increased 46% over last year to $235 million, making it the fastest growing of the company's current lineup. The drug launched in Japan in June.
"
642,ABBV,"Other drugs currently generating revenue for Celgene include Abraxane, which treats advanced cancers in the breast, lungs and pancreas; Vidaza, which helps bone marrow produce healthier blood cells; and Otezla, a pill for treating psoriasis and psoriasis arthritis.
"
643,ABBV,"With sales in the second quarter up 13% from the prior year, to $244 million, Abraxane is one of Celgene's slower-growing drugs.
"
644,ABBV,"Goldman Sachs analyst Terence Flynn noted that it ""continues to face competition in breast and lung cancer,"" though its share in treating pancreatic cancer in the U.S., now at 50%, has been growing.
"
645,ABBV,"Analysts expect new indications and geographic expansion to keep Abraxane from petering out.
"
646,ABBV,"Sales of Otezla, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved in March 2014, totaled $90 million in Q2, up 49% from Q1.
"
647,ABBV,"Total revenue in the quarter rose 22% to $2.28 billion. Analysts expect full-year revenue to rise 21% to $9.3 billion. Earnings are seen growing 29% to $4.78 per share and rising another 24% in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters.
"
648,ABBV,"But there's a lot more to come from other drugs percolating in the wings. In Celgene's Q2 report in late July, CEO Bob Hugin said that new transactions with AstraZeneca (AZN), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Receptos (RCPT) would likely speed up earnings growth, starting in 2019.
"
649,ABBV,"The biggest deal, announced mid-July and valued at $7.2 billion, is Celgene's pending acquisition of Receptos, a biotech firm whose lead drug, Ozanimod, has shown good results in treating ulcerative colitis and relapsing multiple sclerosis.
"
650,ABBV,"Biggest Biotech Mergers
"
651,ABBV,"If a higher bid doesn't thwart the deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter, it would be one of the largest mergers and acquisitions in the biotech/drug industry this year, after AbbVie's (ABBV) $21 billion bid for Pharmacyclics (PCYC) and Alexion 's (ALXN) $8.4 billion agreement to merge with Synageva BioPharma (GEVA).
"
652,ABBV,"Celgene's offer for Receptos, amounting to $232 per share, expires August 24.
"
653,ABBV,"Receptos' oral pill Ozanimod could generate around $2 billion in annual revenue for ulcerative colitis alone, plus another $1 billion for MS, Yee says. He puts peak sales in total at $5 billion.
"
654,ABBV,"Phase three data for MS is expected in 2017 and for ulcerative colitis in 2018.
"
655,ABBV,"Another oral drug, which Celgene acquired last year in a $710 million licensing deal with Dublin, Ireland-based Nogra Pharma, could generate $1 billion as well, Yee says. Known as GED-0301, it treats Crohn's disease. Phase three trials are expected to start in Q3, later than initially planned.
"
656,ABBV,"""They have a very robust pipeline of partnerships and new growth drivers, with multiple billion-dollar opportunities over the next five years,"" Yee said.
"
657,ABBV,"Earlier this summer, Celgene announced a 10-year collaboration with Juno to develop and commercialize immunotherapies for patients with cancer and autoimmune diseases.
"
658,ABBV,"Celgene will pay $150 million upfront and buy 9.1 million shares of Juno's stock, at $93 per share. It also has the right to take up to a 30% stake in Juno.
"
659,ABBV,"But it's not all full speed ahead. One ""overhang"" on Celgene's stock, notes Flynn, remains the potentially negative impact of a patent dispute that could shave off some of the years when Revlimid is patent-protected.
"
660,ABBV,"Celgene is in litigation with Allergan (AGN) over some Revlimid patents that extend through 2019 and 2026. A key challenge is on a patent that now expires in 2026. Pretrial hearings are underway.
"
661,ABBV,"Yee expects the two sides to settle before the case goes to court.While drugs for treating and curing hepatitis C have made one biotech company the envy of the industry, another biotech — Celgene — is poised to break ahead of its peer pack over the next few years.Celgene's (CELG) sales and profit growth is seen rising in double digits through at least 2019 from multiple drugs for multiple disorders.Meanwhile, Gilead Sciences (GILD) — the biotech firm behind hepatitis C drug Harvoni and its predecessor Sovaldi — is expected to see earnings slow to low single digits over that time starting in 2016 as patients cure out of the liver virus.Other big-cap biotechs, such as Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB), will also fall far short of Celgene's expected growth rate, analysts say.""Celgene has the best top-line growth in all of large biotech right now and will have the fastest revenue and earnings growth over the next five years,"" said Michael Yee, managing director and analyst with RBC Capital Markets.'Next Major Mover'?Piper Jaffray analysts told clients in a recent research report that Celgene is ""positioned to be a next major mover among large-cap biotech stocks.""They noted that Celgene is a returning name ""as a top large-cap pick for us.""

"
664,ABBV,"It may be somewhat simplistic to describe Amazon as just a retailer. It's now a cloud computing juggernaut. Amazon Web Services generated 81% more revenue in the June quarter than a year ago. That said, the unit is still a small part of the company's overall business.

689,ABBV,"Jazz Pharmaceuticals gets a heavy border in today's Sector Leaders charts (see Page B1) because it's near a 191.11 buy point. But don't let that make you give fellow drugmaker Gilead Sciences short shrift, because it's back above its 10-week moving average as it works on a flat base with a 123.47 buy point. Shares of Gilead (GILD) gapped up…
"
690,ABBV,"Gilead Sciences has been on a winning streak in recent years. But competition and price pressure may push the biotech pace-setter to go for acquisitions to continue the momentum.Gilead's (GILD) Q1 revenue climbed 52 percent from the year-earlier period, while the company's per-share earnings more than doubled. The Foster City, Calif.-based Gilead's annual sales total more than $27 billion, and through the past three years, market value has risen more than fivefold to reach an impressive $177 billion. The stock earns the best possible IBD Composite Rating, 99, which means that the stock has outperformed 99% of all other stocks in a combination of factors including Earnings Per Share and Relative Strength Ratings.Gilead has flourished by focusing on treating HIV and hepatitis patients. Hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni have chalked up more than half of the company's product sales.But a backlash has been building about Sovaldi, because Gilead has priced the drug at $1,000 per pill or $84,000 for the 12-week life of the treatment.""Any time you get a major move like that one, it's very hard for people to completely forget about it,"" said Michael Holland, head of New York money management firm Holland & Co. ""Management has the task of showing people that the biotech boom isn't ready to end yet — and that Gilead will continue to be a major player in the industry. They have to show the world that they have a strong and long-lasting growth strategy, just in case this kind of bad news surfaces again.""""Consumerism is growing in health care, and Gilead will surely feel pressure because of the prices it charges,"" said Paul Carroll, a partner with Devil's Advocate Group, a consulting firm for CEOs. ""This pressure will take some time to build, because any attempt to deny the use of medicine based on the cost brings people out of the woodwork shouting, 'Death panels!' Gilead needs to be preparing a 'doomsday scenario' to imagine what life will be like in a world when it can no longer charge $1,000 per pill.""Not everyone agrees. ""Despite the rhetoric surrounding Sovaldi, Gilead is in a very strong position strategically,"" says Dan Mendelson, CEO of health business advisor Avalere Health. ""It's in a strong position globally because Hep C is one of the big public health issues of our time.""As Dr. Barnett Mennen, a physician of long experience with the pharmaceutical industry, has said, Sovaldi ""has changed the game for many patients. They've offered a cure. How much is that worth to someone who is suffering?""Where Gilead Is VulnerableFactors other than price may put pressure on Gilead. The company's shares plunged about 15 percent last Dec. 22, reaching a four-month low, after the FDA approved rival AbbVie's (ABBV) hepatitis-C product.Around the same time, AbbVie forged an agreement with Express Scripts (ESRX) to offer its drug at a lower price. It became the only hepatitis-C product that the big pharmacy-benefit entity sanctioned.Industry observers say that Gilead can handle the pressure. ""It may be looking at a few acquisition targets"" as a way to lock in its continued solid growth, Brian Skorney, an analyst with Baird in Milwaukee, told IBD.Jacob Plieth, senior editorial analyst at EPVantage, also expects Gilead to pursue acquisitions. ""It's hard to know how else they can proceed. ... when you have a competitor coming in.""In a recent earnings conference call, Gilead COO and President John Milligan said, ""We typically like (acquiring companies) where we can have impact on phase three (drug trials) and where we can accelerate those products either into the approval process or integrator indications after the approval process. And I tend to think still we're looking for things where we feel we can catalyze the development of those products and have a greater utility over them overall.""Acquisition TargetsIn early May, Gilead acquired Danish drugmaker EpiTherapeutics. But which other companies would Gilead buy?Skorney is eyeing such potential takeover targets as South Boston, Mass.-based Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), a global biotech entity that has drawn praise for its work in cystic fibrosis.Vertex could ""fit in nicely with Gilead,"" Skorney said, pointing out that Vertex has put its stamp on treating cystic fibrosis, much as Gilead has focused on hepatitis C. Also, Vertex has more than a dozen continuing programs targeted at other life-threatening diseases.Acquisitions are nothing new to Gilead. In 2011, the company announced an $11 billion acquisition of Pharmasset, giving it further range in treating hepatitis sufferers. The acquisition turned out to be a huge success.But not all acquisitions succeed. ""M&A remains dicey, and there is a long history of bad acquisitions in the pharmaceutical world,"" noted Carroll of Devil's Advocate.Nevertheless, EPVantage's Plieth said, ""Gilead is in a very strong position right now. It has been one of the most amazing biotech stocks, looking back over the past 10-12 years.""

699,ABBV,"With two blockbuster hepatitis C drugs powering sales and profits, Gilead Sciences has become one of the drug industry's hit stocks. Gilead (GILD) stock has soared nearly 150% over the last two years, 19% since a new run-up began May 8. At $178 billion, Gilead's market capitalization is now higher than drug giant Merck's  (MRK), even though its revenue…
"
700,ABBV,"Though facing patent expirations on its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug in 2016, pharmaceutical powerhouse AbbVie says that it can defend Humira from generic challengers — potentially for years.
"
701,ABBV,"In the meantime, AbbVie (ABBV) clinched a $21 billion acquisition in May that, it says, diversifies and bolsters its pipeline of future prescriptions. Drugs in the pipeline could stand in when there's an eventual decline in Humira sales.
"
702,ABBV,"The North Chicago, Ill.-based drugmaker is also riding a wave of strong earnings. Most recently, in April, it reported a double-digit advance in sales. It posted adjusted first-quarter earnings per share of 94 cents, up 32% from a year earlier, on sales of $5.04 billion, up more than 10%.
"
703,ABBV,"Sales of Humira climbed 18% and made up more than 60% of overall revenue.
"
704,ABBV,"AbbVie boasts a three-year EPS growth rate of 11%. It is among the top-ranked companies in IBD's Medical-Ethical Drugs group, with a Composite Rating of 96. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) has the highest in the group, a best-possible 99.
"
705,ABBV,"Also in April, AbbVie raised its adjusted EPS estimate for the full year to a range of $4.10 to $4.30, up from its previous guidance of $4.05 to $4.25, thanks to strong momentum in Humira sales and gains in other drugs, including higher sales of cancer drug Lupron and thyroid-disorder drug Synthroid.
"
706,ABBV,"Humira At The Helm
"
707,ABBV,"Over the past 2 1/2 years, Humira has grown from a $9 billion product to one that generates up to $14 billion in a year, AbbVie says, thanks to gains in both prices and sales volume. About 40% of Humira sales are generated outside of the U.S. As populations age in developed countries, demand for drugs that treat common ailments such as arthritis is steadily mounting, analysts say. 
"
708,ABBV,"AbbVie stock has risen by 27% over the past 12 months and is up 21% from an April dip, though it's ahead only about 4% for the year to date — held in check by Humira patent-expiration worries, analysts say.
"
709,ABBV,"""That's the key pressure on the stock,"" Morningstar analyst Damien Conover told IBD.
"
710,ABBV,"AbbVie is slated to lose certain patent protections on Humira at the end of 2016, making it vulnerable to generic challengers that are eager to introduce so-called biosimilars, or lower-cost versions of the name-brand drug.
"
711,ABBV,"Morningstar estimates that AbbVie could lose up to 15% of its Humira sales annually, beginning in 2017, should producers of biosimilars be allowed to move in and take share. Conover said that several competitors are working on biosimilar versions of Humira, notably including rival Amgen (AMGN), which has developed a version that, it has said, it could start selling in 2017.
"
712,ABBV,"AbbVie executives, however, say that in addition to patents on the finished drug itself, the company has hundreds of other patents globally that cover the formulation and manufacturing of Humira that it can use to legally challenge the introduction of biosimilars, likely delaying the onset of competitive pressure for several years. These patents do not begin to expire until 2022.
"
713,ABBV,"During a call with analysts to discuss first-quarter results, CEO Richard Gonzalez said, ""We have a robust portfolio of intellectual property protecting Humira, which we intend to enforce if infringed by a biosimilar applicant."" The company, he added, expects Humira ""to drive strong growth and significant cash-flow generation for many years.""
"
714,ABBV,"Gonzalez says that AbbVie is also braced for a worst-case scenario, in which a competitor can begin selling a biosimilar as early as 2017. He said that AbbVie would trim costs to keep expenses in line with revenue and protect the bottom line as sales of Humira decline.
"
715,ABBV,"Acquisitions And Expansion
"
716,ABBV,"Meanwhile, AbbVie has moved with haste to diversify its offerings and buttress its pipeline.
"
717,ABBV,"This year, for example, it began selling Viekira Pak, a treatment for hepatitis C that pulled in sales of more than $230 million during the first quarter. Gonzalez said during the earnings call that he expects Viekira to generate an annualized run rate of more than $3 billion in global sales by the end of 2015.
"
718,ABBV,"The company also jumped on the M&A path this year, closing the $21 billion acquisition of Pharmacyclics in May. The deal gives AbbVie rights to Imbruvica, a drug that treats blood cancer. AbbVie said in a news release announcing the deal's closing that the treatment of blood cancer is a $24 billion global market.
"
719,ABBV,"Analysts say that AbbVie also has several drugs in the making that span its areas of expertise: virology, immunology, neurology and oncology. In oncology alone, Gonzalez says, AbbVie has five drugs poised to launch over the next few years. They will complement Imbruvica, he says, and will help the company grow share in the blood-cancer treatment arena.
"
720,ABBV,"""They've got a great pipeline,"" Morningstar's Conover said. ""That should mitigate the patent headwind.""
"
721,ABBV,"More dealmaking, too, could follow and help add to AbbVie's product lineup.
"
722,ABBV,"""You can either build it or you can buy it, and in the case of a company with important patents expiring, it will look to buy that growth in order to get ahead of what could otherwise be a declining revenue stream,"" Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank and an observer of the prescription-drug industry, told IBD.
"
723,ABBV,"An AbbVie spokeswoman did not respond to IBD's interview request. While speaking at a conference in May, AbbVie CFO Bill Chase told investors that another deal in the $20 billion range was not likely in the near term. But he said that the company continues to look for ""tuck-in"" deals that would help further complement its existing pipeline.
"
724,ABBV,"AbbVie, Chase said, is not ""turning off the M&A engine,"" but it is ""much more likely"" to pursue ""the sorts of transactions that we have done since 2009 onward, which were largely single-asset additions to our pipeline.""Though facing patent expirations on its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug in 2016, pharmaceutical powerhouse AbbVie says that it can defend Humira from generic challengers — potentially for years.In the meantime, AbbVie (ABBV) clinched a $21 billion acquisition in May that, it says, diversifies and bolsters its pipeline of future prescriptions.

871,ABBV,"Thursday brought a passel of earnings reports from large-cap drugmakers, which the market greeted with a mostly unenthusiastic response. One of the most anticipated reports came from AbbVie (ABBV), which unveiled its first full quarter with hepatitis C treatment Viekira Pak and addressed questions buzzing around Wall Street about its spending strategy.
"
872,ABBV,"AbbVie's Q1 earnings rose 32% over the year-earlier quarter to 94 cents a share, 9 cents above analysts' consensus, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales climbed 10.5% to $5.04 billion, about $60 million above consensus. The company raised its full-year EPS guidance by 5 cents, to $4.10-$4.30, in line with analysts' $4.19.
"
873,ABBV,"Leading drug Humira drove the beat, with sales of $3.1 billion — about $155 million above consensus and up 18% from last year's Q1. On the conference call with analysts, CFO William Chase said shipment timing helped sales and AbbVie sticks by its previous guidance of midteens growth for the year.
"
874,ABBV,"Viekira, which launched in late December, yielded $231 million, below analysts' estimate of $268 million. On the call, Chase said AbbVie's contracts with providers should start kicking in this quarter, so he affirmed previous guidance of a $3 billion run rate by year-end.
"
875,ABBV,"The light quarter did undergird recent analyst speculation that rival Gilead Sciences (GILD) is on track to beat expectations.
"
876,ABBV,"AbbVie's stock opened higher, but was down nearly 2% in midday trading Thursday. The first two questions in the analyst Q&A on its earnings conference call involved whether AbbVie could improve profit margins by lowering costs, with the second analyst, Goldman Sachs' Jami Rubin, saying bluntly that the company seemed to be spending too much money on marketing. CEO Rick Gonzalez disagreed, saying AbbVie's investment strategy was paying off. Nonetheless, he allowed that the firm was prepared to cut if an unexpected downturn in sales occurred.

911,ABBV,"The company guided Q2 earnings on the high side of consensus at 99 cents to $1.01 a share, but it shaved a few cents off its previous full-year guidance, now $3.92 to $3.97. The lowering was due to foreign-exchange headwinds, which analysts say was generally expected.

965,ABBV,"When the FDA last month approved the first biosimilar drug, the U.S. took its first step into a lucrative but potentially disruptive field of medicine.Pfizer (PFE), which is moving big into biosimilars with its $17 billion Hospira (HSP) acquisition, has estimated that global biosimilar sales could hit $17 billion to $20 billion per year by 2020. Sales are just $1 billion yearly now, mainly in the European Union.With the March 5 approval of Zarxio, Novartis' (NVS) biosimilar version of Amgen's (AMGN) aging blockbuster Neupogen, the U.S. market cracked open.""As the FDA becomes more comfortable ... we're going to see biosimilars get through a lot more easily,"" predicted Jitendra Malik, an attorney with Alston & Bird who specializes in intellectual-property and drug-approval issues. ""The first one's always the hardest to get through, because the FDA is more cautious — it's uncharted territory.""For years, the biotech revolution not only brought life-saving new medicines, but also profit-saving protections against competitors. While traditional pharmaceuticals can be assembled by machines from different chemical ingredients, biologic drugs are formed by biological processes, like a high-tech version of fermentation. Many of these processes are trade secrets that, unlike patents, have no expiration date.Reverse EngineeringAs more companies became familiar with biotech manufacturing, however, they were able to reverse-engineer the process to create biosimilar drugs — not identical to the originals, but close enough. Novartis' Sandoz unit, historically devoted to traditional generic drugs, has been a pioneer in the field, already selling biosimilar versions of Neupogen and its sister drug Epogen in Europe.Many others are lined up at the U.S. border with their own products. Hospira and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) have launched their own versions of Neupogen in Europe. Some companies are working on biosimilar versions of AbbVie's (ABBV) blockbuster immunology drug Humira, including Sandoz, Hospira, Pfizer (prior to acquiring Hospira), Amgen and German pharma giant Boehringer Ingelheim.When AbbVie announced its richly priced acquisition of Pharmacyclics (PCYC) in March, some analysts figured it was driven by the need for another blockbuster in the face of Humira competitors.Key Biologics Face RivalsOther drugs with biosimilar versions in late-stage testing include Biogen's (BIIB) cancer drug Rituxan, Roche's (RHHBY) breast-cancer treatment Herceptin, and Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Remicade. And Merck (MRK) is developing a biosimilar version of Sanofi's (SNY) popular diabetes drug Lantus.Hospira's biosimilar version of Remicade already has been approved in Europe and was expected to be OK'd in the U.S. in Q1. But in February, the FDA delayed its advisory-panel meeting on the product ""due to information requests pending with the sponsor of the application.""Analysts are closely watching the biosimilar's rollout in Europe. Remicade is approved for a variety of ailments, from psoriasis to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to rheumatoid arthritis, and will provide a test case for how willing the different specialists are to use the knockoff without independent studies.""B(iosimilar)-Remicade was approved without gastroenterology studies, which account for 50% of Remicade sales,"" wrote Leerink analyst Jason Gerberry in a December research report. ""Some gastroenterology specialists we've spoken with do not plan to use b-Remicade for IBD indications until clinical studies report out in late 2015 or 2016.""In Europe, biosimilar versions of Neupogen have taken about 30% of the market. Analysts generally expect the same for the U.S., but much depends on where the drugs are priced.Generic pharmaceuticals generally go for a fraction of the original drug's price, driving the retail value down so much that the original developers stop marketing the products (though they do keep manufacturing them). Biosimilars are more difficult and expensive to develop, so there are fewer players and less pricing competition.Novartis still hasn't launched Zarxio and is keeping mum about its price. Company spokeswoman Geena Wardaki told Investor's Business Daily in an email, ""For biosimilars in general, we typically expect discounts to be in the range of 10% to 30% below the reference biologic. However, this depends on therapeutic area, market, channel, number of competitors and reimbursement situation.""CMS Vs. FDA On BiosimilarsOn Tuesday, the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced that physicians prescribing Medicare Part B drugs would be reimbursed for biosimilars in the same way as for the original drugs — average selling price plus 6%. Pharmacies dispensing part D drugs can exclude the original from their lists of preferred drugs in favor of the biosimilar if they wish, so long as they provide a transitional supply of the original for patients already taking it.That implies that CMS is treating biosimilars as effectively interchangeable with the originals, further muddying an issue that's already unclear. The FDA ruled that although Zarxio can be used for all five of the uses approved for Neupogen — boosting blood cells in various kinds of cancer patients — it's not technically interchangeable. That means that if a doctor prescribes the original drug, a pharmacy can't fill it with the biosimilar.That doesn't matter so much for Zarxio, since the drug is administered via hospitals and clinics rather than retail pharmacies. Nonetheless, some drugmakers might find it worthwhile to file separately for an interchangeability approval, which will likely involve studies of patients switching between products, say experts in the matter.""That would be a deterrent to a second person coming in,"" said Malik. ""If I can show that my product is interchangeable, that doesn't necessarily mean that another applicant down the road can do the same thing just by piggybacking on me. In a lot of cases, the structure (of the original drug) is not perfectly known, and you do have to spend time convincing people that it's the same.""Yet another question is how aggressive the payers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) will be in pushing biosimilars ahead of the original drugs to save costs. In a March 29 report, analyst Gerberry wrote that two unnamed ""payer specialists"" had told him that payers will probably leave a grace period of six to 12 months for doctors to get used to biosimilars, but then start to lean harder.""Specialists expect policies to grandfather stable patients receiving anti-TNF therapy (e.g., Remicade) at same reimbursement, but new patients or new switches would likely be required to go through a prior authorization requiring patients use biosimilar first,"" he wrote.Gillian Woollett, senior vice president at the consulting firm Avalere Health, says another issue is naming. When a company develops a new drug, it gets a generic (also called nonproprietary) name and a brand name, and the generic name (filgrastim, in the case of Neupogen) is used by all generic drugmakers when the patents expire.What's In A Name?Many biologics approved by the FDA, even when they have never been compared, also share nonproprietary names because this is simply the name of the active ingredient and not the name of the product. Biosimilars in most other markets share the nonproprietary name of their reference product too, but in the U.S., with the first approval, the FDA assigned makers a ""placeholder nonproprietary name,"" in this case filgrastim-sndz.""The naming thing is an important space to watch,"" Woollett told Investor's Business Daily. ""I think these are all going to be branded products, and all biosimilars, like most originator biologics, will have brand names — again, the generic-drug situation is totally different, as most generics do not have brand names.""

966,ABBV,"Best ETFs 2015: April Performance UpdateValue stocks gained ground with ETF investors in the past month as the markets remain choppy. But growth-oriented exchange traded funds continue to lead year to date. They tend to hold more stocks that offer the promise of higher returns, while presenting greater risks. Value-oriented ETFs focus on safer, more mature stocks.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), which tracks the broad stock market, rose 2% during the last four weeks. It's up 2.2% so far in 2015.Investors' bullishness stems in part from the Federal Reserve's holding interest rates lower for longer. News of corporate acquisitions is also helping, says Russ Koesterich, BlackRock's (BLK) global chief investment strategist.""One positive side effect of the extraordinary low interest rates is a continuation, even acceleration, in merger activity,"" Koesterich wrote in an April 13 note. Low rates make money cheap and readily available for financing large deals.Last week, two multinationals announced acquisitions to expand internationally. FedEx (FDX) agreed to buy Dutch delivery service TNT for $4.8 billion. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) offered to buy BG Group for $70.2 billion.Along with M&As, initial public offerings are chugging along, albeit below last year's record pace. The 37 IPOs priced in 2015 thus far have raised $5.6 billion, according to IPO expert Renaissance Capital.Web host and domain registrar GoDaddy (GDDY), for instance, raised $460 million in its IPO March 31, hitting above expectations.Such signs of strength are helping U.S. diversified stock ETFs. First Trust U.S. IPO (FPX) grew 4.3% in the trailing one month and 8.2% year to date. The large-cap growth fund holds the 100 largest and most liquid U.S. IPOs. It has $638.4 million in assets, more than half of which are in the tech and consumer sectors currently in favor.

1028,ABBV,"Two of the world's biggest drugmakers issued a mixture of Q4 reports Friday in what continues to be a tough earnings season.AbbVie (ABBV) said profit excluding one-time items rose 8.5% over the year-earlier quarter to 89 cents, beating analysts' consensus by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales climbed 5.1% to $5.37 billion, $11 million ahead of consensus.For the full year, profit increased 5.7% to $3.32 a share, with sales gaining 6.2% to $19.96 billion.AbbVie affirmed the 2015 guidance it issued earlier this month, which called for earnings of $4.25 to $4.45 but didn't set out a revenue range.However, on the conference call with analysts, CEO Richard Gonzalez said he expects the newly launch hepatitis C combo Viekira Pak to achieve a run rate of $3 billion by the end of this year. In the midst of AbbVie's hepatitis C battle with Gilead Sciences (GILD) to land exclusive deals with payers, Gonzalez said he expects about 40% of insured patients will have access to Viekira Pak.RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee calculated that this will mean about $2 billion this year, which is below consensus of $2.8 billion.""On the positive, ABBV announced their '2nd generation' regimen (improved possible single pill w/ no booster or ribavirin) and will have data soon and plan to go to Phase III later this year. .. . This is one way they may maintain some share as an alternative to GILD,"" Yee wrote in a research note Friday.Still, AbbVie shares fell 2.7% to 61.41 in afternoon trading in the stock market today. The stock fell to a three-month low intraday of 60.12.Eli Lilly (LLY), still in the shadow of the patent cliff, reported that sales shrank 12% to $5.12 billion, missing consensus by nearly $80 million. Earnings rose 1% to 75 cents a share, beating the Street's average estimate by 2 cents.For the full year, profit dropped 33% to $2.78 a share while sales slid 15% to $19.61 billion.Lilly also affirmed its earlier profit guidance of $2.40 to $2.50 a share, but shaved $800 million off its revenue guidance, which is now $19.5 billion to $20 billion. Singing a familiar tune for this earnings season, Lilly blamed the lowered guidance ""solely to reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared with several other currencies.""However, S&P Capital IQ analyst Jeffrey Loo was heartened that the EPS guidance stayed the same, as it pointed to better-than-expected gross margin. He raised his price target to 74 from 66, saying that ""2014 was the low point for sales and (we) see improving growth over the next few years.""Lilly's stock rose 0.9% to 72.73 in afternoon trading.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.

1030,ABBV,"Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) said U.S. prescription-drug spending rose more last year than it had since 2003, according to its annual review. According to the 2014 Drug Trend Report, spending on drugs among the commercially insured rose 13.1% to $980 per member last year. Medicare spending rose 13.8% to $2,987 per member, while Medicaid spending climbed 10.2% to $882.
"
1031,ABBV,"The report said that spending on hepatitis C drugs accounted for more than half of the increase, which was not a big surprise: Before 2014 the disease was still treated mainly with generic drugs, but in 2014 Gilead Sciences' (GILD) premium-priced Sovaldi, often prescribed in tandem with Johnson & Johnson 's (JNJ) also-pricey Olysio, took over the market. In October, Gilead launched Harvoni, which rendered Olysio obsolete but cost more than Sovaldi.
"
1032,ABBV,"Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefits management leader, was one of the earliest and loudest critics of Sovaldi's price, which amounted to $84,000 for a standard 12-week treatment. In its press release accompanying the report, the PBM bragged about how it had taken a bite out of Gilead by making an exclusive deal with AbbVie (ABBV), when it came out with Gilead's first serious competitor in the form of Viekira Pak near year's end. Express claimed that this would save clients $1 billion this year.
"
1033,ABBV,"It's not clear, however, how well this is working out for AbbVie. Analysts tracking prescription data estimate that it only has about 10% market share, although the data are incomplete and won't be fully known until AbbVie's Q1 report. Another caveat is that Express' price data does not include rebates, which are a significant part of the picture, especially in the hepatitis C market lately.
"
1034,ABBV,"When Gilead reported its Q4 last month, investors had a minor freak out after company executives guided the gross-to-net adjustment — i.e. the rebate level — on the hepatitis C franchise at 46%.
"
1035,ABBV,"Express Scripts' release also echoed comments made by its CEO at January's JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, where he indicated the next price war target would be PCSK9 inhibitors, a new class of cholesterol drugs expected to come to market this year with two offerings from Amgen (AMGN) and the team of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY).

""If we were to assume 10% market share for ABBV among non-exclusive/preferred lives, we see overall share for ABBV at 14% and US sales at $1.25 billion in 2015.""With added revenues from Europe, where the drugs in Viekira Pak are expected to launch this year both as a set and as separate products, Karnauskas arrived at total HCV sales of $2 billion vs. $2.7 billion consensus. However, she also expects Gilead is going to low-ball consensus due to the price discounts it's had to negotiate to compete with AbbVie.""At worst case, we expect discounts in commercial channels to be 15% for Harvoni (5% Sovaldi) which coupled with government discounts (40% Harvoni, 30% Sovaldi) calculates to 22% overall discount for HCV franchise,"" she wrote, explaining that this could result in revenue guidance $1 billion lower than the present consensus of $28.6 billion. ""If guidance comes $2.5 billion lower that would validate what PBMs (pharmacy benefit managers) are telegraphing regarding discounts.""AbbVie is due to report Q4 and 2015 guidance on Jan. 30. Gilead hasn't yet set a date for its report.Despite these lowered estimates, Karnauskas maintained a buy rating on both stocks due to their pipelines full of other promising drug candidates.

1080,ABBV,"Monday brought a surprising turn to the twisting story of hepatitis C treatments, as pharmacy giant CVS Health said it will offer exclusive coverage for Gilead Sciences' hep C drugs.
"
1081,ABBV,"But the key issue of price remained unanswered.The deal seemed to counterattack one cut two weeks ago between pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) and AbbVie (ABBV), days after the FDA OK'd AbbVie's four-drug Viekira Pak for genotype 1 of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Express Scripts said that at the start of 2015 it would cover only the Viekira Pak for genotype 1 patients, unless they'd already started a course with another drug.Although both firms were tight-lipped on the details, CVS' (CVS) deal appeared to mirror Express Scripts'. Starting Wednesday, CVS, which also operates as a pharmacy benefit manager, will cover Gilead's (GILD) Sovaldi and Harvoni exclusively on its CVS/Caremark Standard Commercial, Exchange (Marketplace), Medicare Part D and Medicaid formularies. Viekira Pak would be covered only for patients who got an exception or prior approval.What they didn't say was how much CVS will pay for the drugs.Price was the big motive behind Express Scripts' deal, as it had objected to the cost of the new hepatitis C drugs ever since Sovaldi launched in December 2013 at $84,000 for a 12-week round of therapy.Harvoni, which for most patients eliminated the need for companion drugs, launched in October at $94,500 for 12 weeks.However, there wasn't much anyone could do about it as long as there were no competitors of equal quality on the market.When the Viekira Pak was approved on Dec. 19, a price war seemed to have been averted as the treatment priced at a modest discount to Harvoni — $83,319 for 12 weeks — which most analysts thought accounted for the fact that it's more complicated to take than one-pill-a-day Harvoni, though it's equally effective.Price Subject To HagglingAs Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum has observed, the official list price of a drug is a lot like the sticker price on a car, just a starting point for haggling.AbbVie acknowledged that Express got Viekira Pak at a discount, though it declined to reveal how much. Analysts think it could have been 25% to 30%.Gilead's stock fell more than 17% the day Express disclosed the deal, and some analysts cut their ratings or lowered their targets.Monday's news helped Gilead's stock rally 2%. AbbVie fell 2%.""Gilead is not a biotech start-up,"" Maxim Group analyst Jason Kolbert said Monday. ""This is a savvy, marketing-driven company that understands how to launch and manage a product life cycle. .. . Don't underestimate Gilead's ability to manage the competitive environment.""In his own research note Monday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee pointed out that he and most of the Street had already assumed a Gilead price cut once Viekira Pak came out.""We already have a steep 15% gross to net and moving to 18% over the following few quarters,"" Yee wrote. ""So it's not like we think the average price to CVS is going to be drastically different than a 15%-20% discount.""

1092,ABBV,"Big pharma AbbVie's $21 billion deal to acquire hot biotech Pharmacyclics was met with widespread skepticism by AbbVie investors Thursday, sending AbbVie's stock falling 5.7% Thursday.AbbVie (ABBV) announced the cash-and-stock acquisition late Wednesday after rumors had been swirling all afternoon that Novartis (NVS) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) were engaged in a bidding war for Pharmacyclics (PCYC). It surprised Wall Street that AbbVie turned out to be the buyer, especially since J&J already has a partnership with Pharmacyclics to market its blood-cancer drug Imbruvica.""What doesn't really make sense to us is AbbVie prevailing over PCYC's partner and natural buyer, JNJ, to secure PCYC, and paying the price that they did for the asset,"" Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a research note Thursday. ""We believed that JNJ was the only buyer able to secure the operational advantage of full control by buying out their partner, and JNJ, more than any other buyer, would have been able to maximize the synergies by reducing the product's support to a single commercial organization.""The cash-and-stock deal values Pharmacyclics at 261 a share. Its stock rose 10% Thursday to 254.22. The stock traded at 122 at the start of the year.In a conference call with analysts early Thursday, AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez affirmed that the bidding war had come down to three contestants, which he didn't name. He justified the price by citing the enormous market potential for Imbruvica, which launched in late 2013 and brought Pharmacyclics $548 million last year. By AbbVie's reckoning, Imbruvica will bring the firm $7 billion a year at peak — and that's with no change to the existing deal that splits the profits with J&J.Evercore ISI says this assumes total worldwide sales of $11.5 billion to $12 billion, which would make Imbruvica the biggest-selling cancer drug in history, says analyst Mark Schoenebaum. Analysts' consensus sales estimates are bullish but not that bullish: For 2025, the latest year available, the average estimate is $8.3 billion.On the call, Gonzalez broke down the assumptions behind that number. About 25% of the growth would come from expansion in Imbruvica's currently approved uses, as a second-line treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle-cell lymphoma, as well as an anytime treatment for the less common conditions of CLL with 17p deletion and Waldenstrom's macroglobulemia.An additional 30% would come from expansion into first-line treatment for CLL and lymphoma, which Gonzalez says has a ""very high probability of success,"" given the clinical-trial data.The rest would come from unspecified amounts accounting for approval in other cancers of the B cells, and a more speculative assumption that the product will also work on solid tumors.""We did see the data on solid tumors, and we were impressed,"" Gonzalez said.Many analysts viewed AbbVie's late-stage blood-cancer candidate ABT-199 as a potential competitor to Imbruvica. Chief Scientific Officer Michael Severino said the two drugs can potentially work in combination, and he expects to launch clinical trials to prove it.In general, executives said the acquisition should boost AbbVie's entire cancer business by as much as $15 billion or $20 billion by the 2020s. That would be a change of focus for AbbVie, which made its fortune in immunology with the blockbuster drug Humira. However, Humira will likely get biosimilar competition from Amgen (AMGN), Pfizer (PFE) and others after its patent expires in 2018. On the call, Gonzalez affirmed AbbVie's commitment to Humira, both by defending its patents in court and by developing new-and-improved versions of the drug, and said this had nothing to do with the price paid for Pharmacyclics.Analyst Porges, however, said that ""the premium here may be explained by AbbVie's desperation.""

"
1107,ABBV,"That brought Shire (SHPG) deeper into the growing field of rare-disease drugs, helping it diversify from its core business in attention-deficit treatments. It has also made a number of smaller buyouts.

"
1109,ABBV,"North Chicago-based big pharma AbbVie (ABBV) successfully wooed Shire back in July with a nearly $55 billion offer, with which AbbVie planned to cut its taxes by relocating its headquarters to Britain.
"
1110,ABBV,"After the Treasury Department proposed new rules in September that would limit the benefits of such deals — and since AbbVie was legally unable to renegotiate terms — the big pharma backed out, leaving Shire with a $1.63 billion breakup fee.

"
1112,ABBV,"Ornskov recently spoke with IBD about the AbbVie adventure and Shire's strategy.
"
1113,ABBV,"IBD: When AbbVie first made its bid, you initially resisted. Apart from the issue of price, was becoming part of a big pharma ever in your plans? Is it now?
"
1114,ABBV,"Ornskov: No, the situation (when AbbVie made its bid) was that we went out and put a strong case to the investors for us staying independent. We laid out the plan called 10-by-20 — achieving $10 billion in (annual) sales by 2020. AbbVie increased their offer a number of times, and eventually I think the board of Shire felt that the number they were offering was of such a magnitude that they had to recommend it. That's also the feedback they got from the investors.
"
1115,ABBV,"The deal did not happen, and there can be a lot of speculation about tax deals and the importance of that. I think for us right now, the most important thing is we have a strong opportunity as an independent company.

We've made at least three deals during this period of time — Lumena, Fibrotech and a company called Bikam, in the ophthalmic area.

We find that these companies are characterized by innovative pipelines, high growth, high profitability, and very strong research focus and patient focus.

"
1173,ABBV,"For decades, Charlotte Stewart was carrying around a virus that was like the houseguest that refused to leave: hepatitis C.
"
1174,ABBV,"Stewart was first diagnosed with HCV in 1998, but she believes she contracted it as much as 20 years earlier, when she received two blood transfusions and three injections with blood-related products.
"
1175,ABBV,"By the time the virus was detected, her liver was already showing the scarring, known as cirrhosis, that appears in the more advanced cases of the disease.
"
1176,ABBV,"""Fortunately, that didn't get much worse, because I did do the treatment,"" Stewart, now 66, told IBD. ""I did six rounds of treatment, with the sixth being Harvoni.""
"
1177,ABBV,"Harvoni is the new pill just launched this month by Gilead Sciences (GILD), which Stewart got early because she participated in its clinical trials. Harvoni is a combination of the novel drug ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, which for nearly a year has been sold alone under the brand name Sovaldi.
"
1178,ABBV,"High Hopes
"
1179,ABBV,"Sovaldi's launch smashed all previous new drug launches. Since it came out in December 2013 it has racked up nearly $6 billion in sales — and that's before Gilead's third-quarter report, which is due on Oct. 28. Since Harvoni is the new-and-improved Sovaldi, analysts expect it to treat even more patients.
"
1180,ABBV,"Stewart's previous treatment experience shows just why Gilead is rolling in money right now.
"
1181,ABBV,"Her first four treatments were variations on the combination of interferon and ribavirin, which was the standard at the time. She credits those treatments with slowing her liver damage, but they didn't get rid of the HCV and they did make her feel sick.
"
1182,ABBV,"In fact, her third treatment round, which involved daily injections of interferon, drove down her blood-cell counts so low that she nearly landed in the hospital.
"
1183,ABBV,"""It was very difficult going through those treatments,"" she said. ""I always developed anemia. Achiness, fevers, chills and no energy.""
"
1184,ABBV,"In contrast, when she was in the Harvoni trial, she took one pill a day for 12 weeks and suffered no side effects. After 12 weeks, her viral load was undetectable — and still is, more than a year later.
"
1185,ABBV,"""Physically, I have more energy, and just overall better health,"" Stewart said. ""Mentally and emotionally, it's like having a huge weight taken off you.""
"
1186,ABBV,"More than 90% of patients in the trial responded that way. Yet Gilead's stock fell 2% the day Harvoni was approved, and it kept falling the next three days after that.
"
1187,ABBV,"In a way, that's been the story of Gilead's life since the Sovaldi launch. Though the company scores high by IBD metrics with a perfect Composite Rating of 99, its price/earnings multiple is more like that of a big pharma than a booming biotech, say drug analysts. And just about every hint of bad news seems to trigger a sell-off.
"
1188,ABBV,"The biggest cause of concern has been price. Sovaldi's price of $1,000 a pill — which adds up to $84,000 for a 12-week course — came under fire from advocacy groups, insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and even members of Congress. However, nobody could really do anything about it so long as Sovaldi was so clearly superior to everything else on the market.
"
1189,ABBV,"Gilead priced Harvoni basically at parity with Sovaldi. Since most patients still had to take interferon and ribavirin along with Sovaldi — and those drugs are generic and therefore cheaper — Gilead marked Harvoni up 12.5% from Sovaldi to cover for the cost of the two absent drugs.
"
1190,ABBV,"However, Harvoni's official label allows that an eight-week treatment ""can be considered"" for patients without cirrhosis who haven't been treated before. Gilead estimates that 45% of patients may be eligible for this.
"
1191,ABBV,"Given this, FBR analyst Andrew Berens estimates that the average cost of Harvoni treatment will be about $80,000.
"
1192,ABBV,"However, he also pointed out that cirrhotic patients whose previous treatments have failed — patients like Charlotte Stewart — are recommended to take Harvoni for 24 weeks. He also says patients whose Sovaldi treatments have failed may represent an underrated opportunity.
"
1193,ABBV,"""Using our HCV patient flow model, we calculate over 250,000 total patients needing re-treatment over Sovaldi's viable patent life, over $12 billion in the U.S. alone,"" Berens wrote in an Oct. 13 note, in which he raised his estimate of 2015 U.S. Harvoni sales to $8.9 billion from $8.1 billion.
"
1194,ABBV,"But the longer-term threat to Gilead's pricing power is competition. The next few months will bring a lot more clarity on what that competition will look like.
"
1195,ABBV,"The first real peer to Harvoni is expected to be AbbVie 's (ABBV) 3D regimen, which the FDA is due to make an approval decision on by Dec. 22.
"
1196,ABBV,"In clinical trials, the 3D regimen has been comparable to Harvoni in safety and effectiveness, but it does involve three different drugs, which makes it easier for patients to mess up.
"
1197,ABBV,"Discount Price?
"
1198,ABBV,"AbbVie's management has been tight-lipped about how it will price the drug, leaving Wall Street to speculate about how much it will be willing to undercut Harvoni.
"
1199,ABBV,"ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum expects that it will probably price comparably and perhaps offer rebates to certain customers, but he estimates there's a 1% to 15% chance that AbbVie will price at a significant discount.
"
1200,ABBV,"Before that happens — on the second weekend in November, to be precise — Merck (MRK) will report mid-stage trial data on its own HCV program, which could potentially cut down the treatment time to four weeks.
"
1201,ABBV,"That wouldn't launch for a few more years, but the drug industry tends to think in long time frames. When Gilead acquired sofosbuvir with its buyout of Pharmasset in Nov. 2011, it was already thinking about the fact that its legacy HIV franchise — such blockbusters as Viread, Truvada and Atripla — will start going off patent in 2018.
"
1202,ABBV,"The HCV franchise is filling that space now, but Gilead hasn't exactly given up on HIV either. On Sept. 25, Gilead reported positive late-stage trial results for a drug that analysts have dubbed ""son of Viread,"" because it's a similar compound but with fewer side effects.
"
1203,ABBV,"Whatever the long-term future may hold, Gilead's near-term success is expected to roll on. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Gilead to report Q3 earnings of $1.92 a share, up 269% from the prior year.

1209,ABBV,"Investors and analysts seemed optimistic, though, as Shire (SHPG) stock was up 3% in early trading on the stock market today, near 175.50.
"
1210,ABBV,"Leerink analyst Jason Gerberry wrote in a research note Thursday that Shire is unlikely to attract another buyer at this point. Though Pfizer (PFE) and Allergan (AGN) have been rumored to be interested in the firm, the same potential changes to tax-inversion rules that killed AbbVie's (ABBV) interest would likely do the same for theirs, he said.
"
1211,ABBV,"""With an additional $1.6 billion in cash from a likely break-up fee, we view SHPG as more likely buyers in the M&A market; we'd expect CEO Flemming Ornskov to resume his orphan asset roll-up,"" Gerberry wrote of Shire's looking to buy drugs that treat rare medical conditions.
"
1212,ABBV,"He added that some upcoming events could boost the stock price, including potential approval next year of the drug lifitegrast for dry-eye disease, ""a potential blockbuster indication.""
"
1213,ABBV,"Gerberry, though, cut his price target of Shire stock to 198 from 278, but given that the stock was trading below 174 after Wednesday's 30% plunge, he sees a buying opportunity.
"
1214,ABBV,"Bank of America's Graham Parry echoed the point. He upgraded the stock to buy Wednesday based on its price drop. In a Thursday note, he re-emphasized the buying opportunity, ""given an attractive entry price on fundamentals and a compelling stand-alone investment case.""
"
1215,ABBV,"Shire was already a high-rated stock before the AbbVie deal jacked up its IBD Relative Strength Rating, which is likely why AbbVie had to raise its offer four times before finally clinching the deal this summer. Even after Wednesday's hit, the stock boasts a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99.

AbbVie agreed to discount the drug to get on the list, amid concerns that the hep C drugs from both AbbVie and Gilead are too expensive for many low-income patients.Harvoni costs $94,500 for 12 weeks of treatment, compared to Viekira Pak's $83,319. Sovaldi costs $84,000 for a 12-week treatment.""Our goal was to create the lowest net-cost solution for the entire population of patients with all genotypes of hepatitis C,"" CVS said, according to Bloomberg. It was unclear if Gilead and CVS agreed to any kind of discount.Express Scripts, in announcing its decision to add AbbVie's drug to its preferred list, cited concerns about a lack of sufficient price competition in the hepatitis C drug space. The company's clients have also warned about costs.""If the specialty drug trend continues to increase by double-digit percentages, payers will be forced to implement even more narrow management tools, thus limiting the number of patients who can afford to receive the drug therapy,"" Paula Jakub, CEO American Foreign Service Protective Association, said last month. ""It only makes sense for manufacturers to work with payers on pricing decisions.""Gilead's shares tumbled 15.5% on Dec. 22, the day of Express Scripts' announcement.

1255,ABBV,"Big-cap biotech Celgene made its name as a cancer fighter, but now it's branching out into diseases of the immune system. And one of the biggest tests of this new strategy comes this weekend.At the United European Gastroenterology Week in Vienna, which runs Saturday to Oct. 22, Celgene (CELG) is set to present phase-two data on GED-0301, a treatment for Crohn's disease, an inflammatory disease of the GI tract. Celgene licensed the drug in April from privately held Nogra Pharma for an upfront payment of $710 million, with up to $815 million in regulatory and development milestone payments and up to $1.05 billion in sales milestone payments, should the drug launch.The price raised eyebrows on Wall Street. Few had heard of Nogra Pharma, and $710 million was the most that Celgene had ever paid upfront in a licensing deal. And the only information that had been publicly released was from a phase-one trial, which had only 15 subjects and was not placebo-controlled.Celgene, however, said that it already knew the phase-two data and that it was worth the price.""GED-0301 is a potentially transformative therapy that demonstrated striking clinical activity in a phase-two trial for Crohn's disease,"" Scott Smith, Celgene's global head of inflammation and immunology, said in a press release at the time.As the date of GED-0301's release nears, Wall Street's curiosity — and optimism — has been building.According to RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee, about 20% to 30% of the combined $17 billion in sales of the world's two leading immunology drugs — AbbVie's (ABBV) Humira and Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Remicade — comes from the treatment of Crohn's disease.The cause of the disease is still mysterious, and treatment is more about management than cure. According to Yee, about a third of patients don't respond to the drugs, and for those that do relapses are frequent.So it's a potentially huge opportunity if Celgene's drug works.Still, the drug has taken a while to get much attention. As recently as Aug. 26, Deutsche Bank analyst Robyn Karnauskas could assert that GED-0301 was not modeled into Wall Street's consensus numbers and therefore brought a huge potential for upside.Since then, the bandwagon has gotten more crowded.On Sept. 22, Nomura Securities analyst Ian Somaiya reported on an interview with an investigator who participated in the clinical trial. Although the study was doubled-blinded so he didn't know which patients got GED-0301 and which got the placebo, the investigator reported that three out of seven patients went into clinical remission, and the response time was less than half the usual two weeks that Humira takes. Somaiya also observed no safety problems.'Strong Efficacy' Expected""We believe the full phase-two data will reflect this clinical site's findings, confirming strong efficacy seen in phase-one trial, with rapid benefit and durable remission and a clean safety profile,"" Somaiya wrote in his research note. ""We estimate GED-0301 could reach $2.2 billion in peak worldwide sales and drive upside of $7 to CELG shares.""Anticipation of the drug may have boosted Celgene's stock, which was trading near record highs before this week's market crash.Evidence that GED-0301 might be driving Celgene's rise came on Sept. 11, when the stock dropped 5% over three trading days. There wasn't any apparent reason except a short note put out late on Sept. 10 by ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum, who reported from a meeting that he'd had with Celgene's management.""New Crohn's disease drug is unlikely to be 'once daily' product,"" Schoenebaum wrote. ""This is due to theoretical risk of fibrotic changes with long-term exposure. However, company very interested in studying re-treatment and/or intermittent dosing (e.g., 3 months on/3 months off).""Fibrosis, or a hardening and thickening of the bowel wall, is a common symptom of Crohn's disease. The idea that long-term exposure to GED-0301 might make it worse seems to have spooked investors.Schoenebaum apparently blamed himself for the stock's drop, because the next day he put out a clarification emphasizing the word ""theoretical"" in his note and noted that no such problems had been reported from the trials.If all goes well, GED-0301 is expected to launch around 2017.It would be Celgene's second immunology drug after its first, Otezla, hit the market in March for psoriatic arthritis. On Sept. 23, it was also approved for psoriasis, a larger market. The Street estimates that peak annual sales of Otezla could pass $2 billion.

1256,ABBV,"Think sizzling new stock and Alibaba (BABA) pole-vaults to mind.
"
1257,ABBV,"But ETF investors won't find that Chinese e-commerce behemoth in most broad-based products. And so they most likely missed out on Alibaba's 21% gains since its door-busting $25 billion IPO in New York just two months ago.
"
1258,ABBV,"Broad, mainstream indexes tend to be conservative and are slow to include debuting stocks, said Kathleen Smith, principal of Renaissance Capital, an IPO research and investment management firm.
"
1259,ABBV,"IPO ETFs aim to fix that sluggishness. Renaissance IPO (IPO) snaps up the largest and most liquid newly listed U.S. companies in as little as five days of initial trading, or upon quarterly review.
"
1260,ABBV,"A handful of ETFs now have a stake in Alibaba. It's the top holding in IPO as well as KraneShares CSI China Internet (KWEB), with a 12% weighting in each. First Trust U.S. IPO (FPX) allocates 4% to the stock, a top 10 holding.
"
1261,ABBV,"""They're disruptors of some sort,"" Smith said about companies in IPO ETFs. ""They are growing faster than the overall economy.""
"
1262,ABBV,"Investors seem to like that shot at outperforming core, broad-based portfolios with more seasoned stocks. In a year since its launch, IPO has gathered $30 million in assets. FPX seemed to gather dust for its first six years of existence. But since 2013, when Zoetis's (ZTS) debut began a potent string of highflying IPOs, FPX's assets have ballooned roughly 2,000% to $516 million.
"
1263,ABBV,"ETFs are an ideal way to capture the returns of securities that aren't included or are underincluded in core portfolios, experts say.
"
1264,ABBV,"""It's a diversified, less risky approach"" than picking the next hot IPO on a stock-by-stock basis, said Ryan Issakainen, an ETF strategist with First Trust Advisors.
"
1265,ABBV,"High-Profile Names
"
1266,ABBV,"Although more than half of recent U.S. IPOs are in the red after their first two to four years, their average returns tend to beat the broader stock market, he added. ""ETFs allow you to get exposure to that average performance,"" Issakainen said.
"
1267,ABBV,"So far in 2014, FPX has risen 9% on the strength of Abbvie (ABBV), Facebook (FB), HCA Holdings (HCA), Alibaba and Tesla (TSLA), which account for 28% of its portfolio combined. That return lags the SPDR S&P 500's (SPY) 12%. But its three-year average annual 28.39% and five-year average 21.93% beat the S&P 500's average annual 20.25% and 15.7% for those periods.
"
1268,ABBV,"The $32 billion Tesla, a ""terrific performer in the last few years,"" is not even in the large-cap S&P 500, Issakainen noted. But $30 billion Marsh & McLennan (MMC) is.
"
1269,ABBV,"Investors have taken note of FPX's recent track record. An uptick in demand from financial advisers led to the debut of First Trust International IPO (FPXI) in November, Issakainen said. And Renaissance launched its own International IPO (IPOS) in October. FPXI and IPOS have raked in $3 million and $2 million respectively since then.
"
1270,ABBV,"More IPO ETFs wait in the wings: Renaissance has regulatory approval for products tracking the IPO market in the Asia Pacific region, Europe, and consumer and technology sectors. It plans to launch them soon.
"
1271,ABBV,"Stoyan Bojinov, an analyst with ETF Database, advised investors to study the methodologies behind different IPO ETFs. ""Be aware of the nuances,"" he said, noting that FPX keeps holdings for four years, whereas IPO holds them for two years.
"
1272,ABBV,"According to Renaissance, 252 companies have come public so far in 2014, up 24% from last year. The amount IPOs raised from investors rose 61% to $78.5 billion. On average, IPOs gained 13% from their offer price. And so far this year, 341 companies have filed for an IPO.Think sizzling new stock and Alibaba (BABA) pole-vaults to mind.But ETF investors won't find that Chinese e-commerce behemoth in most broad-based products. And so they most likely missed out on Alibaba's 21% gains since its door-busting $25 billion IPO in New York just two months ago.Broad, mainstream indexes tend to be conservative and are slow to include debuting stocks, said Kathleen Smith, principal of Renaissance Capital, an IPO research and investment management firm.IPO ETFs aim to fix that sluggishness. Renaissance IPO (IPO) snaps up the largest and most liquid newly listed U.S. companies in as little as five days of initial trading, or upon quarterly review.A handful of ETFs now have a stake in Alibaba. It's the top holding in IPO as well as KraneShares CSI China Internet (KWEB), with a 12% weighting in each. First Trust U.S. IPO (FPX) allocates 4% to the stock, a top 10 holding.""They're disruptors of some sort,"" Smith said about companies in IPO ETFs. ""They are growing faster than the overall economy.""Investors seem to like that shot at outperforming core, broad-based portfolios with more seasoned stocks. In a year since its launch, IPO has gathered $30 million in assets. FPX seemed to gather dust for its first six years of existence. But since 2013, when Zoetis's (ZTS) debut began a potent string of highflying IPOs, FPX's assets have ballooned roughly 2,000% to $516 million.ETFs are an ideal way to capture the returns of securities that aren't included or are underincluded in core portfolios, experts say.""It's a diversified, less risky approach"" than picking the next hot IPO on a stock-by-stock basis, said Ryan Issakainen, an ETF strategist with First Trust Advisors.High-Profile NamesAlthough more than half of recent U.S. IPOs are in the red after their first two to four years, their average returns tend to beat the broader stock market, he added. ""ETFs allow you to get exposure to that average performance,"" Issakainen said.So far in 2014, FPX has risen 9% on the strength of Abbvie (ABBV), Facebook (FB), HCA Holdings (HCA), Alibaba and Tesla (TSLA), which account for 28% of its portfolio combined. That return lags the SPDR S&P 500's (SPY) 12%. But its three-year average annual 28.39% and five-year average 21.93% beat the S&P 500's average annual 20.25% and 15.7% for those periods.The $32 billion Tesla, a ""terrific performer in the last few years,"" is not even in the large-cap S&P 500, Issakainen noted. But $30 billion Marsh & McLennan (MMC) is.Investors have taken note of FPX's recent track record. An uptick in demand from financial advisers led to the debut of First Trust International IPO (FPXI) in November, Issakainen said. And Renaissance launched its own International IPO (IPOS) in October. FPXI and IPOS have raked in $3 million and $2 million respectively since then.More IPO ETFs wait in the wings: Renaissance has regulatory approval for products tracking the IPO market in the Asia Pacific region, Europe, and consumer and technology sectors. It plans to launch them soon.Stoyan Bojinov, an analyst with ETF Database, advised investors to study the methodologies behind different IPO ETFs. ""Be aware of the nuances,"" he said, noting that FPX keeps holdings for four years, whereas IPO holds them for two years.According to Renaissance, 252 companies have come public so far in 2014, up 24% from last year. The amount IPOs raised from investors rose 61% to $78.5 billion. On average, IPOs gained 13% from their offer price. And so far this year, 341 companies have filed for an IPO.

1280,ABBV,"Massive EPS gains one year might mean that a company tops out the next. While the five IBD 50 stocks in today's screen are set to show 2014 EPS growth that leaves 2013 in the dust, the years beyond might not be as bountiful.Shares of Gilead Sciences (GILD) have launched upward since its hepatitis C drug Sovaldi debuted last year. The company's full-year 2014 EPS is expected to grow 290% year over year to $7.95, partly on Sovaldi and Harvoni — which combines Sovaldi with a non-interferon treatment. Harvoni won FDA approval in October.However, the drugs have faced headwinds this year despite their effectiveness. Concerns from government and patient-advocacy groups over the drugs' steep costs in the U.S. have persisted. Many have argued that the drug is far too costly for low-income hepatitis C patients.What's more, Express Scripts (ESRX), citing concerns about the costs of hep C drugs, said Monday that it would dump Sovaldi and Harvoni from its preferred formulary list in favor of AbbVie's (ABBV) Viekira Pak for the treatment of genotype 1 hepatitis C. Gilead's stock plunged 14% that day and fell 13% for the entire week.Gilead shares have risen 24% since the beginning of the year. But they have struggled to find support at their 50-day line since October, and their relative strength measures have fallen as well. And while massive EPS growth is expected for 2014, analysts project that growth to shrivel into the low-double and single digits over the four years to follow.The stock closed up 2.8% at 93.83 in the stock market today.Generic drug-maker Akorn (AKRX) maintains top-shelf IBD Composite and Relative Strength ratings, and the company is poised to see EPS gains of 105% from a year ago.However, a price hike for its drug clobetasol, a topical rash treatment, weighed on its Q3 results, reported in November. And as with Gilead, analysts forecast Akorn's earnings growth to slow dramatically over the next few years.Shares dropped 9% on its Q3 earnings results, continuing a consolidation that the stock began in October and has remained in since.Facebook's (FB) full-year EPS is expected to grow 90% to around $1.69 a share, driven by Facebook and its still-cool-with-teens Instagram photo-sharing app. The social-media site has snapped up a variety of companies this year in an attempt to anticipate shifts in the online social landscape, and many forecast the company to gain big on online and mobile advertising.As part of their effort to strengthen its position in online advertising, Facebook recently announced a deal to show NFL video clips and Verizon (VZ) ads on its site.Facebook has warned that costs will rise as it steps up spending. Analysts currently expect Facebook's full-year EPS growth to dip to 13% in 2015 but then reaccelerate for the two years after. Shares hit an all-time intraday high of 82.17 on Dec. 23 after clearing a cup base a day earlier. Shares closed up one cent on Friday at 80.78.BitAuto (BITA), the auto-information and advertising website based in China, has benefited from being in the world's largest auto market and China's expanding car culture.Analysts expect the company to grow EPS by 74% this year. In November, the company beat Q3 views on the strength of its ads and gains in the ever-crucial mobile space.Despite near-best IBD fundamentals, the stock has dipped below its 50-day line this month, cooling from a 16% rise after the company reported Q3 results. Still, shares closed up 1.4% on Friday at 73.58 — more than double their value at the beginning of the year.Analysts expect the company's EPS growth to decelerate through 2016 but remain solidly in the double digits.Finally, Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) is forecast for full-year EPS growth of 69% from 2013 on the strength of its only marketed drug, Soliris, which treats two rare blood diseases.The company has years of double-digit quarterly sales and EPS growth under its belt. Shares cleared an 8-month consolidation in October and jumped 7% after a strong Q3 report. But the stock has since seen more sellers enter the picture, bringing its Accumulation/Distribution rating down to a D- .Analysts expect only 14% EPS growth in 2015 but stronger growth after that.The stock has rattled around its 50-day line over the past two weeks.

"
1282,ABBV,"While the approval of AbbVie's (ABBV) hepatitis C regimen Viekira Pak hogged most of the headlines, over the past week the FDA has approved a whole passel of medicines that could be blockbusters for their makers.
"
1283,ABBV,"Here's a short list of some of the most significant:
"
1284,ABBV,"Bristol-Myers (BMY) won approval for Opdivo for melanoma on Monday, which was something of a surprise since the FDA's deadline was in March. Opdivo is a PD-1 inhibitor, a hot new class of cancer drugs that short-circuit cancer cells' ability to fight off the immune system, which are widely expected to eventually make billions of dollars treating multiple cancers.
"
1285,ABBV,"The sped-up Opdivo approval might dilute the first-mover advantage of Merck's (MRK) Keytruda, which was approved for melanoma in September. Opdivo is also under review for squamous-cell lung cancer, which could definitely boost sales: current consensus forecasts 2019 sales of $4.5 billion for Opdivo, vs. just $2.4 billion for Keytruda.
"
1286,ABBV,"Speaking of Merck, on Dec. 19 its buyout target Cubist Pharmaceuticals (CBST) won approval for Zerbaxa, an antibiotic treating drug-resistant intra-abdominal and urinary-tract infections. Zerbaxa is a key component to Cubist's strategy in surviving the patent expiration of its flagship drug Cubicin. That approval became a lot more urgent this month when Cubist lost a patent case that could bring generic competitors to Cubicin as early as 2016. Cubist has a couple more drugs nearing an FDA filing, but Zerbaxa could be the biggest; RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt estimates peak sales could hit $1.5 billion.
"
1287,ABBV,"Also on Dec. 19, AstraZeneca (AZN) won approval for Lynparza, a treatment for ovarian cancer the company believes can achieve peak annual sales of $2 billion. Following a notable trend for cancer treatments, it was approved along with a companion diagnostic test from Myriad Genetics (MYGN) called BRACAnalysis CDx, designed to identify women whose BRCA gene mutation indicates they're most likely to benefit from the drug.
"
1288,ABBV,"Lynparza's approval was far from a sure thing, since in June the FDA's advisory panel voted 11-2 against granting the accelerated approval AstraZeneca had requested based on phase-two data. Although the firm still hasn't finished its phase-three study, it did bring more data that the FDA apparently found convincing.
"
1289,ABBV,"On Tuesday, Novo Nordisk's (NVO) obesity drug Saxenda won the FDA's nod. Saxenda is the brand name of liraglutide, which Novo sells in a lower dose as the blockbuster diabetes drug Victoza.
"
1290,ABBV,"Morgan Stanley recently estimated that its annual sales could hit $1 billion in 2020, a bullish assessment given the underwhelming launches ofVivus' (VVUS) Qsymia in late 2013 and Arena Pharmaceuticals' (ARNA) Belviq earlier this year. (It's still too early to make a call on Orexigen's (OREX) Contrave, which was approved in September.)

1354,ABBV,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) stock was rebounding in afternoon trading on the stock market today, as an analyst lifted his Q3 forecast for sales of blockbuster hepatitis C drug Sovaldi.FBR analyst Andrew Berens raised his estimate to $2.24 billion from $1.94 billion after examining August prescription data from health industry research firm Symphony Health Solutions. After a record-breaking launch following U.S. approval last December, Sovaldi's sales have slowed down over the summer. This has been generally interpreted as doctors ""warehousing"" patients ahead of the launch of another Gilead hep C drug, expected in October, as well as possible price competition from AbbVie's (ABBV) therapy, expected to launch in December. Berens, however, says he found less warehousing than he expected.""An analysis of the first two months of 3Q14 and a projection for the remaining month show U.S. Sovaldi prescriptions tracking above our previous estimates, suggesting that the formation of a second warehouse ahead of anticipated launches of all-oral therapies in 4Q14 may be slower than anticipated,"" he wrote in his research note Tuesday.The report helped arrest the decline of Gilead stock, which fell 2.6% Monday on news that it's allowing generic Sovaldi in poor countries. Gilead stock opened 1% lower Tuesday, but by mid-afternoon it was up 3.2% to 104.25. Gilead stock touched an all-time high of 110.64 on Sept. 3.

""People are really, really scared for anything that causes volatility.""But ""there's a lot of discounting going on already,"" he said, and Sovaldi likely has a 20%-plus discount already applied to its retail value of $84,000 per 12-week course for those in prisons and governmental health programs.Gilead intends to retail Sovaldi in less affluent countries for only $900 for the same course, reported Bloomberg.""(Investors) are worried that the U.S. government is going to say, 'Why are you going to give it away in India while we're paying $65,000 per patient?' "" said Berens. ""It makes it more of a foil . . . for what they're charging in the U.S.""The recent media attention regarding Sovaldi may be causing shares to dip, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee in a note, but making pharmaceuticals available to lower income countries at a discount is ""nothing new.""""(This) is something they already do with HIV pills and (is) already expected,"" said Yee.What will be worth looking at, said FBR's Berens, is AbbVie's (ABBV) anticipated hepatitis C treatment, as investors will be keeping an eye on the drug's pricing.""This is going to become a very interesting market once AbbVie launches their drug,"" he said.Follow Elaine Low on Twitter at IBD_Elow.

"
1385,ABBV,"WhiteWave has been trading near a 37.25 buy point of a double-bottom base it initially cleared late last month. A downward reversal Nov. 10 sent shares as much as 6% below the buy point, but it closed above its 10-week moving average. It's found support at the line and is 2% below the entry.

1391,ABBV,"The stock, which made its Nasdaq debut on March 21, 2013, has rallied 214% from its offering price of $14. It triggered the eight-week hold rule in December and is up 66% from the 26.49 buy point prior to the run-up.

1444,ABBV,"The Treasury Department's new rules cracking down on tax inversions — U.S. companies' moving their headquarters overseas to take advantage of lower corporate tax rates — had an immediate impact on investors as they traded down businesses so engaged.
"
1445,ABBV,"Medtronic (MDT) shares dropped 3.3% to 63.764 in late-morning trade in the stock market today. The Minneapolis-based medical device maker currently proposes a $42.9 billion inversion deal with the Irish health care products company Covidien (COV). North Chicago, Ill.-based AbbVie (ABBV) saw its stock fall 2.2% to 57.50 as its proposed $54 billion acquisition of Ireland-based biopharmaceutical firm Shire was caught in the rules' crosshairs.
"
1446,ABBV,"Late Monday, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew announced the rule changes, effective immediately, making it more difficult for businesses that invert to use their cash generated overseas. The Treasury made the changes after a wave of inversion deals threatened to reduce U.S. tax revenue significantly. Although the deals have prompted criticism, they are legal.
"
1447,ABBV,"Critics have argued that despite various tax exemptions businesses can use, the U.S. corporate tax rate — 35% at the federal level and pushed up to an average of 40% factoring in state taxes — is the highest in the industrialized world and motivates companies to look for deals overseas. Moves for comprehensive tax reform have stalled on Capitol Hill.
"
1448,ABBV,"Other proposed deals potentially affected by the Treasury Department's actions include Burger King Worldwide (BKW), which has negotiated an inversion deal with Canadian coffee and donuts chain Tim Hortons (THI). Both companies saw their shares fall in morning trading, Burger King down 1% and Tim Hortons off 0.3%. Chiquita Brands International (CQB) stock dropped in morning trading but later rose 0.3%. The rule changes affect Chiquita's $1 billion proposed merger with Ireland-based fruit firm Fyffes.

Moves for comprehensive tax reform have stalled on Capitol Hill.Other proposed deals potentially affected by the Treasury Department's actions include Burger King Worldwide (BKW), which has negotiated an inversion deal with Canadian coffee and donuts chain Tim Hortons (THI). Both companies saw their shares fall in morning trading, Burger King down 1% and Tim Hortons off 0.3%. Chiquita Brands International (CQB) stock dropped in morning trading but later rose 0.3%. The rule changes affect Chiquita's $1 billion proposed merger with Ireland-based fruit firm Fyffes.Treasury's move prompted differing partisan reactions.Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said Lew's move ""reinforces the urgency for action before this growing wave of inversions erodes our nation's tax base.""House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, R-Mich., said, ""A few campaign-style speeches and stopgap measures from Treasury won't do it — it hasn't worked in the past, and even Secretary Lew admits the only real solution is tax reform. I fear this administration is only interested in doing the bare minimum — just enough to say they care.""Both men urged Congress to take action. Neither called for the new rules to be abolished.

1475,ABBV,"December is usually a quiet month for medical tech news, but this year will bring a few potentially stock-moving events worth keeping an eye on.As you digest your Thanksgiving turkey, here are the top five in chronological order:By Dec. 5, biotech Incyte (INCY) is looking to get an important expansion of the label on its sole marketed drug, Jakafi. As explained in the recent Incyte profile in The New America, Incyte and its partner Novartis (NVS) have been pulling in respectable income on Jakafi as a treatment for a rare bone-marrow cancer called myelofibrosis. The FDA is pondering whether to add an indication for polycythemia vera, a milder but more common condition. While uptake for that condition is expected to be fairly slow, it's expected to help push Incyte into more consistently profitable territory next year.Two days later, hot medical-device company Edwards Lifesciences (EW) will hold its annual investor day, in which it is expected to give 2015 guidance for the first time. The company impressed the Street last month with its strong Q3 report and Q4 guidance, on the strong launch of its latest Sapien artificial heart valve. Currently, analysts are forecasting 2015 sales of $2.47 billion, up 7% from this year's estimate. Earnings per share are expected to rise 17% to $3.95.Then, sometime before Dec. 21 (which likely means Dec. 19), the FDA is due to issue its verdict on AbbVie's (ABBV) hepatitis C combo of Viekirax and Exviera. The clinical-trial data was so good, the Street would probably be less surprised if a meteor hit Manhattan than if the FDA rejects the drug, but what has analysts all on pins and needles is what the price will be. A price significantly lower than Gilead Sciences ' (GILD) recently launched Harvoni, which costs $94,000 for a 12-week treatment, would help AbbVie gain market share and certainly please pharmacy benefit managers like Express Scripts (ESRX), which has been hoping to start a price war to drive down the suddenly high cost of hepatitis C treatment. However, most analysts are expecting AbbVie to price only a little bit lower. Also affected by all this will be Enanta Pharmaceuticals (ENTA), which licensed a component of Viekirax to AbbVie.Speaking of hepatitis C, sometime before the end of the year the Street is expecting to hear phase one clinical-trial data on Achillion Pharmaceuticals' (ACHN) ACH-3422. The drug belongs to the coveted nucleoside inhibitor class, to which Gilead's mega-blockbuster Sovaldi (also a component in Harvoni) belongs, but which has otherwise shown enough safety issues that there are few left in development. Especially since Merck (MRK) acquired Idenix Pharmaceuticals for its ""nuc,"" speculation that Achillion could be the next target has driven up its stock price, but the Street has seen little real data about the safety and effectiveness of ACH-3422. The data would help analysts determine just how much the company is worth.Speculation exists about whether two aborted takeover attempts earlier this year will be re-upped. The Street seems to have mostly given up on the possibility that Pfizer (PFE) will make another bid for AstraZeneca (AZN) after the six-month cooling-off period mandated under U.K. takeover rules expired on Wednesday. Astra's CEO Pascal Soriot threw more cold water while appearing on CNBC Thursday, saying the deal would have fallen apart even if it had been made because of proposed restrictions on tax-inversion deals in the U.S. However, RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro is still holding out hope for a union of orthopedics firms Stryker (SYK) and Smith & Nephew (SNN). Stryker didn't bid for the company, but since a news report leaked that it was working on one, it got slapped with the U.K.'s six-month cooling-off period anyway, which expired Nov. 28.""We believe a SYK/SNN deal could provide more recon (reconstructive surgery) scale, particularly in international markets, expand SYK's presence in trauma/sports medicine, and bring cost synergies,"" Novarro wrote in a note Friday.

1497,ABBV,"Lowering U.S. corporate tax rates to the global norm — further, if politically feasible — would no doubt benefit our companies and investors. Moving the U.S. into the global mainstream on corporate taxes might even hold out a carrot for the political class — more corporate tax revenues.
"
1498,ABBV,"High U.S. corporate tax rates make no sense in an increasingly global economy. High rates don't raise the revenue they once did — an estimated 11.1% of all receipts in this fiscal year, down from 19.6% in 1969. Even worse, high rates encourage tax-driven tactics and strategies that weaken the U.S. economy.
"
1499,ABBV,"We've seen companies move jobs and operations to countries with lower tax rates. We've seen American companies stash nearly $2 trillion in profits overseas to avoid the U.S. tax bite.
"
1500,ABBV,"We've seen companies such as Burger King Worldwide (BKW), Chiquita Brands International (CQB), Medtronic (MDT), AbbVie (ABBV) and Mylan (MYL) announce corporate ""inversions"" — mergers and acquisitions that transfer headquarters overseas.

"
1503,ABBV,"Other countries that cut corporate rates weren't merely kowtowing to corporate power. Their politicians understood that lower taxes would help keep companies at home and bolster their nations' economies, paying off in faster growth, higher employment and added tax revenues.
"
1504,ABBV,"Applying Laffer's Curve
"
1505,ABBV,"The United States doesn't necessarily have to choose between larger budget deficits and fixing an onerous corporate tax system that's out of step with the rest of the world.
"
1506,ABBV,"In the 1970s, economist Arthur Laffer famously put forward the proposition that tax rates can be so high they choke off economic activity and actually reduce revenue. If so, lowering rates will raise tax receipts. This could very well be the case for U.S. corporate taxes.
"
1507,ABBV,"In 2007, American Enterprise Institute economists Kevin Hassett and Alex Brill determined the tax-revenue-maximizing top U.S. corporate rate went from 34% in the late 1980s to 26.7% in 2005.
"
1508,ABBV,"Reasons for the decline: increasing international mobility of capital and other countries' cuts in corporate tax rates.
"
1509,ABBV,"Other countries have kept on cutting their corporate tax rates since 2005, so the revenue-maximizing rate has probably come down a few percentage points since then. But we'll stick with Hassett and Brill's 26.7% and see where it takes us.
"
1510,ABBV,"For the U.S., going down to the revenue-maximizing rate would add about a third to corporate tax receipts. Why? Lower taxes reduce the incentives for moving abroad and stashing profits overseas.
"
1511,ABBV,"More important, it would encourage both American and foreign companies to expand and invest in the United States, raising overall economic growth, corporate earnings and tax receipts.
"
1512,ABBV,"Sound too good to be true? The Tax Foundation's William McBride took a look at Canada. From 1988-2000, with the top rate at 43%, corporate tax revenues averaged 2.9% of GDP.
"
1513,ABBV,"Since 2000, as the country reduced rates to 26%, corporate tax revenues rose to 3.3% of GDP. By comparison, the high U.S. corporate tax rates have yielded average revenues of just 2.3% of GDP.
"
1514,ABBV,"Cutting U.S. corporate tax rates would raise both before- and after-tax earnings — good news for companies and their shareholders.
"
1515,ABBV,"The before-tax kick comes from greater incentives to do business in the U.S., so we'd see more companies stay home, more transplants from overseas, more new businesses, more investment from both domestic and foreign sources, and more economic growth — all leading to higher corporate revenues and profits.
"
1516,ABBV,"After-tax gains are more direct: For every $100 in profits, firms would now keep $73 rather than $61. Stock price gains will depend on several factors — including how much actual tax relief U.S. companies get and whether other countries respond with more tax cuts. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest the market gains could be substantial in going from today's high rates to 26.7% or even lower.
"
1517,ABBV,"With corporate tax rates closer to the worldwide norm, the U.S. will find it easier to change another flaw in its corporate tax system. We are one of a handful of countries that tax worldwide revenues, forcing American companies to pay high U.S. rates on their overseas earnings. Most other countries use a territorial approach, taxing only the profits earned within their country.
"
1518,ABBV,"England switched to a territorial system in 2009, so British companies that make profits in Ireland pay the country's 12.5% — and that's all. A U.S. multinational pays 12.5% in Ireland, but it still owes U.S. taxes on its Irish earnings — the difference between Ireland's low rate and the much higher U.S. rate.
"
1519,ABBV,"For years now, both Democrats and Republicans have called for cutting U.S. corporate tax rates, but nothing's been done — another sign of the paralysis gripping our nation's capital.
"
1520,ABBV,"The hubbub over Burger King's proposed move to Canada wasn't encouraging. Members of Congress and the administration seemed more interested in chastising the corporate escapees than in lowering the tax penalty they've imposed on doing business here.

We've seen American companies stash nearly $2 trillion in profits overseas to avoid the U.S. tax bite.We've seen companies such as Burger King Worldwide (BKW), Chiquita Brands International (CQB), Medtronic (MDT), AbbVie (ABBV) and Mylan (MYL) announce corporate ""inversions"" — mergers and acquisitions that transfer headquarters overseas. That's just the year's first eight months; more are likely to follow.The political class harrumphs and howls at this perfectly legal tax avoidance, branding companies as unpatriotic.Their catcalls divert attention to the politicians themselves, who already have in their hands a fiscally sound and economically sensible way to keep companies in America — lower the country's punishing corporate tax rates.Other countries that cut corporate rates weren't merely kowtowing to corporate power. Their politicians understood that lower taxes would help keep companies at home and bolster their nations' economies, paying off in faster growth, higher employment and added tax revenues.Applying Laffer's CurveThe United States doesn't necessarily have to choose between larger budget deficits and fixing an onerous corporate tax system that's out of step with the rest of the world.In the 1970s, economist Arthur Laffer famously put forward the proposition that tax rates can be so high they choke off economic activity and actually reduce revenue. If so, lowering rates will raise tax receipts. This could very well be the case for U.S. corporate taxes.In 2007, American Enterprise Institute economists Kevin Hassett and Alex Brill determined the tax-revenue-maximizing top U.S. corporate rate went from 34% in the late 1980s to 26.7% in 2005.Reasons for the decline: increasing international mobility of capital and other countries' cuts in corporate tax rates.Other countries have kept on cutting their corporate tax rates since 2005, so the revenue-maximizing rate has probably come down a few percentage points since then. But we'll stick with Hassett and Brill's 26.7% and see where it takes us.For the U.S., going down to the revenue-maximizing rate would add about a third to corporate tax receipts. Why? Lower taxes reduce the incentives for moving abroad and stashing profits overseas.More important, it would encourage both American and foreign companies to expand and invest in the United States, raising overall economic growth, corporate earnings and tax receipts.Sound too good to be true? The Tax Foundation's William McBride took a look at Canada. From 1988-2000, with the top rate at 43%, corporate tax revenues averaged 2.9% of GDP.Since 2000, as the country reduced rates to 26%, corporate tax revenues rose to 3.3% of GDP. By comparison, the high U.S. corporate tax rates have yielded average revenues of just 2.3% of GDP.Cutting U.S. corporate tax rates would raise both before- and after-tax earnings — good news for companies and their shareholders.The before-tax kick comes from greater incentives to do business in the U.S., so we'd see more companies stay home, more transplants from overseas, more new businesses, more investment from both domestic and foreign sources, and more economic growth — all leading to higher corporate revenues and profits.After-tax gains are more direct: For every $100 in profits, firms would now keep $73 rather than $61. Stock price gains will depend on several factors — including how much actual tax relief U.S. companies get and whether other countries respond with more tax cuts. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest the market gains could be substantial in going from today's high rates to 26.7% or even lower.With corporate tax rates closer to the worldwide norm, the U.S. will find it easier to change another flaw in its corporate tax system. We are one of a handful of countries that tax worldwide revenues, forcing American companies to pay high U.S. rates on their overseas earnings. Most other countries use a territorial approach, taxing only the profits earned within their country.England switched to a territorial system in 2009, so British companies that make profits in Ireland pay the country's 12.5% — and that's all. A U.S. multinational pays 12.5% in Ireland, but it still owes U.S. taxes on its Irish earnings — the difference between Ireland's low rate and the much higher U.S. rate.For years now, both Democrats and Republicans have called for cutting U.S. corporate tax rates, but nothing's been done — another sign of the paralysis gripping our nation's capital.The hubbub over Burger King's proposed move to Canada wasn't encouraging. Members of Congress and the administration seemed more interested in chastising the corporate escapees than in lowering the tax penalty they've imposed on doing business here. Cox is director of the O'Neil Center for Global Markets and Freedom at the SMU Cox School of Business and former chief economist of the Dallas Federal Reserve. Alm is writer in residence at the Center.

1572,ABBV,"The second half of August is usually a desert for business news, but the FDA schedule is year-round. Several important drugs are up for approval decisions this month, which could provide some upside for three biotech stocks that have recently been suffering.
"
1573,ABBV,"Getting the most attention will likely be Repatha, Amgen's (AMGN) cholesterol drug. It's expected to be approved by Aug. 27. Repatha is a PCSK9 inhibitor similar to Praluent, the drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) that was approved with much fanfare last month.
"
1574,ABBV,"Given the resemblance between the two drugs, Repatha is widely expected to be approved. In a July 30 research note, Nomura analyst Ian Somaiya wrote that Amgen's drug will probably also get a similar label, which doesn't cover quite as many patients as some had hoped but ""should be sufficiently broad to support our $2.5 billion peak sales estimate.""
"
1575,ABBV,"What will be especially interesting to investors will be the pricing dynamics that come with two drugs appearing on the market. Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) has said it hopes to start a price war between the two, similar to what happened when AbbVie (ABBV) launched a rival hepatitis C regimen to Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Harvoni late last year. Gilead has maintained dominant market share, but only by rebating near half the drug's list price.
"
1576,ABBV,"""We believe rebating may drive access, as Sanofi/Regeneron and Amgen will be directly competing for formulary position,"" Somaiya wrote. ""While our $750 Repatha net price per month estimate implies a 33% discount to Praluent's gross price of $1,120, we believe competition could result in above average discounting similar to what has been seen in hepatitis C.""
"
1577,ABBV,"Amgen stock hit a new high of 181.81 after its Q2 report, but has since shed about 7% in the larger biotech selloff. It retains an excellent IBD Composite Rating of 95.
"
1578,ABBV,"By Aug. 18, the FDA is due to decide on a label expansion for Adcetris, the sole marketed drug from Seattle Genetics (SGEN). Adcetris, marketed by partner Takeda, is already approved for patients with Hodgkins lymphoma who've relapsed after receiving a stem-cell transplant or after two chemotherapy treatments. The current filing followed a study of patients who'd received a transplant but hadn't relapsed, and found a significant improvement in progression-free survival.
"
1579,ABBV,"In a July 16 research note, RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt wrote that the chances of approval looked good since the FDA didn't convene an advisory committee before the approval date, which it normally does when it has issues with a drug.
"
1580,ABBV,"""The market opportunity in the post-transplant Hodgkins lymphoma setting could take Adcetris from $200 million to $250 million (a year) to $250 million to $350 million or higher in sales potentially,"" Butt wrote.
"
1581,ABBV,"Getting new indications for Adcetris is a key part of Seattle Genetics' strategy, because even though the drug launched four years ago it still hasn't made the company profitable. Adcetris is also being tested in T cell lymphoma and in the front-line setting in both kinds of lymphoma. In January, the company also announced a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) to test Bristol's hot new cancer drug Opdivo along with Adcetris in various kinds of lymphomas.
"
1582,ABBV,"Seattle Genetics stock is down about 14% from its July 20 high of 52.33, but retains a good Relative Strength Rating of 89. Analysts expect it to turn profitable in 2018.
"

"
1588,ABBV,"Connect with Amy Reeves: @IBD_Areeves and Facebook.The second half of August is usually a desert for business news, but the FDA schedule is year-round. Several important drugs are up for approval decisions this month, which could provide some upside for three biotech stocks that have recently been suffering.Getting the most attention will likely be Repatha, Amgen's (AMGN) cholesterol drug. It's expected to be approved by Aug. 27. Repatha is a PCSK9 inhibitor similar to Praluent, the drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) that was approved with much fanfare last month.Given the resemblance between the two drugs, Repatha is widely expected to be approved. In a July 30 research note, Nomura analyst Ian Somaiya wrote that Amgen's drug will probably also get a similar label, which doesn't cover quite as many patients as some had hoped but ""should be sufficiently broad to support our $2.5 billion peak sales estimate.""What will be especially interesting to investors will be the pricing dynamics that come with two drugs appearing on the market. Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) has said it hopes to start a price war between the two, similar to what happened when AbbVie (ABBV) launched a rival hepatitis C regimen to Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Harvoni late last year. Gilead has maintained dominant market share, but only by rebating near half the drug's list price.""We believe rebating may drive access, as Sanofi/Regeneron and Amgen will be directly competing for formulary position,"" Somaiya wrote. ""While our $750 Repatha net price per month estimate implies a 33% discount to Praluent's gross price of $1,120, we believe competition could result in above average discounting similar to what has been seen in hepatitis C.""Amgen stock hit a new high of 181.81 after its Q2 report, but has since shed about 7% in the larger biotech selloff. It retains an excellent IBD Composite Rating of 95.By Aug. 18, the FDA is due to decide on a label expansion for Adcetris, the sole marketed drug from Seattle Genetics (SGEN). Adcetris, marketed by partner Takeda, is already approved for patients with Hodgkins lymphoma who've relapsed after receiving a stem-cell transplant or after two chemotherapy treatments. The current filing followed a study of patients who'd received a transplant but hadn't relapsed, and found a significant improvement in progression-free survival.In a July 16 research note, RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt wrote that the chances of approval looked good since the FDA didn't convene an advisory committee before the approval date, which it normally does when it has issues with a drug.""The market opportunity in the post-transplant Hodgkins lymphoma setting could take Adcetris from $200 million to $250 million (a year) to $250 million to $350 million or higher in sales potentially,"" Butt wrote.Getting new indications for Adcetris is a key part of Seattle Genetics' strategy, because even though the drug launched four years ago it still hasn't made the company profitable. Adcetris is also being tested in T cell lymphoma and in the front-line setting in both kinds of lymphoma. In January, the company also announced a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) to test Bristol's hot new cancer drug Opdivo along with Adcetris in various kinds of lymphomas.Seattle Genetics stock is down about 14% from its July 20 high of 52.33, but retains a good Relative Strength Rating of 89. Analysts expect it to turn profitable in 2018.The FDA has an Aug. 22 deadline for deciding on Aristada, a schizophrenia drug from Alkermes (ALKS).

1638,ABBV,"Analysts were singing the praises of life-science giants Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Illumina (ILMN) Wednesday morning after both surged above Q1 estimates late Tuesday. Shares of both companies were up on the stock market today.
"
1639,ABBV,"Gilead's $2.3 billion in sales for its new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi was called ""one of the most impressive beats in biopharma history"" by Piper Jaffray's Joshua Schimmer, although he increased his price target by only a dollar to 105. Gilead was up 3% in morning trading Wednesday, near 75.
"
1640,ABBV,"RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee lifted his 2014 sales estimate to $9.5 billion from his previous $7.4 billion, and added $1.05 to his full-year EPS estimate, now $6.15. He expects Sovaldi sales to hit $11.5 billion next year, with EPS reaching $7.
"
1641,ABBV,"Nomura's Ian Somaiya lifted his price target to 130 from 121. He wrote that Gilead's position in the HCV market is sustainable, and he says Sovaldi and the new Sovaldi-based combo pill expected to launch later this year are superior to competing products from AbbVie (ABBV) and Merck (MRK).
"
1642,ABBV,"Cowen's Phil Nadeau was also impressed, but noted that lengthy discussion of ""payor pushback"" on Tuesday's earnings call provided ""probably not nearly enough resolution to satisfy investors."" Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) and insurer United Health (UNH) have both criticized Sovaldi's $84,000 price.
"
1643,ABBV,"""Gilead did discuss pharmacoeconomic arguments that support the price of Sovaldi, such as the value of a cure to the health care system, and the cost of treating patients with end stage liver disease ($42k/yr),"" Nadeau wrote. ""While we found Gilead's discussion and datapoints encouraging, we suspect that investor concerns over payors' ability to limit access to Sovaldi and shuttle patients to competing regimens will linger until ABBV's pricing strategy is known (presumably after approval) and payor strategies are defined in early 2015.""
"
1644,ABBV,"Meanwhile, gene-testing company Illumina was up 6% Wednesday morning, near 156, after it beat estimates and raised guidance. Sales rose 27% over the year-earlier quarter to $421 million, nearly $30 million above consensus. Earnings climbed 15% to 53 cents a share, topping estimates by 9 cents.
"
1645,ABBV,"The company now expects full-year sales growth of 21% to 23%, with EPS of $2.10 to $2.15. Both ranges are above consensus.
"
1646,ABBV,"Leerink analyst Dan Leonard wrote in a note Tuesday that the report ""exceeded even what we would have considered a best-case scenario in the face of multiple new instrument launches,"" and lifted his price target to 180 from 160. He wrote that the launches of the new HiSeq and MiSeq gene-sequencing systems did not appear to be cannibalizing from older versions. He added that orders for the HiSeq X Ten system, which Illumina announced in January with some fanfare due to its claim that it can sequence genomes for $1,000 apiece, were double the initial target.
"
1647,ABBV,"ISI Group's Ross Muken noted that demand was up across Illumina's entire sequencing portfolio, and raised his price target to 162.50 from 152.50 to reflect increased EPS forecasts. However, he maintained his neutral rating on the stock, saying that the current price already reflects 20% annual revenue growth.

W. Baird's Brian Skorney noted that Merck's (MRK) official tender offer statement Friday indicated that there was another bidder for Idenix Pharmaceuticals (IDIX), which accepted Merck's $3.85 billion bid last week. In Skorney's view, this means that somebody's still on the prowl for a nucleoside hepatitis C drug, which Achillion has.""The company draws many similarities to Idenix from an asset perspective and has the only unpartnered nuc left in development, which makes it an attractive target,"" he wrote in his research note Friday.Skorney also wrote that Achillion's prospects of developing an oral hep C cure all by itself are dimming, since its pipeline has been slowed down by various issues even as Gilead Sciences (GILD) and AbbVie (ABBV) steam ahead with their own regimens. He maintains an outperform rating and set his price target at 12, reflecting a more modest expectation than Maxim's target of 22 set earlier this week.

""The open question, however, has been which company grabs the other 25%-40% of the market. I would propose to you that perhaps MRK is now the leading contender for this position.""
"
1673,ABBV,"Because Merck still has a way to go through clinical trials before it can file for approval, it won't have the first competing regimen. That's expected to be AbbVie's (ABBV) and Enanta's (ENTA) cocktail, also expected to launch late in the year.
"
1674,ABBV,"However, in a research note Thursday, Nomura analyst Ian Somaiya wrote that a symposium with hepatologist Stefan Zeuzam brought up Gilead's higher efficacy than AbbVie's with certain patients, as well as the risk of drug interactions with patients who also have HIV.

Shares traded down 14% for the week and 50% below a June high.On the IBD 50 list, Universal Display (OLED) flashed ahead nearly 5% at the open. The maker of organic light emitting diode chips used in high definition TV and computer screens is trading below a 55.93 buy point in a cup base. It triggered an automatic sell signal by diving more than 8% below that mark.Hawaiian (HA) jumped more than 3% after reporting its total numbers of passengers rose 4.1% and its load factor crept up to 82.9% in the fourth quarter. The stock remains well below its 50-day moving average and is attempting to build the right side of a 22% deep consolidation.Aircraft carrier mechanic Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) sailed ahead nearly 4%. Cowen & Co. upgraded the stock to outperform from market perform. Huntington is trading below a 136.55 buy point in a long cup-with-handle base.

1706,ABBV,"Biotech stocks sold off hard Friday as Wall Street blamed a letter by several House Democrats asking Gilead Sciences to justify the price of its hepatitis C blockbuster Sovaldi.
"
1707,ABBV,"The letter, dated Thursday, was signed by Reps. Henry Waxman, Frank Pallone and Diana DeGete, all ranking members of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. It called Sovaldi a ""breakthrough"" in HCV treatment, but expressed concern that ""a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it.""
"
1708,ABBV,"Due to Sovaldi's $84,000 price tag, the letter went on to say that Colorado's and Pennsylvania's Medicaid programs had already announced that they're funding Sovaldi only for the sickest patients, and California's is still figuring out its reimbursement policies. The letter also noted that pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) is ""encouraging some doctors in its networks to delay prescribing Sovaldi.""
"
1709,ABBV,"Meanwhile, hepatitis C is a disease found disproportionately among the poor. As a result of all this, the lawmakers told Gilead to provide an explanation of their pricing by April 3.
"
1710,ABBV,"Health insurer WellPoint (WLP) chimed in Friday with concerns about new hepatitis C drug costs, said executive Ken Goulet.
"
1711,ABBV,"Biotech Stocks Cheaper
"
1712,ABBV,"Gilead's (GILD) fell nearly 5% to 72.07, a 3-month closing low, but some biotechs selling expensive drugs fell even harder, perhaps on fears of a larger change in the national mood on drug pricing.
"
1713,ABBV,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), whose sole drug, Soliris, goes for upward of $400,000 a year, tumbled 8%. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), which also sells an expensive hepatitis C drug called Incivek, retreated 5%.
"
1714,ABBV,"Biogen Idec (BIIB), which has a costly multiple sclerosis treatment, Tecfidera, lost 8%.
"
1715,ABBV,"IBD's top-rated Medical-Biomed/Biotech group fell 4.5%.
"
1716,ABBV,"AbbVie (ABBV), which will likely come out with a rival and possibly cheaper rival to Sovaldi later this year, initially rallied Friday, but closed down a fraction.
"
1717,ABBV,"""It's like Gilead caught a cold and the rest of the market caught pneumonia,"" said Tom Vandeventer, portfolio manager of Tocqueville Opportunity Fund .
"
1718,ABBV,"Sovaldi A Bargain?
"
1719,ABBV,"Analysts, for the most part, advised staying calm. Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets wrote in an email to clients Friday that ""pricing discussions could generate headline 'concern,' but in our view, this underscores that the drug is going to be huge and they're curing patients and improving society. ... HCV is an important public health issue (like HIV was) and validates the significance of this market.""
"
1720,ABBV,"Deutsche Bank analyst Robyn Karnauskas wrote in a client note that she'd spoken to Gilead officials and they were already making their case that Sovaldi is actually a bargain.
"
1721,ABBV,"""A liver transplant related to HCV costs up to $250,000 and another $50,000 each year for meds so that the person does not reject the liver,"" she wrote. ""Gilead has co-pay programs in place (in which) the out-of-pocket cost is as low as $5.""
"
1722,ABBV,"ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum pointed out that Sovaldi compares favorably to older hepatitis C drugs, especially Vertex's Incivek, which goes for $100,000 a year. Sovaldi's cure rate is also much higher than Incivek's, so the cost ""per cure"" is even better, he said in a webinar Friday.
"
1723,ABBV,"Dems Seek 'Public Shaming'
"
1724,ABBV,"Schoenebaum also queried Terry Haines, a longtime Washington lawyer and lobbyist who once served as the senior Republican counsel to the same congres sional committee that sent the letter. Haines responded that the government actually has little power to address drug prices. In his view, what Waxman et al. hope to accomplish is a ""public shaming"" not unlike the one Waxman delivered to the tobacco industry some years ago.
"
1725,ABBV,"""This letter is a 'bank shot' that gets things going, with the goal of getting Gilead to significantly lower the price of Sovaldi,"" Haines wrote.
"
1726,ABBV,"Such a move could be politically popular, he added. Discontent about the high price of Sovaldi and of new drugs in general has been swelling from payers and the general public for some time now. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a large nonprofit with a history of criticizing Gilead over its HIV drug pricing, recently turned its fire on Sovaldi.
"
1727,ABBV,"""Gilead's latest display of out-of-touch greed comes on the heels of the company's January pricing its new hepatitis C treatment, Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), at $1,000 per pill ... 1,100% more than Gilead's most expensive AIDS drug, Stribild,"" the AHF said in a Feb. 4 press release.
"
1728,ABBV,"All this has played out as biotech stocks have hit a lull the last few weeks, after a bull run not seen since the 1990s, leading some to fear that the party may be over. Vandeventer says that while biotechs are a ""high beta group,"" this is probably just a correction. After all, he points out, drug prices have been a political football since the early 1990s.

"
1730,ABBV,"Though still in the early days since its Dec. 6 approval, Gilead Sciences' hepatitis C drug Sovaldi may be enjoying one of the most massive drug launches of all time. Current consensus calls for sales of $4.6 billion this year — and the whisper numbers are running even higher.
"
1731,ABBV,"This doesn't surprise Wall Street, as Sovaldi provides a faster, safer and stronger alternative to a punishing yearlong regimen of interferon. But as analysts obsessively watch the weekly prescription numbers grow, they're also eyeing data from Sovaldi's potential challengers in a market that's estimated at $20 billion a year and growing.
"
1732,ABBV,"Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) daclatasvir grabbed headlines last April when a phase two trial combining it with Sovaldi scored a 100% cure rate.
"
1733,ABBV,"But Gilead (GILD) elected not to pursue the combo further. Instead, it's studying Sovaldi in combination with its similar drug ledipasvir, so that it can co-formulate the two into a single pill and not share the market.
"
1734,ABBV,"Bristol, however, filed in the European Union for approval of daclatasvir ""for use in combination with other agents, including sofosbuvir"" (the generic name for Sovaldi), and was granted accelerated review there in early January. The firm plans to submit a similar filing to the Food and Drug Administration soon.
"
1735,ABBV,"Sovaldi Sets New Standard
"
1736,ABBV,"In October, Bristol filed to approve a combo of daclatasvir with another of its drugs, asunaprevir, in Japan, which has an unusually high rate of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection due to a formerly tainted blood supply.
"
1737,ABBV,"Douglas Manion, Bristol's vice president of development, virology and Japan, says that the dual regimen scored good results, but its 24-week duration is looking like yesterday's news now that Sovaldi has set a 12-week standard. He hopes that will be resolved by a triple therapy involving daclatasvir, asunaprevir and a drug dubbed BMS-791325, co-formulated into one pill to be taken twice a day, now in phase three testing.
"
1738,ABBV,"Ultimately, however, he does not expect a single regimen to conquer the others because not all patients are the same.
"
1739,ABBV,"Treating Toughest Patients
"
1740,ABBV,"""Daclatasvir has been studied with so many different drugs, it's used in all genotypes (of the hepatitis C virus) and all patient populations — especially the toughest-to-treat populations,"" Manion said. ""These are going to be liver-transplant patients, genotype 3 patients, patients with cirrhosis, and ultimately patients with decompensation.""
"
1741,ABBV,"Decompensated cirrhosis, the worst form of liver damage that can result from HCV, usually results in liver transplant or death.
"
1742,ABBV,"The decompensated group was one population not included in AbbVie's (ABBV) six phase three trials of its ""3D"" regimen combining three antiviral agents. AbbVie also stuck to the most common genotype, genotype 1. It did very well in the trials, with cure rates ranging from 90% to 100%. The company plans to file in the U.S. during the second quarter and hit the market late this year.
"
1743,ABBV,"In one respect it will have nearly caught up with Gilead, because current FDA guidelines on Sovaldi recommend that it be used with interferon in genotype 1, unless the patient can't tolerate interferon. Gilead is banking on its sofosbuvir-ledipasvir combo to be its first official interferon-free genotype 1 treatment — also expected to launch later this year after a Feb. 10 filing.
"
1744,ABBV,"Barry Bernstein, AbbVie's vice president of infectious disease development, touted 3D's strong safety profile and the fact that it cured upward of 92% of patients with compensated cirrhosis.
"
1745,ABBV,"""We believe that the regimens will provide an option for any genotype 1-infected patient,"" Bernstein told IBD.
"
1746,ABBV,"AbbVie, Bristol-Myers and Gilead are all expected to report final study details at the International Liver Congress, meeting in London April 9-13. Company officials are keeping mum on which studies will be presented, but abstracts will go online March 24. (Late-breaking abstracts, which appear right before the conference, often have the hottest data.)

1748,ABBV,"Further down the road, even more drugs are on the way.
"
1749,ABBV,"AbbVie and partner Enanta Pharmaceuticals (ENTA) are already working on a next-generation regime that will treat more genotypes and also be simpler to take. (A common criticism of the 3D is that it's more complicated than Gilead's promised pill-a-day routine.)
"
1750,ABBV,"Earlier this month, Merck (MRK) also reported very strong phase two results for its two-drug combo for genotype 1 patients, some of whom were co-infected with HIV. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) last October acquired three HCV drugs from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), which it hopes to combine with its already approved Olysio into an all-oral regimen.
"
1751,ABBV,"Sovaldi, meanwhile, has lately been under pressure both for its $1,000-a-pill price tag and concerns about sustainability — after all, one outcome of finding a curative drug is that the patient population eventually shrinks.

Company officials are keeping mum on which studies will be presented, but abstracts will go online March 24. (Late-breaking abstracts, which appear right before the conference, often have the hottest data.)Next-Generation RegimesFurther down the road, even more drugs are on the way.AbbVie and partner Enanta Pharmaceuticals (ENTA) are already working on a next-generation regime that will treat more genotypes and also be simpler to take. (A common criticism of the 3D is that it's more complicated than Gilead's promised pill-a-day routine.)Earlier this month, Merck (MRK) also reported very strong phase two results for its two-drug combo for genotype 1 patients, some of whom were co-infected with HIV. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) last October acquired three HCV drugs from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), which it hopes to combine with its already approved Olysio into an all-oral regimen.Sovaldi, meanwhile, has lately been under pressure both for its $1,000-a-pill price tag and concerns about sustainability — after all, one outcome of finding a curative drug is that the patient population eventually shrinks.Still, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover says Gilead has a first-mover advantage and such strong trial data that it likely will be the biggest player for the indefinite future.""I think we'll have Gilead representing 50% of the hep C market,"" he told IBD. ""AbbVie will take the lion's share of what's remaining.""

1778,ABBV,"Specialty drug company Horizon Pharma (HZNP) is on a roll with two arthritis drugs, Duexis and Vimovo. Both treat arthritis pain and protect against ulcers, a two-for-one bang that most other drugs treating arthritis don't provide.

"
1790,ABBV,"Now, however, all the statins have gone off-patent or are about to. So Pfizer (PFE) and a passel of other companies — led by Amgen (AMGN), Regeneron (REGN) and Regeneron's partner Sanofi (SNY) — are turning to a new class of cholesterol busters called PCSK9 inhibitors.
"
1791,ABBV,"At the American Cardiology Conference (ACC) in Washington, D.C., Saturday through Monday, investors will get a chance to see how the new drugs are doing in clinical trials.
"
1792,ABBV,"PCSK9 is short for proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, an enzyme that binds to the liver's receptors of LDL, or bad, cholesterol and targets them for degredation. By blocking PCSK9, the companies aim to boost the liver's ability to eliminate LDL cholesterol from the blood, and thus reduce the chance of heart disease.

1807,ABBV,"The safety of the PCSK9s came under particular scrutiny earlier this month, when word got around Twitter that the Food and Drug Administration ""has become aware of neurocognitive adverse events in the PCSK9 inhibitor class"" and had asked Sanofi and Regeneron to ""make an assessment of potential neurocognitive adverse events across the global development program for alirocumab, especially in the longer-term studies,"" according to Sanofi's annual report.

Health care firms typically enjoy steady demand in good or bad economic times, so they often lead when the general market is bumpy.With ObamaCare rolling out, some medicals are seen benefiting although others are shrinking because of higher costs related to regulatory obligations.Here are five medical companies on the Bolting RS Lines screen. Their RS lines have struck out to new highs along with their stocks in recent weeks.Team Health Holdings (TMH) provides outsourced staffing and services to about 800 hospitals in 47 states. The Tennessee-based company went public in mid-December 2009 at 12 a share. Its revenue has risen at a double-digit clip for more than two years and profit growth also took off last year, rising the last four quarters 0%, 8%, 29% and 26% last quarter.It traded relatively flat in early 2012, began climbing from a 19.90 low on April 9 and has risen 89% since then, rising 1.8% to 37.53 Monday in stock market trading. That's a new closing high.Cigna (CI) offers a variety of ways to attain and maintain insurance coverage, including HMOs, PPOs and point-of-service plans.Cigna reported 41% higher earnings per share the last two quarters in a row. The consensus of 19 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is for a more modest 15% gain when it announces first-quarter earnings on May 2. Shares advanced 1% Monday to a new closing high. They jumped 3.5% last week as the Obama administration hiked its final Medicare Advantage reimbursement rates for 2014.AbbVie (ABBV), one of the highest-rated companies most people have never heard of, was spun off from Abbott Laboratories (ABT) on Jan. 2. It sells testosterone-boosting AndroGel, but its flagship product is Humira for rheumatoid arthritis. It's also developing a hepatitis C treatment that analysts expect will come to market in 2015.AbbVie began trading at 34.40 and in just over three months has risen 21% to a 41.77 close.

Since mid-November, for example, its stock has climbed 27%, slightly outpacing the market upturn.It should be noted that during that period sales and profit growth decelerated, as its EPS rose 25%, 21% and a slim 9% last quarter.

"
1914,ABBV,"At a dermatology meeting on Saturday, Celgene reported phase-three results for apremilast, its experimental oral treatment for psoriasis. The drug worked on many patients but its efficacy was below the biologic treatments already on the market, which include Amgen's (AMGN) Enbrel, Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Stelara and AbbVie 's (ABBV) Humira.
"
1915,ABBV,"In an email to clients, ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote that he still thinks the drug will be approved and used by doctors given its good safety profile, but it would have to be priced at a discount to the biologics. Nonetheless, he says Celgene's 2017 apremilast sales guidance of $1.5 billion to $2 billion is too high. Analysts have, in fact, been doubting that figure ever since the phase-two data came out, and current consensus calls for 2017 sales of $873 million.

1918,ABBV,"Shares of drug giant Pfizer (PFE) and its animal-health affiliate Zoetis (ZTS) moved in opposite directions Tuesday after the companies reported sharply different first quarters.
"
1919,ABBV,"Zoetis brought the good news. Adjusted net income reached 36 cents a share, up 20% from a year earlier and topping analyst estimates by 3 cents. Sales rose 4% to $1.09 billion, slightly above views.
"
1920,ABBV,"Full-year guidance was in line with consensus estimates, with EPS at $1.36 to $1.42 and sales at $4.43 billion to $4.53 billion. Last year, the company made 85 cents a share on revenue of $4.34 billion.
"
1921,ABBV,"IPO Three Months Ago
"
1922,ABBV,"Zoetis, partly spun out of Pfizer in an IPO three months ago, performed best in the U.S., where sales rose 7%. It grew less in Europe, but it did better than some had feared after French competitor Virbac reported earlier in April.
"
1923,ABBV,"""There was no obvious 1Q weakness in Europe ... in fact, the region that includes Europe reported revenue growth of 4% (year-over-year), which is excellent, in my opinion,"" wrote analyst Mark Schoenebaum of ISI Group in an email to clients.
"
1924,ABBV,"On the conference call with analysts discussing results, CEO Juan Ramon Alaix admitted that the livestock portion of Zoetis' business had hit head winds, especially with the recent drought in the U.S. He said sales to the pet market made up the difference, though this was helped partly by a now-resolved supply issue with a U.S. rival.
"
1925,ABBV,"He said the company is "" optimistic"" about the pet market in the U.S. ""because, I think, we have had the right strategies, the right programs and also the interaction with the customer — direct interaction with the customer.""
"
1926,ABBV,"Zoetis' shares spiked as much as 6.4% early, but fell back a bit to close up 1.1%, at 33.02.
"
1927,ABBV,"Pfizer, meanwhile, issued a much gloomier report. Its sales shrank 9% to $13.5 billion, missing estimates by some $500 million. Profit fell 5% to 54 cents a share, a penny below consensus.
"
1928,ABBV,"Pfizer also shaved $900 million off its full-year revenue forecast, which is now $55.3 billion to $57.3 billion, vs. $59 billion last year. It also cut 6 cents from its EPS guidance, which is now $2.14 to $2.24 vs. $2.19 last year.
"
1929,ABBV,"About $118 million of the revenue miss and all of the revenue guidance cut was due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates.
"
1930,ABBV,"There were also some timing issues in the Centers for Disease Control's purchases of pneumococcal vaccine Prevnar 13, whose sales came in 14% below consensus at $846 million.
"
1931,ABBV,"The EPS guidance was hit by both the foreign exchange rate and the Zoetis divestment, the latter peeling off 2 cents. On the conference call, Pfizer CEO Ian Read said executives are still making up their minds about when to divest the 80% of Zoetis that Pfizer still owns. He also addressed the prospect that the rest of Pfizer will eventually split into two companies, much like Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and AbbVie (ABBV) did earlier this year. Already the company is being organized into two core businesses, but Read said they won't be ready to separate until 2016 at the earliest.
"
1932,ABBV,"Potential Blockbusters
"
1933,ABBV,"In a research note, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover called the quarter a ""minor disappointment,"" but said it didn't affect his longer-term positive view. He said sales have been shrinking due to patent losses, but this quarter brought the launch of two potential blockbusters: anticoagulant Eliquis, jointly owned with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), and oral rheumatoid-arthritis drug Xeljanz. Xeljanz was rejected by European Union authorities last week, but Conover says Pfizer will succeed after refiling.
"
1934,ABBV,"Other analysts have called the Eliquis launch weak, but Read characterized it as ""in line with our expectations."" Xeljanz wasn't fully launched until March, but Read said ""we're encouraged by the early indications or indicators we're seeing.""

1938,ABBV,"As a result, year-over-year comparisons are a bit deceptive. Current consensus, according to Thomson Reuters, calls for a 43% drop in sales from last year's Q1 to $5.42 billion, with earnings falling 60% to 41 cents a share. Those year-ago numbers, however, include the company now known as AbbVie (ABBV), which owns the blockbuster arthritis drug Humira and other popular drugs. According to analysts, the remaining divisions should see mixed results.
"
1939,ABBV,"Nutritionals now make up the largest division of Abbott, with about 30% of revenue. Earlier this month, both William Blair and Morgan Stanley offered bullish outlooks for this business, especially after Mead Johnson (MJN) CEO Peter Jakobsen said in March that the crucial Chinese market is improving. This gained further support on Tuesday as French competitor Danone (DANOY) reported record growth in its Asian sales, especially for its infant formulas. Danone's and Mead Johnson's shares both rose more than 3%.

1940,ABBV,"William Blair analyst Ben Andrew is modeling 7.7% growth in Abbott's nutrition business in Q1 to $1.68 billion. He's also modeling similar growth in the diagnostics division, again due to growth in emerging markets as well as new products. However, he expects sales of off-patent drugs to shrink due to austerity measures in Europe and reimbursement cuts in Japan. Sales of the stent business are also expected to shrink as the company faces the rollout of Medtronic's (MDT) Resolute Integrity stent.

1998,ABBV,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) announced positive results from the phase II study, ELOQUENT-3, on oncology drug, Empliciti.The study is evaluating the addition of Empliciti to Pomalyst and low-dose dexamethasone (EPd) in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). The international study is evaluating Pomalyst-based triplet combination in patients with RRMM, who received at least two prior therapies, including Revlimid and a proteasome inhibitor.The study achieved its primary endpoint as the results show a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) for patients treated with EPd compared with only Pomalyst and dexamethasone (Pd).The data were also presented at the 23rd Congress of the European Hematology Association.Data from the study showed that patients randomized to EPd experienced a 46% reduction in risk of disease progression compared with patients randomized to Pd alone, with median PFS of 10.3 months compared with 4.7 months in Pd patients.Additionally, the PFS benefit experienced among patients randomized to EPd was consistent among patients who had received two to three prior lines of therapy and four or more prior lines of therapy.The combination therapy, if approved, can provide an important treatment option for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma whose disease has progressed after treatment with lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor.Bristol-Myers is co-developing Empliciti with AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report). Bristol-Myers’ shares have declined 9.4% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 1.8%.Earlier, the company announced that the China National Drug Administration has approved its blockbuster immuno-oncology drug Opdivo, for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after prior platinum-based chemotherapy in adult patients without EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.Per the company, this is the first and only PD-1 inhibitor approved in China. The approval was based on data from the pivotal phase III study, CheckMate-078 trial, in which 90% of the patients enrolled were from China.We note that Opdivo became the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to gain regulatory approval. It is currently approved in several countries including the United States, the EU and Japan for several cancer indications.Opdivo became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy — classical Hodgkin lymphoma — in both the United States (May 2016) and the EU (November 2016).  The drug has been performing impressively, due to demand resulting from the rapid commercial acceptance for several indications, including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and second-line NSCLC.Label expansion into additional indications would give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly.However, Opdivo faces stiff competition from Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda and Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Tecentriq which can limit market share gains.Zacks Rank & Another Stock to ConsiderBristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1999,ABBV,"Another Alzheimer’s candidate failed in clinical studies this week. An independent data monitoring committee (“IDMC”) recommended Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) to discontinue two studies on lanabecestat. Shares of Israel-based small biotech, Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (GLMD  -  Free Report) rose after it announced positive data from a mid-stage study on its NASH candidate Aramchol. Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) gained FDA approval for two new indications of its blockbuster anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda. While Glaxo’s (GSK  -  Free Report) late-stage HIV studies met the primary endpoint, AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report), Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) and AstraZeneca gained regulatory nods for label expansion of their key cancer drugs.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesLilly/AstraZeneca’s Alzheimer’s Candidate Fails: Lilly and AstraZeneca are discontinuing two late-stage studies on their Alzheimer disease candidate, lanabecestat, on recommendation of the IDMC.The IDMC said that the two studies — one in early Alzheimer's disease and the other in mild Alzheimer's disease dementia — were unlikely to meet the primary endpoints upon completion, leading to a decision to discontinue these studies on the oral beta secretase cleaving enzyme (BACE) inhibitor. The latest setback adds to a long list of failed treatment options for this deadly brain disease. (Read more: Lilly & AstraZeneca Scrap Studies on Alzheimer's Candidate)Merck’s Keytruda Gets FDA Nod for Two New Indications: Merck gained FDA’s accelerated approval for two new indications for its blockbuster anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda this week. These include third-line treatment of adult as well as pediatric patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and second-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. These label expansion approvals should drive sales of Keytruda in the future quarters.Also, Merck’s regulatory application seeking approval for an expanded age indication of its HPV vaccine Gardasil was granted priority review by the FDA. Merck is looking to get Gardasil approved for women and men aged 27 to 45. The HPV vaccine is presently approved for men and women aged 9 to 26.

The studies were conducted on treatment naïve HIV-1 infected adults — those who have not received prior antiviral therapy. Regulatory application to get the two-drug regimen of dolutegravir and lamivudine approved is expected to be filed later this year.In another positive news for Glaxo, Mylan's generic version of Glaxo’s blockbuster respiratory drug, Advair was delayed again with a second complete response letter from the FDA.Galmed Shares Hit the Roof as NASH Candidate Succeeds in Study: Galmed announced positive top-line results from a mid-stage study on its lead candidate, Aramchol, for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The study demonstrated that Aramchol was effective at reaching its primary endpoints.Importantly, reduction in liver fat, as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, was demonstrated in patients who had completed 52 weeks of treatment with Aramchol 400mg compared to placebo. These results strongly support the advancement of Aramchol to pivotal phase III studies. Shares of the company skyrocketed around 150% after this news was announced. (Read more: Galmed Soars on Positive NASH Data on Aramchol)Allergan’s Anti-CGRP Drug Meets Goal in Study: Allergan announced that its second anti-CGRP candidate, atogepant, met the primary endpoint in a mid-stage study. The CGP-MD-01 study evaluated 5 doses of atogepant for the prevention of episodic migraine over 12 weeks. Atogepant achieved a reduction of statistical significance in monthly migraine/probable migraine (“MPM”) headache days from baseline for all doses.Allergan’s another oral anti-CGRP acute migraine treatment, ubrogepant, has already shown positive results in two phase III studies.Separately, Allergan announced positive top-line data from a phase III study on its pipeline candidate Bimatoprost SR, an investigational implant developed as the first sustained-release drop-free treatment option for lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Data from the study showed that Bimatoprost SR reduced IOP by approximately 30% over the 12-week primary efficacy period, thereby demonstrating non-inferiority to the study comparator, timolol eye drops.AbbVie/Roche Cancer Drugs Get FDA Nod for Combo Use: AbbVie and Roche announced FDA approval for the combination use of their cancer drugs Venclexta and Rituxan, for previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (“CLL”). The FDA approval was based on positive data from the phase III MURANO study of Venclexta plus Rituxan in relapse/refractory CLL. Venclexta is jointly marketed by AbbVie and Roche’s subsidiary Genentech in the United States and by AbbVie outside the United States.Separately, Roche announced FDA approval for its cancer drug, Avastin in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) for the treatment for women with advanced ovarian cancer following initial surgery. With this latest approval, Avastin is now approved for six different types of cancer in the United States.Tagrisso Gets EU Approval in First-Line Setting: AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) lung cancer drug Tagrisso gained EU approval for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR mutations. A similar label expansion application was approved in the United States in April. Until now, Tagrisso was approved in the United States, European Union, Japan and China as a second-line treatment option for patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. The label expansion in the first-line setting should drive sales of Tagrisso higher in future quarters.

2000,ABBV,"AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted approval for the combination use of its cancer drug Venclexta and Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (“CLL”) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), with or without 17p deletion, who have received at least one prior therapy.Venclexta is jointly marketed by AbbVie and Roche’s Pharma arm, Genentech in the United States and by AbbVie outside the United States.The FDA approval for combination use was based on positive data from the phase III MURANO study of Venclexta plus Rituxan in relapse/refractory CLLData from the study, presented in September last year, showed that the combination led to a profound improvement in progression free survival compared to Teva Pharmaceutical’s (TEVA  -  Free Report) Treanda plus Rituxan(BR). Results from the study showed that a fixed duration of treatment with Venclexta plus Rituxan significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 81% compared with BR. Overall response rate (ORR) was 92% in the Venclexta/Rituxan arm compared to 72% for BR.Concurrently, the FDA also approved Venclexta as a monotherapy for CLL or SLL patients, with or without 17p deletion. Until now, as a monotherapy, Venclexta was approved to treat patients with CLL with 17p deletion, as detected by an FDA-approved test.The FDA approval for label expansion of Venclexta for this indication should expand the patient population for Venclexta significantly and boost its commercial potential. With the latest approval, Venclexta/Rituxan becomes the first oral, chemotherapy-free, fixed duration treatment option for CLL patients. Also, this summer, AbbVie will file a regulatory application in the United States for Venclexta in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) while a phase III program in multiple myeloma is also progressing well.AbbVie’s shares have gained 3.8% this year so far against the industry’s decline of 3.7%.AbbVie currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2001,ABBV,"There is no approved therapy that can completely cure autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. The development of new treatment technologies is ongoing. Meanwhile, it is difficult to control autoimmune diseases in the majority of patients. The newest class of medications to treat these diseases is janus kinase (“JAK”) inhibitors, which are providing patients a better treatment option. This class of therapies has generated significant interest due to their better efficacy compared to tumor necrosis factor (“TNF”) inhibitor therapies.Autoimmune DiseasesIn patients with autoimmune diseases, the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks the healthy cells. Scientists are yet to find the reason behind this abnormality. However, the incidence of autoimmune diseases is on the rise. There are multiple types of autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”), psoriasis, multiple sclerosis (“MS”), inflammatory bowel disease (“IBD”), etc. Several companies are dedicated to bringing better drugs for the treatment of these diseases. The symptoms include fatigue, muscle aches, swelling, and redness in the affected body parts.The most common and first-line treatment for autoimmune disease is disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), especially methotrexate. Apart from methotrexate, there are several classes of DMARDs including TNF inhibitor therapies approved for these diseases that are performing well. AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel are blockbuster TNF inhibitor drugs among others. However, these treatments have serious safety issues which include increased risk tuberculosis and lymphoma among others.JAK InhibitorsSeveral pharma companies are developing JAK inhibitors, which work by blocking a particular signal of a body’s immune response, cytokines, instead of suppressing the immune system as done by DMARDs. Patients treated with JAK-inhibitors in clinical studies have shown faster and better response to the disease. However, the safety concern still looms large. The segment is attractive for companies as there are only two JAK inhibitors, presently approved for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, especially RA. However, several companies are developing their candidates, which is likely to increase competition going forward.The segment was in news recently as Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Olumiant, a JAK inhibitor, received approval in the United States and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced top-line data from a late-stage study evaluating its JAK inhibitor candidate,upadacitinib.4 Pharma/Biotech Companies in FocusGiven the growing interest in JAK inhibitors, let’s take a look at some pharma and biotech companies that are looking to change the way autoimmune diseases are treated.Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xeljanz (tofacitinib) is the first approved JAK-inhibitor in the United States for the treatment of RA. It has been available in the market since 2012. The drug is also approved for psoriatic arthritis. It generated sales of $326 million in the first quarter of 2018, up 30.4% year over year. A regulatory application seeking line extension of the drug in ulcerative colitis was approved late last month in the United States. Regulatory applications seeking approval in the above three indications are under review in Europe.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Eli Lilly’s JAK-inhibitor, Olumiant (baricitinib), is the second drug to receive approval for treating RA in the United States. The drug was approved early this month. However, it was launched in certain European countries in 2017. We note that the FDA rejected the company’s new drug application seeking approval of Olumiant in April 2017 citing safety concerns. Lilly develops and commercializes the drug in partnership with Incyte Corporation. The drug generated sales of $32.2 million in the first quarter, sequentially up 40%. Lilly is currently evaluating the drug in another autoimmune indication, atopic dermatitis (eczema), in a late-stage study.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).AbbVie is another company, which is focused on developing JAK inhibitor based treatments. The company’s JAK inhibitor, upadacitinib, showed promising results in late-stage studies evaluating the candidate in RA patients. It is also being developed for atopic dermatitis in a late-stage study for which it enjoys breakthrough therapy status in the United States. Another late-stage study is evaluating the candidate in Crohn’s disease.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Galapagos NV (GLPG  -  Free Report) is developing its JAK inhibitor candidate, filgotinib, in collaboration with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report). Separate late-stage studies are evaluating the candidate in RA, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Moreover, several mid-stage studies are evaluating the candidate in multiple autoimmune indications including ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and cutaneous lupus erythematosus among others. Data from a mid-stageI study evaluating filgotinib in psoriatic arthritis showed significant improvement in patients.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Prospects of JAK Inhibitors With several blockbuster DMARDs nearing patent expiration, this new class of drugs holds potential to replace the existing treatments. This boosts the prospects of the companies that have these drugs/candidates in their pipeline or commercial portfolio.However, JAK inhibitors also have several side effects, which may delay their approval. We note that a lower dose of Lilly’s Olumiant was approved along with a boxed warning stating risk of serious infections, malignancies and thrombosis.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2002,ABBV,"This week was ruled by cancer data presentations at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (“ASCO”) in Chicago by pharma bigwigs like Bristol Myers (BMY  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report), among others. JAK inhibitors were in the news this week with Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) finally gaining FDA approval for its rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”) candidate Olumiant (baricitinib) in the United States while AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) presented positive top-line data from its fifth late-stage study on upadacitinib in RA.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesUpdate from ASCO: Merck stole the show at ASCO after presenting data from several cancer studies of its PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda. Key presentations were from two pivotal lung cancer trials. KEYNOTE-042 study evaluated Keytruda monotherapy in newly-diagnosed lung cancer patients while KEYNOTE-407 study evaluated Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy in difficult-to treat squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Both the studies showed that treatment with Keytruda led to improved survival. Particularly, data from the KEYNOTE- 407 study, which evaluated Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC was considered “practice changing” by investors.Four and five years follow-up data presented from two advanced melanoma studies showed that treatment with Keytruda led to long-term survival benefit. Interim data from a cohort of a phase II study, KEYNOTE-158, evaluating Keytruda as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated advanced small cell lung cancer (SCLC) demonstrated encouraging response rates in the overall population of SCLC patients as well as in patients whose tumors express PD-L1. Keytruda also demonstrated encouraging ORR in studies evaluating the Lenvima/Keytruda combination in four different tumor types and Keytruda monotherapy for the first-line treatment of advanced clear cell RCC.Bristol-Myers and Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) presented preliminary data from a mid-stage study evaluating NKTR-214 in combination with Bristol-Myers’PD-L1 inhibitor, Opdivo in several tumor types. The response rates in melanoma and kidney cancer patients did not impress investors, resulting in a 42% drop in Nektar’s stock on Monday.  (Read more: Nektar and Bristol-Myers Present Data on Cancer Study)Bristol-Myers also presented data on Opdivo at ASCO. In a late-stage study evaluating Opdivo versus Yervoy in a broad range of patients with resected stage III or IV melanoma, Opdivo demonstrated sustained, superior recurrence-free survival versus Yervoy. In another study, Opdivo plus chemotherapy showed improved PFS versus chemotherapy in first-line lung cancer patients with PD-L1 expression <1%.Novartis (NVS) announced positive data from a combination study on breast cancer drug Kisqali and from two long-term leukemia studies on Tasigna. (Read more: Novartis Announces Positive Data on Kisqali and Tasigna).Roche presented data from a late-stage study, which showed that Tecentriq (atezolizumab) plus chemotherapy reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (PFS) by 29% in advanced squamous NSCLC patients versus chemotherapy alone.AbbVie presented early data from a phase II study evaluating a combination of its cancer drugs Imbruvica plus Venclexta (venetoclax) for the first-line treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The data demonstrated high rates of responses in such patients. Also, interim data from a late-stage study evaluating Imbruvica plus Roche’s Rituxan in Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, a rare form of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, showed that the combination significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 80% compared to placebo plus Rituxan.Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), AstraZeneca and J&J also made some cancer data presentations at the meeting.Lilly Gets FDA Nod for Lower Dose of Olumiant: Eli Lilly and partner Incyte gained FDA approval for the lower dose of (2 mg) of the companies’ JAK inhibitor, Olumiant. The FDA did not approve the higher dose (4 mg) and the drug’s label was approved with a boxed warning stating risk of serious infections, malignancies and thrombosis. Olumiant is already marketed in Europe and Japan and generated sales of $32.2 million in the first quarter of 2018. In the United States, Lilly faced significant trouble in getting FDA nod for Olumiant. In April last year, the FDA had issued a complete response letter for the new drug application seeking approval of Olumiant, requesting additional information to determine the most appropriate doses. This year in April, an FDA advisory committee had recommended approval of the lower dose of the drug while not recommending the higher dose of 4 mg on inadequate safety profile to support an approval relative to its benefits. (Read more: Eli Lilly's Olumiant Gets FDA Nod for Rheumatoid Arthritis).AbbVie’s 5th Late-Stage Upadacitinib Study Succeeds: AbbVie’s oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib, met all primary as well as secondary endpoints in the fifth phase III study from its SELECT program. Top-line data from the study showed thata significantly higher proportion of patients treated with upadacitinib in both 15 and 30 mg doses achieved superior responses compared to chemotherapy agent methotrexate. AbbVie plans to submit regulatory applications for upadacitinib in rheumatoid arthritis in the second half of the year.  (Read more: Abbvie’s Upadacitinib Fifth RA Study Data Positive)Allergan Under Activist Pressure to Split CEO-Chairman Roles: Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) was under pressure this week after two hedge-fund firms, Senator Investment Group and Appaloosa, disclosed a letter urging the company to engage in a management and board overhaul. The firms asked the pharmaceutical company to split its chairman and chief executive roles, both presently held by Brent Saunders, among other management changes. Appaloosa run by David Tepper and Senator Investment Group run by Douglas Silverman, suggested an outsider should be hired for either of the roles. The letter comes on the heels of Allergan’s strategic plan announced last week to divest its women's health and infectious disease units. Allergan responded by saying that the board has been refreshed with the addition of three members in the last 16 months. (Read more: Allergan Requests Shareholders to Veto Management Change).Glaxo Completes Buyout of Novartis’ Stake in Consumer Healthcare JV: Glaxo announced that it has completed its previously announced deal to buy out Novartis’ 36.5% stake in the Consumer HealthCare joint venture for $13 billion (£9.2 billion),With the acquisition of Novartis’ stake, Glaxo now has 100% ownership of its Consumer Healthcare unit, which includes products such as Sensodyne and Flonase. Glaxo and Novartis created the JV in 2015 as part of a three-part transaction between the two companies by combining their consumer divisions.Pfizer to Invest More in Venture Capital Arm: : Pfizer plans to invest $600 million in its venture capital arm, Pfizer Ventures which will be invested in small biotechs and other emerging growth companies. About 150 million will be earmarked for companies involved in promising early-stage neuroscience research. (Read more: Pfizer Boosts Venture Capital Efforts, Neuroscience in Focus)Meanwhile, Pfizer’s regulatory applications for orally-available PARP inhibitor, talazoparib, for metastatic breast cancer patients with an inherited BRCA mutation, were accepted for review by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency. In the United States, the new drug application (NDA) was granted priority review by the FDA with a decision accepted in December this year.Top-line results from talazoparib’s registrational study, EMBRACA, in germline-BRCA mutated breast cancer, presented in December 2017 demonstrated superiority of talazoparib over chemotherapy in improving progression free survival.Roche’s Haemophilia A Candidate Gets Priority Review: Roche’s sBLA looking for label expansion of its drug, Hemlibra for people with haemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors was granted priority review by the FDA. Hemlibra is presently marketed for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in haemophilia A patients with factor VIII inhibitors. With the FDA granting priority review, a decision is expected on Oct 14Separately, Roche’s cancer drug Rituxan gained FDA approval for a new indication, moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris (PV), a potentially life-threatening diseaseThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index rose 1.7% in the last five trading sessions. Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return  Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Here is how the seven major stocks performed in the last five trading sessions:  All stocks were in the green last week except AstraZeneca, which declined 1.8%.

2003,ABBV,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, AbbVie has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of nearly 15.0, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 19.9. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, AbbVie’s current PE level puts it slightly below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19.7. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that AbbVie has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 11.7, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for AbbVie stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, AbbVie has a P/S ratio of about 5.0. This is higher than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Nonetheless, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, AbbVie currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes AbbVie a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for AbbVie is just 0.9, a level that is lower than the industry average of 1.8. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate.What About the Stock Overall?Though AbbVie might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of C. This gives ABBV a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been trending higher. The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower, while the full year estimate has seen two upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period.As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 1% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched up by 0.6%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:AbbVie Inc. Price and Consensus  AbbVie Inc. Price and Consensus | AbbVie Inc. QuoteThis favorable trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineAbbVie is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Its strong Zacks Rank also indicates robust growth potential in the near future. However, the company’s prospects might be constrained due to adverse broader factors, as it has a sluggish industry rank (Bottom 23% out of more than 250 industries). In fact, over the past two years, the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

2004,ABBV,"Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with Hookipa Biotech AG. Per the agreement, Gilead will own exclusive rights to Hookipa's TheraT and Vaxwave arenavirus vector-based immunization technologies for two major chronic infectious disease indications, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). While research work will be carried out by both, Hookipa will manufacture arenavirus-based vectors for clinical development by Gilead.In exchange, Gilead will provide an upfront payment of $10 million. In addition, Hookipa will be eligible to receive payments up to a total of more than $400 million based upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones. Moreover, Gilead will fund all research and development activities. Hookipa will also be eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales.The agreement further expands the relationship between Hookipa and Gilead following Gilead's participation in Hookipa's Series C financing in Dec 2017.  Hookipa’s unique therapeutic vaccine technology demonstrated excellent safety and immunogenicity in phase I studies.Gilead is banking on its HIV franchise to drive growth in future, given the persistent decline in HCV sales. Gilead’s stock has lost 3.0% in the last six months as against the industry's loss of 5.2%. Gilead’s HCV franchise witnessed slowdown across key markets, including the United States and Europe, reflecting lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi as a result of competitive and pricing pressure. The franchise saw a significant plunge in sales due to new competition and fewer patient starts. Pricing has largely stabilized and market share will stabilize by mid-2018, while patient starts are expected to decline further. We note that Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa face competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Mayret, and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zepatier among others.Meanwhile, Gilead is looking to newer avenues to help its top line by solidifying its presence in the gene therapy space. The initial uptake of Yescarta is also encouraging. Gilead is also intending to foray into the NASH market with pipeline candidates — selonsertib and filgotinib.During the first quarter, Gilead announced an agreement with Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. (SGMO  -  Free Report) to use Sangamo’s zinc finger nuclease technology platform for the development of next-generation ex vivo cell therapies in oncology.Zacks RankGilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2005,ABBV,"AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced that its investigational oral JAK inhibitor, upadacitinib met all primary as well as secondary endpoints in the fifth phase III study from its SELECT program.The phase III study, SELECT-EARLY, evaluated the candidate for moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients who had not been previously treated with chemotherapy agent methotrexate (MTX) versus MTX monotherapy. The SELECT program evaluates more than 4,000 patients across six studies on RA.After 12 weeks of treatment, the ACR50 response (primary endpoint) was achieved in 52% of the patients receiving the 15 mg oral once-daily dose of upadacitinib and 56% of the patients taking the 30 mg dose versus 28% for patients receiving MTX.The second primary endpoint of clinical remission was achieved by 48% of the patients in the 15 mg dose arm and 50% in the 30 mg dose arm, at week 24, versus only 18% for MTX.Meanwhile, 76% and 77% of patients in the 15 mg and 30 mg dose arm, respectively achieved ACR20 response at week 12 versus 54% for MTX.The results clearly show that a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with upadacitinib in both doses achieved superior responses compared to MTX. This suggests that upadacitinib monotherapy has the potential to control progression of RA and reduce the risk of permanent bone and joint damage for MTX naive patients.AbbVie plans to submit regulatory applications for upadacitinib in rheumatoid arthritis in the second half of the year.Other than rheumatoid arthritis, upadacitinib is also being evaluated in late-stage studies for Crohn’s disease and psoriatic arthritis and mid-stage studies for atopic dermatitis, giant cell arteritis and ulcerative colitis.JAK inhibitors, also known as Janus kinase inhibitors, are emerging as a potential treatment option for RA, eczema and other inflammatory diseases. These medicines work by inhibiting the activity of one or more of the Janus kinase family of enzymesLast week, Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and partner Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) gained FDA approval for the lower dose of (2 mg) of their oral JAK inhibitor, Olumiant. While the FDA did not approve the higher dose (4 mg), the drug’s label was approved with a boxed warning stating risk of serious infections, malignancies and thrombosis. Olumiant is already marketed in Europe and Japan. Another JAK inhibitor available in the market to treat RA is Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xeljanz.Successful development of upadacitinib will boost AbbVie’s RA portfolio, especially as biosimilar competition looms for its blockbuster RA drug, Humira.Humira accounts for 65% of AbbVie’s sales. Amgen and Samsung Bioepis/Biogen’s Humira biosimilars will be launched in the United States in 2023 and in the EU in 2018.AbbVie’s shares have gained 2.6% this year so far against the industry’s decline of 4.1%. AbbVie currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2006,ABBV,"Ever since President Trump’s imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from China, markets at large have suffered dearly. There have been a number of meetings between trade representatives from both the countries but all in vain.To further escalate trade-war tensions, reports have surfaced from the U.S. Treasury Department that it has been drafting policies, which prohibit firms having more than 25% Chinese ownership to benefit from emerging technologies in the United States.Such policies would have negative ramifications for industries like healthcare, biotech and pharmaceutical which are tech-heavy and need to acquire industrially efficient technologies for growth and sustenance. So would a trade-war with China turn out to be a nightmare for the U.S. healthcare sector? Let’s have a look.Trump’s Protectionism Would Dampen U.S. Healthcare FortunesEarly-stage pharmaceutical startups and biotech companies have historically benefited from increased access to Chinese investment and resources. Intellectual property rights’ protection is going to hamper the growing entrepreneurial spirit in the biotech space in the long run. The brunt would be borne more by relatively small-scale startups as American VCs focus more on larger startups from top-notch universities.Further, China has not included any medical products in the retaliatory tariffs that it imposed on the United States and is not likely to do so in the future as well. However, in case such a scenario occurs, it would not be too good for the healthcare industry. As a norm, China refrains from using copies of drugs from American biotech companies. Experts fear that if China gets down to violating patent rights due to the escalation of trade war, it might start copying drugs from companies having significant exposure to the Asian country.Under such circumstances, companies from the U.S. pharmaceutical and drug industry would have to pay dearly. Such a turn of events would also result in dwindling global share of the U.S. healthcare industry.Market leaders of the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceutical Industry such as AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report), Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pifzer (PFE  -  Free Report) would end up being the biggest losers. Such companies not only have significant Chinese exposure but are highly vulnerable to instances of I.P. right infringements. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Chinese Investment is Oxygen for U.S. Biotech and Pharma Chinese venture-capital funds have invested a whopping $1.4 billion in U.S. biotech and drug companies in the period between January through March. This surpasses the $125.5 million in investments by Chinese VCs for the whole of 2017. Part of such an increase can be attributed to China’s efforts in becoming the leader in healthcare investments across the globe.China increasingly wants to make use of the manufacturing-intensive nature of their economy. Another reason for typically increasing investments in U.S. biotech firms is that China wants to access novel therapies that it can make use of along with high returns from such investments.However, any restriction by the Trump administration on Chinese involvement in U.S. biotech can spell doomsday for the industry. One of the big reasons is that it is relatively cheaper for the drug and pharmaceutical companies to perform clinical trials in China. The China Drug Administration (CDA) or the Chinese FDA takes less than a third of the time taken by the U.S. FDA in approving results. Consequently, costs involved are also lower over there.To ConcludeThe U.S. pharmaceutical industry has suffered in the recent past due to rising costs associated with raw materials. Trump’s act of tariff imposition on China has proved to be rather counterproductive for several industries at large and might turn out to be nightmarish for the healthcare industry.It is a known fact that Chinese investments breathe life into small and mid-scale healthcare companies in America. Finally, in the event of China infringing drug patent rights from American companies having significant operations on Chinese shores, a bloodbath in the healthcare industry would be inevitable.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2007,ABBV,"Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced positive top-line results from a late-stage study evaluating the safety and efficacy of ABP 710, its biosimilar version of J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report)/Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Remicade, compared to the reference product for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA). ABP 710 is an anti-TNF monoclonal antibody.Data from the phase III study showed that ABP 710 was non-inferior compared to Remicade based on its primary endpoint, which was assessment of ACR20 at week 22. The ACR (American College of Rheumatology) criteria are used to measure the effectiveness of various arthritis medicines in clinical studies.  An ACR20 score means that a person's RA has improved by 20%.The data showed that there was no clinically meaningful difference between ABP 710 and Remicade.Amgen’s shares have gained 5.5% so far this year against a 7.6% decrease registered by the industry.  Amgen has 10 biosimilar products in its portfolio. Out of them, Amgen’s biosimilar version of Abbvie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) RA drug Humira, Amjevita, was approved by the FDA in September 2016 and in the EU in March 2017 for the same indications as Humira. Amjevita is the first biosimilar version of Humira to be approved by the FDA as well as Amgen’s first biosimilar medicine to be approved. Amgen will begin selling Amjevita in most countries in the EU this year and in the United States from January 2023.Amgen has collaborated with Allergan for the worldwide development and commercialization of four oncology antibody biosimilar medicines. Among them, a biosimilar version of Roche’s Avastin— Mvasi — is already approved in United States and EU while a biosimilar version of Herceptin, Kanjinti, is under review in the United States and EU. A biosimilar version of Rituxan — ABP 798 — is in late-stage development.Several of Amgen’s own drugs are facing biosimilar competition. Biosimilars are already having a negative impact on key products like Neupogen and Neulasta in the EU. In the United States, while Neupogen is already facing biosimilar competition, other key drugs like Neulasta and Epogen could start facing biosimilar competition this year. The entry of additional biosimilars in the United States will have a negative impact on the company’s top line. Sensipar also lost patent exclusivity in March 2018 and generics could be launched soon.Amgen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2008,ABBV,"AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced extension of its 2014 research and development (R&D) agreement with Calico Life Sciences to jointly discover and develop candidates to treat age-related diseases including neurodegeneration and cancer.Calico is a San Francisco Bay Area based biotech company, backed by Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report). Since the companies first entered the deal, the partnership has produced more than two dozen early-stage programs. With the latest agreement, the collaboration has been extended for another three years.Calico will be responsible for the early R&D programs until 2022 and will continue to advance the programs through phase IIa through 2027. AbbVie will continue to support Calico in early R&D stages and will have the option to manage late-stage development and commercial activities. The companies will be sharing costs and profits equally and contribute $500 million each additionally to the collaboration.The deal strengthens AbbVie’s grip on the oncology segment. As it is, AbbVie has a strong position in the oncology market with drugs like Imbruvica, which it markets in partnership with J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report).Imbruvica, currently approved for quite a few indications, has multi-billion dollar potential and AbbVie is exploring the potential to expand Imbruvica’s label into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. Several studies on Imbruvica are ongoing to evaluate the drug alone or in combination in different patient segments. AbbVie expects Imbruvica peak sales of more than $7 billion and revenues of about $5 billion in 2020.AbbVie is also studying chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) drug Venclyxto/Venclexta to expand the label to address the broader relapsed/refractory CLL patient population, expand into earlier lines of therapy and other hematologic malignancies like multiple myeloma and AML. Data from the phase III MURANO study of Venclexta plus Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan in relapse/refractory CLL presented in last September showed that the combination led to a profound improvement in progression free survival compared to Treanda plus Rituxan. Regulatory applications seeking approval for the combination use in this broader patient population were approved in the United States earlier this month. Label expansion for this indication should expand the patient population for Venclexta significantly and boost its commercial potential.AbbVie’s shares have declined 4.8% this year so far compared with the industry’s decline of 4.9%. AbbVie currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2009,ABBV,"The world of cancer research is changing fast. This space is seeing huge developments and companies are taking great strides in treating a variety of cancers.Cancer research is definitely an exciting area and one that investors will keep a close watch on in the coming years. This is because the disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality across the world preceded only by heart disease.The five-day ASCO conference in Chicago, which is basically the most important annual cancer research event, concluded yesterday. The conference featured clinical updates from several companies about the latest developments in treating the disease.Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) stole the limelight at ASCO after presenting data from several cancer studies of its PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda.The data presentation from Merck, which garnered the most attention from physicians and investors was from a second interim analysis of a pivotal lung cancer study on Keytruda — phase III KEYNOTE-407 study. The study evaluated Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC, which is a difficult-to-treat lung cancer patient population. The data from the study showed that the combination of Keytruda plus chemotherapy led to significant improvement in both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival regardless of PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 is a protein present on the surface of cells.The risk of death (OS) was reduced by 36% compared to chemotherapy alone. The PFS improvement was nearly half for patients in the Keytruda combination group compared with chemotherapy alone.The data was termed “practice changing” by CNBC – changing the way doctors look at prescribing these drugs to cancer patients. It further cemented Merck’s position in the lung cancer market, which is the most lucrative oncology sector.In this context, we must mention that Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) also presented data from a similar late-stage study, which showed that Tecentriq (atezolizumab) plus chemotherapy reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (PFS) by 29% in advanced squamous NSCLC patients versus chemotherapy alone.Coming back to Merck, the company also presented data from another pivotal lung cancer study (KEYNOTE-042) evaluating Keytruda monotherapy in first-line NSCLC patients with PD-L1 expression of at least 1%. This study also showed that treatment with Keytruda led to improved survival. Meanwhile, four and five years follow-up data presented from two advanced melanoma studies showed that treatment with Keytruda led to long-term survival benefit. Interim data from a cohort of a phase II study, KEYNOTE-158, evaluating Keytruda as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated advanced small cell lung cancer (SCLC) demonstrated encouraging response rates in the overall population of SCLC patients as well as in patients whose tumors express PD-L1.Meanwhile, Keytruda also demonstrated encouraging ORR in studies evaluating the Lenvima/Keytruda combination in four different tumor types and Keytruda monotherapy for the first-line treatment of advanced clear cell RCC. Merck & partner AstraZeneca also presented positive Lynparza combo data in breast cancer. Shares of Merck have gone up by more than 3% since Friday, Jun 1 on ASCO strength.Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) was the biggest loser at ASCO. Nektar along with partner Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report), presented preliminary data from a mid-stage study evaluating NKTR-214 in combination with Bristol-Myers’ PD-L1 inhibitor Opdivo in several tumor types. The response rates in melanoma and kidney cancer patients did not impress investors, resulting in a 42% fall in Nektar’s stock on Jun 4, which was probably the worst performance by an S&P 500 Index member in the last five years.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Bristol-Myers also presented data on Opdivo at ASCO. In a late-stage study evaluating Opdivo versus Yervoy in a broad range of patients with resected stage III or IV melanoma, Opdivo demonstrated sustained, superior recurrence-free survival versus Yervoy. In the study, Opdivo plus chemotherapy showed improved PFS versus chemotherapy in first-line lung cancer patients with PD-L1 expression <1%.Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) and partner Bluebird Bio presented early-stage data for the CAR-T cell therapy bb2121 in patients with late-stage relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Though the study showed a median PFS of 11.8 months in this heavily pre-treated patient population, the data did not impress investors.Celgene also presented data on another CAR-T therapy - liso-ce (JCAR017) - which it acquired from its acquisition of Juno earlier this year. The data showed that at six months, 49% of the patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) remained in remission while 46% maintained a complete response. (Read more: Celgene Presents Data on CAR T Therapy, Revlimid & Pomalyst)Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) announced positive data from a combination study on breast cancer drug Kisqali and from two long-term leukemia studies on Tasigna. (Read More: Novartis Announces Positive Data on Kisqali and Tasigna).AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) presented early data from a phase II study evaluating a combination of its cancer drugs Imbruvica plus Venclexta (venetoclax) for the first-line treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).  The data demonstrated high rates of responses in such patients. Also, interim data from a late-stage study evaluating Imbruvica plus Roche’s Rituxan in Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, a rare form of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, showed that the combination significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 80% compared to placebo plus Rituxan.Pfizer, Amgen, AstraZeneca and J&J also made some cancer data presentations at the meeting.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2010,ABBV,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted a priority review to its lymphoma drug Imbruvica’s (ibrutinib) sNDA for the treatment of Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM) in combination with Rituxan (rituximab), marketed by Genentech, a subsidiary of Roche Group (RHHBY  -  Free Report).The sNDA was based on positive data from the phase III study, iNNOVATE, which evaluated Imbruvica in combination with Rituxan and showed positive outcomes across all lines of WM treatment including patients with untreated and relapsed/refractory WM.The phase III study (n=150) enrolled patients with relapsed/refractory and treatment-naive WM. Patients received intravenous Rituxan 375 mg/m2 once weekly for four consecutive weeks followed by a second four-weekly Rituxan course post a three-month interval. They either received Imbruvica420 mg or placebo once daily until permanently discontinuing the treatment. The primary endpoint was progression free survival with a measure of safety and tolerability across all treatment lines.Based on the data and if approved, the sNDA would expand the drug’s label for the indication of WM as the first chemotherapy-free combination treatment option.Notably, Imbruvica is a first-in-class Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The drug is already approved in the United States for the following indications such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma, Waldenström's macroglobulinemia along with previously-treated mantle cell lymphoma, previously-treated marginal zone lymphoma and the previously-treated chronic graft-versus-host disease.The drug is being jointly developed and marketed by Pharmacyclics LLC, which got acquired by AbbVie in 2015 and Janssen Biotech, a unit of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report).We also mark that AbbVie’s Humira drug is a key growth driver for its revenue base. Imbruvica also appears to have great potential of a blockbuster drug. In the first quarter of 2018, the drug’s net revenues were $762 million, up 38.5% year over year. By the end of the year, its global revenues might exceed $3.3 billion with sales in the United States likely to cross $2.7 billion.Share of AbbVie has decreased 3.8% year to date compared to the industry’s decline of 4.4%. AbbVie currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2011,ABBV,"Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission has granted Marketing Authorization to HIV combination therapy Biktarvy (bictegravir 50mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg; BIC/FTC/TAF).Biktarvy is approved as a once-daily single tablet regimen (STR) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults without present or past evidence of viral resistance to the integrase class, emtricitabine or tenofovir.The approval was supported by positive data from four ongoing phase III studies, namely Studies 1489 and 1490 in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults, and Studies 1844 and 1878 in virologically suppressed adults.With this approval, BIC/FTC/TAF becomes Gilead’s third FTC/TAF-based STR approved in the European Union in the past three years. BIC/FTC/TAF met its primary objective at 48 weeks in all four studies.The regimen was earlier approved by the FDA in February 2018. The approval in Europe will further strengthen the company’s HIV franchise.Gilead is a dominant player in the HIV market with an impressive portfolio for the same. HIV is one of the primary areas of focus for Gilead and the company is working to bring new HIV treatments to market to further boost sales of the franchise. The company was the first to bring to market a single-tablet regimen (STR) for the treatment of HIV — Atripla. The TAF-based products, Genvoya, Odefsey and Descovy, are performing well with strong adoption in both the United States and Europe.Biktarvy combines the novel, unboosted integrase strand transfer inhibitor (“INSTI”) bictegravir, with the demonstrated safety and efficacy profile of the Descovy, (FTC/TAF) dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (“NRTI”) backbone, and the smallest INSTI-based triple-therapy STR is produced. The approval of this new HIV therapy will pose stiff competition to GlaxoSmith’s (GSK  -  Free Report) existing therapies, Tivicay and Triumeq.Meanwhile, Gilead is banking on its HIV franchise to drive growth in future, given the persistent decline in HCV sales. Gilead’s stock has gained 0.8% in the last six months as against the industry's decline of 6.8%.Gilead’s HCV franchise is experiencing slowdown across key markets, including the United States and Europe, reflecting lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi as a result of competitive and pricing pressure. The franchise saw a significant plunge in sales, due to new competition and fewer patient starts.Pricing has largely stabilized and market share will stabilize by mid-2018, while patient starts are expected to decline further. We note that Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa face competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Mayret, and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zepatier among others.Meanwhile, Gilead is looking at newer avenues to help its top line, by solidifying its presence in the gene therapy space. The initial uptake of Yescarta is also encouraging. Gilead is also intending to foray into the NASH market with pipeline candidates — selonsertib and filgotinib.Zacks RankGilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2012,ABBV,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) along with its partner Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved the 2 mg dose of Olumiant (baricitinib) for treating moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”). The once-daily oral JAK inhibitor is approved as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate for treating adult patients with inadequate response to tumor necrosis factor (“TNF”) inhibitor therapies.The approval in the United States was not much of a surprise considering that an FDA advisory committee had recommended approval of the lower dose of the drug in April. However, the 4 mg dose of the drug was not approved.Moreover, the drug’s label includes a boxed warning stating risk of serious infections, malignancies and thrombosis.The companies expect to launch the drug by the end of the second quarter. It will be available at a price 60% lower than the leading TNF inhibitors approved for RA, which includes AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel among others.We remind investors that the FDA had issued a Complete Response Letter in April 2017 for the new drug application seeking approval of Olumiant, requesting additional information to determine the most appropriate doses.Olumiant is already approved in Europe and Japan and generated sales of $32.2 million in the first quarter of 2018. The U.S. approval will further boost the sales of the drug.Lilly’s share price has increased 0.5% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 4.4%.The approval was based on data from RA-BEACON study, which evaluated Olumiant in combination with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs versus placebo. Data showed that 49% of the patients treated with Olumiant achieved improvement in the signs and symptoms of RA compared to placebo (27%).The companies will conduct a long-term safety study of Olumiant in RA patients as part of the approval.Following approval in the United States, Incyte is now eligible to receive a milestone payment of $100 million from Lilly, which it expects to record in full in the second quarter of 2018.Olumiant is also being evaluated in a late-stage study for the treatment of atopic dermatitis.Eli Lilly and Company Price  Eli Lilly and Company Price | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteLilly currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2013,ABBV,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved the label expansion of its JAK inhibitor, Xeljanz (tofacitinib), to include a new indication – moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (“UC”). The drug is approved for the treatment of adult patients with recommended a dose of 10 mg twice-daily for at least eight weeks.The approval was expected as the FDA Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee had adopted a positive vote in a meeting in March recommending the approval of the supplemental new drug application (sNDA) filed in July last year seeking label expansion of Xeljanz in UC.Xeljanz is already marketed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and active psoriatic arthritis. In the first quarter of 2018, Xeljanz sales were $326 million, up 30.4% from the year-ago period. The label expansion in the UC indication is likely to boost its sales further.Shares of Pfizer have lost 0.5% so far this year, compared with a 6% decrease for the industry it belongs to.The approval was based on data from three pivotal studies – OCTAVE Induction 1, OCTAVE Induction 2 and OCTAVE Sustain – which demonstrated that statistically significant and greater proportion of patients achieved remission when treated with Xeljanz compared to a placebo.Pfizer is currently evaluating Xeljanz in an open label long-term extension study, OCTAVE Open.However, there are several blockbuster drugs in the inflammatory segment approved for UC, which includes Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Remicade and Simponi, AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Shire’s (SHPG  -  Free Report) Lialda. Moreover, many biotech companies are developing their candidates for the treatment for UC. Hence, competition is likely to increase in this segment.Pfizer Inc. Price  Pfizer Inc. Price | Pfizer Inc.

2014,ABBV,"Shares of AstraZeneca, PLC (AZN  -  Free Report) have risen 4.8% so far this year against the Large-Cap Pharma industry’s decline of 4.9%.Though the drug sector was off to a strong start in 2018, it has struggled thereafter, probably on U.S. market instability and a few negative updates on the pipeline and regulatory front. Only four large-cap drug stocks have risen this year including AstraZeneca, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) and Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report).Factors Driving AstraZeneca StockAstraZeneca announced quite a few positive developments on the regulatory and pipeline front this year, which led shares to outperform the industry.AstraZeneca recorded good progress in Oncology in the first quarter of 2018. Lynparza received EU approval for a broad second-line ovarian cancer indication with the tablet formulation, and for breast cancer in the United States. Tagrisso received the important U.S. approval for first-line EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PD-L1 inhibitor Imfinzi was approved and immediately launched for the second indication in the United States — early stage lung cancer — which drove sales higher in the first quarter.In hematology, moxetumomab submission was accepted by the FDA and granted priority review for an intended indication in third-line hairy cell leukemia. In CVRM, AstraZeneca received EU and U.S. approval for Lokelma to treat hyperkalemia. In Respiratory, biologic medicine, Fasenra was approved in the EU and Japan in January.There were however a few negative pipeline updates. Fasenra did not meet the primary endpoint in the first COPD trial, GALATHEA. The ARCTIC trial of Imfinzi plus tremelimumab in third-line non-small cell lung cancer did not meet the primary endpoint of progression-free-survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Meanwhile, its core products like Nexium, Crestor and Seroquel are facing generic competition, which is hurting sales growth. The diabetes franchise also faces stiff competition while pricing pressure is hurting sales in AstraZeneca’s Respiratory franchise.Nonetheless, AstraZeneca’s newer drugs like Brilinta (cardiovascular), Lynparza (ovarian cancer), Farxiga/Forxiga (type II diabetes) and Tagrisso (lung cancer) are doing well. Brilinta and Farxiga achieved blockbuster status in 2017, exceeding $1 billion in sales. Imfinzi and Fasenra, launched in 2017/early 2018, are off to a strong start given their highly competitive clinical profile. AstraZeneca is also looking for further label expansions for these drugs.Its newer medicines registered sales growth of 66% in the first quarter of 2018. These new drugs should keep contributing to the top line while several launches are underway across each of the therapeutic areas, Oncology, CV metabolism and Respiratory. AstraZeneca is looking to return to growth in 2018 on the back of newer drugs. Meanwhile, cost-cutting initiatives should drive the bottom line.All these positive developments are likely to keep the stock’s momentum alive this year.AstraZeneca currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2016,ABBV,"First-quarter results of pharma bigwigs like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) stole the limelight this week. Other than that, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) gained FDA approval for the second indication of its CAR-T therapy, Kymriah. While AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) submitted a regulatory application in the EU for its psoriasis candidate, risankizumab, Merck’s PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda gained FDA’s Priority Review status for yet another label expansion application.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesMixed Q1 Results for Merck & Pfizer: Both the pharma giants beat estimates for earnings but missed the same for sales. While Pfizer re-affirmed its previously issued guidance for 2018, Merck raised its outlook for both earnings and sales. Both the companies witnessed a relatively weaker top-line performance in the quarter.For Merck, strong sales of Keytruda, Gardasil and Bridion were partially offset by lower sales of other key therapies – RotaTeq, Zepatier and Zostavax. Meanwhile, loss of market exclusivity for several drugs also hurt the top line.While for Pfizer, the top-line was hurt by decline in sales of key drugs like Lyrica, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13, and Enbrel, loss of exclusivity for some products like Viagra and Pristiq and continued supply shortages in legacy Hospira products.Allergan beat estimates for both earnings and revenues in the first quarter of 2018 and raised its 2018 guidance for both earnings and sales.Novartis’ Kymriah Gets FDA Approval for Second Indication: Novartis’ supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) looking to get its CAR-T therapy Kymriah approved for the second indication was granted approval by the FDA. With the latest approval, Kymriah suspension has been approved for intravenous infusion for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), high grade B-cell lymphoma and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma.Kymriah was the first CAR-T therapy to obtain FDA approval in August 2017 for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor ALL that is refractory or in second or later relapse.Separately, Novartis announced that the FDA has given a complete response letter to its BLA for its proposed biosimilar version of Roche’s cancer drug, Rituxan.Merck’s Keytruda in News: Merck’s supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) looking to get overall survival data from the phase III KEYNOTE-189 study included on the label of the PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda was granted priority review by the FDA. The FDA will give its decision on Sep 23, 2018.The study evaluated Keytruda, in combination with Lilly’s Alimta (pemetrexed) and platinum chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin) for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression. The combination treatment improved overall survival regardless of PD-L1 expression including in patients whose tumors tested negative for PD-L1.Notably, in May 2017, this combination therapy was granted an accelerated approval by the FDA for the aforementioned indication. The approval was based on tumor response rate and PFS data from the KEYNOTE-021 study. Hence, the positive readouts from the KEYNOTE-189 confirmatory study will help the company gain continued approval for the combo therapy, which should support uptake and sales.Merck also announced interim data from another pivotal lung cancer study on Keytruda, which met a pre-specified secondary endpoint of overall response rate (ORR) in an early cohort of participants. The phase 3 KEYNOTE-407 study evaluated Keytruda in combination with carboplatin-paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel for the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC.AbbVie Submits Application for Psoriasis Candidate in EU: AbbVie submitted a marketing application to the European regulatory authorities for investigational interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibitor, risankizumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) is supported by data from four pivotal phase III studies. Data from these studies have shown that more than half of the patients receiving risankizumab achieved complete skin clearance at one year.Meanwhile, AbbVie also announced commencement of a self-tender offer for up to $7.5 billion of its common stock at a price not less than $99.00 per share and not more than $114.00 per share.United Therapeutics to Acquire SteadyMed: United Therapeutics Corporation (UTHR  -  Free Report) announced a definitive merger agreement with SteadyMed Ltd. per which United Therapeutics will acquire the latter for $216 million including contingent payments. With the deal, United Therapeutics will add SteadyMed’s drug device pipeline product, Trevyent for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) patients to its portfolio. The product could have posed competition to United Therapeutics’ RemoSynch implantable pump, which is under review in the United States.Trevyent is a single-use, pre-filled pump that has been developed by SteadyMed to deliver a two-day supply of treprostinil subcutaneously using SteadyMed’s PatchPump technology to treat PAH. Though SteadyMed received a refuse-to-file letter from the FDA for want of further information, SteadyMed intends to resubmit its NDA by the end of 2018.Allergan’s Ubrogepant Succeeds in 2nd Phase III Study: Allergan announced that the second of two pivotal phase III studies evaluating its oral anti-CGRP acute migraine treatment ubrogepant met its co-primary endpoints. The phase III data showed ubrogepant displaying strong efficacy and a clean side effect profile.The ACHIEVE II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of orally administered ubrogepant (25 mg and 50 mg) for treating a single migraine attack of moderate-to-severe headache intensity.The study data demonstrated that a “significant greater percentage of patients” treated with ubrogepant, at both the doses, were free from pain at two hours after the initial dose as compared to those treated with placebo. Also, a statistically significant greater percentage of ubrogepant patients taking the 50 mg dose experienced absence of the “most bothersome migraine-associated symptom” -- either photophobia, phonophobia or nausea -- at two hours after the initial dose compared to those treated with placebo. However, the 25 mg dose failed to demonstrate statistical significance in this endpoint.J&J Seeks Label Expansion of PAH Drug: J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Actelion submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA seeking approval for a label expansion of its PAH drug, Opsumit (macitentan) to include treatment of patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH).Also, J&J announced a definitive agreement to acquire private biotech, BeneVir Biopharm.

2017,ABBV,"Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) reported dismal results for the first quarter of 2018 wherein both earnings and revenues missed expectations due to a wider-than-expected decline in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) franchise.Consequently, the stock declined in after-market hours trading and is expected to open in the red given the expectation of a further decline in HCV franchise in 2018.  Gilead’s stock has lost 1.7% in the last one month as against the industry's  gain of 0.4%.  The company’s first-quarter earnings of $1.48 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.66. Earnings were also below the year-ago quarter figure of $2.23 per share. Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Gilead Sciences, Inc. Quote Moreover, total revenues of $5.1 billion also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.42 billion. Further, revenues declined 21.8% year over year.Harvoni & Sovaldi Plunge FurtherProduct sales came in at $5.0 billion, down 21.6% year over year due to accelerated decline in HCV sales.Antiviral product sales, which include Gilead's HIV and liver disease portfolio, came in at $4.4 billion in the quarter, down 24.1% from the year-ago quarter.Research & development (R&D) expenses declined 8.4% to $814 million. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 9.5% to $884 million.HCV product sales, which include Harvoni, Sovaldi, Epclusa and Vosevi, were $1.0 billion, down from $2.6 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside was mainly due to lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi across all major markets and lower sales of Epclusa in the United States as a result of increased competition.Sales of Harvoni plunged 74.7% year over year to $348 million in the quarter.  Epclusa garnered sales of $536 million in the quarter, down from the year-ago period figure of $892 million.Meanwhile, HIV and HBV product sales came in at $3.3 billion, up 1.9% year over year. The increase was primarily driven by continuous strong uptake of tenofoviral afenamide (TAF)-based products such as Genvoya, which generated sales of $1,082 million, up from $769 million in the year-ago quarter, Descovy, which recorded sales of $361 million, up from $251 million, and Odefsey, which registered sales of $342 million, up from $227 million. Entry of generics and greater U.S. inventory drawdown than in the prior-year quarter somewhat impacted sales. However, HIV treatments like Stribild and Complera/Eviplera sales declined 43.7% and 24.9% respectively. Viread sales were down at $97 million, down 62.7%.Atripla sales tanked 30.5% to $314 million, while Truvada sales fell 8.7% to $652 million.Other products like Letairis, Ranexa, AmBisome and Zydelig recorded sales of $204 million (down 3.3%), $195 million (up 27.4%), $107 million (up 16.3%) and $33 million, respectively. Adjusted product gross margin was 86.3% compared to 88.3% in the year-ago period.2018 Guidance ReiteratedGilead continues to expect net product sales in the range of $20-$21 billion. Adjusted R&D expenses and adjusted SG&A expenses are projected in the range of $3.4-$3.6 billion and $3.4-$3.6 billion, respectively. Adjusted product gross margin is expected in the range of 85-87%.AcquisitionsThe company acquired Kite Pharma in 2017. The FDA approval for Yescarta, a CAR-T therapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy should Gilead’s prospects. The company also acquired Cell Design Labs to expand further in the CAR-T space.Yescarta sales came in at $40 million in the quarter.Dividend and Share RepurchaseGilead declared a cash dividend of 57 cents per share of common stock for second-quarter 2018. The dividend is payable on Jun 28 to stockholders of record at the close of business on Jun 15. During the quarter, the company paid cash dividends of $253 million and repurchased shares for $1.0 billion.Our TakeGilead’s first-quarter results were disappointing with the company’s both earnings and sales missing estimates as the magnitude of the decline in HCV sales was wider-than-expected. The HCV franchise is under tremendous pressure due to lower patient starts and increasing competition.We expect sales to decline further going forward.  We note that Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa, face competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR, and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zepatier.While pricing has largely stabilized, market share will stabilize by mid-2018 while patient starts are expected to decline further.Meanwhile, the HIV franchise maintains momentum driven by the rapid adoption of Descovy-based regimens.  The approval of Biktarvy in Feb 2018 by the FDA has further widened the portfolio. Biktarvy sales came in at $35 million in the quarter. In March, Biktarvy was added to the U.S. DHHS guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents living with HIV as one of the recommended initial regimens. The CHMP has also adopted a positive opinion on the Marketing Authorization Application for Biktarvy in the EU and Gilead expects to obtain approval for the same in the third quarter which will further solidify its portfolio. Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting continued to maintain momentum with an estimated 167,000 patients using Truvada by the end of the first quarter.Given the persistent decline in HCV sales, the company is looking to newer avenues to help its top-line. Gilead is looking to solidify its presence in the gene therapy space. The initial uptake of Yescarta is also encouraging. During the first quarter, Gilead announced an agreement with Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. (SGMO  -  Free Report) to use Sangamo’s zinc finger nuclease technology platform for the development of next-generation ex vivo cell therapies in oncology. Gilead is also intending to foray into the NASH market with pipeline candidates- selonsertib and filgotinib. Both the candidates are being evaluated in late stage studies and a tentative approval will diversify Gilead’s portfolio.Zacks RankGilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2018,ABBV,"Per the latest Earnings Preview, the Q1 earnings season which has already crossed the half way mark is gaining strength with earnings and revenue growth on track to reach its highest level in seven years.Total earnings for the 267 S&P 500 members that have already reported results are up 25.1% from the same period last year on 10% higher revenues, with 76.8% beating top-line estimates and 73.8% beating revenue estimates.

(AMGN  -  Free Report) also surpassed both earnings and revenue expectations this quarter.Higher demand is expected to boost new product sales. Also, innovation and successful product line expansion along with positive clinical study results, FDA approvals, and consistent performance of key products, growing demand for drugs, especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an ageing population as well as an increased healthcare expenditure are some of the factors that are expected keep the sector on a growth trajectory.Also, according to the Earnings Preview, the broader Medical sector (inclusive of drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is likely to record 7% year-over-year growth in revenues and witness a 12.9% rise in earnings in the quarter under review.Four pharma/biotech giants are scheduled to report Q1 earnings results on May 1.

The company’s performance has been impressive in the recent past with its earnings surpassing expectations in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 4.97%.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.  The combination of the company’s Zacks Rank #2 and +1.36 Earnings ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s earnings for the quarter under review is pegged at 74 cents per share.In the Innovative Health segment, new products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain), Chantix (smoking cessation) and Eliquis (blood thinner) are expected to drive the top line. In the Essential Health, biosimilars and emerging markets are expected to support sales.

We expect the trend to continue in the first quarter as well. The franchise received a further boost with the FDA approval of once-daily single tablet regimen (“STR”), Biktarvy (bictegravir 50mg/emtricitabine 200mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25mg, BIC/FTC/TAF) for HIV-1 infection in February 2018.

2019,ABBV,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 5.9% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is ABBV due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.AbbVie Tops Q1 Earnings & Revenue Estimates, Ups 2018 GuidanceAbbVie reported better-than-expected earnings and sales for the first quarter of 2018. Importantly, it raised its earnings expectations for 2018 based on strong Q1 performance and an optimistic outlook for future quarters.AbbVie reported first-quarter 2018 earnings of $1.87 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.80 by 3.9% and ahead of the guided range of $1.77 and $1.79. Earnings grew 46.1% year over year. Strong sales performance and higher operating profits led to the bottom-line beat.Revenues of $7.9 billion in the reported quarter marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.7 billion. Sales increased 21.4% year over year. Excluding a 3.8% favorable impact from foreign exchange rate fluctuations, operational revenues rose 17.6% backed by continued strong performances by Humira and Imbruvica and solid uptake of new HCV medicine, Mavyret. Operational revenue growth was in line with management expectations of growth in a mid-teen range. Currency tailwinds of 3.8% were also better than 3% expected by the company.Quarter in DetailsHumira recorded sales growth of 14.4% (10.7% on an operational basis) with revenues coming in at $4.7 billion, reflecting continued strong demand trends.Sales in the United States increased 11.4% to $3 billion driven by strong prescription volume growth across all three major market categories. Humira sales in the ex-U.S. market were up 9.3% on an operational basis and 20% on a reported basis to $1.71 billion driven primarily by market growth across indications.Humira holds the leading market position as a front-line therapy in all three major market categories despite stiffer competition from new classes of drugs as well as an indirect biosimilar competition in the international marketsHowever, on the call, AbbVie said that retail specialty pharmacy destocking hurt sales of Humira somewhat in the quarter.In 2018, Humira sales in the United States are expected to be approximately $13.7 billion, which is lower than the prior expectation of $14.0 billion-$14.1 billion. Humira U.S. sales expectations were softer than the previous outlook due to the impact of a retail specialty pharmacy destocking in the first quarter and a conservative stance on co-pay costs associated with co-pay accumulator programs.Internationally, Humira sales are expected to approach $6.4 billion, up from $6.2 billion previously, which includes the expected impact of biosimilar entrants in Europe in the fourth quarter.First-quarter net revenues from Imbruvica were $762 million, up 38.5% year over year. This included U.S. sales of $624 million, up 36.7%, and $138 million (up 47.2%) of international profit sharing with Johnson & Johnson.Continued uptake in the front-line CLL market and steady gains across other indications led to the strong performance of Imbruvica.In 2018, Imbruvica global revenues are expected to exceed $3.3 billion with sales in the United States likely to cross $2.7 billion.Other products that performed well include Lupron ($219 million, up 13.3% year over year) Duodopa ($103 million, up 28.9% year over year) and Creon ($209 million, up 13%).Despite competitive dynamics in the HCV market, AbbVie HCV sales, including Viekira and Mavyret, were $919 million in the quarter, up 80.2% on a sequential basis. Mavyret alone accounted for nearly $850 million in the quarter driven by better-than-expected launch uptake in the United States and international markets. Mavyret commands a market share of 45% in the United States with less than a year on the market. The medicine has also established a strong position in other major countries as well, such as Japan, Germany, Spain, and Italy. Viekira sales declined in the quarter.In 2018, global HCV sales are expected to be approximately $3.5 billion, higher than $2.5 billion expected previously.Adjusted gross margin rose 30 bps to 80.2% in the quarter. Adjusted SG&A expenses increased 21.4% to $1.67 billion. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses rose 20 bps to 21.0% in the quarter, reflecting new product launch costs. R&D expenses escalated 7.2% to $1.19 billion in the quarter due to greater investments in the pipeline. Adjusted operating margin was 44.1% of sales in the reported quarter, up 200 bps year over year.2018 OutlookAbbVie raised its adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $7.66-$7.76 for 2018 compared with $7.33-$7.43 predicted earlier. A strong first-quarter performance coupled with an optimistic outlook for stronger underlying business performance through the rest of the year and the benefit from the planned share buybacks through the ‘Dutch’ tender offer propelled the increase in earnings guidance. The earnings guidance reflects a year-over-year surge of 38% at the mid-point versus 32% previously.Revenues are expected to approach $32.6 billion, up from the previous expectation of $32 billion. Currency impact is expected to benefit revenues by 2% in 2018 compared with 1.5% expected previously.While R&D expense is expected to be slightly more than 16% of revised sales outlook, SG&A is expected to be about 20.5% of sales. Operating margin is expected to be above 43.5%, roughly 100 basis points above 2017 levels. Previously, AbbVie expected operating margin to be approximately 44% of sales. AbbVie decreased the projected 2018 operating margin expectations as it plans to increase investments in upcoming product launches.Adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 9% in 2018. The normalized tax rate expectation over the next five years is 13%.Second-Quarter 2018 OutlookSecond-quarter earnings are expected between $1.94 and $1.96. Revenues are estimated to grow approximately 15% on an operational basis. Foreign exchange is expected to have approximately 3% favorable impact on sales in the second quarter.U.S. Humira sales are expected to grow at approximately 10% year over year. Internationally, sales are expected to be approximately $1.6 billion. Imbruvica U.S. sales are expected to be approximately $700 million. Global HCV sales are expected to be approximately $950 million with approximately 40% of those sales coming from U.S. sales.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been six revisions higher for the current quarter.AbbVie Inc. Price and Consensus  AbbVie Inc. Price and Consensus | AbbVie Inc.

2020,ABBV,"AbbVie ((ABBV  -  Free Report) announced top-line results from the phase III iLLUMINATE (PCYC-1130) study that met its primary endpoint of improvement in progression-free survival (PFS). The study evaluated cancer drug Imbruvica (ibrutinib) in combination with Gazyva (obinutuzumab) in previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) patients compared to chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab.Year to date, shares of AbbVie have increased 6.6% against the industry’s decline of 4.4%.Imbruvica is jointly developed and marketed by AbbVie’s subsidiary Pharmacyclics LLC and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Janssen Biotech. It is currently approved in the United States for treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), who have received at least one therapy earlier and for CLL patients with deletion 17p. It is also approved in the European Union for treatment of MCL. Significantly, in January 2017, Imbruvica was approved for patients with marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), requiring a systemic therapy and having received at least one prior anti-CD20 based therapy.The iLLUMINATE study met its primary endpoint for a clinically and statistically significant difference in PFS for patients treated with Imbruvica plus obinutuzumab versus those who received chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab, as assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC).Pharmacyclics and Janssen are sharing the primary analysis data from the study with regulatory authorities and plan to present the data in a future publication or medical congress. Based on the data and if approved by the FDA, Imbruvica plus obinutuzumab could be the first chemotherapy-free CD20 combination in first-line CLL treatment.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAbbVie has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the same space are Illumina, Inc.

2021,ABBV,"Biotech bigwig Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) develops drugs for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (“HIV”), liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) infection and chronic hepatitis B virus (“HBV”) infection, cardiovascular, hematology/oncology and inflammation/respiratory diseases.The HCV franchise boasts drugs like Sovaldi and Harvoni and the recently launched Epclusa. However, the HCV franchise continues to grapple with competitive and pricing pressure leading to a massive decline in Harvoni and Sovaldi sales. Harvoni and Sovaldi have been facing competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Merck‘s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zepatier, among others.Gilead is a dominant player in the HIV market with an impressive portfolio for the same. The company was the first to bring to market a single-tablet regimen (“STR”) for the treatment of HIV — Atripla. STRs for HIV in the market include Complera/Eviplera and Stribild among others.The newly launched tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)-based products Genvoya, Odefsey and Descovy are performing well with strong adoption in both the United States and Europe. Genvoya has already become the most-prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients since its launch in November 2015.Also, Genvoya has been listed as a preferred regimen in several HIV treatment guidelines. The TAF-based regimens now represent 62% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and the launches of Odefsey and Descovy in 2016. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Genvoya is $1074 million.Truvada, for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting, also put up a strong performance. The company saw a significant uptick in PrEP usage in 2017 with approximately 153,000 patients using Truvada by the end of 2017.  We note that HIV is one of the primary areas of focus for Gilead and the company is working to bring new HIV treatments to market to further boost sales of the franchise.The company received a major boost when the FDA approved the company’s once-daily STR, Biktarvy (bictegravir 50mg/emtricitabine 200mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25mg, BIC/FTC/TAF) for HIV-1 infection. The approval provides a major boost to Gilead’s HIV franchise.Biktarvy combines the novel, unboosted integrase strand transfer inhibitor (“INSTI”) bictegravir, with the demonstrated safety and efficacy profile of the Descovy, (FTC/TAF) dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (“NRTI”) backbone and is the smallest INSTI-based triple-therapy STR available. The approval of this new HIV therapy will pose stiff competition to GlaxoSmith’s (GSK  -  Free Report) existing therapies, Tivicay and Triumeq.Gilead’s stock has returned 10.9% in the last twelve months compared with the industry's  loss of 8.9%. Gilead has a decent track record, with the company’s earnings beating estimates in three of the last four while missing in one. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings beat expectations by 4.7%. Overall, the company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 7.5%. We expect the strength in the HIV franchise to offset the HCV franchise weakness making it highly likely for the company to beat on earnings in the first quarter.

2022,ABBV,"DaVita Inc.’s (DVA  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 results are scheduled to release on May 3, after the market closes. DaVita’s Dialysis and related lab services business segment has been a consistent driver of revenues for the company. Surging acquisition of dialysis centers also adds to the positives.Notably, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the company reported adjusted operating earnings of 92 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 91 cents. However, earnings declined 6.1% on a year-over-year basis.Meanwhile, revenues in the last reported quarter increased 3% year over year to $2.78 billion but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.89 billion.For the quarter under review, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.96 billion, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 20%. The same for earnings per share is projected at 92 cents, indicating year-over-year growth of 16.5%. The company delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 3.5% in the trailing four quarters.DaVita Inc. Price and EPS Surprise DaVita Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | DaVita Inc. QuoteLet’s delve into other factors that are likely to impact DaVita’s first-quarter 2018 results.Kidney Care Business & Dialysis Centers to Drive Q1DaVita Medical Group & Kidney Care, also known as DMG, provides integrated care management as an operating division of the company and focuses on delivering healthcare through a broad range of services.In 2017, Kidney Care business witnessed several prospects. Adjusted operating income in the segment was $1.616 billion, up from the adjusted guidance of $1.57-$1.6 billion in 2017. Lately, the company, in collaboration with Texas-based Methodist Specialty and Transplant Hospital, announced the launch of the Transplant Waitlist Support Program. The aim is to help keep waitlisted patients transplant-ready by deploying a technology-enabled solution.Developments like these are likely to help DaVita in registering solid quarterly results.In fourth-quarter 2017, DaVita acquired nine dialysis centers, opened 36 new centers and closed four in the United States. DaVita also acquired six dialysis centers, opened two centers and closed one center outside the United States. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the number of dialysis centers in the current quarter is pegged at 2.686, down 2.2% sequentially.Other Factors at PlayGuidanceFor 2018, the company projects Kidney Care consolidated operating income in the range of $1.5-$1.6 billion. Operating cash flow from continuing operations is estimated in the band of $1.4-$1.6 billion.The effective tax rate is expected in the range of 26.5-27.5%.A solid guidance such as this raises optimism in the company’s upcoming quarterly results.ReimbursementsCalcimimetics, a drug used to treat mineral bone disease, just moved into dialysis reimbursement with introduction of an injectable drug called Presibib.Though it is early to understand the full picture, the management is optimistic about its probable contributions to the quarterly results.Acquisition PerilsWith surging labor cost inflation, DaVita is likely to witness solid margin pressure in the traditional Medicare fee-for-service business.The series of acquisitions of dialysis centers by DaVita may affect operations, debt-to-capital ratio, capital expenditures or other aspects of the business.Further, joint ventures and minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational and compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment.Our ModelOur quantitative model predicts an earnings beat for DaVIta in the upcoming quarterly results.This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.

2023,ABBV,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) has one of the most diverse revenue streams in the industry within the pharmaceutical division, which accounts for almost half of its revenues. The company has several multi-million dollar drugs covering a broad range of areas such as neuroscience, cardiovascular and metabolism; immunology, oncology, pulmonary hypertension,, and infectious diseases/vaccines. However, like many of its peers, J&J is facing generic competition and pricing pressure for some of the products in its pharmaceutical segment.J&J’s stock has depreciated 8.5% this year so far, comparing unfavorably with a decline of 2.4% recorded by the industry.J&J’s Pharma segment sales picked up from the second half of 2017 after being soft in the first half of 2017. We are likely to see the positive impact of the trend in second-quarter results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the J&J’s Pharma segment sales is $9.93 billion.We believe that new products, continued share gains of some key products, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica, Xarelto, Stelara and Darzalex and meaningful contribution from acquisitions will support the top line.Continued share gains will drive sales of Imbruvica (cancer indications), Xarelto (blood thinner), Zytiga (prostate cancer) and Stelara (psoriasis). Please note that J&J markets Imbruvica in partnership with AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report). The Zacks Consensus Estimates for total Imbruvica sales is $608 million.Strong adoption witnessed for the newer indication of Crohn's disease will continue to contribute to Stelara growth. Zytiga was approved in the first-line setting in February, which contributed to the strong performance of the drug in the first quarter, a trend we expect will continue in the second quarter. Also, strong adoption in outside U.S. markets and accelerated adoption in the United States across all lines of therapy are likely to drive sales of Darzalex. Importantly, Darzalex was approved in the first-line setting this May, which can add significantly to sales in the second quarter.These positives will offset the loss of sales of some drugs like Invokana due to higher managed care discounting and market share decline due to competitive pressure. Meanwhile, biosimilar competition is expected to hurt sales of key arthritis drug, Remicade outside the United States. Please note that J&J markets Remicade in partnership with Merck (MRK  -  Free Report). The Zacks Consensus Estimates for total Remicade sales is $1.33 billion.We note that some inventory build and seasonality issues hurt sales of Xarelto in the first quarter. It remains to be seen if the issues persist in the second quarter as well.Regarding newly launched Tremfya, J&J said on the first quarter conference call that the uptake of the product has been strong. The drug recorded sales of $72 million in the first quarter, which is expected to be higher in the to-be reported quarter. Meanwhile, we expect J&J to discuss initial sales numbers for Erleada, its newly approved next-generation oral androgen receptor (“AR”) inhibitor for prostate cancer on the second-quarter conference call.Overall, in the second quarter, sales in the Pharmaceutical segment are expected to remain strong while the Consumer and Medical Device segments will continue to improve (Read more: J&J to Set Pharma Q2 Earnings in Motion: What’s Up?)J&J currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2024,ABBV,"The biggest news this week was Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) announcement of its plans to re-organize its business into three new segments, effective next year. J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report) was ordered by a St Louis jury to pay approximately $4.7 billion to nearly two dozen women in a lawsuit related to its talc-based products. Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) provided updates on their cancer drugs.Pfizer to Re-Organize Business Units: Pfizer is re-organizing its business into three business segments, separating its consumer healthcare business into a standalone unit. Beginning 2019, Pfizer will report under three new business units — Innovative Medicines, Established Medicines and Consumer Healthcare. Presently, Pfizer has two reporting segments namely Innovative Health and Essential Health.The present Innovative Health unit will be called the Innovative Medicines unit and will now include biosimilars and a new hospital business unit for anti-infectives and sterile injectables — both of which are presently reported under Essential Health. The Essential Health unit will now be renamed to Established Medicines. This unit will include Pfizer’s legacy brands that have lost or will lose market exclusivity. (Read more: Pfizer to Reorganize Business Into Three New Units)J&J to Pay $4.7 Billion in Talc Lawsuit: J&J was ordered by a jury in a St. Louis court to pay $4.69 billion in damages to 22 women who alleged that its talc-based products, including its baby powders, contained asbestos, which caused them to develop ovarian cancer. The damages comprised $550 million in compensatory damages and $4.14 billion in punitive damages. J&J, in an official statement, said the verdict was unfair and it would appeal against it. It also said its talc products neither contained asbestos nor caused cancer. J&J faces more than 9,000 cases for its talc products. Trump Slams Pfizer for Price Hikes; Pfizer Defers Increases: In a tweet, President Donald Trump slammed Pfizer for raising prices of several of its prescription drugs, effective from Jul 1. Trump said Pfizer and other U.S. drugmakers should be “ashamed” that they had raised drug prices for “no reason.” The tweet also said that by raising drug prices in the United States, these drug companies were offering “bargain basement prices” overseas. He warned that the administration will respond. A day after this tweet was published, Pfizer issued a statement saying it will defer the price increases until the President’s drug pricing blueprint goes into effect or until the end of the year, whichever is earlier. AbbVie’s Imbruvica Lymphoma Study Fails: AbbVie announced that a late-stage study evaluating its cancer drug Imbruvica for the first-line treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) failed to meet the primary endpoint.The study evaluated the addition of Imbruvica to R-CHOP (combination of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone), which is the existing standard of care for DLBCL, an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) versus R-CHOP plus placebo. However, the study data showed that adding Imbruvica to R-CHOP did not improve event-free survival (EFS) in the targeted patient population. Imbruvica is presently FDA approved for eight indications including five B-cell blood cancers, as well as in chronic graft-versus-host-disease. The drug, which AbbVie markets in partnership with J&J, recorded sales of $762 million in the first quarter of 2018. This included U.S. sales of $624 million, up 36.7%, and $138 million (up 47.2%) of international profit sharing with J&J.AbbVie also filed a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) to the FDA for a label expansion of Venclexta (venetoclax) for the first-line treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  AbbVie is looking to get Venclexta approved in combination with a hypomethylating agent (“HMA”) or with low-dose cytarabine (“LDAC”) in AML patients who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. (Read more: AbbVie's Imbruvica Fails in Phase III Blood Cancer Study)Merck’s Keytruda sBLA Gets Priority Review: Merck’s supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) looking to expand the label of Keytruda for previously treated patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer, was granted priority review by the FDA. The FDA’s decision is expected on Nov 9. The sBLA filing was based on data from the phase II KEYNOTE-224 study.

2025,ABBV,"Investors in AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the May 25, 2018 $83 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for AbbVie shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, AbbVie is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry that ranks in the Top 36% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, six analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while no analyst has dropped its estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.87 per share to $1.97 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about AbbVie right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

2026,ABBV,"Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved the inclusion of additional data on the label of its psoriasis injection, Taltz. With the latest approval, Taltz label will now include data for psoriasis involving the genital area, which impacts roughly 63% of psoriasis patients over the course of their disease.Taltz is already marketed for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy as well as for active psoriatic arthritis. Taltz works by specifically targeting IL-17A, a protein that plays a role in driving underlying inflammation in psoriasis.The drug recorded sales of $146.5 million in the first quarter of 2018. The label expansion will expand the eligible patient population of the drug, which should drive sales going forward.The approval for genital psoriasis was based on data from a study evaluating patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis involving the genital area. In the study, Taltz demonstrated a significant improvement compared to placebo at 12 weeks in the severity of psoriasis affecting the genital area, overall psoriasis, genital itch and the impact of genital psoriasis on sexual activity in such patients.Though many other drugs like Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Cosentyx, J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Tremfya and AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira are approved to treat plaque psoriasis, Lilly claims Taltz is now the first and only FDA approved treatment for genital psoriasisTaltz is also being studied in a late-stage study for axial spondyloarthritis.Year to date, Lilly’s shares have declined 2.6% compared with the industry’s decline of 3.8%. Lilly currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2027,ABBV,"Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced full results from the phase III study, HAVEN 3, evaluating haemophilia A drug Hemlibra (emicizumab).The randomized multicenter, open-label, phase III study evaluated the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of Hemlibra prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis (episodic/on-demand factor VIII treatment) in patients with hemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors.  The trial results show that Hemlibra reduced treated bleeds by 96% compared to no prophylaxis in HAVEN 3 study in haemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors. Moreover, in a subset of patients included in the study, who previously received factor VIII prophylaxis, which is the standard of care, Hemlibra reduced bleeds by 68% compared to their prior therapy.Almost 55.6% of patients treated with Hemlibra every week and 60% of patients treated with Hemlibra every two weeks experienced zero treated bleeds, compared to none of patients treated with no prophylaxis.Additionally, results from another phase III study, HAVEN 4, showed Hemlibra administered every four weeks provides clinically meaningful control of bleeding in people with or without factor VIII inhibitors.We remind investors that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Hemlibra in April 2018 for patients with hemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors, based on data from the HAVEN 3 study. The drug is already approved by the FDA for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adults and children with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors.Hemlibra was also approved by the European Commission in February 2018 for routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in people with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors.Roche’s hematology portfolio includes approved drugs like MabThera/Rituxan, Gazyva/Gazyvaro, Tecentriq and Venclexta.We note that Roche is developing Venclexta in collaboration with AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report). Both companies are jointly commercializing the drug in the United States. AbbVie is commercializing the drug outside the United States as well.Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche as its legacy drugs like Herceptin, MabThera are facing competition from biosimilars.Roche’s stock has lost 7.3% in the last six months compared with industry’s gain of 0.5%. Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan/ MabThera in Europe. Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) has also obtained FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Avastin for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer.Zacks RankRoche currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2028,ABBV,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation’s (ABC  -  Free Report) second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, scheduled for release on May 2, are expected to show steady growth in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, a significant contributor to revenues.In the last reported quarter, the company posted adjusted earnings of $1.55 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.35 and improving 14% year over year. The upside was attributed to strong growth in the company’s Pharmaceutical Distribution Segment and World Courier business. Revenues improved almost 6% to $40.47 billion in the previous quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.37 billion.For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $40.49 billion, reflecting a rise of 9% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.83, indicating an increase of 3.4% year over year.Let’s dig deeper to analyze how things are shaping up before the earnings announcements.Pharmaceutical Distribution to Boost Q2 ResultsPharmaceutical Distribution accounted for 96.2% of total revenues in the last quarter. Revenues in the segment were $38.94 billion, up 5.8% on a year-over-year basis. Operating income was $388.2 million, up 2.4% year over year.For the upcoming quarterly results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Pharmaceutical Distribution segment is pegged at $38.88 billion. The figure reflects an increase of 9.5% from the year-ago figure.Strong organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, improving patient access to medical care, improved economic conditions and population demographics, introduction of new innovative drugs like hepatitis C drugs along with a consistent good brand-pricing environment should drive growth for AmerisourceBergen in the quarter to be reported.AmerisourceBergen Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  AmerisourceBergen Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | AmerisourceBergen Corporation QuoteMoreover, the company’s focus on specialty drugs bodes well. Per the IMS, pharmaceutical sales are estimated to grow approximately 7.1% annually over a five-year period through 2020, courtesy of strong demand, favorable pricing and new product introductions.The deals signed by AmerisourceBergen look encouraging, which are likely to boost the top line. The company entered into a strategic agreement with Walgreen Boots Alliance. The deal includes a 10-year pharmaceutical distribution contract, under which the company will distribute branded and generic pharmaceutical products to Walgreens.However, the segment is likely to be affected by lower-than-expected production at PharMEDium's Memphis 503B outsourcing facility. Notably, operations in the facility were voluntarily suspended by the company in the last quarter following a few inspections by the FDA.Other Factors to ConsiderGenerics & Product Launches to Drive Growth: We believe that AmerisourceBergen will benefit from generics growth in the long run. In the last quarter, AmerisourceBergen marked its 16th consecutive quarter with 10% or greater revenue growth in the business. Management confirmed that its strategic and focused effort is driving generic product volume growth to offset historic deflation rates.However, it's important to highlight that AmerisourceBergen will have about a 25% increase in quarterly interest expense beginning from the second quarter.Operational Efficiencies: The recent U.S. tax legislation has enhanced AmerisourceBergen’s ability to invest in business, innovate and deliver value to its shareholders. Over the long term, this enables AmerisourceBergen to boost its U.S. business.Recently, the company made strategic investments in IT systems to realize greater operational efficiency and increase operating leverage. This is likely to boost the company's results in the second quarter.In fact, AmerisourceBergen also announced its plans to roll out eight new IT systems and a new e-commerce platform at MWI. These should enhance the company’s results in the quarter to be reported.Guidance: Based upon the expectations from the recently legislated U.S. tax reform, AmerisourceBergen raised guidance for fiscal 2018. Notably, AmerisourceBergen’s strong guidance for fiscal 2018 indicates that the company expects to deliver solid results from the second quarter itself.The company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.45-$6.65, up from the previously range of $5.90-$6.15. Revenue growth for fiscal 2018 is expected in the range of 8-11%, up from the previous band of 7-9%.PharMEDium Slows Down: Recently, AmerisourceBergen received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Tennessee for documents about its lab testing of a certain type of syringe made at its PharMEDium lab in Memphis, which is the company’s largest highly automated production facility. As a result of the subpoena, AmerisorceBergen suspended operations and recalled all of the products that had yet to expire. In fact, the FDA also visited this facility for the same reason. Sluggishness in this unit is likely to hamper the company’s specialty distribution segment in the quarter to be reported.In the last reported quarter, the segment's results were negatively impacted by PharMEDium, wherein the company had lower-than-expected revenues and profit contribution.Per management, because of the time and certain ongoing incremental expenses required to perform remedial measures, PharMEDium's contribution to adjusted EBIT and EPS in the second quarter will be lower than anticipated.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show an earnings beat for AmerisourceBergen in the second quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: AmerisourceBergen has an Earnings ESP of -1.55%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: AmerisourceBergen carries a Zacks Rank #3.Here are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Cooper Companies, Inc.

2029,ABBV,"AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced that a combination regimen of its blockbuster cancer drug, Imbruvica (ibrutinib), failed in a phase III study – DBL3001 – evaluating it as first-line treatment for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”). The drug failed to improve event-free survival (“EFS”) compared to current standard of care.DLBCL is an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”), a type of blood cancer, for which no new therapy has been approved for over a decade for treatment-naive patients. The R-CHOP (combination of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) chemotherapy is the standard of care for these patients.Shares of AbbVie slid 3.9% on Jul 11 following the news. The company’s shares have decreased 1.8% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 2.5%.The phase III study, which was conducted in collaboration with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), evaluated Imbruvica in combination with R-CHOP versus R-CHOP and placebo together. The primary endpoint of the study was superiority in EFS. The combination regimen was investigated for the treatment of DLBCL patients who have non-germinal center B cell (“GCB”) or activated B-cell (“ABC”) subtypes. Patients with these two subtypes commonly have poorer treatment outcomes with greater unmet medical need.However, data from the study demonstrated improvement in a certain patient sub-population, which was clinically meaningful and may be analyzed further.The company will present detailed analysis of the study at a future scientific conference and publish it in a peer-reviewed medical journal.In a separate press release, AbbVie and its partner Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced the submission of a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for label expansion of leukemia drug, Venclexta (venetoclax). The sNDA is seeking approval of Venclexta in combination with a hypomethylating agent (“HMA”) or with low-dose cytarabine (“LDAC”) for treating newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.The sNDA was filed based on data from two separate early stage studies evaluating Venclexta in combination with MHA and with LDAC.Venclexta’s label was expanded last month as monotherapy or in combination with Roche/Biogen’s (BIIB  -  Free Report) Rituxan for the treatment of relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma in second or later line settings.AbbVie Inc.

2030,ABBV,"We expect Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), a healthcare bellwether, to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 17, before market open. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.49%.J&J’s performance has been pretty impressive, with the company exceeding earnings expectations in all the trailing four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 2.86%Johnson & Johnson Price and EPS Surprise   Johnson & Johnson Price and EPS Surprise | Johnson & Johnson QuoteThe stock has depreciated 9.6% this year so far, which compares unfavorably with a decline of 1.3% recorded by the industry. Factors to ConsiderJ&J’s sales improved in the first quarter of 2018. This is because the Pharmaceutical segment continued the positive momentum seen in the second half of 2017 and Consumer segment sales improved. The positive sales trend is expected to continue in the second quarter. In fact, J&J is quite confident that its Pharma segment will continue to perform better than the market this year despite the impact of biosimilars on sales of its key arthritis drug Remicade. Sales in the Consumer and Medical Device segments are expected to improve.We believe that new products in all segments, successful label expansion of cancer drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and contribution from recent acquisitions will continue to drive top-line growth. Core products like Stelara, Zytiga, Simponi/Simponi Aria and Invega Sustenna are expected to contribute to growth.However, in the past two quarters, revenues from pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) products — added after the June 2017 acquisition of Actelion —  declined sequentially due to lower sales of Tracleer outside the United States due to generic competition. It is less likely that PAH revenues will improve in the second quarterBiosimilar competition is expected to hurt sales of Remicade outside the United States. Please note that J&J markets Remicade in partnership with Merck (MRK  -  Free Report).However, J&J does not expect any biosimilar entrants for Zytiga, Prezista, Risperdal Consta, or Invega Sustenna in the United States in 2018. However, the full year guidance includes the impact of generics for Procrit and Tracleer as well as Remicade biosimilars.Regarding newly launched Tremfya, J&J said on the first-quarter conference call that the uptake of the product has been strong. The drug recorded sales of $72 million in the first quarter, which is expected to be higher in the to-be reported quarter. We expect J&J to discuss initial sales numbers for Erleada, its newly approved prostate cancerdrug, on the second-quarter conference call.In the Medical Devices segment, sales are expected to rise consistently in the Vision Care and Cardiovascular units. Diabetes Care unit will however continue to remain weakIn the Consumer segment, while beauty and over-the-counter products are expected to do well, domestic baby care product sales will likely remain weak. Recent acquisitions as well as new products are likely to provide some support.However, higher investments behind the new product launches will continue to hurt profits.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that J&J is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for a likely positive surprise.Zacks ESP: J&J’s Earnings ESP is +0.37%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $2.06 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: J&J has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of J&J’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other large drug/biotech stocks that also have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +1.25% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is scheduled to release results on Jul 26. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.14% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is slated to release results on Jul 27.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2031,ABBV,"It’s time to celebrate President Trump’s second year in office. After all, in two out of every three times, the second years of presidential terms have favored stock investors,.Wall Street, by the way, has shown enough confidence even as concerns about trade war loom large. As a matter of fact, solid job additions last month and an economy poised for growth that could come teasingly close to a milestone achieved in 2005 have instilled confidence among investors.Given the bullishness, investing in stocks with solid growth potential doesn’t seem to be a bad proposition.Wall Street Usually Rises in 2nd Year of Presidential TermsThere is always a 67% chance that the U.S. stock market will scale north during the second years of presidential terms. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, since its inception in 1896, has risen in two out of three times on average during the said period. And when the stock market rises less than 2% in the first half, you can be assured that it’s a done deal. Needless to say, the broader S&P 500 index rose less than 2% in the first half of this year.Even when the markets are fraught with concerns about geopolitical tensions or pending U.S. mid-term elections, you can pin your hopes on the success of the second year of a presidential term. And why not? The stock market is always forward looking and has already discounted such issues. Further, these odds won’t get hampered even if it is an aging bull market. This is why, there is a saying that bull markets don’t die of old age.% of time DJIA rises during the 2nd years of presidential terms (Data: Since 1896)Underlying Fundamentals Point the Way HigherStocks, by the way, have remained resilient to potential threats such U.S.-China trade skirmish after the White House imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, compelling Beijing to retaliate (read more: Think Small As U.S.-China Trade War Breaks Out! 5 Top Picks).Bulls also have solid faith in the underlying strengths of the U.S. economy and perhaps that points the way higher. The United States has been able to create 213,000 jobs in June; a healthy sign that show corporates are finding ways to fill open jobs despite lack of skilled workers. Such hiring figures easily topped analysts’ estimates of 200,000 job additions.Job gains were pretty broad based, with white-collar jobs leading the way with 50,000 job additions. From manufacturers, health-care providers to construction companies, all hired workers, a clear sign of a burgeoning economy.The unemployment rate rose to 4% last month, but for a good reason. The jobless rate went up mostly because of around 600,000 people entering the labor force. This showed that more Americans are searching for jobs as they are easier to find.Companies, in the meanwhile, are raising pay and benefits. Hourly wages rose 5 cents to $26.98. The yearly rate of pay hikes remained unchanged at 2.7%.Ramped up business investments, in a way, is expected to help the economy gain traction. The U.S. economy is projected to expand in the second quarter at an annual pace of nearly 4% after a 2.2% gain in the first three months of this year, economists say. This would put the economy in a solid position this year to meet or even beat 3% growth in gross domestic product (GDP), one of the primary aims of the government (read more: US GDP to Hit Elusive 3% Annual Growth in 13 Years: 5 Picks).Pundits Remain Sanguine About the U.S. Equity OutlookA number of market pundits remain upbeat about the outlook for U.S. equities. They have looked beyond potential headwinds that have been hurting the markets so far this year. In fact, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) have said that upbeat economic data coupled with pro-business policies will help companies register double-digit growth and accelerate buybacks in the near term.Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, the firm’s head of equity strategy, raised his year-end target for the S&P to 3,000 (8.7% upside potential from the current level). Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup’s (C  -  Free Report) chief U.S. strategist, is also upbeat, upgrading his rating to overweight from neutral and setting a price a price target of 2,865 for the S&P (3.8% upside potential from the current level). Andrew Adams, a strategist at Raymond James, in the meantime said that even though this year has seen a more torrid run than last year, he is yet to see red flags that indicate that the bull run is near its end. In fact, he has urged investors to look at the long-term trend and remain bullish.5 Stocks With Solid Upside Potential in the Second halfWall Street is gaining traction despite headlines flashing warnings about trade war. At the same time, statistical evidence shows that Trump’s second year in office will be fruitful for the stock market. Thus, investing in stocks that can make the most of these bullish trends seems judicious.We have, hence, selected five stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A or B, as it offers the best investment opportunities in the growth investing space.Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) is an independent energy company.

2032,ABBV,"The large cap pharmaceuticals sector comprising some of the biggest drugmakers of the world was off to a strong start in 2018. However, the sector took a backseat due to reasons like U.S. market instability and a few negative updates on the pipeline as well as regulatory front. Also, some older drugs of these companies are not performing up to the mark, inducing a drop in their revenues.The Zacks Large-Cap Pharma industry has declined 3.1% so far this year against the Zacks S&P 500 Composite’s gain of 2.6%.Overall, the sector is expected to rebound in the second half of the year. We believe, new product sales will be ramped up on the back of a rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results and frequent FDA approvals. This upside in turn,  might bring the sector back on track this year. Also, many of these companies have accelerated their cost-saving initiatives to enable investment in new products as well as defend the existing product portfolio to optimize long- and short-term growth. Cost savings can drive the earnings performance.Importantly, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity is gaining momentum with the tax reform in place. The new tax law, which cuts corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and encourages companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%, is spurring merger activity this year.With an optimistic outlook for the rest of the year, here we highlight three stocks that may prove to be good buys. All these stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and have seen their share price and earnings estimates rise in the near term. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Large Cap Pharma StocksH.

It also strengthened its R&D pipeline with the inclusion of Parkinson's disease candidate, foliglurax, from the acquisition of Prexton Therapeutics, currently in mid-stage development.Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report)This Zacks #2 Ranked stock has been working on strengthening its suite of products through buyouts and licensing deals. The company’s new products like Ibrance, contribution from acquisitions, cost-cutting efforts, a lower tax rate and share buybacks should help the company achieve its guidance. Pfizer also boasts a strong pipeline and expects approximately 25 to 30 drug approvals through 2022 including around 15 products with blockbuster potential. Pfizer’s growing immuno-oncology portfolio offers strong growth prospects. Shares of the company have increased 3.9% in the past three months. Earnings estimates have also moved 0.3% north both for 2018 and 2019, respectively, over the past 60 days. AbbVie Inc.

Moreover, its drug Imbruvica marketed in partnership with Johnson and Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) is approved for hematological cancers has multibillion dollar potential and the company is exploring the possibility of a label expansion for solid tumors and autoimmune diseases.

2034,ABBV,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved the label expansion of oncology drug Sprycel.Consequently, the drug is now approved for the treatment of children and adolescents aged one year to 18 years with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP). It also includes a powder for oral suspension formulation.An approval was on the cards as the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) had given a positive opinion on the same in April 2018.The approval was based on positive data from CA180-226 (NCT00777036) study, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of Sprycel in pediatric patients newly diagnosed with CP-CML, and in those who are resistant to or intolerant of Gleevec.We note that Sprycel is already approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP). The drug also received the FDA approval for adults with Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), who are resistant to or intolerant of prior therapy. The FDA also approved Sprycel for treatment in pediatric patients with Ph+ CML-CP in November 2017.Label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Bristol-Myers.Bristol-Myers’ shares have declined 6.9% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 1.1%. While its blockbuster drug Opdivo continues to perform well and the label expansion of the drug will further boost the top line. Pricing concerns and stiff competition in the immuno-oncology space are major causes of concern. In particular, Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda and Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Tecentriq pose stiff competition.Hence, the label expansion of other drugs of the company should maintain the top-line momentum. The cancer portfolio also got a major boost with the launch of immuno-oncology drug, Empliciti, for the treatment of multiple myeloma in December 2015.

2035,ABBV,"AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) shares have outperformed the large-cap pharma industry in the past three months. The stock has returned 1.5% in that timeframe against the industry’s decline of 1.1%.AbbVie’s outperformance was backed by decent quarterly results, an optimistic outlook for stronger underlying business performance through the rest of the year,positive pipeline news flow and regulatory updates.It is one of the reputed names in the pharmaceutical sector. AbbVie came into existence on Jan 1, 2013, after Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) divested its pharmaceutical divisionHere are six reasons to invest in the stock.Favorable Rank & Earnings Surprise Record: AbbVie has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It has been consistently beating earnings expectations.  Earnings surpassed expectations in each of last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 2.39%.The company is expected to record earnings and sales growth of 39.3% and 16.8%, respectively, in 2018. Meanwhile, estimates for 2018 and 2019 increased 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, in the past 60 days.Valuation Looks Reasonable: Despite the outperformance, AbbVie’s valuation looks fairly reasonable currently.AbbVie currently has a forward twelve months price-to-earnings ratio (P/E F12M) of 11.25, which is near the lowest level (11.03) in the past year. When compared with the highest level of 17.99 and median level of 13.92 over the past year, there is apparently some upside left.The space also looks inexpensive when compared with the industry, as the current as well as median F12M P/E ratio for the industry is 14.02 and 15.63, respectively. Price-to-Earnings Forward Twelve Months (F12M) chart  Key Drug Humira Going Strong: AbbVie’s flagship product Humira is approved for several inflammatory indications like rheumatoid arthritis. Humira continues to witness strong demand trends despite launch of drugs with new mechanisms of action and competition from indirect biosimilars. Currently approved for 13 indications, Humira sales have increased consistently - 11.7% in 2015, 16.1% in 2016 and 14.6% in 2017 - backed by robust demand trends. The product continues to see strong growth in the dermatology and gastroenterology markets. The company expects Humira sales to approach $21 billion in 2020.Though two biosimilar versions of Humira are already approved by the FDA, per settlements with Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Samsung Bioepis, biosimilar entry into the United States is set for 2023, thus delaying direct biosimilar competition in the country.Strong Oncology Portfolio: AbbVie work rigorously on expanding and accelerating its presence in oncology. A key drug in its oncology portfolio is Imbruvica, which is currently approved for quite a few indications and has multi-billion dollar potential. AbbVie is exploring the potential to expand Imbruvica’s label into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. Several studies on Imbruvica are ongoing to evaluate the drug alone or in combination in different patient segments. AbbVie expects Imbruvica peak sales of more than $7 billion and revenues of about $5 billion in 2020. AbbVie has developed Imbruvica in partnership with J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report).AbbVie is also studying another cancer drug Venclyxto/Venclexta to expand the label to address the broader relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient population, expand into earlier lines of therapy, and broaden into other hematologic malignancies like multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia. In June, regulatory applications seeking approval for the combination of Venclexta plus Roche’s (RHHBY) Rituxan in relapse/refractory CLL were approved in the United States. Label expansion to include this broader patient population should boost Venclexta’s commercial potential.Meanwhile, the 2016 acquisition of drugmaker, Stemcentrx added a key late-stage candidate, rovalpituzumab tesirine or Rova-T, to AbbVie’s portfolio. Rova-T is currently in registrational studies for first and second-line small cell lung cancer (SCLC). A phase I, eight-arm ""basket study"" on Rova-T in neuroendocrine tumors is also ongoing.Promising Pipeline: AbbVie has a deep pipeline consisting of several interesting late-stage candidates. Promising candidates include elagolix (endometriosis), risankizumab (inflammatory diseases), Depatux-M/ABT-414 (glioblastoma multiforme), ABBV-8E12 (early Alzheimer's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)), and upadacitinib/ABT-494 (inflammatory diseases).The company expects to move 10 tumor candidates into clinical development in 2018.Several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones are expected in the second half of the year including FDA decisions on risankizumab and elagolix regulatory applications.Mavyret Performs Beyond Expectations: AbbVie’s eight-week, pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, once-daily hepatitis C (HCV) treatment, Mavyret, gained approval in the United States, EU, Canada and Japan in 2017. Mavyret, AbbVie’s next-generation HCV program, is a combination of glecaprevir, a potent protease inhibitor and pibrentasvir, a NS5A inhibitor. Mavyret has the potential to rejuvenate growth in the HCV franchise. According to AbbVie, Mavyret may be used in up to 95% of HCV patients, depending on the stage of liver disease and prior treatment history. Mavyret performed beyond expectations in the first year of launch, recording sales of almost $500 million in 2017. The positive sales trend continues in 2018 with the drug recording sales of $850 million in the first quarter of 2018. With less than a year on the market, Mavyret already commands 45% share in the United States.Conclusion                                                                                  AbbVie faces its share of challenges in the form of slower sales of HCV drugs, potential biosimilar competition to Humira, regular pipeline setbacks and rising competition. However, we believe AbbVie is well positioned to overcome these headwinds.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2036,ABBV,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) is reportedly raising prices of almost 100 drugs, effective July 1. This is the second time that the drug giant has raised the prices of its drugs this year. The scrutiny of drug prices has increased since Trump assumed office. However, with a softer drug pricing policy formed last month, we expect other companies to follow suit.The increase in price was nearly 9% for the majority of the drugs, within the agreed limit of 10% price rise a year. However, price of a few drugs like Xalatan, Viagra and Chanix have already increased in double digits including the price hike of January.On May 11, Trump announced plans to control drug prices in the United States. However, a group of investors believe the plan is not likely to have a major impact on the profits of large pharma companies. Instead of including provisions of direct negotiations by Medicare with the pharma companies, Trump targeted intermediaries, certain small pharma companies and foreign countries. Thus, Medicare is a major customer of drugs, paying nearly 30% of dollar values of prescriptions filled. Medicare could have negotiated lower prices directly from the manufacturers.The President also expects to increase competition by streamlining some approval-related regulatory processes and promoting faster approval to generics/biosimilars. The plan allows more substitutions/additions in Medicare’s drug list for single-source generics to contain price rise and gives sponsors more negotiation power with manufacturers. It also instructs companies to display list prices in advertising. The plan also focuses more on transparency related to pricing and availability of generics.Moreover, the announcement of the price hike by Pfizer comes after weeks of Trump’s claim that pharma companies will take massive price cuts voluntarily soon.Pfizer has defended the price rise by stating that list price does not reflect actual price, which includes discount. It also mentioned that it has hiked prices for only one-tenth of its drug portfolio and also reduced prices of five drugs by 16% to 44%.Meanwhile, price hike by one company may soon trigger a market-wide increase in drug prices. Thus, Pfizer’s move can again stir the opposition related to drug price rise, especially by large pharma companies. Along with Pfizer, stock prices of several other large cap pharma companies moved north on Jul 2 including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report). A rise in drugs prices will certainly help these companies to boost its profits.So far this year, the large cap pharma industry has declined 5.1% against the S&P 500’s rise of 2.2%.We expect investors to remain focused on other pharma companies for any announcement related to drug prices and any subsequent move by the government to restrict any further hike.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2037,ABBV,"Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2, after market close. Solid performance by the Pharmacy Benefit Management segment (“PBM”) is likely to drive the company’s top line. However, the company is getting acquired by Cigna Corporation by the end of 2018.In the last reported quarter, Express Scripts delivered adjusted earnings of $2.16 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.08. Further, adjusted earnings improved from $1.88 in the year-ago quarter. Revenues of $25.38 billion also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.12 billion.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $24.76 billion, reflecting a rise of 0.4% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.76, indicating an increase of 32.3% year over year.Let’s dig deeper to analyze how things are shaping up before the earnings announcements.PBM in FocusExpress Scripts is the largest PBM in North America. The company has been consistently trying to expand its core PBM business. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PBM revenues is pegged at $22.60 billion.We believe that the company’s unique offerings of home-delivery pharmacy care, specialty pharmacy care, specialty benefit management and medical and drug data analysis services buoy optimism. Express Scripts also distributes a full range of biopharmaceutical products and provides extensive cost-management and patient-care services.The company inked an agreement to acquire privately-held eviCore healthcare at $3.6 billion in October 2017. The transaction was closed in the fourth quarter of 2017. eviCore provides evidence-based and integrated medical benefit management services (MBM) solutions that drive cost reduction and quality care outcomes. The acquisition is expected to prove accretive to Express Scripts’ adjusted diluted earnings per share within the first full year of operation, the first quarter being no exception.Express Scripts Holding Company Price and EPS Surprise  Express Scripts Holding Company Price and EPS Surprise | Express Scripts Holding Company QuoteExpress Scripts' PBM services coupled with eviCore's complementary medical benefits management is likely to build a solution.Strong demand for the company’s solutions continued into the quarter under review. The company expects solid demand for SafeGuardRx, 90-day supply for chronic medications, exclusive Accredo Specialty Pharmacy and advanced opioid solutions. Through each of these programs as well as many others, Express Scripts delivers superior care to patients at an affordable cost.The company’s latest offering of Multiple Sclerosis Care Value Program has been launched on Jan 1. This program extends the company’s differentiated payment model by shielding payers from costs associated with discontinued therapy. Express Scripts already enrolled over 22 million lives as of yet. Management claims this as the most successful launch till date.Other Factors to ConsiderGuidance: Adjusted claims for the first quarter of 2018 are expected in the range of 335-345 million. Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2018 are estimated in the range of $1.73-$1.78. This represents growth of 30-34% on a year-over-year basis.For the full year, adjusted earnings are estimated in the band of $9.27-$9.47, reflecting growth of 31-33% year over year. Revenues are expected in the band of $99,000-$102,000 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected between $7,600 million and $7,800 million.Coming to guidance for Express Scripts’ core business, total adjusted claims are expected in the range of 280-290 million for the first quarter of 2018.Client-Retention Rate Positive: Express Scripts entered 2018 with strong market momentum and continued to witness success in retaining key clients. By the end of the previous quarter, the company created trusted client relationships by delivering exceptional care to patients while controlling costs. Its favorable drug-trend results are clearly indicative of the above fact. Buoyed by strong prospects, Express Scripts expects to provide retention rate guidance for 2019 of 96-98%.Express Scripts Getting Acquired: After declaring that Express Scripts is losing its biggest customer — the leading health insurer Anthem Inc., the company recently announced that it is getting acquired by Cigna, a global health insurance company.The acquisition is expected to be completed by Dec 31, 2018. Per the definitive agreement, Cigna will take over Express Scripts in a cash and stock transaction worth $67 billion. Notably, this includes Cigna's assumption of approximately $15 billion debt of Express Scripts.In fact, Moody's Investors Service, the rating services arm of Moody’s Corporation, is worried about Express Scripts’ high customer concentration and pricing pressure. Per Moody’s, Express Scripts is likely to experience declining script volume and higher-than-typical customer losses in the days to come. Other challenges include fewer generic drug introductions, softening mail order growth trends, client focus on cost savings and transparency.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show an earnings beat for Express Scripts in the quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

2038,ABBV,"Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter results on May 1, after the market closes. Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Gilead Sciences, Inc. Quote Gilead, a leader in the hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) space, has a decent track record, with the company’s earnings beating estimates in three of the last four while missing in one. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings beat expectations by 4.7%. Overall, the company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 7.5%.   Gilead’s stock has rallied 10.5% over a year outperforming the industry's decline of 10.8%.Why A Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that Gilead is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates which is what the case is here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Gilead is +0.32%.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 which when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this quarter.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayConcurrent with the fourth-quarter earnings call, Gilead provided guidance for 2018. Gilead now expects net product sales in the range of $20-$21 billion.Strong HIV performance and other antiviral product sales are being driven by continued uptake of tenofovir alafenamide (“TAF”) based products — Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey. We expect the trend to continue in the first quarter as well. Genvoya has already become the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients since its launch. The TAF-based regimens now represent 62% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume. Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting also put up a strong performance as the company saw a significant uptick in PrEP usage in 2017 with approximately 153,000 patients using Truvada by the end of 2017. Moreover, the franchise received a further boost with the FDA approval of once-daily single tablet regimen (“STR”), Biktarvy (bictegravir 50mg/emtricitabine 200mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25mg, BIC/FTC/TAF) for HIV-1 infection in February 2018. Hence, sales should get a further boost.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Genvoya is $1074 million. However, Gilead lost exclusivity for Viread in some countries outside the United States which might impact sales.On the other hand, the HCV franchise continues to be under competitive and pricing pressure leading to a massive decline in Harvoni and Sovaldi sales. Harvoni and Sovaldi has been facing competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR among others.  The franchise suffered a significant plunge in sales due to new competition and fewer patient starts.  Both pricing and market share are expected to stabilize by mid-2018 while patient starts are expected to decline further. HCV revenues are projected to decline further and will constitute a smaller portion of the top-line going forward.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of lead HCV drug Sovaldi and Harvoni are $98 million and $466 million, respectively.Adjusted R&D expenses and adjusted SG&A expenses are projected in the range of $3.4-$3.6 billion and $3.4-$3.6 billion, respectively. Adjusted product gross margin is expected in the range of 85-87%.Meanwhile, the Kite acquisition was a step in the right direction with the FDA approval of its chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), for the treatment of refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which includes DLBCL, transformed follicular lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. However, management stated that Yescarta launch will be a controlled launch to ensure patient safety as CAR-T therapy is complicated and can sometimes be associated with severe side effects.Gilead is also looking to build up a nonalcoholic steatohepatitis franchise. We expect the management to throw more light on the same during the first-quarter’s call. Investors are also likely to keep an eye on other pipeline updates.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.GW Pharmaceuticals plc (GWPH  -  Free Report) is expected to report earnings on May 8. The company has an Earnings ESP of +8.11% and a Zacks Rank #1.

2039,ABBV,"Vice ETFs primarily target companies dealing in products seen as vices, such as alcohol, tobacco or marijuana.  These ETFs are attractive options for those seeking some diversification in their portfolio by investing in the so-called sin stocks.The need to form such a category was primarily because of some investors’ inclination toward sustainable investing, which mainly seeks to avoid sin stocks. However, some investors choose such stocks for their attractive return potential.How to Add Sin Stocks to Your Portfolio?Investors have multiple ways to gain exposure to the space. Depending on their preference, investors can choose pure play alcohol stocks, tobacco, marijuana stocks or form a diversified portfolio of the entire space. However, owing to high volatility in this space and stringent regulations, it is advisable to go the ETF way to gain exposure to the sector.With experienced managers handling money, investors will be in a good spot when the sector performs well. When AdvisorShares Vice ETF was launched last September, the fund’s portfolio manager Dan Ahrens said, “We’re not making any kind of moral judgment or statement about what people want to consume with this focus; there’s a strong economic argument for looking at these sectors.""Another positive for this segment’s investors is that these products are somewhat staples. Even when the economy is not performing well, people drink and smoke. As a result, even if the sector takes a beating at the time of a recession, it will outperform other segments of the markets, owing to its demand interdependency.The alcohol industry has been looking up, with growth surpassing expectations. Volumes for spirits grew 2.6% last year, according to data provided by the Distilled Spirits Council, while supplier revenue was up 4.0% to $26.2 billion. Moreover, the cannabis and legal marijuana industry is seeing strong growth although tobacco sales are seeing a slight decline.Let us now discuss a few ETFs providing exposure to the space.Spirited Funds/ETFMG Whiskey & Spirits ETF This fund focuses on providing exposure to companies across the world involved in the production and sale of whiskey and spirits. It has AUM of $15.0 million and charges a fee of 60 basis points a year.

2040,ABBV,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the opening bell.In the last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, Alexion’s track record is excellent as it has consistently topped estimates in the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 15.21%.Alexion’s shares have underperformed the industry in the past  year. The stock has lost 9.9% compared with the industry’s decline of 8.3%. What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Alexion is likely to beat on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — which have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates.Zacks ESP: Alexion has an Earnings ESP of +2.09% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.51 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.48. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Alexion’s Zacks Rank #2, when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Note that Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Impact Q1 ResultsAlexion’s blockbuster drug, Soliris, continues to perform well. Alexion continues to identify and treat a consistently high number of new patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) with Soliris, across its 50-country operating platform.Alexion is working on expanding Soliris’ label into additional indications. The FDA recently approved the drug for the treatment of refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive. The drug was approved in Europe for this indication. Approximately 60,000-80,000 patients are expected to have gMG in the United States.Additionally, a phase III study (PREVENT) on Soliris in patients with relapsing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder is ongoing with enrollment was completed and data expected in mid-2018. Label expansion in additional indications will give Soliris access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Soliris hints that the drug’s sales will increase to about 8.2% from the year-ago quarter to $803 million.Alexion recently announced that it will acquire Sweden-based Wilson Therapeutics for $855 million. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter. The acquisition will add a late-stage candidate, WTX101 to Alexion’s pipeline. The candidate is currently in phase III for the treatment of Wilson disease, a rare genetic disorder.Alexion is looking to diversify its portfolio and reduce its dependence on its blockbuster drug Soliris. The deal will strengthen Alexion’s rare disease pipeline with a late-stage candidate.The company plans to focus on rare diseases businesses in core areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders to enhance productivity. Alexion will reduce spending and headcount associated with the previously announced de-prioritized pipeline programs as well as optimizing additional R&D expenses.The company plans to relocate its headquarters to Boston, MA by mid-2018 with approximately 400 positions. As a result of the restructuring plan, the company will reduce its global workforce by approximately 20%. The company expects that the increased financial flexibility will allow it to reinvest approximately $100 million annually into R&D. Alexion expects pretax savings of approximately $250 million by 2019.In the meantime, the company’s efforts to develop its pipeline are impressive, particularly in case of ALXN1210. Currently, it is evaluating ALXN1210 (a longer-acting anti-C5 antibody that inhibits terminal complement) in phase III studies for both PNH and aHUS. A tentative approval for PNH is expected in 2019.Patients are also being dosed in a phase III trial with ALXN1210 administered intravenously every eight weeks in complement inhibitor treatment-naive adolescent and adult patients with aHUS.  The company is expected to complete enrollment in the second quarter and announce the results in the fourth quarter of 2018.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

2041,ABBV,"AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) announced that the Japanese regulatory authorities have granted approval to its PARP inhibitor, Lynparza tablets for the treatment of patients with unresectable or recurrent BRCA-mutated metastatic breast cancer in patients who have received prior chemotherapy. With this approval, Lynparza becomes the first and only PARP inhibitor approved for use beyond ovarian cancer in Japan. This is the second indication for which Lynparza is now approved in Japan. Lynparza was approved for the first indication — advanced ovarian cancer regardless of BRCA mutation status — in the country earlier this year.AstraZeneca’s shares have risen 0.3% so far this year. In contrast, the industry has declined 5.1%.In United States, Lynparza was approved for a breast cancer indication this January.Lynparza is also presently marketed for advanced ovarian cancer in later settings.Lynparza is also in different studies for a range of tumor types including breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers as well as earlier-line settings for ovarian cancer.In the first quarter of 2018, Lynparza sales rose 100% to $119 million. Sales in the United States surged 144%, gaining from recent label expansion approvals in ovarian cancer, tablets, and breast cancer indication. In Europe, sales rose 44%, pushed higher by a number of successful launches, high BRCA-testing rates and encouraging levels of reimbursement.AstraZeneca has a joint development and collaboration agreement with Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) for Lynparza.AstraZeneca’s another cancer drug Imfinzi was also approved in Japan for an early-stage lung cancer indication. The PD-L1 inhibitor was approved for patients with locally-advanced, unresectable (stage III) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), whose disease has not progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy concurrent with radiation therapy (CRT).The approval was based on positive progression free survival data from the phase III PACIFIC study.Imfinzi is already approved in the United States, Canada, Switzerland and India in this indication while an application in the EU is under review, with a decision expected in the second half.Meanwhile, Imfinzi (durvalumab) is being evaluated for multiple cancers, either alone or in combination with other regimens, including late-stage studies in combination with tremelimumab in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, liver cancer), NSCLC, small cell lung cancer, metastatic urothelial cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) among others.Imfinzi was launched in the United States for the first indication — second-line advanced bladder cancer — in May last year. Thereafter, Imfinzi was approved and immediately launched for early-stage lung cancer in the United States in February this year, which contributed significantly to the drug’s $62 million sales in the first quarter of 2018.AstraZeneca has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked large-cap pharma stocks include Pfizer, Inc.

2042,ABBV,"Volatility and uncertainty in the stock market has raised the appeal for dividend growth stocks. A history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 11 stocks that fit the bill:Ohio-based The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) provides personal and commercial auto insurance, residential property insurance, and other specialty property-casualty insurance and related services primarily in the United States.

2043,ABBV,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated’s (VRTX  -  Free Report) shares rallied more than 15% on Jun 29, following the announcement of lower-than-expected top-line results from Galapagos NV’s (GLPG  -  Free Report) phase II study on cystic fibrosis (“CF”) candidate, GLPG2737.Galapagos is evaluating the candidate on top of Vertex’s CF drug, Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor), in the phase II PELICAN study in CF patients who are homozygous for the class II F508del mutation. The patients treated with GLPG2737, were treated with Orkambi for at least 12-weeks before the study and continued to receive it during the study. The company is developing GLPG2737 as a triple-combination regimen to treat CF patients.Data from the study showed that GLPG2737 in combination with Orkambi improved ppFEV1, a measure of lung function, by 3.4% and reduced sweat chloride by 19.6 mmol/L from baseline versus placebo.However, investors have found these data disappointing, which led to a decline in Galapagos’ share price last Friday. Vertex is also developing triple-combo regimens. Its two candidates – VX-659 and VX-445 – in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor have improved ppFEV1 by 13.3% and 13.8%, respectively, in early to mid-stage studies. The reduction in sweat chloride in patients was also materially higher than GLPG2737.Moreover, both the candidates are in phase III stage of development.The numbers and the stage shows that Vertex is a clear leader in the development process of triple-combo regimens for CF patients. The study results are also significantly higher, which can probably ward off competition for a longer term.So far this year, Vertex’s shares have gained 13.4% against a decrease of 7.3% registered by the industry.Galapagos is also developing triple combination regimens its own CF potentiator/correctors – GLPG2451, GLPG2222 and GLPG2737 – in a phase I study with interim data expected in the third quarter. The CF studies are being conducted in partnership with AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report). However, AbbVie has opted not to proceed with the development of previously contemplated second triple combination therapy comprising GLPG3067, GLPG2222 and GLPG2737.Meanwhile, Vertex announced in its press release that its third CF drug was approved for the treatment of patients aged 12 and older with two copies of the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene in Canada. The drug will available under the brand name of PrSYMDEKO.Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. (CRBP  -  Free Report), a MA-based clinical-stage pharmaceutical company, is also developing its CF candidate, lenabasum, in a mid-stage study.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated QuoteVertex currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2044,ABBV,"Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced that European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (""CHMP"") has issued a positive opinion on the company’s Marketing Authorization Application (""MAA"") for CAR T therapy, axicabtagene ciloleucel, as a treatment for adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (""DLBCL"") and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (""PMBCL""), after two or more lines of systemic therapy.Axicabtagene ciloleucel, a chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) therapy, modifies a patient’s own T cells to recognize and attack cancer cells.The agency had earlier granted PRIME status to axicabtagene ciloleucel in May 2016.A tentative approval is on the cards as the EMA generally takes the CHMP recommendation into account while reviewing any MAA.We note that axicabtagene ciloleucel was approved by the FDA in October 2017 as Yescarta.An approval in Europe will boost the growth prospects of the therapy, given the market potential. Per the information provided by the company, there are an estimated 7,700 patients with DLBCL, who are refractory to or have relapsed after two or more lines of the therapy,  and may be eligible for CAR T therapy in Europe.Concurrently, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) also obtained positive opinion from the CHMP for its CAR-T therapy, Kymriah, for two B-cell malignancies — B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and DLBCL.Gilead’s stock has gained 0.4% in the year so far as against the industry's decline of 6.9%. We note that Gilead is looking to newer avenues to help its top line by solidifying its presence in the gene therapy space. The initial uptake of Yescarta in the United States is also encouraging. Gilead is also intending to foray into the NASH market.Gilead’s HCV franchise is experiencing slowdown across key markets, including the United States and Europe, reflecting lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi as a result of competitive and pricing pressure. The franchise saw a significant plunge in sales, due to new competition and fewer patient starts. We note that Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa face competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Mayret, and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zepatier, among others. Nevertheless, the HIV franchise continues to maintain momentum.Zacks RankGilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2046,ABBV,"Inogen Inc.’s (INGN  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 results are scheduled for release on Apr 30, after the market closes. A broadening Long-term Oxygen Therapy (“LTOT”) market, inherent benefits of Portable Oxygen Concentrators (“POC”) over traditional delivery model, direct-to-customer business model, underpenetrated international markets and expanding product portfolio are key growth catalysts.Notably, in the last  quarter, Inogen reported adjusted earnings of 31 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 47.6%. Earnings increased 24% on a year-over-year basis. Total revenues in the reported quarter rose 25.4% to $63.8 million on a year-over-year basis. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.9%.For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $62.6 million, reflecting a rise of 19.2% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 27 cents.Let’s delve into other factors which are likely to impact Inogen’s first-quarter 2018 results.European Sales to Boost Q1 Top LineInogen has been one of the leading providers of POCs in Europe. In the last-reported quarter, sales in Europe represented 84.3% of international sales, up from 83.3% in the year-ago quarter.We expect the trend to continue in the upcoming quarterly results. In fact, management expects long-term opportunity ahead as the market transitions from tank and liquid oxygen systems to non-delivery solutions.Further, in support of its European customers, Inogen began the production of its Inogen One G3 concentrators in the fourth quarter of 2017 using a contract manufacturer, Foxconn, located in the Czech Republic.In 2018, the company expects Foxconn to produce a huge number of Inogen One G3 concentrators required to support the massive European demand, with the first quarter being no exception.Although Inogen is just in the first leg of its collaboration with Foxconn, the company has been already delivering improved service levels and lower costs.We expect the company to deliver a solid first-quarter 2018 performance on the back of Inogen One concentrators and Inogen At Home concentrators. Inogen, Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Inogen, Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Inogen, Inc Quote Other Factors at PlayGuidanceFor 2018, Inogen expect revenues in the range of $298 million to $308 million, up from the previously-issued range of $295 million to $305 million. Notably, this represents growth of 19.5% to 23.5% year over year. An upbeat trend is expected to continue in the quarter to be reported as well.Direct-to-Consumer ModelInogen expects its direct-to-consumer sales to be the fastest growing channel, domestic business-to-business sales to have a significant growth rate and international business-to-business sales to have a modest growth rate where the strategy will still focus on the European market.Inogen’s direct-to-customer business model has lent it a leading position in the oxygen therapy market. The direct-to-consumer model gives companies an opportunity to build a unique brand relationship directly with customers. Recently, the company signed a lease for its expansion site in Ohio to accelerate growth in domestic direct-to-consumer sales channel. The growing direct-to-customer sales and marketing efforts help in increasing awareness among patients. Growth in physician referrals in this segment is expected to boost the top line over the long term.In the fourth quarter of 2017, direct-to-consumer sales (domestic and international) increased 23.9% to $29.5 million on a year-over-year basis. The company’s sales team consisted of 263 inside sales representatives as of Dec, 2017 which represented an increase of 86 reps over the 2016 year-end’s total of 177. The company announced plans to execute a direct-to-consumer pricing trial in 2018 to ensure that its products are optimally priced.A unique direct-to-consumer business model is likely to boost the company’s first-quarter bottom line.Dull Rental RevenuesInogen derives a significant portion of its revenues from Medicare’s service reimbursement programs. The company expects rental revenues per patient to decline in the upcoming quarters, due to lower reimbursement rates in connection with the nationalization of competitive bidding and continued reimbursement declines.Rental revenues represented 8.5% of total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017, lower than 16.2% of net revenues in the year-ago quarter. Rental revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $5.4 million compared with $8.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, down 34.1% year over year. Per management, the decline was caused by a $2-million rental benefit in the year-ago quarter.What Our Model PredictsOur quantitative model does not predict an earnings beat for Inogen in the upcoming quarterly results.This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.

Per the latest Earnings Preview, 87 S&P 500 members — accounting for 17.4% of the index — have already released financial figures as of Apr 20, 2018.Total earnings for the 87 S&P 500 members that have reported results already are up 25% from the same period last year on 10.7% higher revenues, with 82.8% beating EPS estimates and 67.8% beating revenue estimates. The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 62.1%.The ongoing earnings phase seems to have also begun encouragingly for the Drug/Biotech sector. Among the major large cap players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) kicked off the season on a strong note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings as well as sales. Another large cap player that reported earnings last week was Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), which also surpassed both earnings and revenue expectations this quarter. Also Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) which released its results this week surpassed earnings but missed sales expectations.Higher demand is expected to boost new product sales. Also, innovation and successful product line expansion along with positive clinical study results, FDA approvals, and consistent performance of key products, growing demand for drugs, especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an ageing population as well as an increased healthcare expenditure are some of the factors that should keep the sector on a growth trajectory.Also, according to the Earnings Preview, the broader Medical sector (inclusive of drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is likely to record 6.8% year-over-year growth in revenues and a 9.4% rise in earnings in the quarter under review.Four pharma/biotech giants are scheduled to report Q1 earnings results on Apr 26.

2048,ABBV,"We expect AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.78%.Shares of AbbVie have marginally outperformed the industry so far this year. While the stock has declined 4.1%, the industry has decreased 4.3%. Notably, AbbVie’s earnings history is quite impressive with the pharmaceuticals company having outpaced estimates in all the last four quarters with an average beat of 1.81%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors to ConsiderAbbVie expects first-quarter 2018 earnings in the range of $1.77-$1.79 per share. Revenues are estimated to grow in a mid-teen range on an operational basis. Foreign exchange is anticipated to gain a 3% favorable impact on sales in the period to be reported.The company’s key drug, Humira, is likely to remain a key growth driver in the first quarter, backed by strong demand trends for the drug. AbbVie expects Humira sales to reflect a rise in the low-teens band in the imminent earnings release while internationally, the growth rate is projected in a mid-single-digit range, operationally. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Humira is pegged at $4.7 billion.Significantly, on first-quarter conference call, investors’ focus will also be on the performance level as well as the label expansion updates of AbbVie’s another cancer drug, Imbruvica. The drug has been recording strong sales since the past few quarters, a trend that we expect to continue even in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Imbruvica stands at $759 million.Other drugs, namely Duopa and Creon are also likely to maintain an encouraging performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.However, AbbVie’s Hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment, Viekira, will continue to see declining sales, affected by an intense pricing and competitive pressure in the HCV market.Moreover, in March 2018, AbbVie’s rovalpituzumab tesirine or Rova-T fell short of expectations in a phase II TRINITY study, evaluating it in third-line therapy for later small cell lung cancer (SCLC). On first-quarter conference call, we expect management to provide updates on the same.Notably, AbbVie’s eight-week, pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, once-daily HCV treatment, Mavyret, secured an approval in the United States, EU, Canada as well as Japan in the second half of 2017. Importantly, Mavyret recorded $500 million global sales last year. The initial uptake of the drug has been commendable and we expect its higher sales in the first quarter as well.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that the stock is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.Zacks ESP: AbbViehas an Earnings ESP of +0.06%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is $1.80 per share. A positive ESP indicates a likely earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: AbbViehas a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and together with a positive ESP, chances of the stock beating estimates in its upcoming release are always pegged higher.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a couple of other health care stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to also surpass estimates this time around:Pfizer Inc.

Moreover, the bottom line rose 16% year over year.Sales came in at $3.13 billion, up 11% from the year-ago period. However, the metric marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.15 billion. The top line, excluding hemophilia revenues, grew 15% year over year.We remind investors that last year,Biogen spun off its hemophilia business into a new company called Bioverativ. Earlier this January, Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) announced that it has entered into an agreement with Bioverativ to buy the latter for $11.6 billion.Shares of Biogen were down more than 2.5% in pre-market trading. The stock has declined 19.3% this year so far, underperforming the industry’s 9% decrease.Quarter in DetailBiogen’s multiple sclerosis (MS) revenues were $2.1 billion (down 4% year over year) in the reporter quarter including approximately $77 million in royalties on the sales of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) MS drug, Ocrevus.

Plegridy contributed $100 million to revenues, which decreased 11% year over year and 20%, sequentially.U.S. Interferon revenues are experiencing declining trends due to patients transitioning to other oral MS therapies as well as due to higher discounts and allowance.Zinbryta, launched in collaboration with AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report), contributed $1 million to revenues in the first quarter compared with $12 million in fourth-quarter 2017.Notably, in March 2018, Biogen announced the decision to withdraw Zinbryta from the markets, within less than two years of its FDA approval, due to growing safety concerns and limited commercial adoption of the drug because of its restrictive label. Both companies decided to discontinue the drug’s marketing on grounds of its complex and evolving benefit/risk profile.Biogen’s newest drug Spinraza (spinal muscular atrophy) logged revenues of $364 million in the first quarter, almost in line with the previous one.Spinraza U.S. sales were $188 million in the first quarter, decreasing 13.8% sequentially.

2052,ABBV,"Pharma giant Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) announced positive top-line results from a second phase III study on its arthritis drug, Taltz (ixekizumab), for the treatment of Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS), also known as radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (r-axSpA).The phase III study, COAST-W, evaluated the safety and efficacy of Taltz for the treatment of AS. This is the first AS trial on a patient population with inadequate response to one or two tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors or intolerance to a TNF inhibitor.The results showed that Taltz demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the signs and symptoms of AS, measured by the proportion of patients having achieved Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society 40 (ASAS40) response at 16 weeks when compared with placebo. The study met the primary and major secondary endpoints.AS is a type of spondyloarthritis affecting the pelvic joints and spine.Notably, the company had earlier reported positive results from the phase III COAST-V study on Taltz for the therapy of AS.Lilly plans to submit detailed data from the COAST-W study at scientific meetings and in peer-reviewed journals later in 2018. Based on the positive results from the COAST-V and COAST-W studies, the company plans to submit the same for approval in the United States later this year.We like to remind investors that apart from psoriatic arthritis, Taltz is approved for treating moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults, eligible for systemic therapy or phototherapy, as well as for active psoriatic arthritis. Although many other drugs like Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Cosentyx and AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira are approved to treat plaque psoriasis, Lilly claims Taltz is now the first and the only FDA approved treatment for genital psoriasis.Taltz logged sales of $146.5 million in the first quarter. The label expansion will in turn, expand the eligible patient population of the drug, driving sales going forward. The drug recorded sales of $559.2 million in 2017.Shares of Lilly have inched up 1.3% year to date against the industry’s decline of 6.1%. Lilly currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2053,ABBV,"We expect Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before market open.Bristol-Myers’ shares have decreased 16.5% so far this year compared with the industry’s decline of 4.7%.Bristol-Myers’ track record has been mixed so far. The company delivered positive earnings surprise in three of the last four quarters and missed expectations once. The average positive earnings surprise in the last four quarters is 4.23%. In the last reported quarter, Bristol-Myers delivered a positive surprise of 1.49%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter. What Will Drive Growth in Q1?Bristol-Myers’ blockbuster immuno-oncology drug, Opdivo is expected to remain the main sales driver in the first quarter, following several line extensions in 2017. In the soon-to-be reported quarter, the company announced encouraging results from a phase III study evaluating Opdivo in first-line non-small cell lung cancer. Opdivo in combination with Yervoy significantly improved progression free survival in patients compared to chemotherapy. A potential approval in this indication will be a significant boost for the drug, given the immense scope in the lung cancer market. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the drug’s sales in the first quarter is pegged at $1.38 billion.In January 2018, the European Commission approved the label expansion of Yervoy injection in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The FDA approved the drug for this indication in July 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the drug’s sales in this quarter is $291 million.In November 2017, the FDA approved line extension of Sprycel in pediatric patients with Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase. The drug, which registered growth of 6.7% in the previous quarter, is expected to receive a boost this quarter due to the expanded label. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sprycel sales stands at $507 million. Cardiovascular drug, Eliquis, came up with a strong performance in 2017, with sales growing 44% year over year. Sales are expected to remain robust in the first quarter too. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Eliquis sales is pegged at $1.43 billion.On the other hand, the decline in Hepatitis C franchise is expected to continue due to intense competition from multiple drugs including Epclusa as its label was expanded to include HIV co-infection in August. Moreover, the HIV business continues to face competitive pressure. Recent launches by other companies in the same space are expected to further impact the Sustiva franchise. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hepatitis C franchise sales is pegged at $52 million this quarter, down 67.9% from the year-ago quarter actual figure.ConclusionSeveral label expansions of Bristol-Myers’ blockbuster cancer drug, Opdivo, drove the company’s sales last year and are expected do so this year as well. Moreover, cardiovascular drug, Eliquis, also demonstrated strong performance in 2017. We expect this trend to continue this quarter. Label expansion of leukemia drug, Sprycel, approved in November 2017, should bring in more sales for the drug. Moreover, continued strong performance of Yervoy and Orencia will have a favorable impact.However, genericization of Plavix, Avapro/Avalide and Baraclude in the United States due to loss of exclusivity is significantly hurting the company’s top line. The company also faces stiff competition in the immuno-oncology space. The HIV business continues to face competitive pressure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and earnings for Q1 is pegged at $5.17 billion and 84 cents, respectively.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that Bristol-Myers is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP:Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +0.82%. This is a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank:Bristol-Myers has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and EPS Surprise  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and EPS Surprise | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderHere are some biotech stocks that you may also want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Pfizer Inc.

2055,ABBV,"Last week, U.S. Senator Tina Smith expressed concerns that big pharma companies plan to use their large corporate tax savings to reward shareholders instead of bringing down costs of expensive drugs and benefiting consumers. The Senator questioned through letters to CEOs of five big pharma companies — Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) and Abbott Labs (ABT  -  Free Report) — how they plan to use their extra cash.Please note that on their Q4 conference calls held earlier this year, most big pharma companies discussed what they plan to do with the extra cash they save from the new tax bill. These companies plan to invest the extra cash in capital expenditures, products/pipeline, in-licensing or acquisition deals or rewarding shareholders through higher dividends and share buybacks. Not many talked about taking any steps to lower prescription drug costs.This apart, key announcements this week included the failure of Dermira, Inc.’s (DERM  -  Free Report) acne candidate in two pivotal late-stage studies, Merck’s oncology collaboration with Japan’s Eisai, expansion of Jardiance clinical studies by Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and FDA committee backing for Pfizer’s Xeljanz for the third indication.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesDermira Shares Sink as Acne Candidate Fails: Shares of Dermira plunged after it announced that its acne candidate, olumacostat glasaretil, surprisingly failed to meet the primary endpoint in either of the two pivotal phase III studies -- CLAREOS-1 and CLAREOS-2. The company said that it will likely stop olumacostat glasaretil’s development following this failure. (Read More: Dermira's Acne Candidate Fails in Pivotal Trials, Shares Sink)Merck to Jointly Develop Eisai’s Cancer Drug Lenvima: Similar to last year’s profit sharing deal with AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report), Merck announced an oncology collaboration with Japan’s Eisai Co., Ltd. Per this deal, the companies will jointly develop and commercialize Eisai’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Lenvima, both as a monotherapy and in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda for several types of cancer. For the deal, Merck will give Eisai an upfront payment of $300 million. The companies will share global development and marketing costs as well as gross profits from Lenvima equally. (Read More: Merck to Pay $300M Upfront to Co-Develop Eisai's Cancer Drug)Pfizer’s Xeljanz sNDA Gets FDA Committee Backing: Pfizer’s supplemental new drug application to include the ulcerative colitis (UC) indication in its label received a backing from an FDA advisory committee. The FDA’s Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee (GIDAC) voted unanimously in favor of the JAK inhibitor. The FDA’s decision is expected in June. Xeljanz, which is already approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis and active psoriatic arthritis, recorded sales of $1.35 billion in 2017, representing growth of 45% year over year.AstraZeneca Looks for Forxiga EU Approval in Type I Diabetes: AstraZeneca’s application looking to get its SGLT-2 inhibitor, Forxiga, approved for a new indication -- an oral adjunct treatment to insulin in type-1 diabetes (T1D) patients -- was accepted by the European Medicines Agency. Forxiga is presently approved as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy to treat type-2 diabetes. If approved, Forxiga will become the first SGLT-2 inhibitor approved in Europe for the treatment of T1D as an oral treatment adjunct to insulin. (Read More: AstraZeneca's Forxiga Label Expansion Filing Accepted in EU)Glaxo Presents Asthma/HIV Data: Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report) presented data from OSMO study on a new respiratory medicine, Nucala, at American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) and World Allergy Organization (WAO) Joint Congress in Orlando. Data from the study showed that patients whose asthma was uncontrolled with Xolair witnessed improved asthma control on switching to Glaxo’s new respiratory medicine, Nucala.Glaxo also presented interim data from a phase IIIb study, INSPIRING, on investigational HIV candidate dolutegravir at a medical conference in Boston. (Read More: Glaxo’s Encouraging Asthma & HIV Data at Medical Meetings)Meanwhile, Glaxo gained approval to expand the European label of its once-daily LABA/ICS combination treatment, Relvar Ellipta. Now, Relvar Ellipta can be used in the EU in patients whose asthma is already adequately controlled by an ICS/LABA. With the label update, doctors can prescribe asthma patients to switch to once-daily Relvar Ellipta from their current twice-daily ICS/LABA, while experiencing comparable benefit in lung function and safety profile.Lilly, Boehringer to Expand Jardiance Clinical Studies: Lilly and partner Boehringer Ingelheim announced plans to initiate two phase III EMPERIAL studies, which will evaluate the effect of Lilly’s SGLT2 inhibitor Jardiance on exercise ability and heart failure symptoms in people with chronic heart failure irrespective of whether they have type II diabetes. Though the presently ongoing phase III EMPEROR outcomes studies are evaluating the effect of Jardiance on long-term morbidity and mortality outcomes in people with heart failure, the EMPERIAL studies will investigate if treatment with Jardiance can help improve the everyday lives of people living with chronic heart failure.

2056,ABBV,"With the passing of the new tax bill, the corporate tax rate has come down from 35% to 21% which is likely to boosts profit margins. Moreover, the cash repatriation window allowed in the bill will help companies to bring in cash stashed in foreign locations at a one-time tax rate of 10%, leaving these companies with extra spending power.Most big pharma companies discussed their plans to use the extra cash they save from the new tax bill at their fourth-quarter conference calls. The extra cash will mostly be invested in capital expenditures, products/pipeline, in-licensing or acquisition deals or rewarding shareholders through higher dividends and share buybacks. However, the majority of companies did not mention any effort regarding lowering of prescription drug costs.Last week, Senator Tina Smith in letters to five big pharma companies, expressed concern about how big pharma companies plan to used billions of dollars they will save from the tax cut offered under the tax bill passed in December 2017. She is concerned about the fact that the companies are favoring investors instead of using the savings to bring down prescription drug costs. Major life-saving drugs which are protected by patents are steeply priced. Thus, making these drugs affordable will help consumers, as it will lower their medical costs.The Senator has sent letters to CEOs of Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report), Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) to provide the details of how they intend to utilize major savings from the tax overhaul.The prices of major prescription drugs have skyrocketed over the past years, pinching hard U.S. citizens as their medical bills have soared. Moreover, the government also has to pay higher costs for the drugs that are covered under Medicare. The concern of the senator is thus justified. A move to restrict the use of tax savings for boosting shareholders will be a welcome move for consumers.Moreover, large players from every other industry have similar plans, which have undercut President Donald Trump’s plans to create jobs and boost wages.Senator Smith is also working toward making cheaper generic drugs available in the market faster by introducing a new legislation, as reported by KDAL.Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return  Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnDon’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

2058,ABBV,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) kicked off pharma earnings season on a strong note beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and sales in the first-quarter 2018. J&J’s performance was driven by continued positive momentum since the second half of 2017 and improvement in Consumer segment sales.How Did J&J Perform in Q1?J&J’s earnings of $2.06 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.01. Quarterly revenues were $20 billion, which also beat the consensus mark of $19.48 billion. Buoyed by its strong performance, the company upped its previously issued sales outlook for 2018. (Read More: J&J Tops Q1 Earnings Estimates, Raises Sales Guidance).J&J’s Pharmaceutical segment sales grew 19.4% year over year in the first quarter of 2018 due to strong sales in both domestic and international markets and favorable currency impact. Sales in the U.S. market rose 9.9% in the quarter while international sales grew 33.1%.New products like Imbruvica (cancer) and Darzalex (multiple myeloma) continued to perform well. Oncology sales increased 45% during the quarter to $2.3 billion, constituting almost a quarter of the pharmaceutical sales. Core products like Xarelto, Stelara, Zytiga, Simponi/Simponi Aria and Invega Sustenna also contributed to growth. Imbruvica sales rose 43.5%. The drug is marketed by J&J in partnership with AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report).Edurant sales rose 40.9% while Prezista sales increased 11.2%.However, Concerta sales continue to decline due to generic competition. Sales of Risperdal Consta also fell 5.3%. Sales of Invokana/Invokamet declined 12.7% due to higher managed care discounting, while blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, Remicade, marketed in partnership with Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) fell 16.9%.J&J’s Pharma segment achieved some clinical milestones during the quarter including FDA approvals of prostate cancer drug, Erleada for the treatment of men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and line extension of already marketed prostate cancer drug, Zytiga in combination with prednisone in the first-line setting.These will certainly boost sales in 2018. J&J now expects revenues in the range of $81.0 to $81.8 billion, higher than $80.6 billion to $81.4 billion expected previously.Overall, in 2018, J&J expects the Pharmaceutical segment to remain strong while the Consumer and Medical Device segments will continue to improve. We expect other companies like Merck, Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), Pfizer and Lilly to follow suit.Novartis Reports Encouraging Q1 ResultsNovartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) also reported this week. The Swiss pharma giant beat earnings and revenue estimates driven by strong performance of key drugs, Cosentyx and Entresto. Novartis reported core earnings of $1.28 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.25 and up from $1.13 recorded in the year-ago quarter. Revenues increased 10% to $12.7 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.3 billion. (Read more: Novartis Beats Earnings and Revenue Estimates in Q1)Sales of the Innovative Medicines division grew 6% to $8.4 billion driven by volume growth of Cosentyx and Entresto. However, entry of generics for Gleevec in the United States and Europe impacted sales unfavorably.Cosentyx sales increased to $580 million, up 35% driven strong growth in all indications and expanded access. Entresto’s sales increased 126% to $200 million driven by increased uptake.Oncology franchise (excluding Gleevec) grew 6% driven by Promacta/Revolade, Tafinlar + Mekinist, Jakavi and recent launches. However, sales at the Sandoz division were $2.5 billion, down 4% due to price erosion in the Unites States.However, this year so far, J&J’s shares have lost 8.8% and Novartis’ shares are down 6% against 4.3% decrease witnessed by the industry.Will Other Pharma Bigwigs Report Solid Results Too?PfizerPfizer's top line is expected to be favorably impacted by new products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain), Chantix (smoking cessation) and Eliquis (blood thinner) in the soon-to-be reported quarter. Moreover, line extension of Xeljanz, Sutent and Bosulif received in the fourth quarter of 2017 is also expected to bring in more sales.However, loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for Pristiq in the United States and Lyrica in Europe, and product shortages for legacy Hospira will likely affect sales negatively. Blockbuster drug Enbrel sales should continue to decline in the quarter due to biosimilar competition.In 2018, the company’s sales are expected to increase in low single digits from 2017 levels. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and earnings for Q1 is pegged at $13.03 billion and 73 cents, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in 2018 currently stands at $54.52 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 3.7%. Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).MerckMerck’s blockbuster drug, Keytruda, along with Lynparza and Bridion Injection is expected to boost revenues in the first quarter. Keytruda sales are gaining momentum through approval and launch of Keytruda in new indications, especially in first-line lung cancer.However, rising competitive and pricing pressure are expected to hurt sales of Zostavax, Zepatier, Januvia and Isentress.Animal health franchise sales are likely to remain strong in the first quarter.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and earnings for Q1 is pegged at $10.11 billion and 99 cents, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 sales is $41.81 billion, representing a 4.2% year-over-year increase.Eli Lilly (LLY)Sales of Lilly’s diabetes drugs, Trulicity and Jardiance are expected to grow driven by market share gains. Other new drugs such as Cyramza, Taltz, and Lartruvo are also expected to boost the top line due to continued strong demand. Verzenio is also expected to generate higher sales in the first quarter.However, patent expiry in some countries for Cymbalta, Strattera, Effient, Axiron, Zyprexa, Evista and competitive pressure mainly from immuno-oncology agents for Alimta will hurt sales of these drugs.We expect strong uptake of new products to offset decline in sales of established products this quarter too.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and earnings for Q1 is pegged at $5.52 billion and $1.13, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 sales stands at $23.43 billion, representing a rise of 2.4% year over year. Lilly carries a Zacks Rank #2.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY)Several label expansions of Bristol-Myers’ blockbuster cancer drug, Opdivo, drove the company’s sales last year and is expected do so this year as well. Moreover, cardiovascular drug, Eliquis, also demonstrated strong performance in 2017. We expect this trend to continue this quarter. Label expansion of leukemia drug, Sprycel, approved in November 2017 should bring in more sales for the drug. Moreover, continued strong performance of Yervoy and Orencia will have a favorable impact.However, genericization of Plavix, Avapro/Avalide and Baraclude in the United States due to loss of exclusivity is significantly hurting the company’s top line. The company also faces stiff competition in the immuno-oncology space. The HIV business continues to face competitive pressure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and earnings for Q1 is pegged at $5.17 billion and 84 cents, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 sales is pegged at $21.69 billion, representing a rise of 12.7% year over year. Bristol Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3.ConclusionThe new products of the majority of these companies are doing well and are expected to offset declining sales of legacy drugs due to loss of exclusivity. Moreover, most of these companies boast a deep and promising pipeline. Also, the new tax law boosts the prospects of strategic mergers and acquisitions and in-licensing deals/collaboration with smaller companies, which will strengthen the companies' product portfolio.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2059,ABBV,"Roche Holding AG’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) member Genentech announced that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to its hemophilia drug, Hemlibra (emicizumab-kxwh). The designation was granted to Hemlibra for treatment of people with hemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors.The designation aims to expedite the development and review of drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and provide patients access to these as soon as possible.This designation is based on data from the phase III HAVEN 3 study in people 12 years or older with hemophilia A without inhibitors. In the study, Hemlibra prophylaxis dosed subcutaneously every week or every two weeks showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in treated bleeds compared to no prophylaxis. The study met its primary endpoint as well as key secondary endpoints with Hemlibra significantly reducing bleeding.Roche’s stock has lost 11.6% over a year compared with industry's gain of 8.9%.We note that the FDA approved Hemlibra for routine prophylaxis to event or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adults and children with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors in November 2017. Hemlibra was reviewed by the FDA under Priority Review and granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation in September 2015.In January 2018, the EU Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) adopted a positive opinion for Hemlibra (emicizumab) for routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in patients suffering from hemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors. The CHMP has recommended the drug for use in all age groups. The Marketing Authorisation Application is being reviewed under accelerated assessment.A potential approval will further boost Roche’s hematology portfolio which includes approved drugs like MabThera/Rituxan, Gazyva/Gazyvaro, Tecentriq and Venclexta We note that Roche is developing Venclexta in collaboration with AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report). Both companies are jointly commercializing the drug in the United States. AbbVie is commercializing the drug outside the United States.Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche as its legacy drugs like Herceptin, MabThera are facing competition from biosimilars.Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan/ MabThera in Europe. Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) has also obtained FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Avastin for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer.Roche Holding AG Price Roche Holding AG Price | Roche Holding AG QuoteZacks RankRoche currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2060,ABBV,"The first-quarter earnings season has just kicked off. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the bottom line of S&P 500 companies is expected to increase at a highly impressive rate of 16.6% on a year-over-year basis. This prospective upside marks the maximum quarterly earnings growth pace in seven years. The report further predicts that 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors are projected to exhibit double-digit earnings growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Total revenues for the same set of companies are projected to grow 7.5%.However, focusing our attention on the Large Cap Pharma and Medical-Drugs sector, we note that both these sectors have decreased 6.2% and 4.2%, respectively, since February this year due to broader market pressure. Further, the S&P 500 index has registered a decline of 6.2% since the second month of 2018.We remind investors that the U.S. stock market is facing a severe volatility since the last couple of months despite a strong start this year. This downside can mainly be attributable to a potentially damaging trade war between the world’s two largest economies, United States and China, since this February.After President Donald Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of annual Chinese imports, China retaliated by notifying its intention to levy tariffs on 128 U.S. products. Such aggressive exchange has triggered tensions of a possible trade dispute between the two countries. Moreover, sluggish large-cap tech stocks are cited as another reason for this plummet in the market.Despite the recent market unrest, an optimistic sentiment revolves around the remaining year. Notably, the biotech sector is likely to improve as the year advances. We expect new product sales to thrive in tandem with rising demand. This apart, a successful innovation and a host of product launches, strong clinical study outcomes, more frequent FDA nods, solid performance of key products, growing demand for drugs, especially to deal with rare-to-treat diseases, an ageing population and an escalated healthcare expenditure are some of the factors to keep the sector stable. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.It is important to note that the outlook for the upcoming first-quarter results looks bright. Per the Earnings Preview, the broader Medical sector (inclusive of drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is expected to record 6.3% year-over-year growth in revenues and a 7.8% rise in earnings.How to Pick Potential Q1 WinnersGiven the enormity of the healthcare space, the task of selecting stocks with possibilities to beat estimates could appear quite daunting. But the Zacks proprietary methodology makes this job fairly simple. One way to carve out the top choices this reporting cycle is by looking at the stocks with the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP. It is observed that a positive earnings surprise delivered by a company mostly leads to its stock price appreciation.Per the well-researched quantitative model, an Earnings ESP is used for identifying stocks with higher or 70% chances of pulling off a positive surprise in the impending earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proven methodology, we culled three stocks from large-cap pharma and two from the medical-drug sector, poised to surpass estimates in the to-be-reported quarter.The three large cap stocks are as follows:Our first pick is AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report). This North Chicago, IL-based company has an Earnings ESP of +0.24% and a Zacks Rank #3. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2018 earnings being pegged at $1.78 per share. Besides this, the company boasts an encouraging earnings track record, exceeding expectations in all the last four quarters with an average beat of 1.81%. AbbVie is scheduled to report earnings numbers on Apr 26.Our next choice is Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report). The stock has an Earnings ESP of +0.73% and a Zacks Rank #2. The consensus mark for first-quarter earnings stands at $1.13 per share. Headquartered in Indianapolis, IN, Lilly has an excellent positive earnings surprise history. The company’s average beat over the trailing four quarters is 4.08%. Lilly is slated to announce results on Apr 24.Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) too has a pleasing earnings profile with the company having consistently outpaced expectations in all the last four quarters with an average beat of 4.97%. It looks perfectly poised to repeat this winning streak this time around as well. This New York-based player is Zacks #2 Ranked and has an Earnings ESP of +2.62%. The consensus mark for first-quarter bottom line is pegged at 73 cents per share. Pfizer is scheduled to release financial figures on May 1.Given below are the two medical-drug stocks:Our first pick from the medical-drug sector is Catalent, Inc. (CTLT  -  Free Report). This New Jersey-based company has an Earnings ESP of +1.70% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 39 cents per share. The company flaunts a positive earnings surprise record, outshining expectations in all the last four quarters with an average beat of 16.44%. Catalent is expected to report earnings on May 3.Our next choice is Aratana Therapeutics, Inc. (PETX  -  Free Report). The stock has an Earnings ESP of +37.14% and is a #3 Ranked player. The consensus mark for first-quarter loss stands at 18 cents per share. Based in Kansas, Aratana has an outstanding earnings history with consecutive estimate beats in the trailing four quarters, the average being 11.74%.

2062,ABBV,"Key highlights of the week include FDA’s acceptance of Regeneron/Sanofi's Dupixent sBLA for asthma, Biogen/AbbVie’s decision to withdraw multiple sclerosis drug, Zinbryta, due to risk of liver failure and Celgene’s completion of Juno acquisition.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesRegeneron/Sanofi's Dupixent sBLA for Asthma Accepted by FDA: Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report) and partner Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has accepted for review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) of Dupixent (dupilumab) as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults and adolescents (12 years of age or older) with moderate-to-severe asthma. The FDA has set a target action date of Oct 20, 2018 per the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. The sBLA was supported by results from the three pivotal trials from the LIBERTY ASTHMA clinical development program. Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of clinical development programs for diseases driven by Type 2 inflammation, including pediatric atopic dermatitis (phase III), nasal polyps (phase III) and eosinophilic esophagitis (phase III).(Read more: FDA Accepts Regeneron/Sanofi's Dupixent sBLA for Asthma)Regeneron is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.

Both companies decided to withdraw the drug on grounds of the complex and evolving benefit/risk profile of Zinbryta, given the limited number of patients being treated.  The drug is currently available in Europe and United States, Switzerland, Canada and Australia. While AbbVie distributes Zinbryta in the United States, Biogen distributes the drug in ex-U.S. markets.  The European regulatory authorities provisionally restricted the use of Zinbryta in adult patients with highly active relapsing disease despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least one DMT or with rapidly evolving severe relapsing MS who are unsuitable for treatment with other DMTs following the report of a case of fatal fulminant liver failure, as well as four cases of serious liver injury.Gilead Reports New Data on Biktarvy: Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) announced encouraging results at 48 weeks from a phase III study (Study 1961) among 470 virologically suppressed adult women with HIV infection at the International Workshop on HIV and Women and at the 2018 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (“CROI”) in Boston (Poster 2539). Biktarvy was found to be statistically non-inferior to regimens containing a bPI or boosted elvitegravir and demonstrated no treatment-emergent resistance at 48 weeks in the ongoing study. Biktarvy, Gilead’s latest triple therapy, was approved by the FDA in February 2018 as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults who have no antiretroviral treatment history.(Read more: Gilead Announces Positive Data on New HIV Therapy Biktarvy)Celgene Completes Juno Acquisition: Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) announced that it has completed the previously-announced acquisition of Juno Therapeutics, Inc for $9 billion Juno focuses on the development of CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T and TCR (T cell receptor) therapeutics with a promising pipeline evaluating multiple targets and cancer indications.

2063,ABBV,"President Donald Trump’s biggest tax overhaul in decades has raised the appeal of buyback ETFs. This is especially true as a massive $1.4-trillion tax cut and the repatriation policy have prompted companies from almost every sector to boost their multi-billion dollar share buyback program this year.Notably, approximately $2.6 trillion in American corporate profits are sitting in overseas bank accounts, about half of that being in cash. The new tax law encourages these companies to bring this cash back home at much reduced rates (read: How Will Tax Reform Affect Buyback and Dividend ETFs?).U.S. companies have announced $209 billion worth of share buyback since the beginning of this year, according to the latest report from Senate Democrats. A California-based research firm TrimTabs stated that the pace of buybacks had exploded in February to a record $153.7 billion from $59.9 billion in January. Among the largest share repurchases so far, Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) has been on the forefront, with its additional $25 billion buyback plan. This was followed by $22.6 billion for Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), $15 billion for Pepsico (PEP  -  Free Report), $10 billion for Abbvie (ABBV  -  Free Report) and $10 billion for Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report).Given this optimism, 2018 is expected to be the second-busiest year for buybacks since the bull market began in 2009 as U.S. companies are on track to return a record $1 trillion to their shareholders. An analyst at J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report) expects companies on the S&P 500 index to buy back as much as $800 billion in shares of their own stock this year, representing a whopping jump of 51% (i.e. $300 billion) from $530 billion repurchased last year.About $100 billion of additional buybacks is the result of the tax savings and stronger earnings while $200 billion will be generated from the repatriation bonanza. Another analyst at Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) projects that buybacks will rise 23% this year to $650 billion (read: Top-Ranked Sector ETFs & Stocks From Top Industries).As a result, investors should take advantage of the ongoing boom in share buybacks through the following three ETFs:SPDR S&P 500 Buyback ETF (SPYB  -  Free Report)This fund focuses on the 101 top companies in the S&P 500 with the highest buyback ratio in the last 12 months. It follows the S&P 500 Buyback Index, charging investors 35 bps in annual fees. From a sector look, financials and consumer discretionary take the largest share with 28.8% and 23.9% allocation, respectively, while information technology and healthcare round off the next spots. The product has a lower AUM of $15.7 million and trades in a paltry volume of around 3,000 shares a day on average (read: Buyback ETF Hits New 52-Week High). PowerShares Buyback Achievers Portfolio (PKW  -  Free Report)    This ETF tracks the NASDAQ US Buyback Achievers Index, which comprises companies that have repurchased 5% or more of their common stock in the trailing 12 months. It holds 131 stocks in its basket and charges a higher annual fee of 63 bps. Here also, financials and consumer discretionary are the top two sectors, with at least 29% share each, closely followed by consumer staples (15.3%). PKW is the popular fund in the buyback space, managing an asset base of nearly $1.4 billion and trading in an average daily volume of 67,000 shares.AdvisorShares Wilshire Buyback ETF (TTFS  -  Free Report)This is an actively managed fund that seeks to generate long-term capital appreciation by investing in stocks with liquidity and fundamental characteristics that are historically associated with superior long-term performance.

2064,ABBV,"Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced encouraging 48-weeks results from a phase III study (Study 1961) among 470 virologically suppressed adult women with HIV infection at the International Workshop on HIV and Women and at the 2018 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (“CROI”) in Boston (Poster 2539).The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of switching from a boosted protease inhibitor (bPI) or boosted elvitegravir-containing regimen to Biktarvy (bictegravir 50mg/emtricitabine 200mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25mg), a once-daily single tablet regimen (“STR”).    Biktarvy was found to be statistically non-inferior to regimens containing a bPI or boosted elvitegravir and demonstrated no treatment-emergent resistance at 48 weeks in the ongoing study.The study data showed that women who switched to Biktarvy maintained high levels of viral suppression, comparable to those who remained on a baseline regimen of either Genvoya, Stribild or ATV+RTV+FTC/TDF. Moreover, none of the participants on Biktarvy developed treatment-emergent resistance.Biktarvy, Gilead’s latest triple therapy, was approved by the FDA in February 2018 as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults who have no antiretroviral treatment history or to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen for at least three months with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to the individual components of Biktarvy.Meanwhile, the HIV franchise continues to gain traction on the back of rapid adoption of TAF-based regimens in the United States and EU. The TAF-based regimens now represent 62% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya along with Odefsey and Descovy in 2016.A marketing authorization application for Biktarvy is under review in the European Union. Meanwhile, additional clinical trials of Biktarvy are ongoing, including a study in adolescents and children with HIV. The approval of this new HIV therapy will pose stiff competition to GlaxoSmith’s (GSK  -  Free Report) existing therapies, Tivicay and Triumeq.  Gilead’s stock has lost 4.8% in the last six months compared with the industry's  decline of 9.8%.Gilead is banking on its HIV franchise which has been under tremendous pressure for a while due to lower patient starts and increased competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) therapies.Zacks Rank & Key PickGilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the health care sector is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Regeneron’s earnings per share estimates have moved up from $17.13 to $18.65 and from $20.37 to $21.56 for 2018 and 2019, respectively in the last 30 days. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 9.15%.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2065,ABBV,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) kicked off 2018 pharma earnings on a strong note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts in the first quarter of 2018. The drug and consumer products giant upped its previously issued sales outlook for 2018. Shares were up around 1% in pre-market trading.This year so far, J&J’s shares have declined 5.7%, comparing unfavorably with the 2.7% decline witnessed by the industry.Earnings BeatJ&J’s first-quarter 2018 earnings came in at $2.06 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.01 and increasing 12.6% from the year-ago period.Adjusted earnings excluded amortization expense and some special items. Including these items, J&J reported first-quarter earnings of $1.60 per share compared with earnings of $1.61 in the year-ago period.Sales Beat SlightlySales came in at $20 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.48 billion. Sales also increased 12.6% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting an operational increase of 8.4% and a positive currency impact of 4.2%. Organically, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, sales increased 4.3% on an operational basis, better than 2.4% increase seen in 2017. This is because the Pharmaceutical segment continued the positive momentum seen in the second half of 2017 and the Consumer segment sales improved.First-quarter sales grew 6.1% in the domestic market to $9.95 billion and 19.9% in international markets to $10 billion, reflecting 10.9% operational growth and 9% positive currency impact.Sales in DetailsPharmaceutical segment sales rose 19.4% year over year to $9.84 billion, reflecting 15.1% operational growth and 4.3% positive currency impact as sales rose in both domestic and international markets. Sales in the domestic market rose 9.9% to $5.35 billion while international sales grew 33.1% to $4.49 billion (operational increase of 22.5%).New products like Imbruvica (cancer) and Darzalex (multiple myeloma) continued to perform well. Core products like Xarelto, Stelara, Zytiga, Simponi/Simponi Aria and Invega Sustenna also contributed to growth. Please note that J&J markets Imbruvica in partnership with AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report).Organically, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, sales increased 7.5% on an operational basis, slightly less than 7.6% growth seen in the previous quarter.In the quarter, J&J recorded pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) revenues of $585 million, less than $610 million in the previous quarter. The $30 billion acquisition of Swiss biotech,Actelion in June last year diversified J&J’s revenues to the PAH category and added 7.6% to sales growth in the first quarter.However, sales of Invokana/Invokamet declined 12.7% due to higher managed care discounting. Importantly, sales of the blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, Remicade, marketed in partnership with Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report), was down 16.9% in the quarter with U.S. sales declining 22.5%. However, international sales rose 1.8% despite biosimilar competition.J&J’s Pharma segment achieved some clinical milestones during the quarter including FDA approvals of prostate cancer drug, Erleada for the treatment of men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and line extension of already marketed prostate cancer drug, Zytiga in combination with prednisone in the first-line setting.Medical Devices segment sales came in at $6.77 billion, up 7.5% from the year-ago period. It included an operational increase of 3.2% and positive currency movement of 4.3%.Domestic market sales rose 2.2% year over year to $3.16 billion. International market sales increased 12.7% (operational increase of 4.2%) year over year to $3.61 billion.The Consumer segment recorded revenues of $3.4 billion in the reported quarter, up 5.3% year over year(operational increase of 1.3%). Foreign currency movement positively impacted sales in the segment by 4%. Sales in the domestic market rose 1.6% from the year-ago period to $1.44 billion.Meanwhile, the international segment recorded an increase of 8.2% to 1.96 billion, reflecting an operational increase of 1.2% and a positive currency impact of 7%.2018 Outlook J&J maintained the previously issued earnings guidance for 2018 while increasing the sales range.J&J still expects 2018 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $8.00 - $8.20, reflecting an operational growth rate between 6.8% and 9.6%.However, now it expects revenues in the range of $81.0 to $81.8 billion, higher than $80.6 billion to $81.4 billion, reflecting operational constant currency sales growth rate in the range of 4% to 5% (previously 3.5% to 4.5%).Our TakeThough quite a few key products in J&J’s portfolio like Remicade and Concerta face generic competition, we believe that new products like plaque psoriasis drug, Tremfya (guselkumab), cancer drugs, Darzalex, Imbruvica and Zytiga, currency tailwinds and contribution from acquisitions helped J&J deliver strong sales and profit in the first quarter of the year and led it to raise the sales outlook for the whole year. In fact, J&J is quite confident that its Pharma segment will continue to perform better than the market this year despite impact of biosimilars on Remicade sales, as told by chief financial officer, Dominic J. Caruso to Bloomberg.Meanwhile, J&J announced some global supply chain initiatives, which will annually save approximately $600 million to $800 million in pre-tax costs by 2022. Meanwhile, Alex Gorsky, chairman and chief executive officer of J&J said that the company will invest more than $30 billion in R&D and capital investments in the United States over the next four years. The new tax laws will leave some extra cash in the hands of large pharma companies like J&J, allowing them to invest in innovation and capital building.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderJ&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Johnson & Johnson Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Johnson & Johnson Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Johnson & Johnson QuoteA better-ranked stock is Pfizer, Inc.

2066,ABBV,"After rising 16.3% last year, the Large Cap Pharmaceutical industry has risen 1.9% this year so far. It has however underperformed the 4% gain for the S&P 500 in the same time frame.Though the sector was off to a strong start in 2018, it struggled a little thereafter probably on broader market correction. Also, the mention of high drug prices by President Donald Trump in his State of the Union address hurt investor sentiment. However, the sector is largely expected to rebound as the year progresses.2017 was a good year for pharma and biotech stocks with the sector witnessing some positive developments that led to a much-awaited recovery.The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gained 11.8% in 2017, in sharp contrast to the decline witnessed in 2016, which was a tough year for pharma stocks given the furor over rising drug prices.A key reason for the sector’s improved performance was the willingness of investors to look beyond the drug pricing controversy and focus more on fundamentals instead. Although the drug pricing controversy will remain a headline risk, investors appear more comfortable with the issue. Moreover, a significantly higher number of FDA approvals in 2017 restored investor confidence in the sector. The approval of the first gene cell therapy last year was a major breakthrough for the sector.Coming back to 2018, we believe that new product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals, continued strong performance from key products, growing demand for drugs especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should keep the sector on track. A faster drug approval process and the proposed removal of outdated regulations that drive up costs and slow down innovation should also provide benefits.Possibilities of more mergers and acquisitions (M&As) are also high now that the tax reform is in place and big players are on the lookout for companies with innovative pipelines/technology. There has already been quite a bit of M&A buzz this year about potential deals. Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) have already announced two deals each.Meanwhile, with the Large-Cap Pharma industry being among the top 30% of the 256 Zacks-ranked industries, it would make sense to look at some Buy-ranked stocks in the space.Investing in stocks with a large market cap is a much more reliable investment because of the fact that they control a large portion of their given industry. Also companies with a larger market cap have performed well in 2017 and look well poised to earn higher profits in 2018.Here is a look at four large-cap pharma companies that sport a favorable Zacks Rank -- #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).H. Lundbeck A/S (HLUYY  -  Free Report)Denmark-based Lundbeck specializes in psychiatric and neurological disorders. The company’s key areas of focus include depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. According to Lundbeck, about 700 million people across the world suffer from psychiatric and neurological disorders with many receiving inadequate treatment.YTD, Lundbeck has outperformed the Large-Cap Pharmaceutical industry with shares gaining 4.7%. In addition to delivering revenue growth of 12% (in local currencies) in 2017, Lundbeck issued an upbeat outlook for 2018. Estimated earnings growth for the current year is 31.2%. Meanwhile, earnings estimates for 2019 are up 8.5% over the past 30 days.AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report)AbbVie beat estimates for both earnings and sales in the fourth quarter. It also raised its earnings expectations for 2018 based on continued strong operational performance. AbbVie’s key drug, Humira has been performing well based on strong demand trends, despite new competition. AbbVie’s shares have outperformed the industry in the past year, supported by a series of positive news including promising data from several pivotal studies, regulatory nods, including approval for its competitive HCV medicine Mavyret and two approvals for Imbruvica, and settlement of its Humira patent disputes with biotech major, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report).AbbVie’s shares are up an impressive 22.3% this year so far, outperforming the industry.Estimated earnings growth for the current year is 33.9%. Meanwhile, estimates for 2018 and 2019 are up 8.4% and 7% respectively, over the past 30 days.Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report)New York-based, Pfizer is one of the most well-known names in the pharmaceutical sector not just for its medicines and vaccines but also for its consumer healthcare products.Pfizer reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2017 results as it beat estimates for earnings as well as sales and provided an upbeat outlook for 2018. We believe that Pfizer’snew products like Ibrance, contribution from acquisitions, cost cuts and share buybacks should help the company earn profits in the future quarters. Pfizer’s shares have risen 1.6% this year so far.Estimated earnings growth for the current year is 11.3%. Meanwhile, estimates for 2018 and 2019 are up 6.1% and 4.1%, respectively, over the past 30 days.Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report)The year 2017 was eventful for this Denmark-based pharma giant as it gained regulatory approvals for some key pipeline drugs/candidates including fast-acting insulin aspart - Fiasp, once-daily pre-filled pen - Ozempic and hemophilia B treatment Rebinyn. Meanwhile, strong performance of Victoza is driving top-line growth. We believe these new products and a solid pipeline will pave the way for growth this year for the company.Over the past 30 days, earnings estimates have risen 1.5% and 4.9%, respectively, for 2018 and 2019. Estimated earnings growth for the current year is 13.7%.While Pfizer, AbbVie and Novo Nordisk are all Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks, Lundbeck is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.

2067,ABBV,"Shire plc (SHPG  -  Free Report) announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement with French company, Servier to sell its Oncology business. The deal is valued at $2.4 billion and includes global rights to leukemia drug, Oncaspar, and ex-U.S. rights to pancreatic cancer drug, Onivyde. Servier will also add another leukemia drug, Calaspargase Pegol, to its portfolio, which is under review in the United States.Shire’s oncology segment also includes immuno-oncology pipeline collaborations, comprising multiple early stage studies. Although the oncology segment has delivered high growth and profitability, it contributed lower than 2% to product sales in 2017.The company has initiated the sale of this segment as part of its long-term strategy to focus on rare disease leadership. Shire plans to return the proceeds from the sale to its shareholders through a share buyback. However, the buyback program will be initiated after Takeda Pharmaceutical’s  potential offer to acquire Shire, which is expected by Apr 25.Per the terms of the recent agreement, Servier will acquire the segment in an all cash deal, which is valued at an attractive revenue multiple of 9.2 times of 2017 revenues. The deal is not subject to shareholder approval and is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2018.Shire is also looking to dispose of other non-strategic assets as part of the strategy.Shire shares have decreased 1.7% so far this year, comparing favorably with the industry’s decline of 3.2% in that period.Although investors cheered the news of a potential buyout of Shire by Takeda, with the sale of the oncology segment, Takeda is expected to reconsider its decision before making an offer. Oncology was one of the three core therapeutic areas which Takeda was looking to strengthen through Shire’s acquisition.However, a deal between Takeda and Shire is still expected to bring strategic synergies. Takeda acquired ARIAD Pharmaceuticals last year in a bid to strengthen and diversify its oncology business. The sale of Shire’s oncology segment may bring down the acquisition cost for Takeda.The investor community also believes that a formal takeover offer from Takeda may also trigger bids from other companies, which previously showed interest in Shire including AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report).Demand for companies with rare disease drugs in their portfolio or pipeline candidates are rising. This is evident from the billion dollar deals signed this year. Novartis is acquiring AveXis for $8.7 billion while Sanofi has spent nearly $16 billion to boost its rare blood disorder pipeline.Shire plc Price  Shire plc Price | Shire plc QuoteShire carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

2068,ABBV,"The last week has been an eventful one for pharma stocks with Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) announcing that it is acquiring gene therapy company AveXis while Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced successful study results. In other news, Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) kidney cancer drug, Inlyta missed primary endpoint in a phase III study.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesNovartis to Buy AveXis for $8.7 Billion: The big news early in the week was Novartis’ $8.7 billion deal to buy AveXis whose lead product candidate AVXS-101 is a one-time gene replacement therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). A regulatory filing for AVXS-101 in the United States is expected in the second half of this year. AVXS-101 has the potential to generate millions of dollars for Novartis, if approved. The company agreed to pay $218 for each share of AveXis, representing a whooping premium of 88% to AveXis’ closing price on Friday.With boards of both the companies having approved the deal, the buyout is anticipated to close in the second half of the year. (Read More: Novartis Inks $8.7 Billion Gene Therapy Deal to Buy AveXis)Merck’s Keytruda Succeeds in Another Key Lung Cancer Study: A pivotal lung cancer study, KEYNOTE-042, on Merck’s blockbuster PD-1 inhibitor, Keytruda met the primary endpoint. The KEYNOTE-042 study evaluated patients with locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous or squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors express PD-L1 protein levels of 1 percent or greater  (TPS of ≥1 percent). In such patients, Keytruda showed a significant survival benefit compared with platinum-based chemotherapy.Notably, Keytruda monotherapy is already marketed for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 protein levels of 50 percent or greater (TPS of ≥50 percent).If the OS data from KEYNOTE-042 study are approved to be included in Keytruda’s label, the drug can be prescribed to treat an expanded lung cancer patient population, further reinforcing its position in the lung cancer market. (Read More: Merck’s Keytruda Offers Survival Benefit in Lung Cancer Study)AbbVie’s 4th Late-Stage Upadacitinib Study Succeeds: AbbVie’s oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib, met all primary as well as secondary endpoints in the 4th phase III study from its SELECT program. The phase III study, SELECT-COMPARE, evaluated the candidate for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in patients who are on a stable background of methotrexate and elicited an inadequate response.After 12 weeks of treatment, the ACR20 response — the first primary endpoint — was achieved in 71% of the patients receiving the 15 mg dose of upadacitinib versus 36% for placebo. The second primary endpoint of clinical remission was achieved by 29% of the patients in the upadacitinib arm versus only 6% in the placebo arm. (Read More: AbbVie's RA Candidate Meets Primary Endpoints in Phase III)Meanwhile, the FDA has extended the review period for AbbVie’s pipeline candidate elagolix by three months. The FDA’s decision, previously expected in the second quarter, will now come in the third quarter. (Read More: FDA Prolongs Review Date for AbbVie Endometriosis Candidate)Pfizer’s Inlyta Misses Primary Endpoint in Phase III Study: Pfizer’s kidney cancer drug Inlyta (axitinib) failed to demonstrate a clear improvement in the primary endpoint of extending disease-free survival (DFS) compared with placebo in the phase III ATLAS study. Accordingly, an independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended the study be stopped at a planned interim analysis. (Read More: Pfizer’s Kidney Cancer Drug Misses Endpoint in Phase III).Pfizer also announced initiation of dosing in an early-stage study evaluating its mini-dystrophin gene therapy candidate, PF-06939926, for the treatment of boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most common type of muscular dystrophy. Early data from the study is expected in the first half of 2019.Pacira’s Exparel Gets FDA Nod for Expanded Label: Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (PCRX  -  Free Report) supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for label expansion of Exparel in the nerve block setting for patients undergoing upper extremity surgeries got the FDA nod. The FDA’s approval came as a surprise after an FDA Committee voted six to four against approval of the expanded indication in February. (Read More: FDA Okays Label Expansion of Pacira's Exparel's, Stock Up)Exparel generated sales of $282.9 million in 2017, representing an increase of 6% from 2016.

2069,ABBV,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) has one of the most diverse revenue streams in the industry within the pharmaceutical division that accounts for almost half of its revenues. The company has several multi-million dollar drugs covering a broad range of areas such as neuroscience, cardiovascular and metabolism; immunology; oncology; pulmonary hypertension; and infectious diseases/vaccines. However, several products in this segment are facing generic competition.J&J’s stock has depreciated 6.1% this year so far, comparing unfavorably with a decline of 1.7% recorded by the industry.J&J’s domestic Pharma segment sales witnessed a positive trend in the second half of 2017 after being soft in the first half of the year. We are likely to see the positive impact of the trend in first-quarter results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Pharmaceutical segment is $9.51 billion. Last quarter, the segment’s sales beat the consensus estimate.We believe that new products, continued share gains of some key products, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica, Xarelto, Stelara and Darzalex, and meaningful contribution from Swiss biotech Actelion that J&J bought in June, will support the top line.Continued share gains should drive sales of Imbruvica (cancer indications), Xarelto (blood thinner), Zytiga (prostate cancer) and Stelara (psoriasis). Meanwhile, strong adoption for the newer indication of Crohn's disease should continue contributing to Stelara growth. J&J also gained FDA approval for Zytiga in first-line setting in February, which can drive sales of the drug higher in the first quarter. Please note that J&J markets Imbruvica in partnership with AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report).Also, strong adoption in outside U.S. markets and accelerated adoption in the United States across all lines of therapy should drive sales of Darzalex. These positives will likely offset the loss of sales of some drugs like Invokana due to higher managed care discounting. Meanwhile, biosimilar competition is expected to continue hurting key arthritis drug Remicade’s sales outside the United States. J&J markets Remicade in partnership with Merck (MRK  -  Free Report).Regarding newly launched Tremfya, J&J said at the fourth-quarter conference call that the uptake of the product has been decent. The drug recorded sales of $47 million in the last quarter, which are expected to be higher in the to-be reported quarter. Also, J&J should discuss the initial sales uptake of Juluca at the call — the first dual treatment for HIV developed in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) — that gained FDA approval in last November. Juluca is under review in the EU.Meanwhile, we expect J&J to discuss commercialization plans for Erleada, its newly approved prostate cancer drug, at the first-quarter conference call.Overall, in2018, J&J expects the Pharmaceutical segment to remain strong while the Consumer and Medical Device segments will continue to improve.

2070,ABBV,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended that two of its hematology medicines be granted marketing authorizations in the EU. However, the committee gave a negative opinion, recommending against label expansion of Pfizer’s kidney cancer medication, Sutent.The CHMP recommended approval of Mylotarg in combination with standard chemotherapy for the treatment of patients aged 15 years and above with newly diagnosed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML), except acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Mylotarg was approved in the United States in September last year.CHMP also granted a positive opinion for the label expansion of another leukemia drug Bosulif for the first-line treatment of patients suffering from chronic phase Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Bosulif was approved in the first-line setting for Ph+ CML in the United States in December last year.However, the CHMP recommended against approving the label expansion of Sutent as an adjuvant treatment in patients at high risk of recurrent advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), following nephrectomy (surgical removal of the cancer-containing kidney).Please note that Sutent was approved for use in the same patient population in the United States in November last year. It is the only adjuvant therapy approved for recurrent RCC, the most common type of kidney cancer.Though the European Commission (EC) is not bound to follow the CHMP’s opinion, it usually does so.Bosulif recorded sales of $40 million in the developed Europe region in 2017, recording growth of 43% year over year while Sutent’s sales of $323 million in the same region declined 4%.Shares of Pfizer are up 2.4% so far this year, comparing favorably with a 0.7% increase for the industry.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderPfizer carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2071,ABBV,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 9.7% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is ABBV due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.AbbVie Tops Q4 Earnings & Revenues, Ups 2018 GuidanceAbbVie reported better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter of 2017. Importantly, it raised its earnings expectations for 2018 based on continued strong operational performance and lower tax rates.AbbVie reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.48 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate $1.44 by 2.8% and came ahead of the guided range of $1.42 and $1.44. Earnings grew 23.3% year over year. Strong sales performance and higher operating profits led to the bottom-line beat.Including a charge related to the recent tax law changes and other one-time/special items, earnings were 3 cents per share compared with 85 cents in the year-ago quarter.Revenues of $7.74 billion in the reported quarter marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.6 billion. Sales increased 13.9% year over year. Excluding a 1.5% favorable impact from foreign exchange rate fluctuations, operational revenues rose 12.6% backed by continued strong performances by Humira and Imbruvica and solid initial uptake of Mavyret. Operational revenue growth also surpassed management expectations of approximately 10% growth.Quarter in DetailsHumira recorded sales growth of 14% (12.3% on an operational basis) with revenues coming in at $4.89 billion, reflecting continued strong demand trends. Sales in the United States increased 15.1% to $3.3 billion.Humira sales in the ex-U.S. market were up 6.5% on operational basis and 11.7% on a reported basis to $1.58 billion.In 2018, Humira sales growth in the United States is expected to be approximately 13% to 14% while internationally, Humira sales are expected to peak at approximately $6.2 billion.Fourth-quarter net revenues from Imbruvica were $708 million, up 38.7% year over year.  This included Imbruvica U.S. sales of $585 million, up 35.3% and $123 million (up 57.8%) of international profit sharing. Continued uptake in the front-line CLL market and steady gains across other indications led to the strong performance of Imbruvica.In 2017, AbbVie met its expectations of recording Imbruvica global revenues of more than $2.4 billion with sales in the United States crossing $2 billion. In 2018, Imbruvica global revenues are expected to exceed $3.3 billion with sales in the United States likely to cross $2.7 billion.Other products that performed well include Lupron (224 million, up 1.8% year over year) Duodopa ($100 million, up 21.3% year over year) and Creon ($235 million, up 10.6%).Despite competitive dynamics in the HCV market, AbbVie HCV sales, including Viekira and Mavyret, were $510 million in the quarter, up 62.7% on an operational basis. Strong uptake of Mavyret in the United States and international markets led to the increase.On the call, management mentioned that Mavyret has witnessed strong uptake both in the United States and internationally.In 2018, global HCV sales are expected to exceed $2.5 billion with a roughly equal split between U.S. and outside U.S.  markets.Adjusted SG&A expenses inched up 0.9% to $1.64 billion. However, as a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses declined 270 bps to 21.2% driven by sales leverage and operational efficiencies. R&D expenses escalated 12.5% to $1.32 billion in the quarter due to greater investments in the pipeline. Adjusted operating margin was 40.7% of sales in the reported quarter, up 90 bps year over year.2017 ResultsFull-year sales jumped 10.1% year over year on an operational basis to $28.2 billion. Sales outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $28 billion. Revenue growth was in line with expectations of 10% growth on an operational basis.Adjusted earnings of $5.60 per share for the full year exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.56 as well as the guided range of $5.53-$5.55. Earnings rose 16.2% year over year.2018 OutlookAbbVie raised its adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $7.33-$7.43 for 2018 from $6.37-$6.57 predicted earlier. Consistently strong organic growth coupled with tax rate reductions as result of the recent U.S. tax reforms propelled the increase in earnings guidance. The guidance reflects a year-over-year increase of 32% at the mid-point.Revenues are expected to approach $32 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of approximately 13%. Currency impact is expected to benefit revenues by 1.5% in 2018.While R&D expense is expected to be roughly 16% of sales, SG&A is expected to be just over 20% of sales. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 44%, roughly 150 basis points above 2017 levels. Adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 9% in 2018. The normalized tax rate expectation over next five years is 13%.On the call, the company said that it plans to invest approximately $2.5 billion in capital projects in the United States over the next five years on increased access to foreign cash following the U.S. tax reforms. In addition, the company will accelerate its pension funding by $750 million and also plans to contribute $350 million to select not-for-profit organizations.First-Quarter 2018 OutlookFirst-quarter earnings are expected between $1.77 and $1.79. Revenues are estimated to grow in a mid-teen range on an operational basis. Foreign exchange is expected to have a 3% favorable impact on sales in the first quarter.U.S. Humira sales are expected to grow in a low-teens range year over year. Internationally, operational sales growth is expected in the mid single-digits range. Imbruvica U.S. sales are expected to grow in the mid single-digits range sequentially over the fourth quarter.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been three revisions higher for the current quarter. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted by 19% due to these changes.AbbVie Inc. Price and Consensus  AbbVie Inc.

2072,ABBV,"Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) is partnering with Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Biologics Co., Ltd. to commercialize a biosimilar to AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) blockbuster arthritis drug Humira (adalimumab). Adalimumab is developed by Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Biologics.Mylan intends to seek approval and commercialize the product in Europe. The European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) accepted a marketing authorization application for review for the proposed biosimilar to Humira in May 2017, and the companies expect to receive the EMA’s decision during the second half of 2018. Under the agreement, Mylan will have an exclusive license to commercialize the biosimilar in Europe and will receive an upfront fee from Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin. The company will also be responsible for the sales activity of the product in European countries. On the other hand, Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Biologics will be eligible to receive a subsequent commercialization milestone payment and sales royalties. Over a year, shares of Mylan increased 6.2% compared with the industry’s fall of 27.9%.Humira is a TNF-inhibitor aimed at treating multiple chronic inflammatory conditions. It is approved in Europe for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, plaque psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa and uveitis.We note that few days ago, Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) and partner Samsung Bioepis announced resolution of an ongoing patent dispute with AbbVie regarding Biogen’s biosimilar version (Imraldi) of AbbVie’s Humira, in the EU. Per the settlement agreement, Biogen/Samsung Bioepis plans to launch Imraldi in Europe on Oct 16, 2018.Also in the United States, Samsung Bioepis entered into a settlement agreement with AbbVie, which would allow the former to bring Humira biosimilar into the U.S. market by Jan 31, 2023.Notably, Imraldi is the second biosimilar version of Humira to be launched in the EU. Another biotechnology company, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), is also expected to launch its biosimilar version of Humira, in the EU come October this year as Amjevita, per a settlement with AbbVie.Notably, Amjevita was approved in the EU last March and approved in the United States in September 2016.In the United States, per settlement with AbbVie, Amjevita is likely to be launched on Jan 31, 2023.Mylan N.V.

2073,ABBV,"We expect Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), a healthcare bellwether, to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on April 17, before market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.16%.J&J’s performance has been pretty impressive, with the company exceeding earnings expectations in all the trailing four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 3.09%The J&J stock has depreciated 6.6% this year so far, which compares unfavorably with a decline of 1.0% recorded by the industry.Factors to ConsiderJ&J’s sales growth accelerated in the second half of 2017, backed by higher sales in the Pharmaceutical segment and improving performance in Medical Devices.In 2018, J&J expects the Pharmaceutical segment to remain strong, while the Consumer and Medical Device segments will likely continue to improve.We believe new products in all segments, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica, Xarelto, Stelara and Darzalex, and meaningful contribution from Swiss biotech — Actelion — which J&J bought in June last year, will support the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales from the Pharmaceutical segment in Q1 is $9.5 billion.However, in the fourth quarter of 2017, revenues from pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) products — added from the Actelion acquistion —declined sequentially. It is to be seen if PAH revenues improve in Q1.Meanwhile, biosimilar competition is expected to continue to hurt sales of the key arthritis drug — Remicade — outside the United States.However, J&J does not expect any biosimilar entrants for Zytiga, Prezista, Risperdal Consta, or Invega Sustenna in the United States this year.Regarding the newly-launched Tremfya, J&J noted at the Q4 conference call that the uptake of the product has been decent. The drug recorded sales of $47 million in Q4 which is expected to be higher in the to-be reported quarter. Meanwhile, we expect J&J to discuss commercialization plans for Erleada, its newly-approved prostate cancer drug, at the Q1 conference call. Also, J&J will discuss the initial sales uptake of Juluca— the first dual treatment for HIV developed in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) —  which received the FDA approval in November last year. Juluca is under review in the EU.In the Medical Devices segment, sales are expected to continue to rise in the Vision Care and Cardiovascular units. Diabetes Care unit will continue to remain weak. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales from the Medical Devices segment in Q1 is $6.7 billion.In the Consumer segment, global consumer category slowdown across many of the company’s markets will continue to hurt sales. However, recent acquisitions as well as new products will likely provide some support. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales from the Consumer segment in Q1 is $3.35 billion.Meanwhile, higher investments behind the new product launches will continue to thwart profits.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that J&J is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for a likely positive surprise.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate ($2.03 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($2.01 per share), is +1.16%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: J&J has a Zacks Rank #2. The combination of J&J’s Zacks Rank #2 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other large drug/biotech stocks that have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +1.15% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is scheduled to release results on Apr 26.

2074,ABBV,"Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) and partner Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission has granted marketing approval to its biosimilar version of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) blockbuster cancer drug, Avastin (bevacizumab), Mvasi. The drug was approved in the United States in September.Mvasi is approved in the EU for the treatment of multiple types of cancer. Note that Mvasi is the first bevacizumab biosimilar to be approved in the European Union.The approval was in line with expectations considering the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) had rendered a positive opinion for the approval of Mvasi in November/The approval was supported by a comprehensive data package that demonstrated similarity of Mvasi with bevacizumab.Amgen has collaborated with Allergan for the worldwide development and commercialization of four oncology antibody biosimilar medicines. Other than Mvasi, Amgen/Allergan’s portfolio also includes biosimilar versions of Herceptin (under review in the United States and EU) and Rituxan (in late stage studies)Overall, Amgen has 10 biosimilars in its pipeline including biosimilar versions of Johnson and Johnson/Merck’s Remicade and Alexion’s Soliris.

Per a settlement agreement with AbbVie, Amgen will begin selling Amjevita in most countries in the EU this year and in the United States from January 2023.Amgen’s biosimilar opportunity is likely to translate into annual revenues of more than $3 billion. Amgen has also partnered Daiichi Sankyo for the commercialization of nine biosimilars in Japan.In the past year, Amgen’s shares have returned 21.3% compared with 4.2% increase registered by the industry. Amgen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2075,ABBV,"Investing in sound large-cap pharma stocks seems judicious as they are fundamentally lucrative and ensure a steady stream of cash inflows for the investor.The drug sector had a good run in 2017, bouncing back after drug pricing issues dampened its performance in 2016. Importantly, the sector saw a considerable increase in new drug approvals last year. The FDA approved 46 novel drugs last year, more than double of 2016’s tally of 22.The Large Cap Pharma industry witnessed an impressive rally in 2017, up 16.3% against a decline of 5.2% in 2016. The run was propelled by encouraging quarterly results, increased demand for new product sales, successful innovation and product line expansion. Strong clinical study results and continued strong performance of legacy products also boosted the sector.These factors are expected to play an instrumental role in 2018 as well, which may take the large-cap drug sector to new highs. The industry is already up 3.9% so far this year.Notably, the Large Cap Pharma industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of #100, placing it among the top 39% of the 265 plus Zacks industries. Our back-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one.The passing of the tax overhaul bill by the Congress is a cherry on the top. The slashing of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% is likely to further boost profit margins.Moreover, the cash repatriation window allowed in the bill will help companies to bring in cash stashed in foreign locations, leaving these companies with extra cash in hand. This may lead to strategic deals like merger and acquisitions this year, which were relatively fewer in 2017.Most drug companies with a large market cap have seen their share price rise in 2018 so far. Here we present four companies, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report), Zoetis Inc. (ZTS  -  Free Report) and Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report), which outperformed the industry last year and have the potential to repeat the same performance in 2018.Johnson & JohnsonThe company's stock was up 21.3% in 2017, which compared favorably with a gain of 16.3% recorded by the industry. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company’s shares were boosted by the approval of two drugs, Tremfya for plaque psoriasis and Juluca for HIV, along with several line extensions to its major drugs including Xarelto, Simponi Aria, Stelara and Imbruvicain 2017.The trend is expected to continue in 2018. J&J has several regulatory applications for label expansion of its key drugs under review. Potential approval to these line extensions will certainly boost the company’s growth prospects. Meanwhile, there are several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones lined up for 2018.Moreover, J&J’s pharma segment’s growth accelerated in third quarter of 2017 after slowing down in the first half due to a number of factors including competition for some key drugs like Remicade and Concerta. The upside is expected to continue in 2018.AbbVieThe stock of the company was up 54.4% in 2017. The company holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).In 2017, the company reported a series of positive news including promising data from several pivotal studies, regulatory approvals in the United States, Europe, and Japan for its competitive HCV medicine, Mavyret and FDA approval for the sixth indication for Imbruvica and settlement of its Humira patent disputes with Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report).AbbVie also expects several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones in 2018, which is expected to further aid the company. The data readout from the pivotal phase III TRINITY study on Rova-T in third-line or later small cell lung cancer will be an important catalyst for the stock. Moreover, a FDA decision is expected on the new drug application (""NDA"") for elagolix for endometriosis, which was granted priority review in October last year.AbbVie’s blockbuster drug, Humira, has been performing well despite competitive pressure. The company expects the drug’s performance to continue, which will boost the topline. Imbruvica is also doing consistently well with multibillion dollar potential. AbbVie is exploring the possibility of label expansion into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases.Novo-NordiskShares of the company increased 49.7% in 2017. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3.This company was granted approval to expand the label of its diabetes drug, Victoza, to include treatment of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type II diabetes in August 2017. Moreover, a new diabetes drug, Fiasp, received approval in September 2017 for treating adults with diabetes. In December 2017, the FDA approved Ozempic, a semaglutide once-daily pre-filled pen to improve glycaemic control in type II diabetes patients. It also received approval for Rebinyn for hemophilia B in the United States and Refixia for the treatment of adolescents and adults with the same indication in Europe.In 2018, the company expects a U.S. launch of Ozempic and an approval for the same in Europe, which will certainly boost the company’s revenues.Moreover, the company serves almost half of the insulin market and a quarter of the diabetes market. The growing diabetes market will certainly boost the topline.ZoetisThe company's shares rose 34.6% in 2017. The company sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The company has a diversified portfolio of livestock and companion animal products. In2017, the company increased its share of the dermatology products for dogs market to 59%. The companion animal business has been performing well, along with the launch of Apoquel and Cytopoint. The company acquired Nexvet Biopharma last year, which boosted its pipeline of solutions for chronic pain management in dogs and cats. The company also expanded the reach of its poultry diagnostics products into major European markets.In 2018, Zoetis topline is expected to benefit from Cytopoint, which was launched in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2017. The company expects cattle herd size to increase in 2018, which will drive growth.ConclusionWith a strong product portfolio, consistently successful pipeline developments and anticipated growth in demand for drugs, these companies will likely attract investor attention this year as well.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

2076,ABBV,"Shares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) hit a new 52-week high of $148.32 on Jan 17 and eventually closed the day at $146.98. The stock hit the new high probably on a Reuters news which states that some Chinese bidders are planning to buy a J&J’s diabetes care unit in the country in a deal which could be worth $4 billionAs it is, J&J stock has had a great run in the past year. Shares of J&J have rallied 28.1% over a year while the industry has registered an increase of 21.5%. Promising data from several pivotal studies and rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions over a year kept the stock on a growth trajectory. This positive trend is likely to continue in 2018 as well.The company received approvals for two new drugs last year — Guselkumab/Tremfyain the United Statesas well as in the EU for plaque psoriasisand thefirst dual treatment for HIV, Juluca (dolutegravir + rilpivirine)in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) in the United States. Juluca is under review in the EU.J&J also received FDA approval for several line extensions —  a lower dose of Xarelto, two new indications of Simponi Aria, use in adolescents for Stelara, combination use of Darzalex with Celgene Corporation’s (CELG  -  Free Report) multiple myeloma drug Pomalyst and the sixth indication for Imbruvica, among others. Investors should note that J&J markets Imbruvica in partnership with AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report).The line extensions can expand the eligible patient populations of these drugs and drive sales.Sales of the company’s Pharma segment accelerated in the third quarter and  the trend is likely to continue in the fourth quarter as well asin 2018. We believe that new products in all segments, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica, Xarelto, Stelaraand Darzalex and contribution from recent acquisitions — mainly Actelion — will support top-line growth. This year J&J expects to file for approval of depression candidate, esketaminewhile apalutamidefor pre-metastatic prostate cancerand Symtuza, a darunavir-based once-daily single-tablet regimen for HIVcould be approved by the FDA.With several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones expected in 2018, the bullish run of the stock is likely to continue in 2018. Johnson & Johnson Price Johnson & Johnson Price | Johnson & Johnson Quote Zacks Rank J&J has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2077,ABBV,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) and partner Neurocrine Biosciences announced that the FDA has extended the review period of marketing application for the companies’ pipeline candidate, elagolix, by three months. As a result, the regulatory body will now announce its decision by the third quarter of 2018 instead of the previously anticipated second-quarter 2018 timeline.AbbVie is looking to get elagolix approved as an oral medicine for pain management associated with endometriosis.Last September, the FDA accepted AbbVie's new drug application (NDA) for elagolix and subsequently, granted priority review status in October. However, the regulatory body requested for an extended time frame to review additional information, provided by AbbVie along with its NDA pertaining to liver function test results.Notably, management showed confidence in the company’s data provided to the FDA and continues to work with the regulatory body to bring elagolix to the U.S. market.We remind investors that the NDA filing was supported by positive results from two replicate pivotal phase III trials, evaluating elagolix for the aforementioned indication. The detailed data from the study, presented last October, showed that treatment with elagolix resulted in statistically significant reductions in menstrual and non-menstrual pelvic pain associated with endometriosis compared with placebo.Data from the studies also demonstrated superiority as compared to placebo in alleviating pelvic pain, non-menstrual pelvic pain and painful intercourse associated with endometriosis.Endometriosis affects an estimated one in 10 women of reproductive age and is associated with pain symptoms. At present, there is no cure for the disease. The pain associated with it is currently managed with oral contraceptives, progestins, danazol, NSAIDS, opioids and GnRH agonists. Many medicines are not specifically indicated for treating endometriosis. If approved, elagolix will be the first option for patients in need of an additional treatment to apprehend the disease.AbbVie’s share price has surged 45.4% in a year, comparing favorably with the industry’s 7.5% gain. Meanwhile, Elagolix is also being evaluated in two phase III programs for preventing heavy menstrual bleeding in premenopausal women with uterine fibroids.Importantly, another pharma company Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) also has a pipeline candidate, ulipristal acetate, in its portfolio, which is currently under evaluation for treatment of uterine fibroids. Here too, the FDA in February requested to extend the review period of the company’s NDA for the candidate to August 2018.AbbVie Inc. Price AbbVie Inc. Price | AbbVie Inc.

2078,ABBV,"The biotech sector was on a bumpy ride over the week as shares of Spectrum surged on positive data from a phase II study, while that of Incyte plunged on the failure of melanoma study. In an effort to bolster its presence in the gene therapy space Swiss giant Novartis announced the acquisition of AveXis Inc.Spectrum Surges on Lung Cancer Data: Shares of Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (SPPI  -  Free Report) surged after the company reported encouraging results from a phase II study on poziotinib in EGFR Exon 20 Mutant non-small cell lung cancer patients. The results show that the confirmed objective response rate was 64% in the first 11 patients, better than the expectations of 20% and 30%. These early data suggest that poziotinib may have a meaningful impact on outcomes for patients who have limited treatment options. The median progression-free survival rate has still not been reached after a median follow up period of 6.5 months. Meanwhile, the original cohort of 30 EGFR patients is fully enrolled and the expanded cohort of 20 patients is nearing the completion of enrollment.AveXis Skyrockets on Novartis Deal: AveXis, Inc.’s  shares skyrocketed on the news of a merger with Swiss pharma giant Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report).  Per the agreement, Novartis will pay $8.7 billion for this clinical stage gene therapy company. AveXis lead product candidate, AVXS-101, is being evaluated as one-time gene replacement therapy for spinal muscular atrophy, a disease which results in early death or life-long disability with considerable healthcare costs. The acquisition will poise Novartis in the promising gene therapy space. The acquisition will be completed in mid-2018. The candidate enjoys a breakthrough therapy designation in the United States and Prime designation in Europe. The FDA also granted AVXS-101, a fast track status for the treatment of SMA Type 1.  A regulatory filing in the United States is expected in the second half of this year with a launch anticipated in 2019. (Read more: Novartis Inks $8.7 Billion Gene Therapy Deal to Buy AveXis)Incyte Plunges on Study Failure: Shares of Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) plunged after an external Data Monitoring Committee review of the phase III study, ECHO-301/KEYNOTE-252 evaluating Incyte’s epacadostat in combination with Merck’s Keytruda in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma determined that the study did not meet the primary endpoint of improving progression-free survival in the overall population when compared to Keytruda monotherapy. Moreover, the second primary endpoint of overall survival is not expected to reach statistical significance either. Hence, the study will be stopped.The failure of the late-stage candidate disappointed investors as Incyte had pinned hopes on the success given the improved response rates in mid-stage studies. (Read more: Incyte's Epacadostat Fails in Melanoma Study, Shares Plunge)Conatus Pharmaceuticals Sinks on Study Failure:  Conatus Pharmaceuticals (CNAT  -  Free Report) plummeted after it reported that its pipeline candidate, emricasan, failed in a phase IIB study – POLT-HCV-SVR. The candidate did not achieve primary endpoint in the study, which evaluated patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis undergoing liver transplant.  Data from the POLT-HCV-SVR study showed that emricasan did not achieve a better overall response rate compared to placebo in the overall patient population.However, in patient subset with advanced fibrosis or early cirrhosis, emricasan provided evidence of an anti-fibrotic treatment effect in 95% of the patients compared to 58.3% for placebo. The company may evaluate emricasan further in this particular subset.

2079,ABBV,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) has announced that its pipeline candidate, upadacitinib, met the primary endpoints in the 4th phase III study from its SELECT program, which evaluated the candidate for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Upadacitinib is an investigational oral JAK1-selective inhibitor, which is being studied as a once-a-day oral therapy.The phase III SELECT-COMPARE study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib (15 mg) compared with placebo and AbbVie’s marketed drug, Humira (adalimumab), over 12 weeks on patients with moderate-to-severe RA, who are on a stable background of methotrexate and had an inadequate response. In the study, upadacitinib met both the primary as well as secondary endpoints compared with placebo while showing superiority as compared to Humira.The primary endpoints of the study registered ACR20 responses and clinical remission. Data from the trial demonstrated that 71% of patients receiving the 15 m oral once-daily dose of upadacitinib 15 mg achieved an ACR20 response compared with 36% of patients receiving placebo at week 12. Moreover, 29% of subjects treated with upadacitinib achieved complete remission in comparison to 6% with placebo.Additionally, data from the study also showed that 45% of patients experienced low disease activity (secondary endpoint) when treated with upadacitinib compared with 29% receiving Humira and 14%, receiving placebo at week 12.Notably, SELECT-COMPARE is the fourth of the six ongoing phase III studies under the SELECT RA clinical trial program conducted on upadacitinib.We remind investors that last December, AbbVie announced that upadacitinib met the primary endpoints in the 3rd phase III study from its SELECT trial.Other researches are also underway on upadacitinib for treating Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and atopic dermatitis.Shares of AbbVie have rallied 42.7% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s 6.4% rise.Notably, AbbVie already has a strong presence in the RA market with its blockbuster drug, Humira. However, several companies are working on developing biosimilar versions of Humira which could induce competition in the market for the company. Also, the RA market is extremely crowded including drugs like Johnson & Johnson’s Simponi and UCB’s Cimzia among others.Significantly, Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) JAK inhibitor, Olumiant, was approved in the EU for RA last February and Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xeljanz is marketed in the United States for the same indication, which might pose a strong competition for upadacitinib on approval.Also, of late, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) has announced resolution of the ongoing patent dispute with AbbVie regarding Biogen’s biosimilar version of Humira, in the EU. Per the settlement agreement, Biogen plans to launch Humira biosimilar in Europe by October, 2018.However, if upadacitinib is approved, it might reduce the potential negative impact of Humira generics on AbbVie’s top line.AbbVie Inc.

2080,ABBV,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) and partner Samsung Bioepis have announced resolution of an ongoing patent dispute with AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) regarding Biogen’s biosimilar version (Imraldi) of AbbVie’s blockbuster arthritis drug, Humira, in the EU. Per the settlement agreement, Biogen/Samsung Bioepis plans to launch Imraldi in Europe on Oct 16, 2018.Also in the United States, Samsung Bioepis entered into a settlement agreement with AbbVie, which would allow the former to bring Humira biosimilar into the U.S. market by Jan 31, 2023.Imraldi (or SB5) will be used for a whole range of indications including rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, active enthesitis-related arthritis, hidradenitis suppurativa and non-infectious uveitis.Notably, Imraldi is the second biosimilar version of Humira to be launched in the EU. Another biotechnology company, Amgen (AMGN), is also expected to launch its biosimilar version of Humira, in the EU come October this year as Amjevita, per a settlement with AbbVie.Notably, Amjevita was approved in the EU last March and approved in the United States in September 2016.In the United States, per settlement with AbbVie, Amjevita is likely to be launched on Jan 31, 2023.Shares of Biogen have underperformed its industry this year so far. The stock has lost 16.6% compared with the industry’s decrease of 6.3%.   We remind investors that Biogen has a joint venture with Samsung BioLogics for biosimilars called Samsung Bioepis, which already markets a couple of biosimilars in the EU, namely Flixabi, a biosimilar referencing J&J/Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Remicade and Benepali, a biosimilar referencing Amgen/Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Enbrel. This development in turn makes Imraldi the third anti-TNF biosimilar from Biogen to receive a marketing authorization in the EU.Biogen is also working with Samsung BioLogics to introduce new biosimilars to the market.Importantly, Biogen grossed biosimilar revenues of $380 million for a 12-month period ending December 2017 compared with $101 million, logged in 2016. This upside was primarily driven by Benepali, which recorded revenues of $370.8 million compared with the year-ago figure of $100.6 million on increased market share.Biogen Inc. Price Biogen Inc.

2081,ABBV,"Aeglea BioTherapeutics, Inc. (AGLE  -  Free Report) announced that it has initiated dosing of patients in two studies evaluating its lung cancer candidate, pegzilarginase, in small cell lung cancer (“SCLC”).A cohort expansion phase I study is evaluating pegzilarginase as monotherapy in SCLC patients. The other one is phase I/II study evaluating the candidate in combination with Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, in a similar indication.Top-line data from the studies are expected in the fourth quarter of 2018.Aeglea’s shares have risen 77.8% so far this year, against the industry’s loss of 4.9% during the period.The SCLC expansion cohort is one of the three arms of the phase I study, which is evaluating pegzilarginase in cancer tumors that stop producing a certain amino acid, arginine. Depletion in arginine levels in the tumors causes cell death and promotes anti-tumor immune responses.The phase I/II study is evaluating combination of pegzilarginase and Keytruda for overall response rate in patients with extensive disease SCLC whose disease has relapsed or progressed after receiving platinum-based chemotherapy.Per the press release, only 6% of SCLC patients survive after five years of treatment, showing a significant unmet need.Several pharma companies are developing therapies for treating SCLC. AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) is developing a combination of its PARP inhibitor, Lynparza, and chemotherapy, Temodar, in a phase I/II study. AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers have collaborated to develop rovalpituzumab tesirine in combination with Opdivo and Yervoy in a phase I study. G1 Therapeutics is also developing therapies in combination with chemotherapy for SCLC.Apart from SCLC, Aeglea is also developing pegzilarginase in a phase I/II study in patients with Arginase 1 deficiency, a rare genetic disease.

2084,ABBV,"AbbVie Inc. ((ABBV  -  Free Report)) along with partner Neurocrine Biosciences, announced that the phase III study oftheir late stage candidateelagolix met its primary endpoint in women with uterine fibroids. Top-line results from the first of the two pivotal phase III studies on elagolix (ELARIS UF-I) revealed that at six month, elagolix, in combination with low-dose add-back hormone therapy, reduced heavy menstrual bleeding compared to placebo. 68.5% (p<0.001) of women with uterine fibroids achieved clinical response.The study also met all ranked secondary endpoints at month six.Hypoestrogenic effects, such as hot flush and reduction in bone mineral density, from elagolix treatment, were observed in the study. However, the overall safety profile for elagolix was consistent with what was observed in phase II studies in uterine fibroids. Data from the phase III study will support regulatory submissions for elagolix and will be presented at an upcoming medical conference. Elagolix is under review in the United States for the management of endometriosis with associated pain.So far this year, AbbVie’s shares price have returned 92.1%, comparing favorably with 11.1% gain recorded by the industry. We note that there are many other companies that have pipeline candidates being evaluated for uterine fibroids. Bayer (BAYRY  -  Free Report) is evaluating vilaprisan in women suffering from uterine fibroids in a phase III ASTEROID studyAllergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) pipeline candidate, ulipristal acetate’s is under regulatory review in the United States. The company expects the FDA to give its decision in the first half of 2018.In a separate press release, AbbVie also announced that it has inked anexclusive strategic collaboration and option agreement with a clinical-stage gene therapy company, Voyager Therapeutics (VYGR  -  Free Report), to develop and commercialize vectorized antibodies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.Per the deal, Voyager will receive an upfront cash payment of $69 million, as well as up to $155 million in potential preclinical and phase I option payments. Following the announcement of the deal, shares of Voyager rose almost 15%.AbbVie Inc.

2085,ABBV,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm, Sandoz announced that the FDA accepted its Biologics License Application (BLA) for the proposed biosimilar of AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira.The biosimilar was submitted under the 351 (k) pathway.The drug is already approved for the treatment of a number of inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, plaque psoriasis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.The data package submitted to the FDA comprises analytical, preclinical and clinical data and is expected to demonstrate that Sandoz proposed biosimilar adalimumab matches the reference biologic in terms of safety, efficacy and quality. It also included a pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers and a phase III confirmatory safety and efficacy study in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis.  Novartis’ stock has rallied 4% in the past one year compared with the industry’s 9.1% gain.The biosimilar version of Humira is also under review in the EU. We note Sandoz holds a leading position in the biosimilars space with a portfolio of five marketed biosimilars currently and a deep pipeline.The biosimilar version of rituximab, Rixathon, was approved by the European Commission in June 2017. It is currently under review in the United States.Meanwhile, Sandoz witnessed strong growth outside the United States buoyed by launches of Rixathon and Erelzi, the biosimilars of Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel in Europe. However, pricing pressure intensified in the United States.  The company expects low single-digit sales decline at Sandoz in the fourth quarter, mainly due to seasonal shipment phasing and continued pricing pressures in the United States.Meanwhile, Novartis is mulling strategic options for Alcon which includes retaining the business separation via capital market transactions such as a spin-off or an initial public offering. The company believes that the Alcon division has revived well for now even though a separation via capital markets will create value for shareholders. On the other hand, Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu, and Kisqali. The recent approval of Kymriah for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a major boost for Novartis given the potential in the CAR-T therapy space.Zacks Rank & Key PickNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Exelixis, Inc.

2086,ABBV,"The cancer space saw label expansion of two major drugs this week. Seattle Genetics, Inc.’s (SGEN  -  Free Report), Adcetris label was expanded to include treatment naive patients with advanced Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL).  Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Tasigna received approval for use in pediatric patients, one year of age or older.Meanwhile, the FDA granted priority review to Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) regulatory application seeking label expansion of Xtandi to include an early-stage patient population. Roche Holding AG’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) PD-L1 inhibitor, Tecentriq, met primary endpoint in a phase III lung cancer combination study. However, AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced disappointing results from a mid-stage study evaluating its lung cancer candidate, Rovalpituzumab Tesirine (Rova-T).Let’s see the news in details.Seattle Genetics’ Adcetris Label Expansion: The FDA approved a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) seeking label expansion of Seattle Genetics’ Adcetris in treatment-naive stage III or IV cHL patients. The drug was approved in combination with a chemotherapy regimen, AVD (Adriamycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine), based on statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival data from phase III ECHELON-1 study.

2087,ABBV,"AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced disappointing results from a pivotal phase II study, evaluating its promising cancer candidate rovalpituzumab tesirine or Rova-T in third-line or later small cell lung cancer (SCLC).AbbVie said it will not seek accelerated approval of Rova-T in the third-line SCLC setting after consulting with the FDA.AbbVie’s stock crashed more than 12% on Thursday in response to the news. The stock has returned 2.1% this year so far, comparing favorably with a decrease of 0.2% recorded by the industry.The TRINITY study is a single-arm study without a comparator. It is evaluating the efficacy of Rova-T for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory SCLC with high expression of the protein DLL3 and who have received at least two previous treatment regimens, including at least one platinum-based regimen. SCLC is characterized by poor outcomes with very few treatment choices available.In the study, the best overall response rate was 29% while the objective response rate was only 16%. The median duration of response was 4.1 months. The median overall survival rate was 5.6 months while the probability of survival at 12 months was 17.5%. The results were much lower than what the company had hoped for and not significant enough to be prioritized for accelerated approval.However, phase III studies of Rova-T in the first- and second-line settings, MERU and TAHOE, respectively, are ongoing. However, investor concerns about the success of these remaining studies increases after the failure of TRINITY.Rova-T was added to AbbVie’s portfolio following the $5.8 billion acquisition of Stemcentrx in June 2016. AbbVie had significant confidence in Rova-T’s potential and believed the candidate had blockbuster potential. AbbVie had, in the past, guided peak sales for Rova-T at $5 billion. The failure of TRINITY has raised scepticism on Rova-T’s potential and has brought into question the viability of the Stemcentrx deal.  Rova-T is also being evaluated in an early-stage eight-arm ""basket study"" in neuroendocrine tumors.Rova-T was a key candidate in AbbVie’s oncology pipeline. AbbVie’s key cancer drug at present is Imbruvica, marketed in partnership with J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report). Imbruvica, currently approved for quite a few indications, has multi-billion dollar potential and AbbVie is exploring the potential to expand Imbruvica’s label into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases.AbbVie is also conducting studies on another cancer drug, Venclyxto/Venclexta to expand the label to address the broader relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient population, expand into earlier lines of therapy, and broaden into other hematologic malignancies like multiple myeloma and AML. Data from the phase III MURANO study of Venclexta plus Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan in relapse/refractory CLL presented in September last year showed that the combination led to a profound improvement in progression free survival compared to Teva Pharma’s (TEVA  -  Free Report) Treanda plus Rituxan. Regulatory applications seeking approval for this combination use are under review in the United States.AbbVie carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2088,ABBV,"Shares of pharmaceutical behemoth AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) dropped more than 11% in early morning trading Thursday after the company’s Rova-T program reported disappointing mid-stage results, forcing the drugmaker to abandon plans to seek accelerated approval for the treatment.AbbVie was hopeful that its Rova-T, or rovalpituzumab tesirine, therapy would qualify for accelerated approval to treat third-line refractory small cell lung cancer, but the company has shifted its focus based on a phase 2 trial and the resulting “magnitude of effect across multiple parameters.”The decision was made after consulting with the Food and Drug Administration, the company said. Nevertheless, AbbVie said that it does still believe the drug has potential in small cell lung cancer and other cancers with the DLL3 protein. Rova-T continues to be tested in phase 3 trials for first-line and second-line small cell lung cancer.But investors appear to be disappointed with today’s news based on the scale of AbbVie’s investment in Rova-T. AbbVie acquired the drug in a $5.8 billion deal for Stemcentrix back in 2016. Rova-T was the purchased firm’s lead asset at the time.Today’s selloff adds to recent headaches for AbbVie, which has seen its share price slump by nearly 20% since reaching new highs in late January. However, the pharmaceutical stock is still up over 50% within the past year.Analyst sentiment has also been relatively solid for AbbVie recently. The company has witnessed 11 positive revisions for its full-year earnings estimates within the past 60 days, lifting our Zacks Consensus Estimate by 92 cents over that time. Still, a pair of negative revisions has kept the stock at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Regardless, 2018 is expected to be a year of aggressive top and bottom line growth for the North Chicago, Illinois-based company. Based on current consensus projections, Abbvie is on track to witness EPS growth of 34% and revenue growth of 14% this year.Want more market analysis from this author?

2090,ABBV,"The Multiple Sclerosis (MS) space hit the headlines once again following biotech bigwig, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) and partner AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) decision to withdraw their jointly owned MS drug, Zinbryta voluntarily on a worldwide basis due to risk of liver injury. Both companies decided to withdraw the drug on grounds of the complex and evolving benefit/risk profile of Zinbryta, given the limited number of patients treated.In November 2017, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) concluded its review of Zinbryta. The review found that unpredictable and potentially fatal immune-mediated liver injury can occur during treatment with Zinbryta and for up to 6 months after stopping treatment. In clinical trials, 1.7% of patients receiving Zinbryta had a serious liver reaction.Given the complexity of the market, MS drugs have a long history of serious side effects, making it a risky therapeutic area.  An autoimmune inflammatory disease of the centrol nervous system, MS disrupts the normal functioning of the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord through inflammation and tissue loss. There are three types of MS widely known to affect adults — relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS).The market for MS changed drastically with the introduction of oral formulations which are mostly preferred than injections. While there a variety of drugs available for MS, they come with their own set of risks mostly.Biogen is a dominant player in the MS market with drugs like Avonex, Tysabri, Tecfidera, Plegridy and Zinbryta.  However, the company has been under the scrutiny for pricing of MS drugs in 2017. Earlier, the emergence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) cases, a type of brain infection, associated with the use of Tysabri and Tecfidera had marred the prospects of MS drugs. The FDA thereafter updated the label of Tecfidera. Nevertheless, the company is a name to reckon with in the MS market.Earlier, the FDA also issued a warning against Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Gilenya for PML. The drug was recently granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Gilenya for the treatment of children and adolescents 10 years of age or older with relapsing MS. The drug is already approved for the same among adults. Novartis has another MS drug in its portfolio, Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone 20 mg.  Sandoz, the company’s generic arm, recently won FDA approval for a generic version of Copaxone 40mg.Israel-based Teva Pharmceuticals (TEVA  -  Free Report) has long been in the MS market through its widely used drug Copaxone which is facing stiff competition for the last few years.Meanwhile, in the past, seizures were known side-effects of another MS drug, Ampyra. Seizure risk was seen to increase with higher blood levels of the drug.  As a result, the FDA had to update Ampyra’s label to clarify recommendations that kidney function should be checked in patients before starting Ampyra and monitored at least annually while Ampyra treatment continues.Nevertheless, the risks associated with the drugs have not deterred newer entrants which claim better formulations with lesser side effects. Consequently, the market has become too crowded.In March 2017, the FDA approved Roche’s (RHHBY) Ocrevus to treat adults with relapsing forms of MS and primary progressive multiple sclerosis. However, there were questions if Ocrevus was a new innovation or a reformulation of Roche’s older drug Rituxan. The drug sales aren’t that impressive yet either.The FDA recently issued Refusal to File letter to Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) New Drug Application (NDA) for ozanimod, which is in development for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. The FDA determined that the nonclinical and clinical pharmacology sections in the NDA were insufficient to permit a complete review. Hence, the company is now gearing up to meet the FDA and determine the future course of action. While there haven’t been any safety issues reports, the delay will definitely open up avenues for competition.Given that so much is happening in this space, we expect investors to remain glued for further updates.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

2091,ABBV,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) ended 2017 on a positive note, courtesy of strong performance of psoriasis drug, Cosentyx.Cosentyx achieved multi-blockbuster drug status in 2017 on the back of strong growth in three approved indications — psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. The drug has grabbed market share from rivals — AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel.The drug has been evaluated in more than 10,000 patients in over 60 studies. It has been prescribed to more than 140,000 patients on a global basis across all indications.Novartis recently reported new encouraging data on Cosentyx data from the phase III study, SCALP at the 2018 American Academy of Dermatology (“AAD”) Annual Meeting in San Diego, CA.The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cosentyx in 102 patients with moderate-to-severe scalp psoriasis.The eligible patients were equally randomized to either subcutaneous Cosentyx 300 mg or placebo at week 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, then every four weeks for 12 weeks. Patients in the placebo group who did not achieve at least 90% improvement from baseline in the Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (“PSSI”) score at week 12 were re-randomized to Cosentyx 300 mg until the completion of the study. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved PSSI 90 response rate at week 12.Majority of patients with scalp psoriasis on Cosentyx achieved clear skin (PSSI 90) at week 12 and 24 along with improved quality of life.The study showed that PSSI 90 response rates were achieved by a significantly higher proportion of patients receiving Cosentyx vs. placebo at week 12 (52.9% vs. 2.0%), with further improvements in those taking Cosentyx up to week 24 (58.8%).Per estimates, scalp psoriasis affects 60 million people worldwide.Earlier in the month, the FDA approved a line extension for Cosentyx, in moderate-to-severe scalp psoriasis. The FDA approval comes on the back of positive efficacy and safety outcomes from a dedicated phase III study — SCALP — in patients with scalp psoriasis.  Novartis’ shares have gained 16.0% over a year on par with the industry’s gain of 16.5%.The label expansion of the drug is likely to boost sales further.Zacks Rank & Key PickNovartis carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock from the health care space is Exelixis (EXEL  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2093,ABBV,"The biosimilar space was in focus in 2017 on key FDA approvals.Biosimilars contain a version of the active substance of an already approved original biological drug. Development of biosimilars is technically more challenging than the development of generic drugs as the former requires clinical studies in patients and are engineered to match the reference drug in quality, safety and efficacy. Due to the complex nature of the product, the development and the regulatory pathway of biosimilars differ significantly from that of generics. A biosimilar is usually less expensive than the branded drug. Thus, the market for the same is highly lucrative. With the acceleration in approvals of biosimilars, the market has thus attracted a lot many players which are witnessing rapid growth. Here we go through the progress report for 2017.Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) launched Reneflexis, a biosimilar version of Remicade (infliximab), in the United States in July 2017 after approval in April. The FDA also granted tentative approval for Lusduna Nexvue, the biosimilar version of Lantus, basal insulin in a pre-filled dosing device. Merck currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Remicade has been seeing intense competition in the biosimilars space of late. We note that Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) supplies Inflectra, a biosimilar version of Remicade. Pfizer is a strong player in the biosimilars market. In December 2017, Pfizer got FDA approval for another of its Remicade’s biosimilar, Ixifi, as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, pediatric Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis. The company has a portfolio of three marketed biosimilar medicines outside the United States, including Inflectra, Retacrit (epoetin zeta) and Nivestim (filgrastim) along with a strong pipeline of 13 distinct biosimilar molecules in various stages of development. Pfizer currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Generic leader Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report) is also exploring the biosimilars market — that has the potential to grow to $20 billion by 2020. Early last December, Mylan and partner Biocon Ltd. announced the FDA approval of Ogivri (trastuzumab-dkst), a biosimilar version of Herceptin (trastuzumab). Ogivri has been approved for all indications included in the label of the reference product, Herceptin, including the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer and metastatic stomach cancer. Ogivri is the first FDA-approved biosimilar of Herceptin and the first biosimilar from Mylan and Biocon's joint portfolio. Mylan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Meanwhile, Amgen Inc.

2095,ABBV,"AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) and partner Neurocrine Biosciences announced that the second of the two pivotal phase III studies evaluating its pipeline candidate, elagolix uterine fibroids, met the primary endpoint. AbbVie is looking to get elagolix approved as an oral medicine for reducing heavy menstrual bleeding in premenopausal women with uterine fibroids.Elagolix is already under review in the United States for management of endometriosis with associated pain.AbbVie’s shares have increased more than 1% on Mar 13, following the news release. Moreover, so far this year, AbbVie’s share price has increased 24.5%, comparing favorably with a gain of 0.5% recorded by the industry.Coming back to the latest release, data from the phase III ELARIS UF-II (M12-817) study demonstrated that elagolix, in combination with low-dose add-back therapy, reduced heavy menstrual bleeding in 76.2% of women with uterine fibroids compared with 10.1% in placebo at month six. The safety profile of the candidate was also found to be consistent with the first phase III study (ELARIS UF-I) results. The study met its secondary endpoints as well. Data from the ELARIS UF-II study will support regulatory submissions for elagolix for the aforementioned indication.Note that, positive top-line data from the first phase III ELARIS UF-I study were announced in February 2018. This study also met the primary endpoints.Per the company’s press release, uterine fibroid affects around 20-80% of women by age 50. Out of them, 25% may experience symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding, painful periods, vaginal bleeding at times other than menstruation and anemia. At present, there are limited non-surgical treatment options for women suffering from the disease. Uterine fibroid is currently managed with oral contraceptives, progestins and GnRH agonists. Many of these medicines are not specifically indicated for the treatment of uterine fibroid. Hence, approval of the candidate will provide the company access to patients who are in need of an additional treatment option to apprehend the disease.Meanwhile, pharma company Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) also has a pipeline candidate, ulipristal acetate, in its portfolio which is being evaluated for treatment of uterine fibroids. It might be the first oral treatment to hit the market, as it is under review in the United States with a response expected from the regulatory agency in August 2018.AbbVie Inc. Price AbbVie Inc.

2096,ABBV,"The pharma/biotech industry was plagued by drug pricing issues last year. However, it bounced back and made a considerable headway this year, courtesy of a slew of FDA approvals. Particularly, large-cap players in the industry raked in stellar returns, up 16.5%, not to forget that the same space posted a decline of 5.2% in the year earlier.Upbeat quarterly results, rise in demand on new product sales, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results as well as a continued strong performance of legacy products propelled the large-cap drug sector to new highs this year. Moreover, these encouraging factors are expected to drive the sector’s growth in 2018.Meanwhile, jubilant Republicans passed the tax overhaul bill for the first time in 30 years. The bill slashes corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%. Such tax reduction is likely to further boost profit margins of these companies in the large-cap pharma sector with more cash left in hand. This, in turn can also be used for striking strategic deals. It is to be remembered that mergers/acquisition activities lagged in the previous year.Notably, the Large Cap Pharma sub-industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of #104, placing it among the top 39% of the 265 plus Zacks industries. Our backtesting shows that the top 50% of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one.Banking on such positive trends, investing in sound large-cap pharma stocks seems judicious. To top it, such stocks are fundamentally lucrative and ensure a steady stream of cash inflows. We have hence selected four such companies that have outperformed the broader S&P 500 index this year and are also poised to continue their winning streak heading into the New Year.Johnson and Johnson, Inc. (JNJ  -  Free Report)The New Jersey-based biotech giant Johnson and Johnson has outperformed the S&P 500 this year. Shares of the company have rallied 22% while the broader market has increased 20.2%. The stock’s earnings are further expected to grow 7.8% in 2018.The company’s track record of product launches has been impressive this year. It is making a fast progress toward achieving its goal of more than 10 approvals for new blockbuster products by 2021. Moreover, the company is targeting more than 50 line extensions of both its existing as well as new drugs. In October, J&J received an FDA approval for two line extensions of Simponi Aria for psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.Additionally, contribution from recent acquisitions, mainly Actelion, generated positive sentiments among investors. Continuous developments have led to a consistent rise in shares. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report)This Illinois-based biopharmaceutical company also outperformed the S&P 500 so far this year. Shares of the company have surged 56.1% during the period. This rally price movement was supported by a series of positive news in the past few months. AbbVie presented promising data from several pivotal studies, gained key regulatory approvals and settled its Humira patent disputes with Amgen. The stock’s earnings are further estimated to increase 18.2% in the next year.AbbVie’s eight-week, pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, once-daily HCV treatment, Mavyret/Maviret, secured approval in the United States, EU and Canada in the third quarter of 2017. Additionally, in August, AbbVie clinched a nod from the regulatory agency for Imbruvica to address its sixth indication among others.Meanwhile, the company announced positive data from the phase III MURANO study of Venclexta plus Roche's (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan in relapse/refractory CLL in September. Later in October too, AbbVie announced that three pivotal head-to-head phase III studies, evaluating risankizumab versus Johnson & Johnson’s Stelara and Humira, for treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis, met all co-primary and secondary endpoints.Several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones are expected in 2018. Besides, all the above-mentioned factors bode well for the stock. The company is a Zacks #3 Ranked player.AstraZeneca plc (AZN  -  Free Report)The UK-based biopharmaceutical giant outperformed the S&P 500 this year. The company’s shares increased 24.8% during the period. It has announced quite a few progressions on the regulatory and pipeline front this year, driving a steady appreciation in share price. AstraZeneca also has a promising late-stage pipeline including immuno-oncology candidates.  Imfinzi, approved for bladder cancer and currently being evaluated for multiple cancers, is a key drug in the pipeline. The company has about 11 new molecular entities in a phase III trial or under a regulatory review apart from several lifecycle management programs.Last month, Fasenra/benralizumab has been approved in the United States for treatment of asthma. It is under review in the EU for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This month, FDA has accepted its application for the label expansion of its marketed drug, Tagrisso (osimertinib), for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC. Additionally, the regulatory filing for Tagrisso’s label expansion is accepted in the EU in November for a similar indication.In December, AstraZeneca also announced positive top-line data from a phase IV study, evaluating its marketed drug, Tudorza Pressair, for an expanded indication (COPD with cardiovascular risk factors).The company carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Novo-Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report)Novo-Nordisk has been in news for the past few months based on the encouraging progress of its diabetes pipeline. Constant improvements and corresponding approvals have led to a regular surge in shares. The company is a #3 Ranked player. Shares of the company have soared 49.9% so far this year, outpacing the S&P 500 index. The stock’s earnings are further projected to rise 5.3% in 2018. In October, the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee of the FDA voted in the 16-0 ratio in favor of the approval of semaglutide to improve glycaemic control in adults with type II diabetes. Meanwhile, late last year, the company also filed for semaglutide in the EU for the given indication. Moreover, in September, the FDA approved Fiasp (fast-acting insulin aspart) for treating adults with diabetes.In August, the FDA approved a label expansion for the company’s diabetes drug, Victoza. The drug is now approved to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type II diabetes. In the same month, the label expansion for the lessened risk of severe hypoglycaemia with Tresiba was endorsed by Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use in the EU. Tresiba’s label update should boost the company’s sales.ConclusionA series of data readouts plus upsides on both regulatory and pipeline fronts for the above stocks this year are likely to help continue the bullish run next year and surpass the broader market as well.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2097,ABBV,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) initiated a head-to-head trial, SURPASS, on psoriasis drug, Cosentyx. The drug will be compared to its proposed biosimilar for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (AS).The trial is the first head-to-head clinical trial in AS investigating superiority of Cosentyx in slowing spinal bone damage compared with proposed biosimilar adalimumab.We note that SURPASS and EXCEED are part of a larger rheumatology program for Cosentyx.  In the head-to-head EXCEED trial, Cosentyx is being compared to AbbVie, Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira in psoriatic arthritis (PsA). This trial is currently recruiting patients.The trial is the first large double-blinded head-to-head clinical trial versus Humira in PsA investigating superiority of Cosentyx on ACR 20 at 52 weeks as the primary endpoint.  Novartis’ stock have rallied 22.4% over a year compared with the industry’s 22% gain.Cosentyx is the first targeted biologic that specifically inhibits IL-17A, cornerstone cytokine involved in the inflammation of entheses in spondyloarthritis, which plays a major role in PsA and AS.The drug was approved for the treatment of active AS and PsA. The drug was approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.The uptake of Cosentyx has been strong and the company has grabbed market shares from rivals, Humira and and Amgen, Inc.‘s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel.

2098,ABBV,"This week, the focus is on the 36th annual J.P. Morgan healthcare conference where several biotech and pharma companies provided a preliminary look at their results for 2017 and have also provided pipeline updates as well as their outlooks for 2018. Meanwhile, Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) was in the news with the company announcing its intention to acquire Impact Biomedicines.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesCelgene to Buy Impact: Celgene has started the year with an acquisition announcement – the company will be acquiring Impact Biomedicines, which is developing fedratinib for myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. The deal terms include an upfront payment of approximately $1.1 billion and contingent payments of up to $1.25 billion based on the achievement of regulatory approval milestones for myelofibrosis. Celgene could make additional payments based on approvals for label expansion and the achievement of sales-based milestones. Plans are on to submit a new drug application to the FDA in mid-2018. Celgene is looking to boost its pipeline with this acquisition. The company had a rough 2017 with shares declining 12.1% over the last one year. Issues like pipeline setbacks as well as the weak performance of Otezla have been weighing on the stock (Read more: Celgene to Acquire Impact Biomedicines to Boost Pipeline).Key Takeaways from J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference: Several biotech companies were present at the 36th annual J.P. Morgan healthcare conference. Most of these companies provided a preliminary look at fourth quarter results and their outlook for 2018. Among key updates, Acorda (ACOR  -  Free Report) could start facing generic competition for its flagship drug, Ampyra, any time after Jul 30, 2018. The company is currently seeking FDA approval for Inbrija for which a response could be out in February (Read more: Acorda's Shares Down on Disappointing Ampyra View for 2018). Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report), which holds a strong position in the cystic fibrosis (“CF”) market, is looking to strengthen its position further with the potential approval of tezacaftor/ivacaftor in the United States – a decision from the FDA is expected on Feb 28, 2018. Vertex could also be one of the companies that will pursue acquisition deals this year. Celgene also provided its preliminary results and 2018 outlook (Read more: Celgene Provides 2017 Preliminary Results & 2018 View). Vertex is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Axovant Plunges on Intepirdine Discontinuation: Axovant Sciences’s (AXON  -  Free Report) shares lost more than 50% of their value with the company announcing disappointing results on its lead pipeline candidate intepirdine. The candidate failed to meet the primary efficacy endpoints in studies that were conducted in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (“DLB”) and patients with dementia and gait impairment. Based on this, Axovant has decided to discontinue the development of intepirdine.This is not the first time that Axovant has faced a setback in its development efforts for intepirdine. Last year in September, the company had said that intepirdine failed to meet its co-primary efficacy endpoints in a late-stage study being conducted in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (""AD"") patients who were receiving background donepezil therapy. At that time too, the company’s shares had plunged significantly (73.9%). Axovant’s shares are down 81.7% over the last one year compared to the 3.3% decline recorded by the industry it belongs to.Regeneron & Sanofi Boost R&D Investment in Dupixent and Cemiplimab: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report) and partner Sanofi have decided to boost their investment in the development of cemiplimab (a PD-1 antibody) in oncology and Dupixent (an IL-4/IL-13 pathway-blocking antibody) in type 2 allergic diseases. Based on this decision, investment in cemiplimab will shoot up to at least $1.64 billion, an increase of approximately $1 billion from the initial agreement, with both companies contributing equally. Cemiplimab is being studied as monotherapy as well as in combination with other therapies in a wide range of cancers including advanced skin cancers, non-small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer and lymphomas. Regulatory applications for cemiplimab in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma are scheduled to be submitted in the European Union and the United States in the first quarter of 2018.  Meanwhile, Dupixent, currently approved for eczema, has the potential to be evaluated for additional indications including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peanut allergy and grass allergy and in patients who have multiple allergic conditions. This is in addition to ongoing development in pediatric atopic dermatitis, pediatric asthma, eosinophilic esophagitis and nasal polyposis. Regeneron and Sanofi are currently seeking FDA approval for Dupixent in uncontrolled, persistent asthma in patients at least 12 years old.Another candidate that should benefit from the additional investment is REGN3500, an IL-33 antibody, with potential indications including atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.AbbVie Eczema Drug Gets BTD: AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) investigational, once-daily oral JAK1-selective inhibitor, upadacitinib, has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (“BTD”) by the FDA for use in adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy.Breakthrough Therapy Designation helps fasten the development and review of drugs which are being evaluated for the treatment of serious conditions and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may be substantially better than existing treatments on clinically significant endpoint(s). Upadacitinib is scheduled to move into a late-stage program for atopic dermatitis in the first half of the year (Read more: AbbVie's Upadacitinib Gains Breakthrough Therapy Designation).PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index declined 0.3% over the last four trading sessions.

2099,ABBV,"Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) stock was up 21.3% in 2017, which compared favorably with a gain of 16.3% recorded by the industry.Last year’s share price surge was supported by a series of positive news including promising data from several pivotal studies and rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions. The positive trend is likely to continue this year as well.What Drove the Stock in 2017?Two new drugs were approved last year - Guselkumab/Tremfya in the United States as well as in the EU for plaque psoriasis and the first dual treatment for HIV, Juluca (dolutegravir + rilpivirine) in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) in the United States. Juluca is under review in the EU.J&J also gained FDA approval for several line extensions -  a lower dose of Xarelto, two new indications of Simponi Aria, use in adolescents for Stelara, combination use of Darzalex with Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) multiple myeloma drug Pomalyst and the sixth indication for Imbruvica, among others. Please note that J&J markets Imbruvica in partnership with AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report).The line extensions can expand the eligible patient populations of these drugs and drive their sales higher in future quarters.In 2017, J&J also submitted regulatory applications for label expansion of key drugs including Darzalex (in first-line setting for multiple myeloma), Xarelto (for chronic coronary artery disease and/or peripheral artery disease), Invokana (to include the cardiovascular indication), Zytiga (for earlier stages of metastatic prostate cancer). It might get FDA nod for these line extensions this year.Factors Likely to Support the Rally in 2018With several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones expected in 2018, the bullish run of the stock is likely to continue in 2018.This year J&J expects to file for approval of depression candidate, esketamine while apalutamide for pre-metastatic prostate cancer and Symtuza, a darunavir-based once-daily single-tablet regimen for HIV could be approved by the FDA.J&J’s domestic Pharma segment sales decelerated in the first half of 2017 as a number of key growth drivers like Remicade and Concerta faced competition. However, sales growth accelerated in the third quarter and we are likely to see the positive impact of the trend in fourth-quarter results and probably in 2018. We believe that new products in all segments, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica, Xarelto, Stelara and Darzalex and contribution from recent acquisitions - mainly Actelion – will support top-line growth. All these factors bode well for the stock. J&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2100,ABBV,"The year 2017 has turned out to be pretty impressive for the pharma/biotech stocks. Though the industry was hampered by drug pricing issues in 2016, it bounced back and made a considerable headway in 2017, courtesy of a slew of FDA approvals. The regulatory body approved 46 novel drugs last year, easily surpassing 2016’s total tally of 22.Particularly, large-cap players in the industry raked in stellar returns, up 15.8% in the last 12 months. Nonetheless, the same space also posted a 5.2% decline in 2016.Upbeat quarterly results, rise in demand for new product sales, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results as well as a continued strong performance of legacy products propelled the large-cap drug sector to scale new highs in 2017. Moreover, these tailwinds are expected to drive the sector’s growth in 2018.Meanwhile, jubilant Republicans have of late passed the tax overhaul bill for the first time in 30 years. The bill slashes corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%. Such tax reduction is likely to further boost profit margins of these companies with more cash left in hand. This, in turn can also be used for striking strategic deals this year, which were relatively fewer in 2017.Notably, the Large Cap Pharma sub-industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of #104, placing it among the top 39% of the 265 plus Zacks industries. Our backtesting shows that the top 50% of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one.Banking on such positive trends, investing in sound large-cap pharma stocks this year seems judicious. We have therefore identified three Large Cap stocks based on a favorable combination of a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a strong VGM Score of A or B. These stocks are backed by sound fundamentals and ensure a steady stream of cash inflows.Back-tested results show that only stocks with an impressive VGM Style Score of A or B when combined with a bullish Zacks Rank of 1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Below are the selected three companies, poised to continue their winning streak this year:AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report)This Illinois-based biopharmaceutical company is a lucrative option. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of B. Shares of the company have soared 57.9% in a year’s time. Moreover, the stock’s earnings and sales are further estimated to increase 18.2% and 11.8%, respectively, in 2018. These positive trends were supported by a series of positive news in the past few months. AbbVie presented promising data from several pivotal studies, gained key regulatory approvals and settled its Humira patent disputes with Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report).With several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones expected in 2018, the bullish run of the stock is expected to continue this year.Novo-Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report)We also recommend Novo Nordisk, the Denmark-based global healthcare company and a leader in the worldwide diabetes market.  Shares of the company have surged 51.2% in a year's time.

In December 2017, Novo Nordisk announced that the FDA has approved its semaglutide once-daily pre-filled pen to improve glycaemic control in type II diabetes patients. It will be marketed by the trade name of Ozempic.The company expects to launch Ozempic in the United States in the beginning of 2018. Meanwhile, in September, the FDA had approved Fiasp (fast-acting insulin aspart) for treating adults with diabetes.In August, the FDA had approved label expansion of the company’s diabetes drug, Victoza, now approved to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type II diabetes.The company’s label expansion efforts and the corresponding approvals bode well for its growth.Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report)Investors can count on Switzerland-based Roche Holding with a VGM Score of B. The company is a Zacks #2 Ranked player with its shares having gained 10.1% in the last 12 months. Roche dominates the breast cancer space with strong demand for its HER2 franchise drugs like Herceptin, Perjeta and Kadcyla. The company also has a dominant position in lung cancer market.The company is looking for a label expansion of drugs namely, Actemra, which was approved for the treatment of giant cell arteritis last May. This is the sixth FDA approval for Actemra since the medicine was launched in 2010.Moreover, the recent FDA approval of Hemlibra for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in patients with haemophilia A is encouraging. Also, the potential acquisition of Ignyta — announced a couple of weeks earlier — is likely to strengthen Roche ’s pipeline as the integration will add a mid-stage cancer candidate entrectinib to its portfolio.Continuous label expansions of key drugs, regular approvals and a robust pipeline are expected to drive the stock in 2018.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2101,ABBV,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced that its investigational oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib, met the primary endpoints in a phase III study from its SELECT program, which evaluated the candidate for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”).AbbVie’s shares have outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has surged 55.5% compared with the industry’s 16.1% rally.The phase III study — SELECT-MONOTHERAPY — evaluated upadacitinib monotherapy in moderate to severe RA patients who were not responsive to methotrexate for a period of 14-weeks. Both the once daily doses, 15 mg and 30 mg, evaluated in the study demonstrated superiority in ACR20 response and low disease activity (LDA) compared to methotrexate.The ACR20 response was achieved in 68% of the patients receiving 15 mg dose while the response rate was 71% for the 30 mg dose versus 41% for methotrexate. The LDA was achieved in 41%, 28% and 8% of patients receiving 30 mg, 15 mg or methotrexate, respectively.Upadacitinib is being evaluated in a large program, which includes six studies on RA patients. AbbVie is also developing the candidate in psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis and atopic dermatitis.The candidate has also met endpoints in two phase III studies from the SELECT program. The SELECT-MONOTHERAPY study supported the potential of the candidate in treating RA patients without a background methotrexate therapy.Successful development of upadacitinib will boost AbbVie’s RA portfolio, which already includes the blockbuster drug, Humira. Sales of Humira ($13.5 billion) accounted for 66% of net revenues in the first nine months of 2017.The approval of Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) / Eli Lilly and Company’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Olumiant in Europe in February 2017 has not had any significant impact on Humira’s sales, as it is approved in patients who are unresponsive to TNF inhibitors like Humira. Moreover, Olumiant’s new drug application received a complete response letter from the FDA in April this year. Meanwhile, upadacitinib may be in direct line of competition with Olumiant as both are JAK-inhibitors.AbbVie Inc. Price AbbVie Inc. Price | AbbVie Inc.

2102,ABBV,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency has recommended the approval of Yervoy for pediatric patients of 12 years and older with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.We note that the European Commission will take the CHMP recommendation into account while considering the application but is not bound by it.The FDA had approved the drug for the same indication in July 2017.We remind investors that Yervoy 3 mg/ kg monotherapy was approved in 2011.  So far this year, Bristol-Myers’ shares have rallied 9.6% compared with the industry's gain of 20.9%.Last week, the company announced that the FDA has accepted its supplemental Biologics License Application for priority review of Opdivo plus Yervoy for the treatment of intermediate- and poor-risk patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The application is based on data from the phase III study, Checkmate-214. The study was stopped ahead of schedule based on the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee following a planned interim analysis of overall survival. The study evaluated the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy versus Sutent for previously untreated advanced or metastatic RCC. The FDA will make a decision by Apr 16, 2018.Meanwhile, the company continues to evaluate its blockbuster immune-oncology drug Opdivo alone or in combination therapies with Yervoy and other anti-cancer agents. Label expansion of the combination into additional indications will give the product an access to a higher patient population and increase its commercial potential.However, Opdivo is facing competitive challenges in the United States. With the FDA approving Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda, for the first-line treatment of metastatic non-squamous NSCLC, the company is expected to suffer further loss of market share.The virology business is also under pressure.

2103,ABBV,"Roche Holdings AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced positive results from a pivotal phase III study, MURANO, evaluating Venclexta plus Rituxan compared to bendamustine plus Rituxan (BR) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).Results from the study showed that a fixed duration of treatment with Venclexta plus Rituxan significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 83% compared with BR.The results were presented at the 59th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.The primary endpoint of the study is investigator-assessed progression-free survival.We note that Roche is developing Venclexta in collaboration with AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report). Both the companies are jointly commercializing in the United States. AbbVie is commercializing the drug outside the United States.The companies expect to submit the data from MURANO study to the FDA. We remind investors that the FDA granted accelerated approval to Venclexta in April 2016 for the treatment of CLL with 17p deletion, as detected by an FDA approved test, who have received at least one prior therapy.The MURANO study is being conducted with the aim of converting the current accelerated approval of Venclexta to a full approval.Meanwhile, Venclexta has been granted four breakthrough therapy designations by the FDA in combination with Rituxan for people with relapsed or refractory CLL, as a monotherapy for relapsed or refractory CLL with 17p deletion in combination with hypomethylating agents (azacitidine or decitabine) for untreated acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) ineligible for intensive chemotherapy and in combination with low-dose cytarabine for patients with untreated AML ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.Roche’s hematology portfolio has approved drugs including MabThera/Rituxan, Gazyva/Gazyvaro, Tecentriq and Venclexta as well as an encouraging pipeline comprising candidates like polatuzumab vedotin/RG7596 and a small-molecule antagonist of MDM2 (idasanutlin/RG7388).The company also obtained FDA approval for Hemlibra (emicizumab-kxwh) for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adults and children with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors.  So far this year, shares of the company have moved up 9.2% compared with the industry’s gain of 20%.Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche as its legacy drugs like Herceptin, MabThera are already facing competition from biosimilars.Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan/ MabThera in Europe. Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) has also obtained FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Avastin for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer.Zacks RankRoche currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2104,ABBV,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) and partner Janssen, Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) pharmaceuticals subsidiary, announced that a combination study evaluating their key cancer drug Imbruvica in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM), a rare form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, met the primary endpoint.Interim data from the phase III iNNOVATE study showed that a combination of Imbruvica and Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan led to improved progression-free survival (PFS) in treatment-naive and previously-treated patients with WM compared to Rituxan alone. Based on the early positive results, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) recommended an unblinded study. AbbVie and J&J plan to discuss the positive interim data with regulatory authoritiesImbruvica is already approved as a monotherapy for the treatment of WM. In fact, including WM, Imbruvica is presently approved for six distinct patient populations including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD).Imbruvica was added to AbbVie’s pipeline with the May 2015 acquisition of Pharmacyclics. It has become a key revenue driver for AbbVie. In 2017, AbbVie expects to record Imbruvica global revenues of more than $2.4 billion with sales in the United States expected to cross $2 billion. In the first nine months of 2017, Imbruvica had recorded sales of $1.87 billion, representing growth of 41.2% year over year.  In fact, AbbVie expects Imbruvica peak sales of more than $7 billion and revenues of about $5 billion in 2020At present, the CLL segment is the largest revenue contributor to Imbruvica's growth while expansion into non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and other indications will be major growth drivers in the future.Imbruvica has multi-billion dollar potential and AbbVie is exploring the potential to expand its label into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. Imbruvica is in phase III studies for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. AbbVie is positioning Imbruvica as a “pipeline in a molecule” with the treatment featuring in several company-sponsored studies.AbbVie’s shares have gained 52.3% so far this year, comparing favorably with a gain of only 15% recorded by the industry.The share price surge was supported by a series of positive news in the past few months. AbbVie presented promising data from several pivotal studies, gained regulatory approvals in the United States, Europe, and Japan for its competitive HCV medicine, Mavyret; received FDA approval for the sixth indication for Imbruvicaand settled its Humira patent disputes with Amgen, Inc.

2105,ABBV,"This week, companies like Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Revance Therapeutics, Inc. (RVNC  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) were in the news. While Amgen got FDA approval for the inclusion of cardiovascular outcomes data for its PCSK9 inhibitor, AbbVie and Revance provided data on their pipeline candidates.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesRevance Soars on RT002 Data: Revance’s shares shot up 33.7% on positive top-line data from late-stage studies evaluating the company’s next-generation neuromodulator RT002. RT002 met the primary as well as all secondary endpoints in the studies that were conducted for the reduction of moderate-to-severe glabellar lines (the frown lines or wrinkles between the brows).A long-term safety study is currently ongoing with the study scheduled to complete in the second half of 2018. The successful completion of this study would allow Revance to file for FDA approval in the first half of 2019 and potentially launch the product in 2020. The company believes that FDA approval would make RT002 the first neuromodulator with a long-acting duration of six months as currently marketed neuromodulators have shown duration of three to four months in treating glabellar lines. RT002’s approval could well change the neuromodulator treatment landscape as it would be needed only twice a year.According to information provided by the company, the treatment of glabellar lines is the most popular aesthetic procedure for an injectable neuromodulator with almost a third of the $3.6 billion in global neuromodulator sales in 2016 coming from this area. Currently approved treatments include Botox and Dysport.Amgen’s PCSK9 Inhibitor Label Approved for Cardiovascular Outcomes Data: Amgen’s PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha, got a bit of a boost with the FDA granting approval to the company’s request to add cardiovascular outcomes data to the drug’s label. This makes Repatha the first PCSK9 inhibitor to prevent heart attacks, strokes and coronary revascularizations in adults with established cardiovascular disease. Repatha was also approved for use as an adjunct to diet, alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies like statins, for the treatment of adults with primary hyperlipidemia to reduce low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).The updated label will provide physicians with a new treatment option to prevent cardiovascular events by dramatically lowering LDL cholesterol with Repatha, especially in the case of patients who are already on maximally-tolerated statin therapy and need to lower their LDL cholesterol level further.The cardiovascular outcomes data should help drive Repatha sales which are yet to take off as expected with factors like strict utilization management criteria and processes employed by insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) impacting sales. However, Amgen has been working with payers to improve access for appropriate patients and Repatha remains a growth brand for the company (Read more: Amgen's PCSK9 Inhibitor Gets FDA Nod for Stroke Prevention). Amgen is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Positive Data on AbbVie’s Risankizumab and Imbruvica: AbbVie’s risankizumab met the primary endpoint in the fourth pivotal phase III study conducted for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. After 16 weeks of treatment, almost half (47%) of risankizumab patients achieved complete skin clearance (PASI 100) compared to 1% of patients on placebo. Risankizumab is being developed in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim (Read more: AbbVie Psoriasis Candidate Succeeds in 4th Phase III Study).AbbVie also presented data on a combination of its BTK inhibitor, Imbruvica, and Rituxan for the treatment of both newly and previously-treated patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (“WM”). The primary endpoint of progression-free survival (“PFS”) was achieved in the late-stage study. Imbruvica is approved for different indications including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, previously treated mantle cell lymphoma and WM as well as chronic graft-versus-host-disease. AbbVie expects Imbruvica revenues of $5 billion in 2020.Priority Review for Clovis sNDA: Clovis Oncology’s (CLVS  -  Free Report) supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for the use of its PARP inhibitor, Rubraca (rucaparib), has been granted priority review status by the FDA. The company is looking to get Rubraca approved for use as maintenance treatment for women with recurrent ovarian cancer who are platinum sensitive, and in complete or partial response to platinum chemotherapy, with no requirement for diagnostic testing. With the FDA granting priority review, a response should be out on Apr 6, 2018.Clovis’s shares are up 29.9% year to date, compared to the 1.3% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Galectin Down on NASH Data: Galectin Therapeutics Inc.’s shares fell 30.7% on data from a phase IIb study on GR-MD-02. Although the candidate showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful results in a sub-group of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”) cirrhosis patients, it failed to achieve statistical significance in the total group of patients.  Positive 48-Week Data on Ultragenyx Drug: Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (RARE  -  Free Report) and partner Kyowa Kirin announced positive 48-week data from a late-stage study of burosumab (KRN23) in adults with X-linked hypophosphatemia (“XLH”). The companies said that further improvement in disease symptoms and fracture healing were observed through 48 weeks of treatment with burosumab. Burosumab is currently under priority review for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with XLH with a response from the FDA expected on Apr 17, 2018.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index declined slightly (0.5%) over the last five trading sessions.

2106,ABBV,"AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced a 35% hike in its quarterly dividend along with the authorization of a new $10 billion share buyback program by the board. AbbVie stock rose more than 1% on Thursday in response to the news.The dividend was increased from 71 cents per share to 96 cents per share. The cash dividend is payable on May 15 to shareholders of record on Apr 13. The new quarterly dividend amounts to an annual dividend of $3.84 per share, which implies a dividend yield of 3.4%.Please note that this is the second dividend hike for AbbVie in less than six months. In October last year, AbbVie announced an 11% hike in quarterly dividend to 71 cents per share from 64 cents per share.AbbVie hiked its quarterly dividend by 4% in 2015 and 12% each in 2016 and 2017. In fact, since its inception in 2013, AbbVie has hiked its dividend by 140%.On the fourth quarter conference call held last month, management hinted that shareholder returns were likely to go up as the company’s cash position has improved following the recent U.S. tax reforms.In fact, AbbVie has performed exceptionally well in the past year, supported by a series of positive news. The stock has returned 86.9% in the past year, comparing favorably with a gain of 10.6% recorded by the industry.AbbVie met primary endpoints in several pivotal studies – the key phase III MURANO study of Venclexta plus Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan in relapse/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia; three phase III studies evaluating oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib for rheumatoid arthritis and also a phase IIb study in atopic dermatitis; and four pivotal head-to-head phase III studies evaluating risankizumab versus Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Stelara and Humira, for moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.Meanwhile, AbbVie gained regulatory approvals in the United States, Europe, and Japan for its competitive HCV medicine Mavyret and FDA approval for the sixth indication of cancer drug, Imbruvica. In fact, Mavyret’s launch has been stronger than expected as informed by the company on its fourth-quarter conference call.AbbVie also settled its patent disputes with Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), which delayed the launch of the latter’s biosimilar version of AbbVie’s blockbuster arthritis drug, Humira in the United States to 2023 and in most countries in the EU to October 2018.This agreement has removed a major overhang on AbbVie’s shares. Moreover, the agreement gave AbbVie ample time to focus on developing its pipeline and launching new products that will help make up for the loss of revenues once biosimilar Humira enters the market.With several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones expected in 2018, the bullish run of the stock should continue in 2018. Importantly, Humira has been generating solid sales based on strong demand trends for the drug – a trend expected to continue this year. Imbruvica, AbbVie’s second most important drug, is also doing consistently well and has multibillion dollar potential. AbbVie is exploring the possibility of label expansion into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. All these factors bode well for the stock.AbbVie carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2107,ABBV,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) announced positive top-line data from a phase III label expansion study evaluating its psoriasis drug, Taltz (ixekizumab), in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (“AS”). The drug met the primary endpoint of improvement in the signs and symptoms of AS and all secondary endpoints as well.Taltz, an IL-17A antagonist, is currently approved for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis or active psoriatic arthritis (PsA).Shares of the company are down 3.3% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 11.2% in that period.  The phase III study – COAST-V – evaluated the drug in AS patients who have not received any prior treatment with a biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug. The study consisted of a placebo arm and an active control arm with AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) arthritis drug, Humira. Data from the study showed that treatment with Taltz led to statistically significant improvement as measured by the proportion of patients who achieved Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society 40 at 16 weeks.Additional data from the study is expected to be presented later this year.Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of spondyloarthritis affecting pelvic joints and spine. It is characterized by chronic inflammatory back pain, stiffness and impaired function and mobility.Taltz sales increased 14% quarter over quarter in the last quarter of 2017, on the back of strong uptake. In January 2018, the drug received approval in Europe for PsA, which is expected to boost sales of the drug in the first quarter of 2018.However, several drugs are approved for the treatment of AS including Humira and Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Cosentyx.

2108,ABBV,"Rising yields have dampened the appeal for dividend stocks. Although high dividend stocks are an eye soar in the current environment, dividend growth ones pose strong fundamentals and are lucrative, especially given the new tax legislation in the United States and heightened volatility.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.P/E Ratio Less than X-Industry: A ratio less than X-industry indicates that the stock is cheap and undervalued in that industry.Here are five of the 20 stocks that fit the bill:Illinois-based Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL  -  Free Report) is a full-service real estate firm that provides management services, corporate and financial services and investment management services to corporations and other real estate owners, users and investors worldwide.

(ABBV  -  Free Report) shares have gained 32.1% so far in the second half of the year, comparing favorably with a gain of only 3.8 % recorded by the industry.The share price surge was supported by a series of positive news in the past few months. AbbVie presented promising data from several pivotal studies, gained key regulatory approvals and settled its Humira patent disputes with Amgen.Resolution of Amgen LawsuitAbbVie announced the resolution of a patent dispute with Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) in September, which has delayed the launch of the latter’s biosimilar version of AbbVie’s blockbuster arthritis drug, Humira in the United States to 2023 and in most countries in the EU to October 2018.This agreement has removed a major overhang on AbbVie’s shares though the company is still facing a patent challenge from Boehringer Ingelheim, which gained approval for its biosimilar version of Humira, Cyltezo, in August. Moreover, the agreement gives AbbVie ample time to focus on developing its pipeline and launching new products that will help make up for the loss of revenues once biosimilar Humira enters the market.Key Regulatory ApprovalsAbbVie’s 8-week, pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, once-daily HCV treatment, Mavyret/Maviret, gained approval in the United States, EU and Canada in the third quarter of 2017. Mavyret, AbbVie’s next-generation HCV program, is a combination of glecaprevir, a potent protease inhibitor and pibrentasvir, a NS5A inhibitor. Maviret has the potential to rejuvenate growth in the HCV franchise. According to AbbVie, Mavyret may be used in up to 95% of HCV patients, depending on the stage of liver disease and prior treatment history.In August, AbbVie gained approval for the sixth indication for Imbruvica. The drug was approved for chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD), a serious and potentially life-threatening condition with high unmet medical need. cGVHD is the first indication of Imbruvica outside of cancer. Also, Imbruvica is the first treatment specifically approved for cGVHD.Positive Data from StudiesAbbVie announced positive data from the phase III MURANO study of Venclexta plus plus Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan in relapse/refractory CLL last month. The data showed that Venclexta plus Rituxan met the primary endpoint of prolonged progression-free survival compared with Treanda (bendamustine) plus Rituxan in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (“CLL”).  Label expansion for this indication should expand the patient population for Venclexta significantly and boost its commercial potential.AbbVie’s oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib (ABT-494) met primary endpoints in a phase III study for the treatment of RA with highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful results for both the doses (15 mg and 30 mg) of upadacitinib compared to placebo. Upadacitinib also met primary endpoints in a phase IIb study for the treatment of adult patients with atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema. The company plans to advance the candidate into phase III studies next year. Data from both the upadacitinib studies were announced in September.In October, AbbVie announced that three pivotal head-to-head phase III studies evaluating risankizumab versus Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Stelara and Humira, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis, met all co-primary and secondary endpoints.ConclusionWith several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones expected in 2018, the bullish run in the stock should continue next year. Importantly Humira has been generating strong sales. Despite new competition, AbbVie raised its long-term target for Humira sales in October based on strong demand trends for the drug. Imbruvica, AbbVie’s second most important drug, is also doing consistently well and has multibillion dollar potential. AbbVie is exploring the possibility of label expansion into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. All these factors bode well for the stock.AbbVie carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2110,ABBV,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and partner GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) recently announced FDA approval for Juluca — a combination of Glaxo’s Tivicay/rilpivirine and J&J’s Edurant/dolutegravir into a single tablet — for the treatment of HIV.Most medicines for HIV treatment are made up of three or more antiretroviral drugs. Juluca is the first two-drug regimen that reduces the number of medicines HIV patients take without compromising on the efficacy of a conventional three-drug regimen. The approval of Juluca has shifted investor focus to the HIV disease space. Let’s see how companies are trying to tap into this huge market.A Note on HIVHIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It weakens the immune system by destroying cells that fight diseases and infections and can eventually lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Medicines for the treatment of HIV are called antiretroviral therapy (ART) that slow or put a check on the progression of the virus.Globally, about 36.7 million people were living with HIV/AIDS at the end of 2016. Of the total, 2.1 million were children (less than 15 years old).Despite improved medical understanding of HIV and its prevention and treatment as well as significant efforts made by leading government and medical bodies, HIV and AIDS still has no cure. Notably, 1 million people died of AIDS-related illnesses in 2016, reaching the total number since the start of the epidemic to 35.0 million.Companies Developing HIV DrugsMarketed Therapies for HIVSeveral pharmaceutical companies are marketing drugs/therapies to treat HIV. Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) is a dominant player in the HIV market with an impressive portfolio. The company was the first to introduce a single-tablet regimen (STR) for the treatment of HIV — Atripla. Gilead’s other STRs for HIV include Complera/Eviplera and Stribild. Its TAF-based product Genvoya is a bestseller, surpassing both Truvada and Atripla since fourth-quarter 2016.Another company, GlaxoSmithKline has a long-standing commitment to HIV and infectious diseases. The company had developed the widely used antibiotic amoxycillin around 40 years ago, and developed the first medicines approved to treat HIV (AZT). The company’s other marketed HIV drugs include Triumeq and Tivicay.Other popular marketed HIV drugs are AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Kaletra and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Isentress.Another pharmaceutical company Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) has received a tentative approval from the FDA for its combination tablet, comprising efavirenz, lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, to treat HIV.What’s in the Pipeline?Companies are working on developing new drugs to treat, prevent and possibly cure HIV. Scientists are exploring new treatment paradigms like two-drug regimens, making therapies/drugs with improved safety profiles and new mechanisms of actions.Gilead’s STR bictegravir for HIV treatment is under priority review in the United States. The FDA is expected to announce its decision next February. The STR is a fixed-dose combination of bictegravir, an INSTI, and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF), a dual-NRTI backbone.Merck is developing an investigational non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor MK-1439, doravirine for HIV -1 infection and plans tofile regulatory applications for fixed-dose combination of the same,both as a single-entity tablet and a fixed-dose combination tabletconsisting of  fixed-dose combination of doravirine (DOR), lamivudine (3TC), and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) n late 2017.Glaxo is also developing two drug regimens are dolutegravir + lamivudineand cabotegravir + rilpivirine.As an increasing number of companies are developing drugs to treat this life threatening disease, competition has intensified manifold in the space. Meanwhile, it is to be seen how Juluca fares in the market.(We are reissuing this article to correct a mistake. The original article, issued Tuesday, Nov 24, 2017, should no longer be relied upon.)

2111,ABBV,"Until 2014, very few options were available to treat ovarian cancer and these primarily included chemotherapy, radiation or surgery. Though effective, these treatments had many side-effects. While chemotherapy can destroy a patient’s immune system, radiation kills normal cells along with cancerous cells. A surgical process is ineffective when the cancer spreads. With the approval of AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report)/Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Lynparza in December 2014, a new targeted therapy for treating ovarian cancer came into the market. The drug inhibits an enzyme in cells – PARP – which helps repair the DNA of the cell, thus destroying the cell.After that, two other PARP-inhibitors were approved by the FDA - Tesaro, Inc.’s (TSRO  -  Free Report) Zejula and Clovis Oncology, Inc.’s (CLVS  -  Free Report) Rubraca. PARP inhibitors have shown more tolerability and effectiveness in clinical studies. However, none of the three marketed PARP inhibitors – Rubraca, Zejula and Lynparza – have been approved in the first-line setting to date.There are many other companies developing PARP inhibitors including Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) and AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report), among others.Let’s see how the marketed drugs are performing and which one has better prospects.Lynparza with its recent label expansion in August 2017 is indicated for maintenance treatment of patients suffering from platinum-sensitive recurrent (“PSR”) ovarian cancer regardless of BRCA-mutation status. It is also approved for BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer beyond the third-line setting. The drug is available in capsule and tablet formulations. The drug recorded sales of $70 million in 2015, $94 million in 2016 and $197 million in the first nine months of 2017, growing over 65% annually. The drug is also being developed as first-line maintenance treatment for BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer. AstraZeneca and Merck expect to file for label expansion by mid-2018.However, Lynparza sales have fallen lately in the United States after the launch of Zejula in April this year. The label expansion in August – including ovarian cancer patients regardless of BRCA-mutation – has brought it on par with Zejula. Moreover, a potential approval in first-line setting next year will give it an edge over the other drugs. Also, AstraZeneca has collaborated with Merck to co-develop Lynparza in combination immunotherapies. Its successful development will be a boon for patients.Rubraca received accelerated approval from the FDA late last year as monotherapy in advanced ovarian cancer patients with deleterious BRCA mutation, treated with two or more chemotherapies. Clovis is conducting confirmatory studies to convert this approval to a full approval. Meanwhile, the company filed a supplemental New Drug Application last month, seeking label expansion as a maintenance treatment for patients with PSR ovarian cancer. Rubraca is under review in EU. The drug reported sales of $38.5 million in the first nine months of 2017. However, the drug may lag the other two drugs as they are approved to treat ovarian cancer irrespective of the BRCA-mutation. Meanwhile, Clovis is evaluating the drug in a phase III study in combination with Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo as first-line maintenance therapy in stage III/IV high-grade ovarian cancer patients who were treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.Zejula is the first PARP-inhibitor, which was approved as maintenance treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer regardless of BRCA-mutation and was launched in April 2017. As the drug can be used in patients who do not have BRCA mutations, it can be prescribed to a broader patient population. Moreover, it also removes the requirement of diagnosis for BRCA-mutation, thereby reducing treatment cost and time.Due to this competitive advantage, Zejula has registered impressive growth since its launch and has also encroached upon Lynparza & Rubraca’s market share. The drug has generated sales of $65.3 million since its launch. The company has also claimed that it is the most frequently prescribed PARP inhibitor for ovarian cancer. Further boosting the prospect of the drug, the European Commission granted marketing authorization earlier this week. TESARO is also developing Zejula in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 drug, Keytruda, in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.From the above discussion, it is evident that Zejula has an edge due to non-requirement of BRCA-mutation status and has fared better thus far. However, with an expanded label, Lynparza is set to get back its lost share. We believe that Rubraca could be in a relatively weaker position among the three drugs. There is uncertainty over how it performs in Europe as both Lynparza and Zejula are already approved there. However, we have to wait till 2018 end to see the actual performance of these drugs as a few label expansions are expected next year.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2112,ABBV,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) is currently going through a transitional stage. The company’s blockbuster drug, Diovan, is facing stiff generic competition in the United States, EU and Japan.  The loss of patent protection for these top-selling drugs continues to hurt sales. Exforge is also facing generic competition in the United States and the EU. Oncology drugs are facing new competition from immuno-oncology therapies. Moreover, certain patents and extensions covering Afinitor and Gilenya will expire in 2018, 2019 and 2020. The negative impact of generic competition will impact sales by $2.5 billion in 2017.CEO Joseph Jimenez will step down from his position in 2018. Vasant Narasimhan, M.D., Global Head of Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, will replace him effective Feb 1, 2018.Nevertheless, we believe that the approval of new drugs and label expansion of existing drugs will boost the company’s top line.Psoriasis drug, Cosentyx, was approved for the treatment of two new indications — ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in 2016. The uptake of Cosentyx has been strong and the company has grabbed market shares from rivals AbbVie Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel. Cosentyx achieved blockbuster status in 2016 recording over $1 billion of sales. Novartis expects to garner $2 billion and $500 million of sales from Cosentyx and Entresto, respectively in 2017. Other approvals include Farydak, Odomzo and the combination of Tafinlar + Mekinist.Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu and an improved formulation of Exjade. The oncology portfolio received a further boosted with the approval of new drugs. The recent FDA approval of Kisqali, for use in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer will boost the sales. The drug was also approved in Europe. Meanwhile, the FDA also approved a label expansion of Zykadia to include the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The European Commission (EC) has recently approved Tasigna for the treatment of pediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) and pediatric patients with Ph+ CML-CP with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib.The FDA recently approved breakthrough gene transfer treatment, Kymriah suspension for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later relapse. Kymriah, formerly CTL019, is the first chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy approved. The approval provided a major boost to Novartis.  The approval opens up new frontiers in the treatment of cancer by advancing immune-cellular therapy for children and young adults with r/r B-cell ALL which comprises approximately 25% of cancer diagnoses among children under 15 years. It is the most common form of childhood cancer in the United States. Kymriah has been launched in the United States.Moreover, Sandoz holds a leading position in the biosimilars space with a portfolio of five marketed biosimilars currently and a deep pipeline. The biosimilar version of Roche Holdings’ (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan (rituximab). Rixathon was approved by the European Commission in June 2017. It is currently under review in the United States. The biosimilar version of Humira is also under review in the EU.  Novartis’ stock has rallied 19.5% year to date compared with the industry’s 18.1% gain. In the first half of 2017, Novartis announced that it is mulling strategic options for Alcon which includes retaining the business separation via capital market transactions such as a spin-off or an initial public offering. The company believes that the Alcon division has revived and hence a decision on a possible spin-off will be taken in 2019.Zacks RankNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2113,ABBV,"Galapagos NV (GLPG  -  Free Report) announced positive top-line data from a phase II study – ALBATROSS – evaluating its cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance (“CFTR”) corrector candidate, GLPG2222, in cystic fibrosis (""CF"") patients. It led to improvements in lung function.So far this year, Galapagos’shares have outperformed the industry. The stock has gained 41.5% compared with an increase of 1.5% registered by the industry.The phase II study evaluated two once-daily doses – 150 mg and 300 mg – of the candidate in CF patients who have one gating mutation and an F508del mutation and were on long-term stable treatment with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated’s (VRTX  -  Free Report) CF drug, Kalydeco. Treatment with Kalydeco was continued during the course of the study.The study achieved its primary objective of safety and was well tolerated in the patient population. Data also showed an improvement of 2.2% in mean percent predicted FEV1 (a measure of lung function) compared to baseline in 300 mg arm of the study.Meanwhile, Vertex is also developing a combination therapy, tezacaftor plus Kalydeco, in similar indication.Apart from GLPG2222, Galapagos is also developing GLPG2737, a CFTR regulator, in a phase I study and GLPG1837, a CFTR potentiator, in a phase II study in CF patients. All three candidates are being developed in partnership with AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report).

2114,ABBV,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved a label expansion for its janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, Xeljanz (tofacitinib), for two doses — 5 mg twice daily and 11 mg once-daily extended-release (XR) formulation.With this latest approval, Xeljanz can now be administered for treating adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), who had an inadequate response to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, respectively.Notably, Xeljanz (5 mg twice daily) is approved in the United States as a second-line treatment option for patients with moderate-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”), who have had an inadequate response to or cannot tolerate methotrexate (MTX). The drug was approved in Europe and China in March for RA. Significantly, this is the first and only JAK inhibitor approved in the United States for both moderate to severe RA and an active PsA.Shares of Pfizer have gained 12.3% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s rally of 16.5%.A supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for Xeljanz was filed with the FDA in May this year for the aforementioned indication. The approval was based on encouraging data from two phase III OPAL (Oral Psoriatic Arthritis TriaL) studies — Broaden and Beyond — on Xeljanz.Both OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of Xeljanz on adult patients with PsA. The programs achieved the primary efficacy endpoint of a statistically significant improvement with twice-daily Xeljanz 5 mg compared with placebo at three months as per measurement by American College of Rheumatology 20 response and the change from baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index score.Overall safety results from these studies were found to be consistent with those observed in the broader rheumatology development program for Xeljanz.We remind investors that the company is also looking to get the drug’s label expanded to include treatment of adult patients suffering from moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis. A response from the FDA is expected in March next year.Additionally, Pfizer is conducting a phase IIIb/IV head-to-head study comparing Xeljanz with AbbVie's (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira. In February, the company announced top-line results from the assessment. Outcomes from the trial demonstrated non-inferiority of combo therapy comprising Xeljanz plus MTX compared with the other combo agents Humira plus MTX, thus meeting the primary endpoint.We are encouraged by Pfizer’s label expansion efforts. Xeljanz’s U.S. sales surged 44% year over year to $935 million in the first nine months of 2017. The drug’s label expansion should boost further the sales.Blockbuster drugs approved to treat PsA and RA include Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ  -  Free Report) Remicade and Amgen, Inc.'s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel that Pfizer markets outside the United States and Canada.In another Pfizer press release, the company announced that it has started a phase III study, evaluating the efficacy and safety of its once-daily janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor, PF-04965842, for treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.

2115,ABBV,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has accepted its supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for priority review of Opdivo plus Yervoy (ipilimumab) for the treatment of intermediate- and poor-risk patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).We note that the FDA had granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for this application which will expedite the development and review of the same.The FDA will make a decision by Apr 16, 2018.The application is based on data from the phase III study, Checkmate -214 study. The study was stopped ahead of schedule based on the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee following a planned interim analysis of overall survival. The study evaluated the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy versus Sutent for previously untreated advanced or metastatic RCC.The study met the co-primary endpoints of improved overall survival and objective response rate compared to Sutent in intermediate- and poor-risk patients. Although the combination demonstrated an improvement in progression-free survival relative to Sutent, another co-primary endpoint, it did not reach statistical significance. So far this year, Bristol-Myers’ shares have rallied 9.2% compared with the industry gain of 20.2%.We note that Opdivo is already approved for a number of indications. These include classical Hodgkin lymphoma, recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum-based therapy. Additionally, it is approved as a monotherapy for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck  in adults progressing on or after platinum-based therapy.Opdivo is also approved for intravenous use for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, who have been previously treated with Nexavar. The drug received approval for liver and colorectal cancers.Meanwhile, the company continues to evaluate Opdivo alone or in combination therapies with Yervoy and other anti-cancer agents. Label expansion of the drug into additional indications will give the product an access to a higher patient population and increase its commercial potential.However, Opdivo is facing competitive challenges in the United States. With the FDA approving Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda, for the first-line treatment of metastatic non-squamous NSCLC, the company is expected to suffer further loss of market share.The virology business is also under pressure.

2116,ABBV,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) announced positive data from phase II study, CA180-372, on Sprycel.Patients received Sprycel 60 mg/m2tablets or powder for oral suspension, once daily, in addition to a chemotherapy regimen modelled on a Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster high-risk backbone for two years or until the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity in the ongoing CA180-372 (NCT01460160) study.The study evaluated Sprycel in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) when added to a chemotherapy regimen. The combination demonstrated an event-free survival rate, the study’s primary endpoint, of 65.5% and an overall survival rate of 91.5% after three years.Meanwhile, patients who had minimal residual disease (MRD) ≥0.05% at the end of the first block of treatment and those with MRD 0.005-0.05% who remained MRD-positive at any detectable level after three additional high-risk chemotherapy blocks, were eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in first remission.We remind investors that Sprycel was approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP) who are resistant or intolerant to prior therapy including imatinib. Sprycel was also approved for adults with Ph+ ALL who are resistant or intolerant to prior therapy.The drug is also approved for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed CP Ph+ CML. Sprycel received FDA approval for the expanded indication for treatment in pediatric patients with CP Ph+ CML in November 2017.The label expansion should improve sales further. So far this year, Bristol-Myers’ shares have rallied 11.6% compared with the industry's gain of 20%.Bristol-Myers’ immuno-oncology Opdivo continues to perform well along with Eliquis and Orencia.

2117,ABBV,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) announced positive results from a post hoc subgroup analysis of the phase II study, SUSTAIN on pipeline candidate, crizanlizumab.The multicenter, multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-month study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the anti-P-selectin antibody crizanlizumab with or without concomitant use of hydroxyurea therapy in patients with sickle cell-related pain crises.Results from the study showed that crizanlizumab deferred the time to first sickle cell pain crisis (SCPC) in patients compared to placebo in key subgroups of adult patients with sickle cell. crizanlizumab at 5.0 mg/kg per month increased the estimated median time to first SCPC versus placebo by approximately two-fold or more.The results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.The data from the study will enable the company to conduct discussions with regulatory agencies. A filing in the United States is expected by the end of 2018.We believe that the approval of new drugs and label expansion of existing drugs will boost the company’s top line.Novartis’ stock has rallied 2.9% in the last six months compared with the industry’s 6.3% gain.Novartis is currently going through a transitional stage.

2118,ABBV,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved the label expansion of its psoriasis drug, Taltz, to include the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adults.We note that Taltz is presently approved for treating moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults who can have systemic therapy or phototherapy.The drug has grown more than 50% in the first nine months of 2017 and contributed significantly to revenues and volumes. This approval for an expanded label in the United States is expected to further boost its growth.Lilly’s stock price has increased 26.9% in the past one year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 20%.Coming back to the news, the FDA’s approval for Taltz’ label expansion was based on data from two phase III studies – SPIRIT-P1 and SPIRIT-P2 – evaluating the drug in active PsA patients, who have not received any  antirheumatic drug therapy or who have failed one or two  tumor necrosis factor (“TNF”) inhibitors, respectively.The drug achieved a reduction of 20% or more in a composite measure of disease activity (ACR20) in more than half of the patient population in both the studies at 24 weeks.The drug (80 mg/mL) can be injected as single agent or in combination with any disease-modifying antirheumatic drug like methotrexate.However, Taltz will face competition from several drugs, especially Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Cosentyx, as both the drug works by targeting IL-17A. Cosentyx is also approved for PsA and plaque psoriasis.PsA is a chronic form of inflammatory arthritis, which is painful and progressive as well. Per the press release, approximately 1.6 million people in the United States are affected by the disease. Apart from Cosentyx, Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Stelara and AbbVie Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira among others are fighting for market share.Eli Lilly and Company Price  Eli Lilly and Company Price | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteLilly carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2119,ABBV,"Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced the launch of its Enbrel Mini with AutoTouch, a new auto injector device for Enbrel in the United States.The Enbrel Mini single-dose prefilled cartridges, used with the AutoTouch reusable autoinjector device, provide an additional administration option for rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel. The Enbrel Mini with AutoTouch device was approved by the FDA in September.Amgen’s shares have rallied 16.2% this year so far, better than the industry’s growth of 1.5%.Sales of Amgen’s largest product Enbrel have been soft for quite some time now. Pricing pressure and stiff competition are hurting sales of Enbrel, one of the main drivers of Amgen’s revenues. Enbrel has recorded sales of $4.01 billion in 2017 so far, a decline of 7% year over year.The RA market is extremity crowded, given the presence of treatments like AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xeljanz among others.It remains to be seen if this new device for Enbrel can lead to some improvement in sales. However, on the Q3 conference call, Amgen had said that the declining trends in price and market share will continue in 2018.In Europe, while biosimilar versions of Enbrel are available, in the United States, Sandoz, the generic arm of Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), has received FDA approval for its biosimilar version of Enbrel, Erelzi. Notably, Erelzi is yet to be launched in the United States.Currently, Amgen has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2120,ABBV,"Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved a line extension for its IL-17A inhibitor drug, Cosentyx, in moderate-to-severe scalp psoriasis. The FDA approval comes on the back of positive efficacy and safety outcomes from a dedicated phase III study – SCALP – in patients with scalp psoriasis.We note that the drug was approved for a similar indication in Europe in June 2017. It is already approved for the treatment of plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing spondylitis (“AS”).Per the press release, scalp psoriasis is one of the difficult to treat forms of psoriasis, which affects about half of the approximately 125 million patients with the disease. The line extension of the drug is an important achievement as treatment of scalp psoriasis with topical agents or phototherapy is challenging due to the presence of hair and other factors.Novartis’ shares have returned 13.7% in the past year, compared to the industry’s gain of 14.1% in the same period. The SCALP study evaluated the subcutaneous administration of Cosentyx (300 mg) for 12 weeks. Data showed significant improvement in patients compared to placebo.Cosentyx’s performance was impressive in 2017. It achieved multi-blockbuster drug status on the back of strong growth in all the approved indications. Sales of the drug increased 82% in 2017 to surpass the $2 billion mark.The drug has shown superiority in clinical studies to Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Stelara and Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel in treating psoriasis. Novartis is also conducting head-to-head clinical trials – EXCEED and SURPASS – to evaluate the superiority of Cosentyx versus AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira in PsA and to a proposed biosimilar of Humira in AS, respectively.The superiority of the drug over Stelara and Enbrel has helped it gain market share. Potential superiority over Humira and its biosimilar along with this line extension in scalp psoriasis will certainly boost the prospect of the drug.Novartis AG Price  Novartis AG Price | Novartis AG QuoteZacks RankNovartis carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2121,ABBV,"Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) received a major boost when the FDA approved the company’s once-daily single tablet regimen (“STR”), Biktarvy (bictegravir 50mg/emtricitabine 200mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25mg, BIC/FTC/TAF) for HIV-1 infection.The approval, which comes ahead of the PDUFA date of Feb 12, 2018, provides a major boost to Gilead’s HIV franchise.Though the company topped both earnings and revenue estimates in the fourth quarter, the magnitude of the decline in HCV sales was wider-than-expected. The HCV franchise has been under pressure for a while due to lower patient starts and increased competition form AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report).The company’s guidance for 2018 also lacks lustre and we expect sales of the same to decline further.  Amid such a scenario, the approval of this latest triple HIV therapy is likely to provide an impetus to the stock as Gilead is now banking on its HIV franchise and newer avenues like the CAR-T therapy post the Kite acquisition and promising NASH candidates for growth. Following the news of the approval, shares of the company moved up 3.8%. Gilead’s stock has gained 14.4% in the last six months as against the industry's decline of 3.6%.Biktarvy, Gilead’s latest triple therapy, is approved as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults who have no antiretroviral treatment history or to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen for at least three months with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to the individual components of Biktarvy.Meanwhile, the HIV franchise continues to gain traction on the back of rapid adoption of TAF-based regimens in the United States and EU. The TAF-based regimens now represent 62% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya along with Odefsey and Descovy in 2016.Biktarvy combines the novel, unboosted integrase strand transfer inhibitor (“INSTI”) bictegravir, with the demonstrated safety and efficacy profile of the Descovy, (FTC/TAF) dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (“NRTI”) backbone, and is the smallest INSTI-based triple-therapy STR available.The approval of Biktarvy was supported by encouraging data from four ongoing studies: Studies 1489 and 1490 in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults, and Studies 1844 and 1878 in virologically suppressed adults. Biktarvy met its primary objective of non-inferiority at 48 weeks across all four studies.However, Biktarvy has a Boxed Warning in its product label regarding the risk of post treatment acute exacerbation of hepatitis B.The approval of this new HIV therapy will pose stiff competition to GlaxoSmith’s (GSK  -  Free Report) existing therapies, Tivicay and Triumeq.On the other hand, per a report from Reuters, ViiV Healthcare, a joint venture majority-owned by GlaxoSmith with Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Shionogi Ltd has filed a lawsuit against Gilead alleging patent infringement on ViiV's dolutegravir, a component of the venture's triple-drug HIV treatment Triumeq.Zacks RankGilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2122,ABBV,"Growth at a reasonable price or GARP is an excellent way for investors to make some quick gains. This strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks that have impressive prospects and are trading at a discount.The GARP approach leads to the identification of stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.That means a portfolio created on the basis of GARP strategy is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth and solid prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that are likely to offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 14.Here are seven of the 14 stocks that made it through the screen:MSCI Inc. (MSCI  -  Free Report) is an independent provider of research-driven insights and tools for institutional investors.

2123,ABBV,"Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s (GILD  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 results wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed expectations. However, management issued a bleak view for 2018.  Consequently, the stock declined in after-market hours trading and is expected to open in the red given the expectation of a further decline in hepatitis C virus (HCV) franchise in 2018.  Nevertheless, Gilead’s stock has gained 10.9% in the last six months as against the industry's  decline of 4.6%.The company’s fourth-quarter earnings of $1.78 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.70. However, earnings were below the year-ago quarter figure of $2.70 per share.Moreover, total revenues of $5.9 billion topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.8 billion. However, revenues declined 18.7% year over year. Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and Consensus  Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and Consensus | Gilead Sciences, Inc. Quote Harvoni & Sovaldi Plunges FurtherProduct sales came in at $5.8 billion, down 19.1% year over year. The decline was due to lower HCV sales, partially offset by higher sales across HIV and other therapeutic areas.Antiviral product sales, which include Gilead's HIV and liver disease portfolio, came in at $5.2 billion in the quarter, down 21.2%.HCV product sales, which include Harvoni, Sovaldi, Epclusa and Vosevi, were $1.5 billion, down from $3.2 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside was mainly attributed to lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi across all major markets.Sales of Harvoni declined 60.7% year over year to $644 million in the quarter. Further, Sovaldi sales recorded a steep year-over-year decline of 78.4% to $117 million.Epclusa garnered sales of $565 million in the quarter, down from the year-ago figure of $1.0 billion.Meanwhile, HIV and HBV product sales came in at $3.7 billion, up 8.8% year over year. The increase was primarily driven by continuous strong uptake of tenofoviral afenamide (TAF)-based products such as Genvoya, which generated sales of $1,060 million, up from $563 million in the year-ago quarter, Descovy, which recorded sales of $365 million, up from $149 million, and Odefsey, which registered sales of $325 million, up from $155 million. HIV treatments like Stribild and Complera/Eviplera sales declined 42.6% and 25.2% respectively. Viread sales were down at $212 million, down 34.6%.Atripla sales tanked 27.5% to $440 million, while Truvada sales fell 8.2% to $797 million.Other products like Letairis, Ranexa, AmBisome and Zydelig recorded sales of $233 million (up 3.1%), $200 million (down 4.7%), $90 million (down 4.4%) and $39 million, respectively.Research & development (R&D) expenses declined 11.9% to $845 million due to the 2016 impact of ongoing milestone payments. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased 1.6% to $923 million. Adjusted product gross margin was 83.5% compared to 88.1% in the year-ago period.2017 ResultsRevenues in 2017 came in at $26.1 billion, down from $30.4 billion in 2016 and surpassed Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.9 billion. Earnings per share came in at $8.84, down from $11.57 in 2016 and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.73.2018 GuidanceGilead now expects net product sales in the range of $20-$21 billion. Adjusted R&D expenses and adjusted SG&A expenses are projected in the range of $3.4-$3.6 billion and $3.4-$3.6 billion, respectively. Adjusted product gross margin is expected in the range of 85-87%.AcquisitionsThe company acquired Kite Pharma in 2017. The FDA approval for Yescarta, a CAR-T therapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy should Gilead’s prospects.The company recently acquired Cell Design Labs to expand further in the CAR-T space.Dividend and Share RepurchaseConcurrently, Gilead declared a cash dividend of 57 cents per share of common stock for first-quarter 2018, an increase of 10%. The dividend is payable on Mar 29 to stockholders of record at the close of business on Mar 16. During 2017, the company paid cash dividends of $2.7 billion and repurchased shares for $954 million.Our TakeThough the company topped both earnings and revenue estimates in the fourth quarter, the magnitude of the decline in HCV sales was larger-than-expected. The HCV franchise is under tremendous pressure due to lower patient starts and increasing competition. We expect sales to decline further going forward.  We note that Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa, face competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR, Bristol-Myers’(BMY  -  Free Report) and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zepatier. Both pricing and market share are expected to stabilize by mid-2018 while patient starts are expected to decline further.Meanwhile, the HIV franchise maintains momentum driven by the rapid adoption of TAF-based regimens in the United States and EU. The TAF-based regimens now represent 62% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and the launches of Odefsey and Descovy in 2016. Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting also put up a strong performance as the company saw a significant uptick in PrEP usage in 2017 with an estimated 153,000 patients using Truvada by the end of 2017. The approval of Yescarta also bodes well for Gilead. We expect the decline in HCV franchise to offset the positive momentum of HIV franchise. Gilead is also intending to foray into the NASH market with pipeline candidates- selonsertib and filgotinib.Zacks RankGilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

2125,ABBV,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) reported mixed results in the third quarter of 2017. The company surpassed earnings estimates, while posted in-line revenues during the period. Importantly, the company raised its long-term sales expectations of its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, despite rising competition in the market. In response, shares nudged up almost 2% in pre-market trading.In the year so far, AbbVie’s shares have surged 48.6%, significantly outperforming the industry’s 16.1% rally.The biopharmaceutical company reported third-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.41 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.39 by 1.4%. The bottom line grew 16.5% year over year.The company posted revenues of $7 billion in the reported quarter, having met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues also increased 9.5% year over year. Excluding a 0.7% favorable impact from foreign exchange rate fluctuations, operational revenues climbed 8.8%.Quarter in DetailKey drug Humira recorded sales growth of 14.8%, on an operational basis, with revenues coming in at $4.7 billion. Sales in the United States rallied 19.1% to $3.2 billion. Humira sales in the ex-U.S. market were up 6.8% on operational basis and 9.7% on reported basis to $1.55 billion. Growth across all three major market categories drove the upside, despite increasing competition from new classes of drugs as well as an indirect biosimilar competition in international markets.Third-quarter net revenue from Imbruvica stood at $688 million, up 37.3% year over year. U.S. sales of Imbruvica were $574 million, up 31% compared with the year-ago figure. AbbVie recorded $114 million of international profit sharing with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report).Other products that delivered an impressive performance include Duodopa, showing revenue growth of 22% on operational and 26.3% on reported basis.

The downside can be attributable to intense pricing and competitive pressure in the HCV market.Adjusted SG&A expenses were up 5.8% to $1.45 billion, while R&D expenses escalated 13.3% to $1.19 billion in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 43.1% of sales in the reported quarter.AbbVie announced an 11% hike in quarterly dividend to 71 cents per share from 64 cents per share.

Though Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Humira biosimilar received an FDA approval in September 2016, its launch is delayed to 2023 due to settlement of its patent dispute with AbbVie. This will make Humira free from competition for a few more years.

Revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.3 billion by 4%.Full-Year UpdateFor 2017, the company reported adjusted earnings of $5.03, up 13.5% year over year. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.8%.Centene reported total revenues of $48.4 billion, up 19% year over year. The rise was primarily driven by Health Net's results throughout the year, impact of growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business in 2017 and expansions and new programs in many states in 2016 and 2017.At the end of the year, managed care membership totaled 12.2 million, up 7% from 2016.Quarterly Operational UpdateHealth Benefit Ratio (HBR) for the fourth quarter was 87.3% compared with 84.8% in the prior-year quarter. This reflects a year-over-year improvement of 250 basis points (bps).In the quarter, adjusted selling, general & administrative (SG&A) ratio was 10.5%, up 110 bps year over year. The deteriorationis a result of increased business expansion costs over the prior-year quarter. Notably, revenues recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016, relating to the minimum MLR amendment in California, had reduced the quarter’s adjusted SG&A expense ratio. Hence, the expense ratio for the fourth-quarter 2017 appears higher compared to the year-ago quarter.Total operating expenses of $12.6 billion at the end of fourth quarter increased nearly 11% from the prior-year quarter.Centene Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Centene Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Centene Corporation QuoteFinancial UpdateAs of Dec 31, 2017, Centene had cash and cash equivalents of $4 billion, up 3.6% from 2016 end.Total assets of $21.8 billion grew 8.2%.As of Dec 31, 2017, Centene’s long-term debt totaled $4.7 billion, up 0.9%.For 2017, cash inflow from operations was $1,489 million compared with $1,851 million at the end of 2016.2018 GuidanceCentene expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $6.95-$7.35, up from the previously guided range of $5.47-$5.87.Total revenues are expected to be in the range of $60.6-$61.4 billion, up from the earlier guidance of $60.0 billion to $60.8 billion.HBR is expected in the range of 86.2-86.7% compared with the previous guidance of 86.3% to 86.8%.Adjusted SG&A expense ratio is expected in the range of 9.2-9.7%, up from the previous guidance of 9.0% to 9.5%. Shares outstanding is expected be between 199.1 million and 200.1 million, down from the previous guidance of 201.1 million to 202.1 million.Zacks Rank and Performance of Other PeersCentene sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Strong sales of Opdivo and Eliquis contributed to the top line in the reported quarter.Shares of the company were up almost 4% in pre-market trading, presumably on better-than expected earnings. Bristol-Myers’ shares have increased 24.4% in the past year, which compares favorably with the industry’s increase of 19%.Quarterly DetailsRevenues were up 2% year over year when adjusted for foreign exchange impact. Revenues increased 7% to $2.9 billion in the United States and 1% outside the country. Ex-U.S. revenues were down 3% when adjusted for foreign exchange impact.Leukemia drug Sprycel raked in sales of $527 million, up 7% year over year.

Multiple myeloma drug, Empliciti recorded sales of $63 million, up 34% year over year.Research and development (R&D) expenses in the quarter increased 37% to $1.9 billion mainly due to a charge of $377 million related to license and asset acquisition, while marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 11% to $1.3 billion.Gross margin was 69.3% in the quarter compared with 73.6% in the year-ago quarter due to change in product mix.In December 2017, Bristol-Myers and privately-held TARIS Biomedical LLC announced a clinical collaboration to evaluate the combination of Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo and TARIS’ investigational product, TAR-200, in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer. Moreover, Bristol-Myers also entered into an agreement with Japan based Ono Pharmaceutical in the same months. The agreement grants Bristol-Myers rights to develop and commercialize Ono’s selective Prostaglandin E2 receptor 4 antagonist, ONO-4578.2017 PerformanceProduct sales increased 8.8% to $19.25 billion, primarily driven by strong sales of Opdico following several line extensions.

Adjusted earnings per share for the full year came in at $3.01.Pipeline UpdateIn February 2018, Bristol Myers announced data from a phase III study, Checkmate -227, which showed superior progression-free survival in first-line non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) treated with Opdivo – Yervoy combination compared to chemotherapy.

The company projects earnings in the range of $3.15 to $3.30 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $3.21.

The 2018 guidance was also encouraging. Meanwhile, we are positive on Bristol-Myers’ efforts to develop its pipeline, especially Opdivo. Several label expansion applications for Opdivo are under review in the United States and Europe. Potential approval will the prospects of these drugs.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company QuoteBristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2128,ABBV,"Biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of $2.89 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.04 by 4.9%. Earnings were flat year over year as lower sales and higher operating costs offset the benefit of a lower tax rate.Including a $6.1 billion charge related to U.S. tax reform, fourth-quarter 2017 loss per share was $5.89 against earnings of $2.59 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016.Total revenues of $5.80 billion in the quarter missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.86 billion. Revenues declined 3% year over year.Quarter in DetailTotal product revenues declined 2% from the year-ago quarter to $5.57 billion (U.S.: $4.35 billion; ex-U.S.: $1.22 billion) as increasing demand for newer products like Prolia, Kyprolis, Xgeva and Blincyto was not enough to make up for lower sales of some of Amgen’s largest products like Enbrel, Aranesp, Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen due to competitive pressure.Revenues of Amgen’s erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA), Aranesp, declined 7% from the year-ago quarter to $491 million due to lower demand and unfavorable changes in currency rates.Revenues of the other ESA, Epogen, declined 15% to $270 million due to lower selling price owing to a newly negotiated contract with DaVita Inc.Neulasta revenues were flat at $1.14 billion from the year-ago period as lower demand was offset by changes in accounting estimates.Increased competition from PD-1s and other new cancer therapies is hurting demand for Neulasta. However, the Neulasta Onpro kit (on-body injector) continues to perform well, commanding a market share of about 60% in the United States for all Neulasta sales.Please note that Neulasta and Epogen could start facing biosimilar competition in the United States this year, which will hurt sales further.Neupogen recorded a 27% decline in sales to $126 million due to biosimilar competition in the United States. Zarxio, Sandoz’s (Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm) biosimilar version of Neupogen, was launched in the United States in September 2015 and is hurting sales.Enbrel delivered revenues of $1.42 billion, down 13% from the year-ago quarter due to lower selling prices and increased competition, which hurt demand. Amgen launched the Enbrel AutoTouch, an autoinjector device in November last year.Prolia revenues came in at $574 million, up 24% from the year-ago quarter due to higher demand. The osteoporosis drug witnessed continued growth in new patient starts and strong repeat injection rates, which drove year-over-year growth.Meanwhile, Xgeva delivered revenues of $391 million, up 4% from the year-ago quarter mainly due to higher demand and favorable changes in inventory levels.Earlier this year, Amgen gained FDA approval for an expanded label for Xgeva to include prevention ofskeletal-related events (SREs) inpatients with multiple myeloma. Until now Xgeva was only approved for the prevention of SREs in solid tumors in patients with bone metastases. The approval for the expanded patient population may drive sales of Xgeva in future quarters.Sensipar/Mimpara revenues were flat at $411 million as higher price increases were offset by unfavorable inventory changes.Vectibix revenues came in at $159 million, up 11%, driven by higher demand.Kyprolis recorded sales of $227 million, up 24% year over year driven by higher demand and robust uptake from outside U.S. markets.Amgen’s regulatory application in the United States to include overall survival data from the ENDEAVOR study on the label of Kyprolis was granted approval by the FDA earlier this month. Also, earlier this week Amgen announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has given a positive opinion recommending addition of ENDEAVOR on Kyprolis label in the EU. The study demonstrated that a combination of Kyprolis plus dexamethasone led to superior overall survival when compared to Takeda’s Velcade plus dexamethasone. This overall survival data, if approved, can help drive usage and boost sales of Kyprolis.Blincyto sales surged 59% from the year-ago period to $46 million, reflecting higher demand.Amgen’s PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha generated revenues of $98 million compared with $89 million in the third quarter.Uptake of the drug, which gained FDA approval in August 2015, has not been very encouraging so far due to pricing and re-imbursement issues/payer restrictions. Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals also faced similar issues with their PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent. The priority for Amgen right now is to improve patient access to Repatha.In December, Amgen gained FDA approval to include a new indication - risk reduction of major cardiovascular events data – on Repatha’s label based on data from the phase III cardiovascular outcomes study, FOURIER.This makes Repatha the first PCSK9 inhibitor to prevent heart attacks, strokes and coronary revascularizations in adults with established cardiovascular disease. With the cardiovascular indication approved to be included in Repatha’s label, patient access to Repatha is expected to improve.Operating Margins DecreaseAdjusted operating margins declined 460 basis points (bps) to 45.9% due to higher operating costs and $79 million in expenses related to Hurricane Maria recovery efforts.R&D expenses declined 3% in the quarter due to lower late-stage pipeline related costs and lower payments for in-licensing transactions. SG&A spend increased 8% due to higher investments to support new product launches, which partially offset the impact of October 2016 expiration of Enbrel residual royalty payments.This month, Amgen’s board of directors approved a new share buyback plan of $10 billion, bringing the total existing share repurchase authorization to $14.4 billion.2017 ResultsFull-year 2017 sales of $22.85 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.90 billion. Revenues were within the guidance range of $22.7 billion to $23.0 billion. Sales declined 1% year over year.Adjusted earnings for 2017 were $12.58 per share, also missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.69 per share. Earnings were within the guidance range of $12.50 to $12.70. Earnings rose 8% year over year.2018 GuidanceThe company expects total revenues in the range of $21.8 billion to $22.8 billion, which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.90 billion. Adjusted earnings are now expected in the range of $12.60 to $13.70 in 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $12.65 per share.Adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 14%-15%, much lower than 18% in 2017 reflecting the impact of tax reform.On expectation of an improved cash position following the tax reform, Amgen plans to invest approximately $3.5 billion over the next five years in capital expenditures. Approximately 75% of this investment will be made in the United States including setting up a new drug substance manufacturing plant in the country.Our TakeAmgen had a rather poor quarter as it missed expectations for both earnings and sales and also issued a lower-than-expected sales guidance for 2018. Shares lost 1.7% in after-market trading in response. However, in the past year, Amgen’s shares have returned 10.7%, better than the 4.6% increase registered by the industry.Though Amgen’s newer products – Prolia, Xgeva, Vectibix, Nplate and Sensipar – are all performing well, their volume growth is not enough to offset the decline in mature brands like Enbrel due to competitive pressure. However, Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline and expects approval and launch of migraine candidate, Aimovig this year. Also, Amgevita, Amgen’s biosimilar version of AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, Humira is expected to be launched in Europe later this year. Parsabiv, a specialty product for kidney disease, was launched in the United States last month. Also, management seems quite confident that Repatha will become an important growth driver for the company with the inclusion of outcomes data on its label. Nonetheless, other than continuing competitive dynamics for Enbrel, possible generic competition to Sensipar and new competition for Neulasta and Aranesp could be the new challenges in 2018.Amgen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2129,ABBV,"AstraZeneca plc (AZN  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 core earnings of 65 cents per American Depositary Share (ADS), which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45 cents. Core earnings rose 13% year over year at constant exchange rates (CER). Higher product sales boosted profits in the quarter.Total revenues rose 2% at CER to $5.78 billion in the reported quarter. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.59 billion. Revenue growth, however, was partially offset by decrease in externalization revenues.Meanwhile, product sales rose 3% at CER in the quarter due to better performance of new products, partially offset by lower sales of legacy products.Key growth platforms (representing 68% of total revenues) were up 12% in the quarter at CER. Among the key growth platforms, Emerging Markets, New Cardiovascular & Metabolic Diseases (""CVMD""), New Oncology and Japan performed well in the quarter.All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-over-year basis and at CER.Product Sales ImpressCrestor sales declined 7% to $594 million with sales in Europe down due to the entry of multiple generic versions of the drug in the market. The negative impact is expected to continue in Europe in 2018.Seroquel XR sales declined 9% to $108 million due to competition from generic launches.In the quarter, Onglyza sales rose 19% to $180 million driven by growth in emerging markets.Symbicort sales remained flat in the quarter at $752 million as higher sales in emerging market were offset by lower sales in the United States. U.S. sales declined due to continued pricing pressure from managed-care access within the ICS/LABA class and also competition from other class like LAMA/LABA combination medicines.Nexium recorded sales of $427 million, down 12%.Other than Crestor and Seroquel XR, other legacy products that recorded decline in the quarter include Zoladex (down 21% to $187 million), Seloken/Toprol-XL (down 7% to $168 million), Casodex (down 8% to $54 million) and Atacand (down 10% to $73 million).However, older drugs, which grew in the quarter include Iressa (up 8% to $130 million), Pulmicort (up 26% to $371 million), Faslodex (up 5% to $238 million) and Daliresp/Daxas (up 27% to $53 million).Among the newer medicines, Lynparza sales rose 58% to $100 million. While sales in the United States gained from the label expansion approval in August for the treatment of second-line ovarian cancer, in Europe, sales were pushed higher by a number of successful launches. Please note that AstraZeneca shares Lynparza’s development cost and profits equally with Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report).Brilinta/Brilique sales were $299 million in the reported quarter, up 24% year over year. Brilinta maintained its leadership position in the U.S. branded oral anti-platelet market. In the United States., Europe and China, Brilinta continued to display an impressive performance.Tagrisso, launched in 2015, recorded sales of $304 million, up 105% year over year. Another new medicine, Movantik/Moventig recorded sales of $30 million in the quarter.Bevespi, a LAMA/LABA in a pressurized metered dose inhaler launched commercially in the United States in January 2017, recorded sales of $8 million in the quarter, higher than $4 million in the third quarter amid slower-than-anticipated growth in LAMA/LABA class.PD-L1 inhibitor Imfinzi, launched for second-line bladder cancer in the United States in May 2017, generated sales of $18 million in the fourth quarter. A regulatory application seeking label expansion of Imfinzi to treat an earlier stage of lung cancer was granted priority review by the FDA.Imfinzi is a key candidate in the company’s immuno-oncology pipeline. The candidate is being evaluated for multiple cancers, either alone or in combination with other regimens. In October 2017, AstraZeneca expanded its clinical trial collaboration with Incyte (INCY  -  Free Report) to evaluate the latter’s investigational selective IDO1 enzyme inhibitor, epacadostat, in combination with Imfinzi, compared to Imfinzi alone in early lung cancer.2017 PerformanceProduct sales declined 5% to $20.15 billion, primarily due to generic competition for Crestor and Seroquel XR and pricing pressure for Symbicort in the United States. European markets witnessed a 7% decline in sales to $4.75 billion. Revenues from Emerging Markets were up 8% to $6.15 billion primarily on the back of strong growth in China (up 15% to $2.96 billion). In Established ROW market, sales were flat at $3.08 billion.Other DetailsAstraZeneca’s core gross margin declined 10 basis points (bps) to 79.4%. Core selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses rose 5% to $2.18 billion.In the quarter, core research and development (R&D) expenses declined 4% to $1.46 billion.2018 OutlookAstraZeneca provided EPS guidance for 2018, which is expected in the range of $1.65 to $1.75 per ADR. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $1.71 per ADR. The company also expects revenues to grow in low single digit percentage.Based on the average exchange rates in January 2018, currency movements are expected to favorably impact the top line by a low single-digit percentage but minimally impact core EPS.Our TakeAstraZeneca’s fourth-quarter performance was impressive as it beat estimates for both earnings and sales.  It also provided an encouraging outlook for 2018. Revenues improved during 2017 and the company expects the trend to continue in 2018. AstraZeneca announced quite a few positive developments on the regulatory and pipeline front in the past year. Several readouts are expected in 2018. Backed by the positive news flow, in the past year, AstraZeneca’s shares have gained 25.9%, comparing favorably with the industry’s growth of 20.9%.AstraZeneca carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2130,ABBV,"Since we have entered the Q4 reporting cycle, looking for stocks with unswerving earnings growth is the highest priority for astute investors. And why not? If the company doesn’t make money, it won’t last over the long haul. Consider a company’s revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you have earnings.This metric is also considered to be the most noteworthy variable in influencing the share price. Better-than-expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price. However, in addition to actual earnings, expectations of earnings play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock.Earnings Estimates Shape Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinions of factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost controls. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while taking investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.As the earnings season picks up pace, investors should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move. Hence, it is important for investors to invest in stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we have added the following parameters:Zacks Rank equal to 1 (Only Zacks' 'Strong Buys' are allowed. With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there, this is a great way to start things off.)

2134,ABBV,"Before we attempt to get our arms around another deluge of earnings reports ahead of the final opening bell of this trading week, we get a first look at Q3 GDP: 3.0%, up from the consensus estimate of 2.7%, and a second consecutive 3-handle following Q2’s final read of 3.1%. This marks the first time since 2014 the U.S. economy had GDP numbers at or above 3% since 2014.Particularly noteworthy about this number is that we did see some negative impact on GDP in the quarter from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria — most notably in consumer spending, which had ratcheted down from 3.3% the previous quarter to 2.4% this time around. That Q3 GDP could take a 90-basis-point hit and still reach 3% illustrates economic strength beyond the power of the consumer.Inventories were up 0.7%, but this is normal coming as it does ahead of holiday season. Perhaps surprisingly, the federal government spent more in Q3. And maybe most importantly, as Zacks Chief Strategist John Blank pointed out last week, no major economies in the world are currently experiencing a recession. Growth is now global and synchronized; it is a very rare occurrence to see no geopolitical headwinds from the Americas to Europe to Asia-Pacific.Q3 Earnings Roll OnAside from big blowout beats after yesterday’s close from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) — which by themselves have already added an additional $80 billion to the market — we see more earnings tonnage, generally from oil & gas and pharma/bio sectors:ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) shares are up modestly in today’s pre-market following Q3 results that surpassed estimates on both top and bottom lines. Earnings of 93 cents per share topped the Zacks consensus by 4 cents, whereas revenues really outperformed expectations: $66.17 billion far exceeded the $63.51 billion we had been looking for. This marks the fourth beat out of the past five quarters for the largest oil & gas “supermajor,” and in an energy sector that has struggled in 2017, XOM looks to be improving.Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) also beat estimates for both earnings and sales this morning, with $1.03 per share surpassing the 98-cent consensus on revenues of $36.21 billion, ahead of the $34.06 expected. Outgoing CEO John Watson, who will retire early next year, cited continued improvement in both earnings and cash flow for the supermajor.Refining company Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) posted a mixed Q3 during today’s pre-market, with earnings of $1.66 per share beating the consensus estimate by 4 cents, though $26.2 billion in revenues fell short of our estimated $29.9 billion. The company’s Refining business more than tripled in the quarter, offset by underperformance quarter over quarter from Midstream, Chemicals and Marketing.Pharmaceuticals major Merck & Co. (MRK  -  Free Report) posted $1.11 per share, ahead of the $1.03 Zacks consensus estimate. However, quarterly sales of $10.33 billion was short of the $10.50 billion we had been expecting. That said, Merck upped its fiscal year earnings guidance from $3.76-3.88 per share last time around to $3.91-3.97 this morning. Following an initial bump up of 1% in the pre-market, shares are now trading down more than 2.5% ahead of the bell.Also, biopharma firm AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report), which had branched off from Abbott Labs in 2013, beat earnings estimates by 2 cents to $1.41 per share, whereas revenues of $7 billion came in basically in-line with estimates. Lymphoma treatment Imbruvica rose 37.3% year over year, and rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira improved 14.8% from the year-ago quarter.

2135,ABBV,"AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (“BTD”) to its investigational JAK1 inhibitor, upadacitinib (ABT-494) for the treatment of severe atopic dermatitisThe designation aims to expedite the development and review of drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and provide patients access to these as soon as possible.AbbVie’s shares have increased 55.2% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 16.3% during that period.The FDA has granted the BTD designation to upadacitinib based on positive data from a phase IIb study announced in September 2017.The study’s primary outcome was the mean percentage change in Eczema Area and Severity Index (""EASI"") score, a tool used to measure the extent of disease severity. In the study, upadacitinib showed greater mean percentage change from baseline in EASI score compared with placebo at 16 weeks. Also, 50% of the patients receiving 30 mg once-daily dose of upadacitinib showed almost clear skin. Additionally, the study met secondary endpoints, demonstrating a significant reduction in skin itching.Upadacitinib is also being investigated in six phase III studies for rheumatoid arthritis. Other studies are also underway for the treatment of Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and psoriatic arthritis.Per National Eczema Association, around 28 million people in the United States are affected with atopic dermatitis.We remind investors that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) along with partner Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) had launched Dupixent injection for treating atopic dermatitis early in 2017. Thus, upadacitinib  has to contend  with competitive pressure in the market, once approved.AbbVie Inc. Price  AbbVie Inc. Price | AbbVie Inc.

2136,ABBV,"Whether its eating a gooey, chocolatey brownie or taking a few hits off a freshly rolled joint, it’s common knowledge that a lot of people like to get high. Many investors, however, have yet to “light up.” Some hesitate from adding marijuana stocks to their portfolio on apprehensions that pot companies are involved in scams or that it’s still deemed illegal by the federal government.Let’s not forget that this market has turned into a big money-maker. Not only is it one of the fastest growing industries in the U.S., but it also received a major boost after the 2016 election, where marijuana was declared legal for recreational and medical purposes in seven additional states.Marijuana sales have the potential to greatly add to the government’s treasury as well, and it will be immensely helpful in medical fields. Nowadays, it is also easier for banks for provide services for legal marijuana businesses. Banking on this optimism, we have selected the largest, most stable, and legal cannabis related companies that will rake in high returns for you.Focus on LegalizationWhen Americans headed to the polls during the last presidential election, nine states—Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Arkansas, Florida, and North Dakota—were set to vote on medical and recreational cannabis initiatives. Gallup polls ahead of the election showed that voters backing full legalization soared from a meager 12% in 1969 to 60% in recent times.When the results came in, Maine, California, Massachusetts, and Nevada all passed measures to legalize recreational marijuana use, while Arizona’s highly contested Proposition 205 recreational marijuana measure failed. Florida, North Dakota, and Arkansas all voted to legalize medical marijuana usage, and Montana voted to expand the state’s medical marijuana laws.In fact, the number of states legalizing marijuana has been rising at a steady pace since 2000. Prior to that year, only three states—California, Maine, and Oregon—had made medical cannabis legal. In the last six years, however, around 15 states have officially authorized medical marijuana, and 25 states have adopted medical marijuana programs, including the District of Columbia. Just last year, medical marijuana was legalized in Ohio and Pennsylvania.Tax Revenue to ImproveSales from legalizing marijuana could help significantly boost the government’s tax revenues. In states like Colorado and Washington, the government collected roughly $70 million in tax revenue from recreational marijuana sales back in 2014, according to CNN and Time Magazine.The legal marijuana industry is growing at a rapid pace, and gained 25% to $5.7 billion in 2015, making it one of the fastest-paced industries in the U.S., according to ArcView Group; the market research firm added that the industry was expected to grow by $7.1 billion last year. Financial behemoth Bank of American (BAC  -  Free Report) even said that the U.S. marijuana market could reach a net worth of $30 billion annually by 2020, almost three times the yearly revenue of the National Football League.4 Marijuana Stocks to ConsiderGiven such bullish trends, the movement to legalize marijuana has definitely picked up steam. Below are four cannabis-linked stocks that are poised to benefit from legalization.AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) is a biopharmaceutical company that already has a cannabis-based drug approved by the FDA. Called Marinol, the drug relieves nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy; it is also used for AIDS patients who have lost their appetites.Corbus Pharmaceuticals Inc. (CRBP  -  Free Report), a biopharmaceutical company, focuses on the development and commercialization of therapeutics to treat life threatening inflammatory-fibrotic diseases. Its key product, the oral endocannabinoid-memetic drug Resunab, helps treat systemic sclerosis, a chronic autoimmune rheumatic disease.Another leader in the industry is Insys Therapeutics Inc. (INSY  -  Free Report), known for developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products that target the unmet needs of cancer patients. Its first synthetic cannabinoid candidate, Syndros, was approved by the FDA as a treatment for anorexia associated with weight loss in AIDS patients, and nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional treatments.Zynerba Pharmaceuticals  is a specialty pharmaceutical company that focuses on developing and commercializing proprietary synthetic cannabinoid therapeutics. It has developed a candidate temporarily named ZYN002, which is in clinical trials for the treatment of refractory epilepsy, Fragile X syndrome, and osteoarthritis.Investors could also consider looking at the industry’s first ETF from Horizons ETFs Management Inc., which is based in Canada. Horizons Medical Marijuana Life Sciences ETF trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker 'HMMJ,' but provides exposure to North American-listed stocks that are involved with medical marijuana bioengineering and production. HMMJ has surged over 142% in the past one year.Bottom LineThere is no doubt about the profit potential in weed. The industry is moving at a rapid pace, with new developments in growing technology and medical treatments popping up quickly and consistently.But it’s important to recognize that many of these cannabis-based treatments are still in their trial stages, and have yet to translate to financial success for many of the biopharmaceutical companies listed above.These therapies show great promise, but the future of marijuana in the medical and biopharma industries depends, of course, on legalization. If marijuana is ever rescheduled—check out how the United States schedules, or classifies, controlled substances here—and deemed to have medical benefits, these companies could finally see their synthetic or organic cannabis-based treatments enter the market, and most importantly, their bottom lines benefit.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, and for the next month, you can follow all Zacks’ private buys and sells in real time.

2137,ABBV,"Biotech bigwig Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) develops drugs for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (“HIV”), liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) infection and chronic hepatitis B virus (“HBV”) infection, cardiovascular, hematology/oncology and inflammation/respiratory diseases.Apart from blockbuster HCV drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni and the recently launched Epclusa, primary products at Gilead include Stribild, Viread, Atripla, Complera/Eviplera and Emtriva among others, along with the tenofovir alafenamide (“TAF”)-based products Genvoya, Odefsey and Descovy and newly approved HBV drug, Vemlidy.Gilead had a solid presence in the HCV market. However, the HCV franchise continues to grapple with competitive and pricing pressure leading to a massive decline in Harvoni and Sovaldi sales. Harvoni and Sovaldi have been facing competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR and Merck‘s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zepatier. Nevertheless, the HCV portfolio received a major boost when Epclusa gained approval in 2016. The FDA also approved Vosevi tablets as a single-tablet regimen (“STR”) for the re-treatment of chronic HCV infection in adults in 2017. Sovaldi recently obtained approval in China. The approval of these new drugs will somewhat offset the decline of legacy drugs.  Gilead’s stock has gained 13.8% in the last six months compared with the industry's gain of 0.5%.The company suffered a decline in HCV sales in the third quarter and same is expected in the fourth quarter as well. HCV product sales were $2.2 billion, down from $3.3 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside was mainly attributed to lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi across all major markets, partially offset by higher sales of Epclusa (launched in 2016) and sales of Vosevi (approved in the United States and Europe in July 2017.While patient starts have exceeded expectations in 2017, competition has started to erode Gilead's HCV market share and net pricing. The company saw some impact of this in the third quarter but most of it was due to be experienced in the fourth quarter.  Hence, we expect the older HCV products to continue to witness declining sales.The company expects HCV product sales between $8.5 billion and $9.0 billion in 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of lead HCV drug Sovaldi and Harvoni are $141 million and $614 million, respectively for the fourth quarter.Hence, the weakness in the HCV franchise will adversely impact Gilead’s performance in the fourth quarter. Although Gilead has a mixed track record, with the company beating estimates in three of the last four and missing in one, an earnings beat looks highly unlikely in the fourth quarter given the competitive pressure.

2138,ABBV,"Markets started the New Year on a strong note, posting fresh records on multiple occasions. Newly instituted tax cuts had a beneficial impact on stocks with the Dow breaching the 25,000 and 26,000 mark in the same month. Economic data remained strong even as fourth-quarter earnings promised to be the most bullish in recent times. Meanwhile, the Fed refrained from raising rates but indicated that a hike was more or less certain in March.January’s PerformanceFor the month of January, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq increased 5.8%, 5.6% and 7.4%, respectively. The passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which permanently slashed corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%, last December contributed to January’s gains. Additionally, in its Beige Book, the Fed provided an encouraging outlook about the U.S. economy, which in turn also boosted investor sentiment.Moreover, during the month, the Senate gave its consent to pass a short-term spending bill that ends the recent government shutdown. Additionally, an upbeat fourth-quarter earnings season, which includes a very strong revenue momentum, an above-average proportion of positive surprises and an unusually positive revisions trend for the current and coming quarters, also contributed to strong market performance.Benchmarks Breach Multiple RecordsKey indexes achieved multiple milestones over last month. On Jan 2, the Nasdaq closed above the 7,000 mark for the first time. On the very next trading day, the S&P 500 moved past 2,700 for the first time. Optimism over strong market performance in 2018 contributed to these gains.On Jan 4, the Dow touched the psychological level of 25,000 for the first time. This was the blue-chip index’s fastest 1,000-point rise since its inception in May 1896. On Jan 9, the S&P 500 gained 3.6 points to close at a record for the sixth straight session. This marks its best start to a year since 1987.On Jan 17, the Dow finished above 26,000 for the first time. Additionally, both the Dow and S&P 500 posted their best 11-trading day start for the first time in a year since 1987, following which bond yields and the U.S. dollar increased. Benchmarks hit record levels again on Jan 22, after the Senate gave its consent to the bill.Finally, on Jan 26, all three U.S. benchmarks closed at record levels following better-than-expected earnings. The S&P 500 finished at a record level for 14 trading days, its best such feat in a month since June 1955. The index also posted its best one-day rise since Mar 1, 2017. Additionally, the Dow posted a rise of more than 220 points, while the Nasdaq registered its biggest one-day gain since Jan 2.Bullish Domestic DataEconomic data released during November was largely encouraging in nature. The ISM manufacturing index rose to 59.7% in December and reached its highest settlement in the last two years. Construction increased 0.8% from downwardly revised October figure to its highest level on record. Factory orders surged 1.3% during the month of November. CPI and core-CPI gained 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively, in December.Additionally, retail sales increased 0.4% in December, increasing for the fourth straight month and ended 2017 on a high. Industrial production for December surged 0.9%, surpassing the consensus estimate of 0.4%.Consumer spending increased 0.4% in October, in line with the consensus estimate for the period. Core PCE Inflation for December came in at 0.2%, higher than the previous month’s figure of 0.1%.However, ISM Services Index for December declined 1.5 points to 55.7%. U.S. trade deficit increased 3.2% in November to settle at $50.5 billion. This is the highest level of deficit since January 2012. Meanwhile, PPI for the month December 2017 decreased 0.1%. This was the index’s first decline in 10 months. However, Core PPI shot up 0.2%.Housing Sector SoftensA certain degree of softness afflicted the housing sector in January. The confidence level among the nation's homebuilders slipped slightly in the first month of 2018 after reaching an 18-year high in December 2017, according to the National Association of Home Builders’ (NAHB) Housing Market Index. The January 2018 reading was down two points to 72 from the December level of 74.Also, housing starts declined by 8.2% in December, the largest percentage drop recorded since November 2016. However, industry watchers believe that the downturn experienced in December is likely to be temporary. Further, housing possibly felt the chill from December’s brutally low temperatures.

(Read: A Very Strong Earnings Picture)Fed Leaves Rates Unchanged, Hike Likely in MarchOn Jan 31, the Federal Reserve opted to leave benchmark rates unchanged within the 1.25-1.5% range. Nevertheless, Fed policymakers reckon three rate hikes for this year, setting the stage for an imminent increase in March under Jerome Powell. The two-day policy meeting that concluded yesterday was the last overseen by Janet Yellen. Her post is set to be taken by Powell.In its two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) policy statement following the meeting ended Jan 31, the Fed indicated that economic activity has increased at a “solid rate” and will continue to grow at a “moderate pace.”Additionally, per the statement, labor market remains strong, while inflation will likely “move up” in 2018 and will reach the desired 2% rate in the “medium term.” The FOMC also said federal funds rate is likely to increase at a “gradual” pace in coming months.5 Star Performers for JanuaryI ran a screen on Research Wizard for companies with the following parameters:(Click here to sign up for a free trial to the Research Wizard today):Percentage price change over the last 4 weeks greater than or equal to 20%Forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) for the current financial year (F1) less than or equal to 20.

Higher rate environment and optimism of steady economic growth and higher inflation have weighed on bond prices, sending yields higher.However, effective signaling on the part of the Fed is likely to result in investors pricing in this decision well before the hike actually takes place. Ultimately, a strong fourth-quarter earnings season and steady economic growth are likely to propel markets toward new milestones in the weeks ahead. Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2139,ABBV,"Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report), is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Feb 6, after the market closes.Gilead, a leader in the hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) space, has a mixed track record, with the company beating estimates in three of the last four and missing in one. Last quarter, the company beat expectations by 8.6%. Overall, the company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 9.1%. Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Gilead Sciences, Inc. Quote Gilead’s stock has rallied 12.8% over a year compared with the industry's gain of 6.0%.  Factors at PlayConcurrent with the third-quarter earnings call, Gilead updated its annual guidance. Gilead expects net product sales in the range of $24.5-$25.5 billion, up from $24.0-$25.5 billion provided earlier. Non-HCV product sales are projected between $16 billion and $16.5 billion (earlier projection: $15.5 billion and $16 billion).Strong HIV performance and other antiviral product sales are being driven by continued uptake of tenofovir alafenamide (“TAF”) based products — Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey. We expect the trend to continue in the fourth quarter as well. Genvoya has already become the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients since its launch. This should drive the non-HCV product sales.  The TAF-based regimens now represent 56% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and Odefsey and Descovy in 2016. Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting is also expected to boost sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Genvoya is $1058 million. However, Gilead lost exclusivity for Viread in some countries outside the United States which might impact sales.HCV product sales are projected between $8.5 billion and $9.0 billion (earlier projection: $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion).  The HCV franchise continues to be under competitive and pricing pressure leading to a massive decline in Harvoni and Sovaldi sales. Harvoni and Sovaldi has been facing competition from AbbVie Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR among others. While patient starts have exceeded expectations in 2017, competition has started to erode Gilead's market share and net pricing. The company saw some impact of this in the third quarter but most of it was due to be experienced in the fourth quarter.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of lead HCV drug Sovaldi and Harvoni are $141 million and $614 million, respectively. The HCV portfolio received a major boost when Epclusa gained approval in 2016. The FDA also approved Vosevi tablets as a single-tablet regimen (“STR”) for the re-treatment of chronic HCV infection in adults.Adjusted R&D expenses and adjusted SG&A expenses are now projected in the range of $3.3-$3.4 billion and $3.3-$3.4 billion, respectively. Adjusted product gross margin is expected in the range of 86-87%. Earnings per share are now projected around $1.02-$1.17 (earlier projection: 86-93 cents).Meanwhile, the Kite acquisition was a step in the right direction with the FDA approval of its chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), for the treatment of refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which includes DLBCL, transformed follicular lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. However, management stated that Yescarta launch will be a controlled launch to ensure patient safety as CAR-T therapy is complicated and can sometimes be associated with severe side effects.We expect the management to throw more light on the same during the fourth-quarter’s call. Investors are also likely to keep an eye on other pipeline updates.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Gilead will beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Gilead is -1.01%.  This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $1.68 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.70.

The announcement comes just a few weeks after Novo Nordisk had announced its interest in acquiring Ablynx in a deal valued at approximately €2.6 billion. Ablynx had rejected Novo Nordisk’s offer with the company’s Board saying that the proposal fundamentally undervalued Ablynx and its growth prospects.A look at Ablynx’s pipeline shows that the company could well be in a position to launch its first product, caplacizumab (anti-vWF; acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura - aTTP), this year. Caplacizumab is currently under review in the EU while a regulatory application will be filed in the United States in the first half of 2018. The estimated annual market opportunity for aTTP, a life-threatening blood clotting disease, is expected to be about €1.2 billion. The company also has a broad range of partnerships with the potential to generate more than €10.6 billion in milestones plus royalties. Other pipeline candidates also address significant market opportunities. The company has more than 45 programs in its pipeline and eight Nanobodies in clinical development. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2018 (Read more: Sanofi on a Buyout Spree This Month, to Buy Ablynx for $4.8B).Bellicum Down on FDA Clinical Hold: Bellicum Pharmaceuticals’s shares are down almost 30% following the company’s announcement that the FDA has placed a clinical hold on U.S. studies being conducted on BPX-501. The hold was placed after three cases of encephalopathy were deemed as possibly connected to BPX-501. The company said that the cases were complex with certain factors like prior failed transplants, prior history of immunodeficiency, concurrent infection, and administration of rimiducid in combination with other medications.Bellicum is now waiting to receive a formal notice from the FDA as to the steps needed to be taken for the resumption of the studies. The clinical hold will not impact an ongoing registration study in Europe.Seattle Genetics to Boost Pipeline with Cascadian Acquisition: Seattle Genetics announced that it will be acquiring Cascadian Therapeutics for $10 per share in cash, or about $614 million. With this acquisition, slated to close in the first quarter of 2018, Seattle will be adding tucatinib to its pipeline. Tucatinib is an investigational oral, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (“TKI”) that is highly selective for HER2, a growth factor receptor that is overexpressed in several cancers, including breast, colorectal, ovarian and gastric. The candidate is currently in a pivotal phase II program for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer and complements Seattle’s existing pipeline.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index declined 1.5% over the last five trading sessions.

2141,ABBV,"Galapagos NV (GLPG  -  Free Report) announced positive top-line data from phase Ib study evaluating its osteoarthritis (“OA”) candidate, GLPG1972. The candidate reduced the level of ARGS neoepitope, a cartilage breakdown biomarker, by more than half in its highest dosage.Shares of the company have risen 43.1% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s decline of 1.7% in that period.The phase Ib study evaluated three doses of GLPG1972 versus placebo over a period of four weeks. GLPG1972 reduced level of ARGS neoepitope by 38.4%, 44.9% & 50.4% for low, medium and high dose, respectively, compared to 3.6% for placebo.GLPG1972 works by targeting ADAMTS-5, a cartilage degrading enzyme.Meanwhile, Galapagos is working on designing the phase II program to further evaluate the candidate in OA.

2142,ABBV,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) shares are expected to be northbound in 2018, carrying on the momentum achieved last year. The stock was up 54.4% in 2017, comparing favorably with a gain of 16.3% recorded by the industry.AbbVie carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Last year’s share price surge was supported by a series of positive news. AbbVie met primary endpoints in several pivotal studies – the key phase III MURANO study of Venclexta plus Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan in relapse/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia; three phase III studies evaluating oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib for rheumatoid arthritis and also a phase IIb study in atopic dermatitis; and four pivotal head-to-head phase III studies evaluating risankizumab versus Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Stelara and Humira, for moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.Meanwhile, AbbVie gained regulatory approvals in the United States, Europe, and Japan for its competitive HCV medicine Mavyret and FDA approval for the sixth indication for cancer drug Imbruvica in 2018.AbbVie also settled its patent disputes with Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), which delayed the launch of the latter’s biosimilar version of AbbVie’s blockbuster arthritis drug, Humira in the United States to 2023 and in most countries in the EU to October 2018.This agreement has removed a major overhang on AbbVie’s shares. Moreover, the agreement gave AbbVie ample time to focus on developing its pipeline and launching new products that will help make up for the loss of revenues once biosimilar Humira enters the market.Factors Likely to Support the Rally in 2018With several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones expected in 2018, the bullish run of the stock should continue in 2018. An important catalyst for the stock will be data from a pivotal phase III (TRINITY) study on Rova-T in third-line or later small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in the first half of the year. An important regulatory milestone will be the FDA decision on elagolixin the second quarter. Please note that the new drug application (NDA) for elagolix for endometriosis was granted priority review by the FDA in October last year.Importantly Humira has been generating strong sales. Despite new competition, AbbVie raised its long-term target for Humira sales in October based on strong demand trends for the drug. Imbruvica, AbbVie’s second most important drug, is also doing consistently well and has multibillion dollar potential. AbbVie is exploring the possibility of label expansion into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. All these factors bode well for the stock.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2144,ABBV,"AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) shares jumped 13.8% following the release of better-than-expected fourth quarter 2017 results and an upbeat outlook for 2018. Results were driven by the performance of Humira, Imbruvica and Mavyret. Imbruvica continued to witness strong uptake for the chronic lymphocytic leukemia (“CLL”) indication while Humira’s performance was driven by robust demand despite the introduction of new mechanisms of action and competition from indirect biosimilars. Meanwhile, Mavyret (hepatitis C virus – HCV) has been witnessing strong uptake in both the United States and international markets. Mavyret exited 2017 with a market share of 32% in the United States and is expected to become a major growth driver for the company.Rosy Outlook for 2018: The company provided an upbeat outlook for 2018 reflecting Mavyret’s strong uptake, the continued robust underlying performance from other products, and a lower tax rate thanks to the passage of the U.S. tax reform. AbbVie expects 2018 earnings per share in the range of $7.33 - $7.43 on revenues of almost $32 billion. The mid-point of the earnings guidance range reflects year-over-year growth of 32%, an improvement over the company’s previously provided guidance of 17% growth at the mid-point (provided with third quarter results).Humira sales are expected to grow approximately 13% - 14% in the United States while ex-U.S. sales are expected to be about $6.2 billion. The company expects to record Imbruvica revenues of more than $3.3 billion in 2018. Mavyret sales are expected to cross $2.5 billion. Other products like Venclexta, AndroGel, and Duodopa are expected to record sales of $300 million plus, $475 million, and $458 million, respectively. Creon sales are expected to grow 10% in 2018 while Synagis, Lupron and Synthroid sales are expected to remain flat. Zinbryta sales are expected to come in below $100 million reflecting the impact of competition and label changes.Cash Repatriation/Capital Deployment: The U.S. tax reform will allow AbbVie more efficient access to its foreign cash and the ability to use it in the United States. The company intends to invest about $2.5 billion in capital within the United States in the next five years and is currently evaluating additional expansion of its U.S. facilities. AbbVie also intends to accelerate pension funding by $750 million and enhance non-executive employee compensation. The company is also planning a one-time shareable contribution of about $350 million to select not-for-profit organizations, supporting initiatives such as the Puerto Rico rebuilding efforts, children's healthcare access programs, and certain charities. AbbVie also said that it would be increasing shareholder returns in what could be a combination of acceleration of dividend growth and more share buybacks. Details will be provided later by the company.What about Deals? As far as deals are concerned, the company’s key focus is on opportunities that could drive growth in the 2023-2025 timeframe. AbbVie said that it is looking at early-stage assets.Catalyst Rich 2018: AbbVie’s R&D spend in 2018 is expected to be about 16% of sales, reflecting higher spending to support the late-stage pipeline and mid-stage programs. In addition to working on expanding the label of approved products like Imbruvica and Venclexta, AbbVie’s late-stage pipeline includes candidates like upadacitinib (rheumatoid arthritis – RA, Crohn's disease) and risankizumab (psoriasis, Crohn's disease). AbbVie is looking to file for regulatory approval of risankizumab for the psoriasis indication in the first half of the year while the regulatory filing for upadacitinib for the RA indication is expected in the second half of 2018.Meanwhile, elagolix is under priority review for endometriosis with a response from the FDA expected in the second quarter.AbbVie’s shares are up 103.9% over the last one year, compared to the 29% rally of the industry it belongs to.

2145,ABBV,"Friday, October 27, 2017Before we attempt to get our arms around another deluge of earnings reports ahead of the final opening bell of this trading week, we get a first look at Q3 GDP: 3.0%, up from the consensus estimate of 2.7%, and a second consecutive 3-handle following Q2’s final read of 3.1%. This marks the first time since 2014 the U.S. economy had GDP numbers at or above 3% in back-to-back quarters.Particularly noteworthy about this number is that we did see some negative impact on GDP in the quarter from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria — most notably in consumer spending, which had ratcheted down from 3.3% the previous quarter to 2.4% this time around. That Q3 GDP could take a 90-basis-point hit and still reach 3% illustrates economic strength beyond the power of the consumer.Inventories were up 0.7%, but this is normal coming as it does ahead of holiday season. Perhaps surprisingly, the federal government spent more in Q3. And maybe most importantly, as Zacks Chief Strategist John Blank pointed out last week, no major economies in the world are currently experiencing a recession. Growth is now global and synchronized; it is a very rare occurrence to see no geopolitical headwinds from the Americas to Europe to Asia-Pacific.Q3 Earnings Roll OnAside from big blowout beats after yesterday’s close from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) — which by themselves have already added an additional $80 billion to the market — we see more earnings tonnage, generally from oil & gas and pharma/bio sectors:ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) shares are up modestly in today’s pre-market following Q3 results that surpassed estimates on both top and bottom lines. Earnings of 93 cents per share topped the Zacks consensus by 4 cents, whereas revenues really outperformed expectations: $66.17 billion far exceeded the $63.51 billion we had been looking for. This marks the fourth beat out of the past five quarters for the largest oil & gas “supermajor,” and in an energy sector that has struggled in 2017, XOM looks to be improving.Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) also beat estimates for both earnings and sales this morning, with $1.03 per share surpassing the 98-cent consensus on revenues of $36.21 billion, ahead of the $34.06 expected. Outgoing CEO John Watson, who will retire early next year, cited continued improvement in both earnings and cash flow for the supermajor.Refining company Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) posted a mixed Q3 during today’s pre-market, with earnings of $1.66 per share beating the consensus estimate by 4 cents, though $26.2 billion in revenues fell short of our estimated $29.9 billion. The company’s Refining business more than tripled in the quarter, offset by underperformance quarter over quarter from Midstream, Chemicals and Marketing.Pharmaceuticals major Merck & Co. (MRK  -  Free Report) posted $1.11 per share, ahead of the $1.03 Zacks consensus estimate. However, quarterly sales of $10.33 billion was short of the $10.50 billion we had been expecting. That said, Merck upped its fiscal year earnings guidance from $3.76-3.88 per share last time around to $3.91-3.97 this morning. Following an initial bump up of 1% in the pre-market, shares are now trading down more than 2.5% ahead of the bell.Also, biopharma firm AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report), which had branched off from Abbott Labs in 2013, beat earnings estimates by 2 cents to $1.41 per share, whereas revenues of $7 billion came in basically in-line with estimates. Lymphoma treatment Imbruvica rose 37.3% year over year, and rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira improved 14.8% from the year-ago quarter.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

2147,ABBV,"Biogen’s (BIIB  -  Free Report) third quarter results surpassed both top-and bottom-line expectations. Meanwhile, Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) CAR T therapy gained earlier-than-expected FDA approval. Alexion (ALXN  -  Free Report) also got a regulatory boost with the FDA expanding the label of the company’s flagship product, Soliris.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesBiogen Beats on All Fronts: Although Biogen’s third quarter results were better than expected with the company surpassing both earnings and revenue expectations, shares were down 3.9% on concerns regarding the company’s multiple sclerosis franchise sales as well as U.S. sales of its recently launched spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”) treatment, Spinraza. Spinraza U.S. sales were $198 million in the third quarter, more or less flat from second quarter sales of $195 million though the company reported a 75% increase in the number of patients on therapy in the United States compared to the end of the second quarter. However, second quarter sales included inventory buildup of $30 million (Read more: Biogen Tops Q3 Earnings & Sales, Spinraza Sales Up).Biogen has gained 11.3% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 8.2% rally.Gilead CAR T Therapy Yescarta Approved: Gilead’s Yescarta, which became a part of the company’s portfolio following the $11.9 billion Kite Pharma acquisition, gained FDA approval for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy. This makes Yescarta the first chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) therapy to gain approval for use in this patient population.Yescarta is the second gene therapy to gain approval in the United States, the first being Novartis’s Kymriah. Both treatments come with a Boxed Warning regarding the risks of cytokine release syndrome (“CRS”) and neurologic toxicities.Yescarta’s approval is a major boost for Gilead which is currently facing declining sales from its hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) franchise. According to information provided by the company, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”) - about 7,500 patients with refractory DLBCL are eligible for CAR T therapy every year. Yescarta represents a new treatment option for these patients who have run out of treatment options and face a poor prognosis. Yescarta will be launched with a list price of $373,000 in the United States and is currently under review in the EU where a response is expected in the first half of 2018 (Read more: Gilead CAR-T Therapy Yescarta Clinches FDA Approval).Gilead also announced phase II results on its investigational treatment for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (""NASH""). The company said that the higher dose (20 mg) of GS-0976, an oral ACC inhibitor, achieved significant reductions in buildup of fat in the liver and a noninvasive marker of fibrosis (TIMP-1) compared to placebo. However, statistical significance was not achieved for other parameters like liver stiffness (by FibroScan and MRE), serum ALT and PIII-NP, a serum marker of fibrogenesis. Meanwhile, differences between the lower dose (5 mg) of GS-0976 and placebo were not statistically significant.Celgene Hit by Crohn’s Disease Study Discontinuation: Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) shares were down 10.8% on news that the company will be discontinuing studies (phase III REVOLVE study and the extension study (SUSTAIN)) being conducted with its investigational Crohn’s disease drug, GED-0301 (mongersen). The decision was based on a recommendation from the Data Monitoring Committee in October following an interim futility analysis. No meaningful safety imbalances were observed in the analysis.Celgene also said that it will wait to review the full dataset from the phase II ulcerative colitis study on GED-0301 before deciding the path forward. The company will not be initiating the phase III DEFINE study for Crohn’s disease (Read more: Celgene Down on Discontinued Crohn's Disease Drug Study).AbbVie Announces Immuno-Therapy Focused Deals: AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced a couple of deals this week. While one deal is focused on immuno-neurology, the other is focused on immuno-oncology.The immuno-neurology deal will see AbbVie collaborating with Alector for the use of the latter’s immuno-neurology discovery platform for innovative new therapies for Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders.Immuno-neurology, a rapidly evolving scientific area, is focused on harnessing the power of the immune system to attack neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease.While development and commercialization costs as well as profits will be shared equally by the companies, Alector will get an upfront payment of $205 million and a potential, future equity investment of up to $20 million.Meanwhile, the immuno-oncology deal will see AbbVie teaming up with Harpoon Therapeutics for the use of Harpoon's tri-specific T-cell activating construct (TriTAC) platform with AbbVie's research-stage immuno-oncology targets to develop cancer therapeutics (Read more: AbbVie Inks Immuno-Oncology Deal with Harpoon Therapeutics).Label Expansion for Alexion’s Soliris: The FDA granted approval to Alexion for the use of its flagship product, Soliris (eculizumab) in adult patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are AchR antibody-positive. Soliris, already approved in the United States for serious ultra-rare disorders like paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), brought in sales of $1.6 billion in the first half of the year. The gMG indication represents incremental growth opportunity for Soliris.Alexion is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

2148,ABBV,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report), a well-known name in the multiple sclerosis (MS) market, surpassed expectations both for earnings and sales in the third quarter of 2017. The company’s revenue was driven by continued a strong performance of its newest drug Spinraza, for spinal muscular atrophy.Despite better-than-expected results, Biogen’s shares were down almost 3% in pre-market trading. This was probably due to the fact that the sales of its multiple sclerosis franchise were below expectations amid an increasingly competitive market. However, we note that Biogen’s shares have gained 15.8% so far this year, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s increase of 9%.Third-quarter 2017 earnings per share were $6.31, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.70 by 10.7%. Earnings also rallied 22% year over year.Sales came in at $3.08 billion, up 4% from the year-ago period. Sales also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.04 billion by 1.6%. The top line, excluding hemophilia revenues, grew 13% year over year. The company spun off its hemophilia business in February this year.Quarter in Detail                           Biogen’s MS revenues were $2.3 billion in the quarter including approximately $65 million in royalties on the sales of Roche’s MS drug Ocrevus.Tecfidera sales increased 3% from the year-ago period to $1.07 billion. However, the drug recorded a 4% sequential drop in revenues. This included the U.S. sales of $836.3 million and ex-U.S. sales of $233.3 million. In the United States, Tecfidera Inventory levels in the third quarter were relatively flat compared with the year-ago levels, which hurt sales in the reported quarter.Third-quarter Tysabri revenues were $469 million (U.S. $266.8 million, ex-U.S. $202.6 million), which decreased 9% year over year and 5% sequentially. We believe Ocrevus’ launch has put pressure on Tysabri’s U.S. sales in the quarter.Combined interferon revenues (Avonex and Plegridy) in the third quarter were $662 million (U.S. $473.3 million, ex-U.S. $188.7 million), down 7% from the year-ago period. Avonex revenues declined 7% from the year-ago period to $538 million. Plegridy contributed $124 million to third-quarter 2017 revenues, down 3% year over year and 7% sequentially.U.S. Interferon revenues are experiencing declining trends due to patients transitioning to other oral MS therapies as well as higher discounts and allowance.Zinbryta, launched in collaboration with AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) in August last year, contributed $14 million to revenues in the third quarter, down 11% sequentially.Newly launched Spinraza brought revenues of $271 million (U.S. revenues $197.6 million) in the third quarter, registering growth of 33.5% sequentially as the drug witnesses a strong demand in the United States. The company is working on expanding access to all patients.This quarter, Biogen recorded biosimilar revenues of $101 million compared with $91 million in second-quarter 2017. The company markets Benepali, a biosimilar referencing Amgen Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel in Europe. Benepali recorded revenues of $99.2 million, registering a growth rate of 11.8% sequentially. Biogen also markets Flixabi, a biosimilar referencing Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug, Remicade, which recorded revenues of $2.2 million in the reported quarter compared with $1.9 million in the second quarter.Revenues from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs, which include Biogen’s shares of Rituxan and Gazyva operating profits, climbed 28% from the year-ago period to $406 million in the third quarter.R&D spend decreased 15.6% in the reported quarter to $446.4 million, while SG&A spend declined 6.2% year over year to $433.8 million. Collaboration AgreementThis month, Biogen announced restructuring of collaboration arrangements with Eisai and Neurimmune to improve long-term value of Alzheimer candidate aducanumab, which is presently in a phase III study.Concurrent with the earnings release, Biogen announced a renegotiation of its agreement with Neurimmune by making a one-time payment of $150 million in exchange of a reduction in Neurimmune’s 15% royalty rate on the potential sales of aducanumab. The re-negotiated deal thus increases aducanumab’s profit potential.On Oct 23, Biogen and partner Eisai refined their existing Alzheimer collaboration. Biogen already has an agreement with Eisai to develop the phase III BACE inhibitor, E2609 and the phase II amyloid-beta antibody, BAN240 for Alzheimer’s disease. However, Biogen has announced that Eisai has exercised the option to jointly develop and commercialize aducanumab. The company will now receive 55% of aducanumab’s potential profits in the United States, 68.5% in Europe and 20% in Japan.Biogen Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Biogen Inc.

2149,ABBV,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 earnings on Oct 27, before the opening bell.AbbVie’s shares have soared 47.8% so far this year, while the industry has recorded an increase of 20.2%.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 1.43%. Notably, AbbVie’s earnings history is a mixed bag as the pharmaceuticals company beat estimates in two of the last four quarters and recorded in-line earnings in the other two. The four-quarter average beat is 0.76%.AbbVie Inc. Price and EPS Surprise AbbVie Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AbbVie Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors to ConsiderAbbVie expects third-quarter 2017 earnings in the range of $1.36-$1.38 per share. Revenues are estimated to grow approximately 9% on an operational basis. Foreign exchange is not expected impact the sales in the third quarter.The company’s key drug, Humira, is likely to remain the main growth driver in the third quarter, backed by higher demand. This quarter, AbbVie expects Humira sales to rise in the high-teens range while internationally, sales are estimated to increase in a mid-single-digit range on an operational basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for Humira is $4.6 billion for the third quarter.Significantly, cancer drug Imbruvica recorded strong sales since the past few quarters, a trend that we expect to continue. In the quarter to be reported, Imbruvica was approved by the FDA for treating adult patients with chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) disease after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy. Imbruvica’s expanded label should also contribute to its sales growth. The company expects the drug’s U.S. sales growth to approach 30% in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Imbruvica is $676 million for this quarter.Other drugs like Duopa and Creon are also expected to continue to perform well in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.However, Abbvie’s Hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment, Viekira, will continue to be adversely impacted by an intense pricing and competitive pressure in the HCV market.Notably, AbbVie’s eight-week, pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, once-daily HCV treatment, Mavyret/Maviret, gained approval in the United States, EU and Canada earlier in July/August.The company believes that Maviret has potential to rejuvenate growth in the HCV franchiseas compared to the competitive dynamics in the HCV market. We expect management to update on commercialization plans of Maviret at the conference call.Maviret is expected to contribute considerably to revenues only from 2018 onward.The company has made significant progress with its pipeline during the quarter, which will be another focus for investors to keep tabs on. AbbVie and partner Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced positive data from a phase III MURANO study of Venclexta plus Rituxan in September to expand the label to address the broader relapsed/refractory CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) patient population. Label expansion for this indication should increase the patient population for Venclexta significantly and boost its commercial potential. Also, in the same month, the company announced that its oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib (ABT-494), met primary endpoints in a phase III study for treatment of RA (rheumatoid arthritis).Additionally, AbbVie and partner Neurocrine Biosciences announced that the new drug application (NDA) for elagolix has been submitted to the FDA in September. AbbVie is looking to get elagolix approved as an oral medicine for pain management associated with endometriosis.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that AbbVie is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: AbbVie has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.39 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Though AbbVie’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, its 0.00% Earnings ESP makes the surprise prediction difficult.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some health care stocks that you may want to consider as per our model, these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this quarter:Merck & Company, Inc.

2150,ABBV,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) reported encouraging results for third-quarter 2017 wherein both earnings and revenues beat estimates driven by strong performance of Cosentyx and Entresto.Third-quarter 2017 core earnings of $1.29 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.25 and were up from $1.23 recorded in the year-ago quarter.Revenues increased 2% to $12.4 billion as volume growth driven by Cosentyx and Entresto was partially offset by the negative impact of generic competition and pricing. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.2 billion.  Novartis’ stock has rallied 21.5% year to date compared with the industry’s 23.7% gain.All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-over-year basis and at constant exchange rates.The Quarter in DetailNovartis operates under three segments: Innovative Medicines (Pharmaceuticals), Alcon (Ophthalmology unit) and Sandoz (Generics).The Innovative Medicines division recorded sales of $8.3 billion, up 2%. Generic competition impacted sales at the segment, primarily due to the entry of generics for Gleevec in the United States and Europe. Nevertheless, growth products — Cosentyx, Entresto, Promacta/Revolade, Jakavi, Tafinlar + Mekinist and Gilenya boosted sales.Psoriasis Cosentyx sales surged 83% on the back of strong growth in its three approved indications while Entresto’s sales benefited from continued access improvements and expansion of sales force in the United States. Oncology franchise (excluding Gleevec) grew 11% driven mainly by Promacta/Revolade, Jakavi, Tafinlar + Mekinist.Sales at the Sandoz division were $2.6 billion, up 1% as volume growth was offset by price erosion in the Unites States. Sales in the United States declined 13% due to pricing pressure. Biopharmaceuticals sales grew 9% mainly driven by Zarxio in the United States and launches of Rixathon, the biosimilar version of Roche Holdings, Inc.’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan (rituximab) and Erelzi, the biosimilar of Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel in EU.Sales at the Alcon division were $1.5 billion, up 7%. Surgical sales increased 9% driven by broad recovery across most market segments, including strong growth from vitreoretinal products. Vision Care sales were up 4% fueled by the continued double-digit growth of Dailies Total1.Earlier, Novartis announced that it is mulling strategic options for its lagging eye-care unit Alcon which includes retaining the business, or a separation via capital market transactions such as a spin-off or an initial public offering.  The company updated its strategic plan and announced that it has the potential to grow sales at or above market while delivering profitability in line with the industry. The company also made significant progress on developing a potential capital markets solution, including financial carve-outs, tax and legal entity structuring, and identifying listing and incorporation locations.  A final decision will be taken depending in Alcon’s sales performance which is not likely to happen before the first half of 2019.Meanwhile, Novartis will move the Ophthalmic OTC products to the Alcon Division, effective Jan 1, 2018, to allow the Innovative Medicines Division to focus on pharmaceutical pipeline. However, the Ophthalmic prescription business will remain with the Innovative Medicines Division.2017 Outlook ReiteratedNovartis expects net sales to be broadly in line with the 2016 levels after including the impact of continued genericization of Gleevec/Glivec in the United States and Europe. Management had earlier estimated the impact of generic competition on sales to be approximately $2.5 billion in 2017.Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise  Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise | Novartis AG QuotePipeline UpdateNovartis’ pipeline candidates’ progress has been encouraging. The oncology portfolio continues to gain traction.  In a significant boost, the FDA approved its breakthrough gene transfer treatment, Kymriah suspension for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is refractory or in second or later relapse.  Kymriah has been launched in the United States.Breast cancer drug Kisqali was approved in Europe as a first-line option for HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with any aromatase inhibitor. The drug is already approved in the United States. The company also received approval of Rydapt in Europe for the treatment of newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia and three types of systemic mastocytosis.Meanwhile, the FDA accepted Novartis’ regulatory application of AMG 334 (erenumab) filing for the prevention of migraine in patients experiencing four or more migraine days per month. The FDA also accepted the supplemental New Drug Application for Tasigna and granted priority review. The sNDA seeks the addition of attempting Treatment-Free Remission for the drug’s label. On the other hand, Tafinlar + Mekinist received Breakthrough Therapy designation in adjuvant melanoma.Sandoz’s proposed biosimilar of Roche’s Rituxan was accepted for regulatory review by the FDA. The proposed biosimilar version of AbbVie. Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira (adalimumab) matched the reference drug in terms of efficacy and safety in a 51-week clinical study. The biosimilar is currently under review the EU for the treatment of several immunological diseases.Our TakeNovartis third-quarter results beat both earnings and sales estimates on strong performance of Cosentyx and Entresto. The generic division, Sandoz also combatted pricing pressure strongly buoyed by biosimilar launches of Rixathin and Erelzi. In the first half of 2017, Novartis announced that it is mulling strategic options for Alcon which includes retaining the business separation via capital market transactions such as a spin-off or an initial public offering. The company believes that the Alcon division has revived well for now and hence a decision on a possible spin-off will be taken in 2019.

2151,ABBV,"Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s (GILD  -  Free Report) reported third quarter 2017 results wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed expectations.  However, the stock is expected to open in the red given the decline in hepatitis C virus (HCV) franchise.  Nevertheless, Gilead’s stock has gained 15.2% year to date as against the industry's  decline of 0.2%.The company’s third-quarter earnings (including the impact of stock-based compensation expenses) of $2.27 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09. However, earnings were below the year-ago quarter figure of $2.75.Moreover, total revenues of $6.5 billion topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.3 billion. However, revenues declined 13.2% year over year.HIV Impresses Yet Again, Harvoni & Sovaldi PlungesProduct sales came in at $6.4 billion, down 13.5% year over year. The decline was due to lower hepatitis C virus (HCV) sales, partially offset by higher sales across HIV and other therapeutic areas.Antiviral product sales, which include Gilead's HIV and liver disease portfolio, came in at $5.8 billion in the reported quarter, down 14.7%.HCV product sales, which include Harvoni, Sovaldi, Epclusa and Vosevi, were $2.2 billion, down from $3.3 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside was mainly attributed to lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi across all major markets, partially offset by sales of Epclusa (launched in 2016) and sales of Vosevi (approved in the United States and Europe in July 2017).Sales of Harvoni declined 47.7% year over year to $973 million in the reported quarter. Further, Sovaldi sales recorded a steep year-over-year decline of 73.4% to $219 million.Epclusa garnered sales of $882 million in the reported quarter, up from the year-ago figure of $640 million. We note that Epclusa was launched in the U.S. and Europe in June and Jul 2016, respectively.Meanwhile, HIV and HBV product sales came in at $3.6 billion, up 16.1% year over year. The increase was primarily driven by continuous strong uptake of tenofoviral afenamide (TAF)-based products such as Genvoya, which generated sales of $988 million, up from $461 million in the year-ago quarter, Descovy, which recorded sales of $316 million, up from $88 million, and Odefsey, which registered sales of $296 million, up from $105 million. HIV treatments like Stribild and Complera/Eviplera sales declined 63.1% and 42.3% respectively. Viread sales were down at $274 million, down 9.6%.Atripla sales tanked 32.4% to $439 million, while Truvada sales fell 5.5% to $811 million.Other products like Letairis, Ranexa, AmBisome and Zydelig recorded sales of $213 million (down 0.9%), $164 million (down 3.5%), $92 million (up 1.1%) and $40 million (up 2.5%), respectively.Research & development (R&D) expenses declined 24% to $745 million. On the other hand, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 3.3% to $806 million. Adjusted product gross margin was 87.2% compared to 87.6% in the year-ago period.2017 Guidance UpdatedGilead now expects net product sales in the range of $24.5-$25.5 billion, up from $24.0-$25.5 billion provided earlier. Non-HCV product sales are projected between $16 billion and $16.5 billion (earlier projection: $15.5 billion and $16 billion). HCV product sales are projected between $8.5 billion and $9.0 billion (earlier projection: $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion). Adjusted R&D expenses and adjusted SG&A expenses are now projected in the range of $3.3-$3.4 billion and $3.3-$3.4 billion, respectively. Adjusted product gross margin is expected in the range of 86-87%. Earnings per share are now projected around $1.02-$1.17 (earlier projection: 86-93 cents).Kite AcquisitionThe company recently acquired Kite Pharma. Last week, the company received FDA approval for Yescarta, a CAR-T therapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy.Dividend and Share RepurchaseConcurrently, Gilead declared a cash dividend of 52 cents per share of common stock for fourth-quarter 2017. The dividend is payable on Dec 28 to stockholders of record at the close of business on Dec 15. During the quarter, the company paid cash dividends of $682 million and repurchased shares for $153 million.Our TakeThough the company topped both earnings and revenue estimates in the third quarter, it witnessed a  decline in HCV sales. The HCV franchise is under tremendous pressure due to lower patient starts and increasing competition. We expect sales to decline further going forward.  We note that Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa, face competition from AbbVie, Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Daklinza among others. Competition as well as pricing pressure has intensified further with the launch of Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zepatier. Only 39,000 patients began treatment on a Gilead regimen during the quarter, down 9% from the prior quarter.Meanwhile, the HIV franchise maintains momentum driven by the rapid adoption of TAF-based regimens in the United States and EU. The TAF-based regimens now represent 56% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and the launches of Odefsey and Descovy in 2016. Genvoya is now the company’s bestselling HIV product with a treatment-naïve patient share of 41%. Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting should further boost sales as the company saw a significant uptick in PrEP usage in 2017 with an estimated 145,000 patients using Truvada by the end of the third quarter. The approval of Yescarta also bodes well for Gilead.However, Gilead has lost exclusivity for Viread and Truva which will further impact performance. We expect the decline in HCV franchise to offset the positive momentum of HIV franchise.Zacks Rank Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2154,ABBV,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 53 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents and came ahead of the year-ago earnings of 17 cents. Strong product revenues led to higher profits in the quarter.Vertex reported revenues of $578.2 million in the third quarter, up almost 40% year over year driven by strong product revenues. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $518.45 million.CF Franchise Sales StrongVertex’s third-quarter revenues consisted of sales from cystic fibrosis (""CF"") products — Kalydeco and Orkambi, collaborative ($26.3 million) and royalty revenues ($2.2 million). CF product revenues were $549.6 million in the third quarter, up 34% year over year.Kalydeco sales rose 22% to $213 million following approvals to treat an expanded population.In May, Kalydeco was approved for use in CF patients 2 years and older who have one of 23 residual function mutations in the CFTR gene. More than 900 people in the United States have one of these mutations. The expanded indication should boost sales of the drug in future quarters. In August, Kalydeco was approved in CF patients (2 years and older) who have one of the five residual function mutations that result in a splicing defect in the CFTR gene, which occurs in more than 600 patients.Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) delivered sales of $336.2 million, up 43.7% year over year. The growth was supported by continued uptake in pediatric patients in the United States and additional revenues from European countries where Vertex has signed reimbursement agreements.Costs RiseAdjusted research and development expenses increased 15.3% to $243.2 million in the third quarter due to higher costs related to development of triple combination CF regimens. Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 7.9% to $90.6 million due to increased investment to support the global commercialization of Orkambi and Kalydeco.2017 Guidance RaisedVertex increased its 2017 guidance for Orkambi and Kalydeco sales. However, it maintained its guidance for combined operating costs.Orkambi revenues are expected in the range of $1.29–$1.32 billion (previously $1.1–$1.3 billion), while Kalydeco revenues are estimated in the range of $810 million - $830 million (previously $770 million - $800 million). Total CF product revenues are expected in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.15 billion in 2017.We note that the increase in Orkambi sales projection is based on strong demands seen so far this year. Projections for Kalydeco were increased following strong demand in newly approved indications.Combined adjusted research and development (R&D) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2017 are still anticipated in the range of $1.33 to $1.36 billion.Focus on Next Generation CF RegimensVertex’s tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination for treating CF patients is under review in the United States and Europe. The company is seeking approval in people with CF aged 12 and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation or one F508del mutation and one residual function mutation. A decision is expected in February next year in the United States, while approval in Europe is expected in the second half of 2018.Concurrent with the press release, the company announced data from a phase III study evaluating the combination in CF patients with one copy of the F508del mutation and one copy of a gating mutation. The study has failed to meet its primary endpoint of absolute change in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV1), a measure of lung function.Vertex is also evaluating some next-generation CFTR correctors (VX-152, VX-440, VX-659 and VX-445) as part of a triple combination with VX-661 (tezacaftor) and ivacaftor. Following discussions with regulatory agencies, Vertex will initiate pivotal phase III studies on two of the four triple combination regimens in the first half of 2018.Other CF Pipeline UpdateVertex’s epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) inhibitor candidate, VX-371, is being evaluated in a phase II study in CF patients who are being treated with Orkambi. Per the press release, the study did not meet its primary endpoint of change in ppFEV1.Another phase II study is developing VX-371 for treating patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia.Our TakeVertex’s third-quarter results were encouraging. The company beat estimates on both counts as sales of both its CF drugs rose.Shares declined slightly in after-hours trading probably due to failure of the pivotal tezacaftor/ivacaftor study. However, so far this year, Vertex’s share price is up a massive 99.3%, comparing favorably with an increase of 6.9% for the industry.Vertex’s CF pipeline is quite strong with a broad portfolio of next-generation CF correctors. Its triple combination CF regimens are considered crucial for long-term growth. If the triple-combo regimes are successful, Vertex can address a significantly larger CF patient population — almost 90% of the patients — in the future.However, competition is increasing as several major companies are developing interest in CF. Belgian company Galapagos NV (GLPG  -  Free Report) and AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) are also developing triple CFTR combination therapy for CF, which may pose a threat to Vertex’s triple combo regimens.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated QuoteVertex carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  A better-ranked stock in the health care sector is Adaptimmune Therapeutics PLC (ADAP  -  Free Report), which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2155,ABBV,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of 75 cents per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as the year-ago quarter earnings of 77 cents.However, total revenue of $5.25 billion came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.2 billion as well as $4.9 billion recorded in the year-ago period. Strong sales of Opdivo and Eliquis contributed to the top line in the reported quarter.Shares of the company were down 1.9% in pre-market trading, presumably due to the lower-than-expected earnings. Bristol-Myers’ shares have increased 9.5% so far this year, which compares unfavorably with the industry’s increase of 17.8%.Quarterly DetailsRevenues were up 6% year over year when adjusted for foreign exchange impact. Revenues in the United States increased 3% to $2.9 billion and increased 12% outside the United States. Ex-U.S. revenues were up 11% when adjusted for foreign exchange impact.Leukemia drug Sprycel raked in sales of $509 million, up 8% year over year. Melanoma drug Yervoy contributed $323 million to the top line during the reported quarter, up 13%.Opdivo, which is approved for multiple cancer indications, generated revenues of $1.27 billion, up 38% from the year-ago period. The drug received approval for its label expansion in three more indications, which includes hepatocellular carcinoma, metastatic colorectal cancer and recurrent gastric cancer.However, the performance of key drugs in the Virology unit continues to disappoint. Sales of Baraclude declined 14% to $264 million. The Reyataz and Sustiva franchises deteriorated 27% and 33% year over year to $174 million and $183 million, respectively..Nevertheless, sales of Eliquis were $1.23 billion during the reported quarter, up 29% year over year. Multiple myeloma drug, Empliciti recorded sales of $60 million, up 46% year over year.Research and development (R&D) expenses in the quarter increased 36% to $1.5 billion mainly due to a charge of $310 million related to acquisition of IFM Therapeutics, while marketing, selling and administrative expenses remained flat at $1.1 billion.Gross margin was 70.1% in the quarter compared with 73.5% in the year-ago quarter due to change in product mix and recognition of an inventory charge.In September 2017, Bristol-Myers completed the acquisition of all outstanding capital stock of IFM and gained full rights to IFM’s preclinical STING and NLRP3 agonist programs, which enhance the body’s immune response for treating cancer. Moreover, the company signed a global collaboration and license agreement with Halozyme Therapeutics for developing subcutaneous administration of its immuno-oncology medicines using Halozyme’s ENHANZE drug delivery technology.During the quarter, Bristol-Myers entered into multiple collaborations to develop Opdivo in combination with two antibody drug conjugates, a PARP inhibitor or tyrosine kinases inhibitor in several tumor types. These include Daiichi Sankyo’s investigational candidate DS-8201, AbbVie Inc’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) ABBV-399, Exelixis, Inc.’s (EXEL  -  Free Report) Cabometyx and Clovis Oncology, Inc.’s (CLVS  -  Free Report) Rubraca.Pipeline UpdateIn September, Bristol Myers announced data from a phase III study, CheckMate -238, which showed significant improvement in recurrence-free survival in stage IIIb/c or stage IV melanoma treated with Opdivo – Yervoy combination compared to Yervoy alone. Meanwhile, another phase III study, CheckMate -214 was stopped early as Opdivo + Yervoy achieved superior overall survival compared to current standard of care sunitinib. The study was conducted on previously untreated patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.However, three studies were placed under partial clinical hold evaluating Opdivo-based combinations in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The hold was placed based on risk observed in studies evaluating another anti-PD-1 agent, pembrolizumab, in multiple myeloma patients.2017 Earnings Guidance RevisedBristol-Myers has raised its adjusted earnings expectations for 2017. The company now projects earnings in the range of $2.95 to $3.05 per share (old guidance: $2.90 to $3.00). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.99.Our TakeBristol-Myers missed earnings expectations primarily due to an increase in R&D expenses. However, robust sales of drugs like Opdivo, Eliquis and Yervoy in the quarter drove the top line. The revised 2017 guidance was also encouraging. Meanwhile, we are positive on Bristol-Myers’ efforts to develop its pipeline, especially Opdivo.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company QuoteBristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2156,ABBV,"A leader in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) space, Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report), is expected to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter results on Oct 26, after the market closes.Gilead’s track record is pretty mixed, with the company beating estimates in two of the last four and missing in one two. Last quarter, the company beat expectations by 17.4%. Overall, the company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 6.4%.  Gilead’s stock has gained 15.9% year to date against the industry's 11.7%. A strong performance in the third quarter will boost share price performance further.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Gilead is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter. This is because it has the right combination of two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.23%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $2.09 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged a penny lower at $2.08. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Gilead Sciences, Inc. Quote Factors at PlayConcurrent with the second-quarter earnings call, Gilead updated its annual guidance. Based on a better-than-expected performance in the first half of 2017 specifically in the United States, the company raised its guidance for 2017.  Gilead now expects net product sales in the range of $24.0-$25.5 billion, up from $22.5-$24.5 billion provided earlier. Non-HCV product sales are projected between $15.5 and $16.0 billion (earlier projection: $15 million and $15.5 billion). HCV product sales are projected between $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion (earlier projection: $7.5 billion and $9.0 billion). Adjusted R&D expenses and adjusted SG&A expenses are now projected in the range of $3.2-$3.4 billion and $3.2-$3.4 billion, respectively. Adjusted product gross margin is expected in the range of 86-88%. Earnings per share are now projected around 86-93 cents (earlier projection: 84-91 cents).Strong HIV performance and other antiviral product sales are being driven by continued uptake of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) based products — Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey. We expect the trend to continue in the third quarter as well. Genvoya has already become the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients since its launch. This should drive the non-HCV product sales.  The TAF-based regimens now represent 51% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and Odefsey and Descovy in 2016.  Specifically, Genvoya is now the company’s bestselling HIV product with a treatment-naïve patient share of 41%. The Zacks Consensus estimate for Genvoya stands at $923 million. Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting is also expected to boost sales.  However, Gilead will lose exclusivity for Viread in 2017 in some countries outside the United States which might impact sales.Meanwhile, the HCV franchise continues to be under competitive and pricing pressure leading to a massive decline in Harvoni and Sovaldi sales. Harvoni and Sovaldi has been facing competition from AbbVie Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR among others. Higher discounts and payer mix continue to impact sales adversely. Despite this, the company increased its guidance for HCV franchise.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for lead HCV drug Sovaldi and Harvoni currently stand at $24.6 million and $1.0 million for the third quarter. The HCV portfolio received a major boost when Epclusa gained approval in 2016. The FDA also approved Vosevi tablets as a single-tablet regimen (STR) for the re-treatment of chronic HCV infection in adults.On the other hand, we expect the company to increase its guidance further for the incremental contribution from the recent Kite Pharma acquisition. The FDA recently approved its chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), for the treatment of refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which includes DLBCL, transformed follicular lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma.  We expect the management to throw more light on the same during the third-quarter’s call. Investors are also likely to keep an eye on other pipeline updates.Other Stocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some other health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +7.24% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is scheduled to release third-quarter results on Oct 25. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.28% and a Zacks Rank #2.

2157,ABBV,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.14, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.08 per share by 5.6%. Earnings rose 20% from the year-ago quarter backed by higher operating profits.Revenues BeatQuarterly revenues of $6.16 billion also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.96 billion by 3.4%. Sales grew 7% year over year backed by strong performance of new drugs and favorable currency movement to a lesser extent, partially offset by lower sales of established products like Strattera, Humalog, Cialis and Effient. Lilly’s established products portfolio recorded a decline of 6.3% in worldwide revenues.Volumes rose 4% as strong performance of new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Jardiance and Lartruvo offset decline in sales of established products. Higher realized prices for several drugs also contributed 2% to sales growth in the quarter. Foreign exchange rate also hada favorable impact of 1%.Segment RevenuesPharmaceutical revenues rose 9% in the quarter backed by 12% volume growth of the new products.While U.S. revenues grew 6% to $3.42 billion, ex-U.S. revenues rose 8% to $2.74 billion.Established products that recorded growth during the quarter include Forteo (up 21% to $513.2 million), Humulin (up 2% to $362.6 million), Cymbalta (up 6% to $192.8 million) and Erbitux (up 10% to $168.9 million). Sales of all other established products declined in the quarter.Humalog sales declined 5% to $782.2 million due to lower realized prices in the United States. Moreover in December 2017, the FDA approved Sanofi’s (SNY  -  Free Report) Admelog, a biosimilar version of Humalog. This approval will certainly increase competition. Alimta sales declined 3% to $525.2 million, reflecting lower demand in ex-U.S. markets due to competitive pressure and loss of exclusivity in certain countries. However, sales of Alimta increased 1% in the United States due to increased volume, partially offset by lower realized prices.Zyprexa sales declined 1% to $152.2 million due to loss of exclusivity in Japan.Cialis sales declined 12% to $597.4 million hurt by worldwide lower demand.Strattera sales declined 60% to $98.3 million. Effient sales declined 56% to $62.3 million in the quarter. Both the drugs saw lower demand due to loss of exclusivity.Among the new products, Trulicity generated revenues of $649 million, up 93% year over year, with U.S. revenues benefiting from growth in the GLP-1 market and market share gains.Cyramza revenues were $204.8 million, up 16% year over year, backed by strong demand. Cyramza’s ex-U.S. revenues increased 15%, benefiting from strong volumes in Japan, partially offset by lower realized prices. U.S. revenues increased 17% driven by increased volume.Jardiance sales (up 88% to $143.2 million) were driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class in the United States and increased volume outside the United States.Basaglar recorded revenues of $153.8 million compared with $145.7 million in the previous quarter. Basaglar - Lilly and partner Boehringer Ingelheim’s follow-on insulin to Sanofi’s blockbuster drug, Lantus - was launched in the United States in mid-December 2016.Taltz brought in sales of $172.5 million compared with $151.3 million in the previous quarter, reflecting strong uptake. In December 2017, the drug was approved for psoriatic arthritis and launched in the United States. The European Commission also approved the drug last week.Lartruvo (olaratumab) generated revenues of $59 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $54.5 million in the previous quarter. Lartruvo was launched in the United States and the EU for soft tissue sarcoma in the fourth quarter of 2016.Lilly and partner Incyte Corporation’s (INCY  -  Free Report) rheumatoid arthritis drug, Olumiant (baricitinib) has been launched in select European countries and in Japan. The drug generated sales of $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $16.2 million in the previous quarter backed by strong launch uptake in Germany.However, in the United States, Lilly received a complete response letter from the FDA for baricitinib in April for want of additional data. The company has re-submitted the application in late 2017.Verzenio, which was launched in the Unites States in the fourth quarter of 2017, Generated a sales of $21 million.Lilly's Elanco Animal Health segment sales declined 6% to $790.9 million due to decrease in food animal revenues (down 8% to $547.4 million). However, companion animal revenues increased 1%, including revenues from the acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica's U.S. feline, canine and rabies vaccine portfolio (acquired in January 2017) which was offset by competitive pressure and lower demand in the United States.Gross Margin Down but Operating Income RisesAdjusted gross margin of 76.5% in the quarter decreased 90 basis points as manufacturing efficiencies were offset by negative product mix and the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold.Operating income increased 20% year over year to $1.46 billion. Total operating expenses, as a percent of revenues, declined 340 basis points in the quarter to 52.8%.2018 EPS Guidance UppedLilly raised its previously issued 2018 adjusted earnings outlook. Adjusted earnings per share are now expected in the range of $4.81 to $4.91 compared with $4.60 to $4.70 expected previously, reflecting positive impact of the U.S. tax reform. However, revenues are still expected in the range of $23.0 billion and $23.5 billion.Gross margin is expected to be approximately 75%, same as previously expected. Adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 18% (previously approximately 21.5%).Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are still expected in the range of $6.1-$6.4 billion, while research and development expenses are projected to be $5.0-$5.2 billion.Our TakeLilly’s fourth-quarter 2017 results were strong with the company beating estimates on both counts. Meanwhile expectations for a lower tax rate due to new tax laws propelled the company to raise its 2018 earnings outlook.Shares were up 1.1% in pre-market trading. Lilly’s share price has risen 11.7% in the past year compared with an increase of 24.2% for the industry. Going forward, new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance and Lartruvo are expected to see higher revenues. Lilly is also progressing well with its pipeline. The FDA approval for Taltz’s line extension will also boost Lilly’s product revenues. In October 2017, Lilly has announced that it is looking to sell or spin-off its Elanco Animal Health business. Potential sale of its underperforming Animal Health segment may help improve margins.However, Alimta will continue to be impacted by competition. Other headwinds include competition from immuno-oncology agents as well as loss of exclusivity for many drugs in emerging markets.Eli Lilly and Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Eli Lilly and Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Eli Lilly and Company Quote Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderLilly carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2161,ABBV,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved Ixifi its second biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ  -  Free Report) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”) drug, Remicade (infliximab). Notably, Ixifi is a chimeric human-murine monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor.Ixifi received the nod for all approved indications of Remicade including RA, ulcerative colitis, plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn’s disease.Shares of Pfizer have risen 12.8% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s rally of 17.7%.The approval was based on an encouraging data from phase III study, REFLECTIONS B537-02. A biologics license application was filed with the FDA in April.Notably, in February 2016, Pfizer had divested the rights to development, commercialization and manufacturing of Ixifi in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to Novartis' generic arm, Sandoz. However, Pfizer retains the commercialization and manufacturing rights to Ixifi in all countries outside the EEA.We remind investors that Pfizer’s first biosimilar product to Remicade, Inflectra, was launched last November in the United States. The company has exclusive commercialization rights to Inflectra in the United States and on certain other territories.In September, Pfizer filed a lawsuit in a U.S. district court alleging that J&J is resorting to unfair practices to prevent the sale of Inflectra, available at a Wholesale Acquisition Cost, which is 19% lower than J&J’s referenced product.Pfizer alleged in a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania that J&J has entered into biosimilar-exclusion contracts with U.S. insurers. These contracts boost insurers not to cover Inflectra, thus making it difficult to access by patients and protecting its referenced product.Pfizer also claimed that anticompetitive contracts with discounts were offered to hospitals on purchase of Remicade on condition that they do not buy the biosimilar versions. Pfizer claims that these unfair practices benefit sales of J&J’s referenced product, a key revenue generator for the latter.Pfizer is evaluating 13 biosimilar molecules in various stages of development. Biosimilar products in late-stage development include biosimilar versions of Roche's (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan and Avastin and AbbVie's (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira. A biosimilar version of Herceptin is under review in the United States and the EU.

2162,ABBV,"AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced that a fourth pivotal phase III study evaluating its investigational IL-23 inhibitor, risankizumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis, met all co-primary and secondary endpoints.Top line data from the IMMhance study showed that a significant portion of patients treated with risankizumab achieved high levels of skin clearance. Nearly half (47%) of the patients treated with risankizumab achieved complete skin clearance versus placebo (1%) after 16 weeks of treatment.On continuous treatment with risankizumab, at week 28, 87% of the risankizumab patients maintained this response for one year. This data shows that patients can achieve better disease improvement over time on continuous treatment with risankizumab rather than withdrawing from the therapy after an initial response. Results from this study will support regulatory filings for the candidate.The 16-week results from this study were presented at the 8th International Congress of Psoriasis from Gene to Clinic meeting in London.AbbVie had in-licensed risankizumab from Boehringer Ingelheim in 2016. AbbVie is responsible for the future development and commercialization of the candidate.We remind investors that in October, AbbVie had announced that three pivotal head-to-head phase III studies evaluating risankizumab versus Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Stelara and AbbVie’s Humira, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis, met all co-primary and secondary endpoints. Top-line data presented from the studies showed that risankizumab achieved significantly greater response of clear or almost clear skin versus Stelara and Humira or placebo after 16 weeks of treatment.Risankizumab is also being evaluated in phase II studies for other immunological disorders like Crohn’s disease and psoriatic arthritis.AbbVie’s shares have gained 52% so far this year, comparing favorably with a gain of only 16.5 % recorded by the industry.The share price surge was supported by a series of positive news in the past few months.

2163,ABBV,"Every year, World Aids Day is celebrated on Dec 1 to raise public awareness about Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome, popularly known as AIDS. The day is observed to make people aware about proper cure and prevention of the disease. In this regard, this year, the theme for the day this year is ""Right to Health."" This day also commemorates those who have died from an AIDS-related illness.World AIDS Day is one of the eight official global public health campaigns marked by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to WHO, globally, about 36.7 million people were suffering from HIV/AIDS at the end of 2016. Of the total, 2.1 million were children less than 15 years old.AIDS is a pandemic disease caused due to the infection of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The virus weakens the immune system by destroying cells that fight diseases and infections, eventually leading to AIDS. Medicines for the treatment of HIV are called antiretroviral therapy (ART) that slow or put a check on the progression of the virus.Currently, companies are investigating new medicines to treat, prevent and ultimately cure HIV. Scientists also are exploring new treatment paradigms like two drug regimens, making therapies/drugs drugs with improved long-term safety profiles and new mechanisms of actions.Despite improved medical understanding of HIV and significant efforts made by leading government and medical bodies to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS, this disease still has limited treatment options. In 2016, 1 million people died of AIDS-related illnesses, totaling to 35.0 million since the start of the epidemic.Based on these statistics, it is not surprising that several healthcare companies are investing a significant amount of their R&D expenditures on developing treatments and devices for HIV and AIDS.Stocks to Watch For On World AIDS Day, here are some of the key pharma companies in the HIV market that investors can rely on.GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) has a long-standing commitment to HIV and AIDS. The company had developed the widely used antibiotic amoxycillin around 40 years ago, which was the first medicine approved to treat HIV. The sales of older HIV products — Epzicom and Selzentry — have been declining. However, the newer HIV drugs —Triumeq and Tivicay — are witnessing a consistent increase in sales and gaining market share.Meanwhile, a significant portion of its R&D expenditures are being used toward developing HIV medicines to treat/prevent HIV.Last week, Glaxo and partner Johnson & Johnson announced the FDA approval for Juluca — a combination of Glaxo’s Edurant/dolutegravir and J&J’s Tivicay/rilpivirine into a single tablet — for the treatment of HIV. Most medicines for HIV treatment are made up of three or more antiretroviral drugs. Juluca is the first two-drug regimen to be approved that reduces the number of medicines HIV patients take without compromising on the efficacy of a conventional three-drug regimen.This week ViiV Healthcare, an HIV company majorly owned by Glaxo and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), announced the start of a large late-stage African study that will evaluate long-acting cabotegravirinjection for the prevention of HIV in sexually active women. If approved, cabotegravir injections will be administered every two months as opposed to presently available oral anti-retroviral medication, which needs to be taken every day.Already, ViiV Healthcare has started conducting a HPTN 083 study on cabotegravirin HIV-uninfected men and transgender women who have sex with men, under co-funding with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Meanwhile, cabotegraviris also being evaluated in three late stage studies as atwo drug regimen withEdurant, with the third study initiation announced earlier this week.Furthermore, Glaxo is developing two drug regimen ofdolutegravir + lamivudine.Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) is a dominant player in the HIV market with an impressive portfolio. In fact, Gilead’s HIV franchise is a major contributor to sales with approved drugs like Genvoya, Truvada, Atripla, Stribild, Descovy, Odefsey and Complera.The company was the first to introduce a single-tablet regimen (STR) for the treatment of HIV — Atripla. Gilead’s other STRs for HIV include Complera/Eviplera and Stribild. Its TAF-based product, Genvoya, happens to be a bestseller surpassing both Truvada and Atripla since fourth-quarter 2016.Currently, Gilead’s bictegravir single table regimen (STR) for HIV treatment is under priority review in the United States. The FDA is expected to announce its decision in February 2018.The STR is a fixed-dose combination of bictegravir, an INSTI, and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF), a dual-NRTI backbone. This combination is also under review in the EU.Another company working towards developing HIV drugs is Johnson and Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report). The company along with partner Glaxo recently received FDA approval for first two-drug regimen- Juluca, as discussed above. Further, the company along with The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and National Institutes of Health is conducting an efficacy study for an investigational mosaic HIV-1 preventive vaccine.The study will evaluate whether the vaccine is safe and is able to reduce the incidence of HIV infection among women in sub-Saharan Africa.  HIV has a significant unmet need and women and girls account for about 60% of people living with HIV in eastern and southern Africa.OthersSome other popular marketed HIV drugs are AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report), Kaletra and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Isentress.Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) also recently received a tentative FDA approval for its combination tablet comprising efavirenz, lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.Meanwhile, Merck is developing an investigational non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, doravirine both as a single-entity tablet and in combination (fixed dose tablet) with other antiretroviral agents — lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). The company plans to file regulatory applications for the same before the end of 2017.ConclusionAIDS/HIV is a life threatening disease which has limited medical cure. However, there are numerous companies that are developing drugs for the treatment and care for people suffering from HIV and for them who are at risk of becoming infected with HIV, thereby making the space competitive.While Johnson & Johnson sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), both Glaxo and Gilead carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2164,ABBV,"Roche Holdings (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved Hemlibra (emicizumab-kxwh) for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adults and children with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors.The approval comes three months ahead of the assigned PDUFA date of Feb 23, 2018. The drug was reviewed by the FDA under Priority Review.Meanwhile, data from HAVEN 1 and HAVEN 2 are being reviewed under accelerated assessment by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).Roche’s legacy drugs like Herceptin, MabThera are already facing competition from biosimilars. Though the approval of new drugs certainly boosts Roche’s portfolio, it must be noted that Hemlibra carries a boxed warning of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and blood clots which will limit sales potential.Moreover, competition is intense in the haemophilia market too. Shire plc’s (SHPG  -  Free Report) hemophila drugs like Advate (hemophilia A) and Rixubis (hemophilia B) pose stiff competition to Roche. Also, the presence of Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report) in the same space is a concern.Meanwhile, Hemlibra is currently being evaluated in a clinical development program that includes two additional phase III studies. HAVEN 3 is evaluating Hemlibra prophylaxis dosed once weekly or once every other week in people 12 years of age or older with haemophilia A without inhibitors to factor VIII. HAVEN 4 is evaluating Hemlibra prophylaxis dosed every four weeks in people 12 years of age or older with haemophilia A with or without inhibitors.  Roche’s stock has gained only 4% year to date compared with industry’s growth of 18%.Roche also obtained FDA approval for Gazyva in combination with chemotherapy, followed by Gazyva alone in those who responded, for previously untreated advanced follicular lymphoma (stage II bulky, III or IV).The drug is already approved in combination with chlorambucil to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in adults who have not had previous CLL treatment.Roche’s hematology portfolio consists of approved drugs like MabThera/Rituxan (rituximab), Gazyva/Gazyvara, and Venclexta/Venclyxto (venetoclax) in collaboration with AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report).Zacks Rank Roche carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2166,ABBV,"Ahead of the opening bell for the final trading day of this week, new U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures were released, and, while not exactly disappointing, came up short of what many analysts had been expecting. The first read for Q4 GDP reached 2.6%, lower than the consensus estimate of 2.9%.Should this figure remain unchanged through future revisions — the second read is expected February 28 — this would amount to domestic economic growth of roughly 2.6%. This is nothing to sneeze at; in fact, it is almost exactly the average GDP growth rate of the previous 5 years. It’s a level which has brought the U.S. from the edge of the abyss during the Great Recession all the way to current all-time highs in the major stock market indexes.That said, the 30 basis-point miss does come as a bit of a surprise, especially considering a very strong Retail industry over the holiday shopping season, as well as a recovery in Oil & Gas and Construction and Manufacturing — all of which served as albatrosses in previous years. Indeed, some analysts were expecting a positive surprise for Q4 GDP that would have pushed the December quarter to 3% growth three times in a row for the first time this decade.This may yet happen, of course — future GDP reads have the benefit of more data points over time, and should this information break more to the positive, we could indeed see the most robust U.S. economy since the Recession. In particular, we look toward adjustments to private inventory investment, which shook out at 2.5% in Q4; personal consumption expenditures of 2.8% were the highest we’ve seen in a couple years.Q4 Earnings Roll OnWe finish the week as we began it — with a new batch of Q4 earnings results. Overall we’ve enjoyed a very strong earnings season, with positive surprises far outweighing negative ones. Even better: earnings revisions in future quarters for companies already having reported are currently up double-digits for the first time in many quarters, according to Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian.Industrial giant Honeywell (HON  -  Free Report) beat earnings estimates by a penny to $1.85 per share. Revenues of $10.84 billion outpaced the $10.69 billion in the Zacks consensus.

2169,ABBV,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) entered into a licensing agreement with Spark Therapeutics to develop, register and commercialize Luxturna (voretigene neparvovec) in markets outside the United States.We note Luxturna was approved in the United States on Dec 19, 2017 as one-time gene therapy to restore functional vision in children and adult patients with biallelic mutations of the RPE65 (retinal pigment epithelial 65 kDa protein) gene.The market authorization application was filed with the European Medicines Agency on July 31, 2017.Novartis will make an upfront payment as well as pay milestones and royalties to Spark Therapeutics. Meanwhile, Spark Therapeutics will retain exclusive rights for Luxturna in the United States and will retain responsibility for obtaining approval in Europe. Spark Therapeutics will also be responsible for the supply of Luxturna under a separate manufacturing and supply agreement with Novartis.We remind investors that the FDA approved Novartis’ breakthrough gene transfer treatment, Kymriah suspension for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is refractory or in second or later relapse.  Kymriah has been launched in the United States.Earlier in the week, Novartis reported encouraging results for the fourth quarter wherein results beat both earnings and sales estimates on strong performance of Cosentyx and Entresto. Psoriasis Cosentyx achieved multi-blockbuster drug status in 2017 on the back of strong growth of three approved indications while Entresto’s sales benefited from continued access improvements and expansion of sales force in the United States.The generic division, Sandoz also combatted pricing pressure strongly buoyed by launches of Rixathon, the biosimilar version of Roche Holdings, Inc.’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan (rituximab) and Erelzi, the biosimilar of Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel in EU.

2170,ABBV,"The fourth-quarter 2017 earnings season is in full swing with financial figures from 133 S&P 500 members or 26% of the index already out as of Jan 26, 2018 per the latest Earnings Preview.Total earnings for these index members jumped 12.3% from the year-ago quarter, driven by 8.8% improvement in revenues. The beat ratio was 81.2% for the bottom line and 78.9% for the top line.On a positive note, the ongoing earnings phase seems to have begun well for the Drug/Biotech sector. Among major large cap players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) kicked off the season with earnings beating estimates while sales slightly missing the same. A few other large pharma companies released their earnings results last week and the picture looks quite encouraging.The pharma bigwigs having reported last week are Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report), which surpassed both earnings and sales estimates in the quarter under review. While Novartis raised its sales guidance for 2018, AbbVie increased its previously issued earnings expectations for the year.Of the major players in the biotech sector, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) announced a mixed performance in the reported period with earnings lagging estimates while sales exceeding the same. However, Celgene Corp. (CELG  -  Free Report) outpaced both the metrics’ expectations during the fourth quarter.Drug/biotech stocks remained on a growth trajectory in 2017, courtesy of a slew of FDA approvals, rise in demand for new product sales, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical reports as well as a continued robust performance of legacy products. Moreover, these impressive factors, along with regular acquisitions, are expected to drive the sector’s growth in 2018 as well.Also, per the Earnings Preview, the broader Medical sector (inclusive of drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is likely to record 4.9% year-over-year growth in revenues and a 4.2% rise in earnings in the period under discussion.Two pharma/biotech giants are scheduled to report earnings numbers on Jan 31. Let's see how things are shaping up for the companies in the upcoming releases.Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report)Lilly is scheduled to release fourth-quarter earnings before the market opens. The company delivered a positive surprise of 1.94% last quarter. Lilly’s earnings performance has been modest with earnings missing expectations in three of the last four quarters while beating the same in the remaining one, thus bringing the average beat to 1.68%.Our proven model shows that Lilly is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. The combination of Lilly’s Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP as a solid Zacks Rank, and a positive Earnings ESP of +0.47% makes us confident about an earnings beat in the impending report. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is pegged at $1.08 per share.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.We expect a sturdy uptake of new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance and Lartruvo. This upside is likely to make up for the decline in sales of established products like Zyprexa, Alimta, Cialis, Strattera and Effient in the fourth quarter. (Read More: Lilly to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in the Cards?).Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report)Vertex is slated to release fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes. The company’s track record has also been impressive so far. It delivered a positive surprise in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 32.67%. In third-quarter 2017, Vertex came up with a positive surprise of 43.24%.However, our proven model does not conclusively show that Vertex is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. Though the company’s favorable Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP, its Earnings ESP of -4.00% leaves surprise prediction inconclusive. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 58 cents per share. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Vertex’s cystic fibrosis (CF) drugs, Kalydeco & Orkambi, performed consistently in the first three quarters of 2017.

2172,ABBV,"Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Advanced Accelerator Applications, obtained FDA approval for its new drug application (NDA) for Lutathera (lutetium Lu 177 dotatate) for the treatment of somatostatin receptor positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs), including foregut, midgut and hindgut neuroendocrine tumors in adults.We remind investors that last week, Novartis completed a successful tender offer for Advanced Accelerator Applications.Lutathera is a first-in-class drug and the first available FDA approved Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy, a form of treatment comprising a targeting molecule that carries a radioactive component. The approval was based on encouraging phase III study results which demonstrated a 79% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death within the Lutathera plus best standard of care arm (octreotide LAR 30mg every four weeks) compared to 60 mg of octreotide LAR alone (hazard ratio 0.21, 95% CI; 0.13-0.32; p<0.0001).The approval of Luthera expands Novartis` neuroendocrine tumor portfolio.Approval of new drugs boost Novartis’ portfolio which is facing generic competition for its blockbuster drug Gleevec.Last week, Novartis reported encouraging results for the fourth quarter wherein results beat both earnings and sales estimates on strong performance of Cosentyx and Entresto. Psoriasis Cosentyx achieved multi-blockbuster drug status in 2017 on the back of strong growth of three approved indications while Entresto’s sales benefited from continued access improvements and expansion of sales force in the United States. Novartis’ stock has rallied 9.0% in the last six months compared with the industry’s 15.7% gain.The generic division, Sandoz also combatted pricing pressure strongly buoyed by launches of Rixathon, the biosimilar version of Roche Holdings’ (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan (rituximab) and Erelzi, the biosimilar of Amgen.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel in EU.

2173,ABBV,"The biotech industry turned around this year after the drug pricing issue crippled its performance last year.It had a number of things going in its favor. Strong quarterly results, new product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals and continued strong performance from legacy products played a pivotal role in bringing the sector on track this year.However, after rising 15.4% in the first nine months of the year (January-September), the Medical-Biotech /Genetics industry has declined 13.4% so far in the fourth quarter (Oct 1 - to date). Both macro and industry specific factors resulted in the sudden downfall.Uncertain Macro PictureA big component of this sell-off is the confusion over the passing of the tax reform. The reform aims to bring down corporate tax to stimulate economic as well as employment growth.The proposed tax reforms, if approved, will leave more cash in the hands of biotech companies. The cash can be invested for mergers/acquisitions, which have been relatively fewer this year compared with the last. It goes without saying that significant uncertainty regarding the timely passing of the U.S. tax reform has cast a shadow over the future of the biotech sector.In October, President Trump once again criticized high drug prices. This came at a time when investors had started to expect that Trump's action on drug prices may not be as onerous as previously feared, sending health-care stocks lower.Tepid Q3 ResultsComing to some industry specific factors, most big biotechs beat estimates for earnings and sales in Q3. However, shares of most of these companies declined post earnings release for various reasons.Although Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) topped both earnings and revenue estimates in the third quarter, it witnessed continued decline in sales of its HCV drugs — Harvoni and Sovaldi — as a result of competitive and pricing pressure.Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) also beat expectations for both earnings and sales in Q3 and raised its earnings guidance for 2017. However sales declined year over year, which resulted in share price decline post the earnings call. Sales of its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha, were also disappointing.Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) shares plunged following the release of third-quarter results. Although Celgene’s earnings topped estimates, revenues fell short. Moreover, the company lowered its 2017 outlook for Otezla sales as well as its total revenue and earnings outlook for 2020.Although Biogen’s (BIIB  -  Free Report) third-quarter results were better than expected, shares were down 3.9% on concerns regarding the company’s multiple sclerosis franchise sales as well as U.S. sales of its recently launched spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”) treatment, Spinraza.Alexion (ALXN  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates but missed on revenues in the third quarter.Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) were the only two outperformers in Q3.ConclusionWe believe that the biotech space should be back on track if there is more certainty regarding the timing of the tax reforms. This is because the fundamentals of the sector remain strong. Meanwhile, with the Q3 earnings season now behind us, stocks should start picking up. Positive data from key clinical studies can drive the sector up as share price of biotechs is correlated to success in key studies. The major biotech players need an infusion of new growth drivers in their pipeline/product portfolios — either from internal development or from buying assets from outside. Strategic deals signed by these biotechs can also push the stocks higher.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2174,ABBV,"Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm, Sandoz, reported data from four clinical studies. The studies compared proposed biosimilar adalimumab and biosimilar rituximab to reference drugs, AbbVie, Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Roche Holdings (RHHBY  -  Free Report) MabThera respectively.The studies included two innovative trials involving switching and two pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies.A phase III confirmatory efficacy and safety study met its primary endpoint in the proportion of patients who achieved a 75% improvement at week 16.  The study confirmed that there were no meaningful clinical differences in efficacy, safety and immunogenicity in patients who continuously received adalimumab, those who continuously received the reference drug and those who switched between biosimilar adalimumab and reference drug on multiple occasion.In addition, a phase III study evaluated rituximab retreatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), who had already received reference rituximab for treatment of RA in the past. The study evaluated the biosimilar and the reference drug in terms of safety and immunogenicity in patients who switched from the reference drug to biosimilar rituximab and in those who continued treatment with the reference drug.In addition, the PK and PD data demonstrated equivalence as the phase I PK study met its primary endpoint as bioequivalence was demonstrated between the biosimilar adalimumab and the reference drug. We note Sandoz holds a leading position in the biosimilars space with a portfolio of five marketed biosimilars currently and a deep pipeline.The biosimilar version of rituximab, Rixathon, was approved by the European Commission in June 2017. It is currently under review in the United States. The biosimilar version of Humira is also under review in the EU.Meanwhile, Sandoz witnessed strong growth outside the United States buoyed by biosimilar launches of Rixathon and Erelzi, the biosimilar of Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel in Europe. However, pricing pressure intensified in the United States.  The company expects low single-digit sales decline at Sandoz in the fourth quarter, mainly due to seasonal shipment phasing and continued pricing pressures in the United States.  Novartis’ stock has rallied 17% year to date compared with the industry’s 17.6% gain. In the first half of 2017, Novartis announced that it is mulling strategic options for Alcon which includes retaining the business separation via capital market transactions such as a spin-off or an initial public offering. The company believes that the Alcon division has revived and hence a decision on a possible spin-off will be taken in 2019. The recent approvals of Kymriah and Kisqali will further boost the oncology portfolio and drive growth.Zacks RankNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The FDA approved the therapy for treating relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (r/rLBCL) in adults who have received two or more lines of systemic therapy.The various forms of r/rLBCL for which Yescarta is approved include diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) and high-grade B-cell lymphoma. This is the second gene therapy to be approved in the United States after Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah, which received approval in August for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.CAR-T therapy is the most advanced form of treating cancer. This is done by modifying the patient’s T-cell, part of the body’s immune system, to fight cancerous cells. The therapy is manufactured specifically for each single patient.Gilead Sciences, Inc.

2176,ABBV,"Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24.  Novartis’ stock has rallied 22.1% year to date compared with the industry’s 21.4% gain.In the last quarter, Novartis delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.3%. The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 3.51% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayConcurrent with the second-quarter results, Novartis reiterated its guidance. Net sales are expected to be broadly in line with the 2016 levels after including the impact of continued genericization of Gleevec/Glivec in the United States and Europe.Novartis operates under three segments: Innovative Medicines (Pharmaceuticals), Alcon and Sandoz (Generics). Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu, and the recently approved Kisqali. The recent approval of Kymriah for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a major boost for Novartis, given the potential in the CAR T therapy space. Meanwhile, the FDA has recently approved a label expansion of Zykadia as the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.New products like Cosentyx and Entresto are expected to boost the top line. Cosentyx has been strong and the company has grabbed market shares from rivals like AbbVie, Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Amgen. Inc’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel. Cosentyx achieved the blockbuster status in 2016 and recorded over $1 billion of sales. While Entresto is expected to record $500 million revenues, sales of Cosentyx are projected to reach $2 billion in 2017.Additionally, Novartis’ generic arm, Sandoz, is making efforts to strengthen its biosimilars portfolio. The company plans to launch five biosimilars of major oncology and immunology biologics across key geographies by 2020. The company is, however, facing significant pricing pressures and this is expected to impact the third-quarter results.Also, the loss of exclusivity of some of the key drugs in Novartis’ portfolio is hurting the company’s top line.  The company’s blockbuster drug, Diovan, is facing stiff generic competition in the United States, the EU and Japan. Gleevec lost exclusivity in the United States in February 2016 and in the EU in December 2016, thereby leading to generic competition. Exforge is also facing generic competition in the United States and the EU. Furthermore, the oncology drugs are facing new competition in the form of immuno-oncology therapies.The negative impact of generic competition is expected to impact sales by $2.5 billion in 2017.The company’s ophthalmologic division, Alcon, continues to face challenges due to lower surgical equipments sales. Stiff competition faced by intraocular lens and a slowdown in demand for equipment purchases continue to act as dampeners.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Novartis will beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Novartis is -0.40%.  This is because both the Most Accurate estimate is 1.24 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.25. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Novartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Although the rank is favorable, the company’s negative ESP makes its highly unlikely for earnings beat this quarter. As it is, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise  Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise | Novartis AG Quote Stock to ConsiderHere is one stock in the healthcare sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.84% and a Zacks Rank #1. The company is scheduled to release results on Oct 24. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

It holds about 30 healthcare and medical stocks for the long term.Tracey has been getting questions from listeners wondering if there is any value in healthcare stocks right now. Are any of them cheap?Biotechs on FireThe biotechs are hot again. The S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) has soared 47% this year while the iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology ETF (IBB) has gained 27%.But can some value still be found in the biotechs? And what about all the other healthcare industries?Zacks’ Medical Sector has over 800 companies, including drug companies, hospitals, managed care insurers, medical device companies, dental companies and others. They’re not all created equal.Tracey and Kevin ran a screen to quickly find basic value stocks within the sector. They looked only in the Medical sector and chose a current year forward P/E less than 20 and a next year forward P/E of under 15.They didn’t screen for Zacks Rank.It returned 61 stocks.Tracey and Kevin discuss about a dozen of them on this week’s podcast including these 5 big names.5 Cheap Healthcare Stocks1.      Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) has been cheap for years. It trades with a forward P/E of just 9.1. But earnings are on the decline. The company made $11.57 last year and expects to just make $8.74 this year. It recently bought KITE but will that be enough to give earnings a boost? Or is it a value trap?2.      Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) is another big biotech that is cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of just 15.6. Two analysts just raised their price targets to over $400 on the stock. Unlike Gilead, it’s expected to see earnings growth this year and next year.3.      Teva (TEVA  -  Free Report) is the cheapest in the group. It trades with a forward P/E of 3.4 but investors have to be concerned about those falling earnings estimates. It made $5.14 in 2016 and is expected to make just $3.82 in 2018. Is it a value trap?4.      AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) has the rare combination of an attractive P/E at just 16.4 and rising earnings estimates. Earnings are expected to jump 14% in 2017 and another 19% in 2018. Should ABBV be on your short list?5.      Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) is in the managed care group, which, is one of the most difficult areas to be in right now due to Obamacare uncertainty. But Aetna has been reducing its exposure to the exchanges and it trades with a forward P/E of just 15.9.There are other industries that are also in the cone of uncertainty due to the unknowns surrounding Obamacare, including the hospitals.Tracey and Kevin discuss the hospital group, especially Tenet Healthcare (THC).Additionally, Valeant (VRX) appears to be cheap, but Tracey fears it’s a value trap.And what about medical device companies? They’ve been hot this year but are they just too expensive to make the list?Find out the answer to all of these questions and more on this week’s podcast.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2178,ABBV,"Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced that the EU Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) has adopted a positive opinion for Hemlibra (emicizumab) for routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in patients suffering from hemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors.The CHMP has recommended the drug for use in all age groups.The Marketing Authorisation Application is being reviewed under accelerated assessment.A final decision is expected from the European Commission shortly. The CHMP recommendation is based on the positive results of two pivotal clinical studies for people with haemophilia A with inhibitors, the phase III HAVEN 1 and HAVEN 2 studies.We note that the FDA approved Hemlibra for routine prophylaxis to event or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adults and children with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors in November 2017. Hemlibra was reviewed by the FDA under Priority Review and granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA in people aged 12 years or older with haemophilia A with inhibitors in September 2015.Meanwhile, Hemlibra is being evaluated in a clinical development program that includes two additional phase III studies, HAVEN 3 and HAVEN 4. Results from HAVEN 3 showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the number of treated bleeds over time in adults and adolescents (12 years of age or older) with haemophilia A without inhibitors who received Hemlibra prophylaxis every week or every two weeks, compared with those receiving no prophylaxis. Interim results from HAVEN 4 showed a clinically meaningful control of bleeding in adults and adolescents (12 years of age or older) with haemophilia A with or without inhibitors who received Hemlibra prophylaxis once every four weeks.A potential approval in Europe will further boost Roche’s hematology portfolio which includes approved drugs like MabThera/Rituxan, Gazyva/Gazyvaro, Tecentriq and Venclexta as well as an encouraging pipeline comprising candidates like polatuzumab vedotin/RG7596 and a small-molecule antagonist of MDM2 (idasanutlin/RG7388).We note that Roche is developing Venclexta in collaboration with AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report). Both companies are jointly commercializing in the United States. AbbVie is commercializing the drug outside the United States.Earlier in the month, the European Commission  granted marketing authorization for multiple sclerosis (MS) drug Ocrevus.The drug is approved for active relapsing forms of MS defined by clinical or imaging features as well as for early primary progressive MS in terms of disease duration and level of disability, and with imaging features characteristic of inflammatory activity. Roche’s stock has lost 3.1% over a year compared with industry's gain of 2.9%.Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche as its legacy drugs like Herceptin, MabThera are facing competition from biosimilars.Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan/ MabThera in Europe. Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) has also obtained FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Avastin for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer.Zacks RankRoche currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2180,ABBV,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and sales. The drug and consumer products giant raised its 2017 sales and profit outlook, which sent shares up 1.5% in pre-market trading.In fact, this year so far, J&J’s share price is up 18.1%. This is almost in line with the 18.2% increase witnessed by the industry.Earnings BeatJ&J’s third-quarter 2017 earnings came in at $1.90 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.80 and increasing 13.1% from the year-ago period.Including amortization expense and special items, J&J reported third-quarter earnings of $1.37 per share, down 10.5% from the year-ago period.Sales BeatSales came in at $19.65 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.28 billion by 1.9%. Sales increased 10.3% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting an operational increase of 9.5% and a positive currency impact of 0.8%. Organically, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, sales increased 3.8% on an operational basis.Third-quarter sales grew 9.7% in the domestic market to $10.29 billion and 10.9% in international markets to $9.36 billion, reflecting 9.3% operational growth and 1.6% positive currency impact.Sales in DetailsPharmaceutical segment sales rose 15.4% year over year to $9.7 billion, reflecting 14.6% operational growth and 0.8% positive currency impact as sales rose in both the domestic and international markets. Sales in the domestic market rose 15.4% to $5.82 billion, while international sales grew 15.5% to $3.88 billion. Organically, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, sales increased 6.7% on an operational basis.New products like Imbruvica (cancer) and Darzalex (multiple myeloma) continued to perform well. Other growth drivers were core products like Xarelto, Stelara and Invega Sustenna. Sales of Concerta and Zytiga improved in the quarter.In the quarter, J&J recorded pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) revenues of $670 million. The $30 billion acquisition of Swiss biotech Actelion in June diversified J&J’s revenues to the PAH category.However, sales of Invokana/Invokamet declined 19.2% due to higher managed care discounting. Importantly, sales of the blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade, marketed in partnership with Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report), declined 7.6% in the quarter with U.S. sales declining 1.3% and international sales declining 6.9% due to biosimilar competition. In this regard, we would like to mention that Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) filed a lawsuit in a U.S. district court recently. In the lawsuit, Pfizer alleged J&J of resorting to unfair practices to prevent sale of Inflectra — Pfizer’s biosimilar version of Remicade — that was launched in the United States in November last year.J&J’s Pharma segment achieved some clinical milestones during the quarter including label expansions in the United States for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) drug, Tracleer for pediatric use and Imbruvica for chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) – the drug’s first indication outside of cancer. J&J markets Imbruvica in partnership with AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report).At the call, the company also mentioned that it will not file global regulatory applications for rheumatoid arthritis candidate, sirukumab. We remind investors that last month, J&J received a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA for sirukumab for want of additional safety data.  Medical Devices segment sales came in at $6.6 billion, up 7.1% from the year-ago period. It included an operational increase of 6.6% and positive currency movement of 0.5%. Sales gained mainly from the inclusion of Abbott Medical Optics acquisition, which added 5.2% to operational sales growth. Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures, on an operational basis, worldwide sales increased 1.2%.Domestic market sales rose 4.6% year over year to $3.19 billion. International market sales increased 9.6% (operational increase of 8.6%) year over year to $3.41 billion.Operational growth was driven by wound closure products in the General Surgery business, electrophysiology products in the Cardiovascular business and Acuvue contact lenses in the Vision Care business, which made up for a weaker sales performance in the Diabetes Care unitThe Consumer segment recorded revenues of $3.36 billion in the reported quarter, up 2.9% year over year(operational increase of 1.6%). Foreign currency movement positively impacted sales in the segment by 1.3%. Sales in the domestic market declined 0.5% from the year-ago period to $1.29 billion.Slower growth in baby care products due to competitive pressure was partially offset by growth in beauty and over-the-counter products and international smoking cessation aids.Meanwhile, the international segment recorded an increase of 5.1% to $2.07 billion, reflecting an operational increase of 3% and a positive currency impact of 2.1%.2017 Guidance RaisedJ&J raised its adjusted earnings and sales outlook for the year.J&J expects 2017 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $7.25 - $7.30 compared with $7.12 - $7.22 expected previously.The revenue guidance was raised to a range of $76.1 billion to $76.5 billion compared with $75.8 billion to $76.1 billion expected previouslyOur TakeAs indicated last quarter, J&J’s sales growth accelerated in the third quarter leading the company to post its first positive sales surprise after almost a year. Higher sales in the pharmaceutical segment as well as positive contribution from the Actelion deal pulled up the top line in the quarter. The Actelion acquisition added an impressive 7.9% to operational sales growth in the quarter.Though quite a few key products in J&J’s portfolio like Remicade and Concerta are facing generic competition, we believe that new products in all segments, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and contribution from Actelion could lead to better sales trends, going forward.J&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2181,ABBV,"Spin-off activities have stepped up lately, with biggies like Honeywell International (HON  -  Free Report) and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) being the most active ones. Lately, the industrial giant Honeywell announced plans of spinning off its homes and global distribution units and its transportation systems unit into two publicly traded companies by 2018 end (read: 5 ETFs to Buy on 13-Year High Manufacturing Activity).On the other hand, Pfizer is exploring strategic alternatives to possibly bid good-bye to its Consumer Healthcare segment. A sale or spin-off of its consumer-health unit is expected next year. Pfizer's consumer sales have been essentially “flat for the past three years.”This clearly explains why Pfizer intends to concentrate on the more promising, innovative pharmaceutical unit and separate it from Consumer Healthcare. The move also signifies the likely introduction of more deal-making, as per Wall Street Journal. However, the company also kept open chances of retaining the business.Inside Spin-offsSometimes businesses form another autonomous entity from an existing business/division, when they believe that the separated line would add more value as an independent company. In such situations, the parent can focus on its core business management while the new entity can focus on its relative different goals.How Profitable Spin-offs are to Investors?According to Cantor Fitzgerald, “spinoffs completed between 2009 and 2013 outperformed the S&P 500 in their first year of trading by an average of more than 17 percent.” As per an article published on benzinga, spun-off entities have been performing better than parent companies lately.PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) (up about 114%) generated higher gains than parent eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) (up about 56%) in the last two years (post spin-off). WhiteWave Foods Co  gained about 67.8% in the last three years against an 11.2% decline in Dean Foods Co (DF  -  Free Report). WhiteWave Foods was spun off in May 2013. Abbot Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) cut ties with part of its business and formed a new company called AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) in Jan 2013. ABBV was up 85% while ABT gained 41% in the last three years (as of Oct 12, 2017).What’s Behind the Recent Surge in Spin-OffA Chicago-based partner at The Boston Consulting Group recently commented that in a bull market, which we are witnessing currently, equities are overvalued. This makes materialization of mergers and acquisitions difficult. Instead, high valuations better justify “spinning off assets or divesting assets."" If this logic holds good, we are likely to see more such actions in the coming days (read: 4 Bargain ETFs in a Pricey Market).Notably, the United States saw 88 completed spinoffs in 1999, which fell to 80 in 2000, when the dot-com bubble burst. The number further declined to 55 in 2001. The number of actions again rose from 24 in 2007 to 30 in 2008, before sliding to 17 in 2009 when the financial crisis kicked in, as per the data provided by Dealogic, quoted on CNBC. The momentum again gained momentum in 2015 by value, though 2016 and 2017 have been subdued.ETFs to Play There are always ways to play such corporate actions. Below we highlight two spin-off ETFs in detail. These ETFs can get further boost from Honeywell and Pfizer’s announcements.Guggenheim S&P Spin-Off ETF (CSD  -  Free Report)The 61-stock fund looks to track the S&P U.S. Spin-Off Index. Paypal Holdings (7.98%), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (7.85%) and Synchrony Financial (7.39%) are the top three holdings of the fund. CSD charges 65 bps in fees (read: PayPal's Strong Q2 Results Put These ETFs in Focus).VanEck Vectors Global Spin-Off ETF (SPUN  -  Free Report) The 95-stock fund follows the Horizon Kinetics Global Spin-Off Index, which is a rules-based, equal-weighted index intended to track the performance of listed, publicly held spin-offs that are domiciled and trade in the U.S. or developed markets of Western Europe and Asia. The net expense ratio of the fund is 0.55%. United States accounts for about 78.8% of the fund. Gannett Co (1.2%), Time Inc. (1.1%) and Timkensteel (1.1%) are top three stocks of the fund.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

2182,ABBV,"Companies like Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report) were in the news with Amgen providing pipeline and regulatory updates while Regeneron and partner Sanofi got some good news with an appeals court ruling in their favor in the PCSK9 inhibitor lawsuit against Amgen.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesPhase II Combination Data on Amgen’s Imlygic Published: Positive data on Amgen’s oncolytic viral therapy, Imlygic, when used in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Yervoy were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. Results from the mid-stage study showed that the objective response rate (""ORR"") more than doubled when Imlygic was used in combination with Yervoy compared to Yervoy alone in patients with unresectable stage IIIB-IV melanoma (39% versus 18%). Moreover, the complete response rate was almost double in the combination arm compared to Yervoy alone (13% versus 7%). Responses were observed in both injected and uninjected lesions, including visceral lesions.Advanced melanoma is highly aggressive and one of the most dangerous types of skin cancer with there being need for multiple treatment approaches over the course of the disease. The data is encouraging and could open up new avenues of revenues for Imlygic if it eventually gains approval for use in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor. Sales of Imlygic, approved in October 2015, are yet to pick up.Meanwhile, Amgen said that the FDA has accepted its regulatory application seeking label expansion for the use of Prolia in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, the most common form of secondary osteoporosis. A response from the agency should be out on May 28, 2018. Prolia, which brought in sales of $505 million in the second quarter of 2017, is an important growth driver for Amgen with the company working on improving diagnosis, treatment rates and duration in order to drive access to a greater number of patients (Read more: Amgen Label Expansion Application for Prolia Accepted by FDA).Amgen is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. Shares of Amgen have gained 27.1% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 13.9% rally. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Breather for Amgen with Neulasta Biosimilar Approval Delay: Amgen got a bit of a breather with the FDA issuing a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) for Mylan and Biocon’s biosimilar version of Amgen’s blockbuster drug, Neulasta (pegfilgrastim). While the agency did not raise any queries regarding biosimilarity, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, clinical data or immunogenicity of MYL-1401H, the CRL relates to the pending update of the regulatory application with certain CMC data from facility requalification activities post recent plant modifications.We note that Mylan and Biocon are not the only companies to get a CRL from the FDA for a biosimilar version of Neulasta. While Novartis’s Sandoz had received a CRL last year, Coherus was issued a CRL this year in June.  Regeneron/Sanofi Score a Win in PCSK9 Inhibitor Litigation: Regeneron and partner Sanofi got a major boost with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ordering a new trial related to Amgen’s claims regarding patents for PCSK9 inhibitors. The court also vacated the permanent injunction in the lawsuit which means Sanofi and Regeneron can continue selling their PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent, in the United States (Read more: Regeneron and Sanofi Get Favorable Ruling Against Amgen).AbbVie in Immuno-Oncology Deal: AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) has entered into a research, option and license agreement with clinical-stage immuno-oncology company Turnstone Biologics. The deal provides AbbVie with an exclusive option to license up to three of Turnstone's next-generation oncolytic viral immunotherapies.Turnstone’s Ad-MG1-MAGEA3 therapy is in a couple of phase I/II studies for different solid tumor indications alone as well as in combination with an approved anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor.Promising New Data on Biogen’s Spinraza: New phase III data presented by Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) on Spinraza showed that earlier initiation of treatment with the therapy may improve motor function outcomes in infants and children with spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”). Biogen and Ionis’s Spinraza is the first approved medicine for the treatment of SMA. Spinraza is off to a promising start in the United States bringing in sales of $203 million in the second quarter of 2017.Clovis Seeks Label Expansion for PARP Inhibitor: Clovis Oncology (CLVS  -  Free Report) has filed for label expansion of its PARP inhibitor, Rubraca, in the United States. The company is looking to get the drug approved for the maintenance treatment of patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. The company had presented impressive late-stage data earlier this year in June on Rubraca showing that the treatment significantly improved progression-free survival in all ovarian cancer patient populations evaluated in the ARIEL3 study.Rubraca had gained accelerated FDA approval in December 2016 for use in advanced ovarian cancer patients who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies and who have deleterious germline or somatic BRCA mutations. A broader label would boost Rubraca’s sales potential (Read more: Clovis Submits sNDA for Ovarian Cancer Drug Rubraca).PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index was up 0.6% over the last five trading sessions. Among major biotech stocks, Biogen gained 4.9% while Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) lost 4.4%.

2183,ABBV,"All the three key U.S. indexes closed at record levels on Friday following better-than-expected earnings from Intel, AbbVie and Honeywell. Additionally, continued economic growth and optimism over a weaker dollar had a positive impact on investor sentiment. The S&P 500 has finished at a record level for 14 trading days so far this month, its best such feat in a month since June 1955. The index also posted its best one-day rise since March 1, 2017.Additionally, the Dow posted a rise of more than 220 points on Friday, while the Nasdaq registered its biggest one-day gain since Jan 2. Further, all the three indexes advanced more than 2% for the week, posting their fourth straight week of gains.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.8%, or 220.13 points to close at 26,115.65. The S&P 500 rose 1.2% to close at 2,872.87. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,505.77, gaining 1.3%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 4.3% to close at 11.08. A total of around 6.58 billion shares were traded on Friday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6.81 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.20-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.54-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.Upbeat Q4 Earnings Boost SentimentEncouraging earnings results from Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) and Honeywell International Inc (HON  -  Free Report) lent further impetus to the markets’ rally. Intel’s shares climbed 10.6% after the chipmaker posted fourth quarter earnings per share (EPS) and revenues, which beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Intel guided first-quarter 2018 non-GAAP revenues of around $15 billion, up 5% year over year excluding McAfee. (Read More)Shares of AbbVie jumped 13.8% after the pharmaceutical products manufacturer reported fourth quarter EPS and revenues, which surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. AbbVie raised its adjusted EPS in the range of $7.33-$7.43 for 2018 compared with $6.37-$6.57, predicted earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings is pegged at $6.58 per share. (Read More)Honeywell’s shares increased 2% after the diversified technology companyposted solid fourth-quarter results with healthy year-over-year increase in revenues and adjusted earnings. Further, Honeywell revised full-year 2018 earnings guidance to better reflect the favorable impact from the tax reform. (Read More)Economic DataU.S. GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.6% in the final three months of 2017 following gains of more than 3% in the two previous quarters, as per the “advance” estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In fact, this marked the economy’s strongest stretch of growth since the expansion started in mid-2009.The economy was boosted by solid consumer spending, which increased at 3.8% over the quarter after a 2.2% gain in the third quarter. Consumer outlays registered its fastest pace of growth in the fourth quarter in almost two years. Companies also ramped up spending in the fourth quarter by 6.8%. Among other bright spots, government spending also increased at a clip of 3%.Weak Dollar Bodes Well For Large-CapsAdditionally, during the week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that any weakness in the dollar was beneficial for trade. His comments led to the ICE U.S. Dollar Index falling to its lowest level since Dec 2014 on Wednesday. Although, later Mnuchin said that his remarks regarding dollar was “misinterpreted.”Meanwhile, President Trump in the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland said that ""the dollar is going to get stronger and stronger” and eventually he wished the greenback to strengthen. However, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index fell 1.5% for the week to settle at 89.07, following Mnuchin’s comments. A weaker dollar bodes well for large-cap multinationals, which generate revenues mainly from buyers outside the U.S.Weekly RoundupFor the week, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq gained 2.1%, 2.2% and 2.3%, respectively. Benchmarks registered their fourth straight weekly increase after the Senate gave its consent to pass a Bill that ends the recent government shutdown. Additionally, encouraging earnings results by Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report), 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) also boosted markets.Stocks That Made HeadlinesDiageo 1H18 Interim Earnings & Sales Up Year Over YearDiageo plc (DEO  -  Free Report) recently announced interim results for the half yearly period ended Jul 31, 2017.

2184,ABBV,"Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 results were mixed as it beat estimates for earnings while missing the same for sales. J&J announced its fourth-quarter results on Jan 23 before markets opened.As expected, J&J’s sales growth accelerated in the second half of the year backed by higher sales in the Pharmaceutical segment and improving performance in Medical Devices. Organically, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, sales increased 4.2% on an operational basis in the fourth quarter, better than 3.8% increase seen in the third quarter and 2.4% in the first half.Meanwhile, the acceleration in underlying sales growth in J&J’s Pharma segment seen in the third quarter continued in the fourth quarter.  Pharmaceutical segment sales rose 17.6% year over year in the fourth quarter to $9.7 billion. Also the drug and medical device giant issued a bullish profit outlook for 2018. J&J estimated 2018 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $8.00 - $8.20, reflecting an operational growth rate between 6.8% and 9.6%. The company’s guidance exceeded the then Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.86 per share.Despite all these positive factors, shares of J&J have declined since the earnings release on what seems to be investor disappointment with the 2018 revenue guidance.In 2018, J&J expects revenues in the range of $80.6 billion to $81.4 billion, reflecting operational constant currency sales growth in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. However, the sales guidance fell slightly short of the then Zacks Consensus Estimate of $81.55 billion. Organic sales growth, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, is expected to be in the range of 2.5%-3.5%, which, though slightly higher than 2.4% seen in 2017, is short of 4.2% recorded in the fourth quarter. The organic sales growth outlook fell short of investor expectation, which resulted in the share price drop.We understand investors’ concern with the projected decline in revenue growth in 2018. However, we do believe that this outlook is conservative, considering that J&J has a history of issuing a cautious outlook, especially at the beginning of the year. We believe that there are several tailwinds this year, which can coax it to improve the projection as the year progresses. Two new drugs were approved last year - Guselkumab/Tremfya in the United States as well as in the EU for plaque psoriasis and the first dual treatment for HIV, Juluca (dolutegravir + rilpivirine) in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) in the United States. Juluca is under review in the EU.J&J also gained FDA approval for several line extensions -  a lower dose of Xarelto, two new indications of Simponi Aria, use in adolescents for Stelara, combination use of Darzalex with Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) multiple myeloma drug, Pomalyst and the sixth indication for Imbruvica, among others. Please note that J&J markets Imbruvica in partnership with AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report).The line extensions can expand the eligible patient populations of these drugs and drive sales higher in 2018. The newly approved products will also contribute to sales in 2018.In 2017, J&J also submitted regulatory applications for label expansion of key drugs including Darzalex (in first-line setting for multiple myeloma), Xarelto (for chronic coronary artery disease and/or peripheral artery disease), Invokana (to include the cardiovascular indication), Zytiga (for earlier stages of metastatic prostate cancer). It might get FDA nod for these line extensions this year, which can provide top-line support, if launched.This year J&J expects to file for approval of depression candidate, esketamine while apalutamide for pre-metastatic prostate cancer and Symtuza, a darunavir-based once-daily single-tablet regimen for HIV, could be approved by the FDA. Also, several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones are expected in 2018.Meanwhile, J&J’s Pharma segment sales accelerated in the second half from a weak first half and management seemed confident that the positive trend will continue in 2018. J&J also said on the call that the Consumer and Medical Device segments will continue to improve in 2018.We believe that new products in all segments, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and contribution from acquisitions, mainly Actelion, will support top-line growth.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2185,ABBV,"Late last week, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced its decision to discontinue the development of a couple of candidates in its hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) program - MK-3682B (grazoprevir/ruzasvir/ uprifosbuvir) and MK-3682C (ruzasvir/uprifosbuvir). The company’s decision was based on a review of available phase II efficacy data and the growing competition in the HCV market. Merck itself has a marketed product in the HCV market in the form of Zepatier (elbasvir and grazoprevir) which brought in sales of $895 million in the first six months of 2017 (including a $40 million favorable adjustment to rebate accruals due to mix of business). While Merck will continue to work on expanding Zepatier’s utilization across the world, uptake will be impacted by the ongoing decline in overall patient volumes in many markets and increased competition.Gilead and AbbVie in HCV SpotlightMerck’s announcement has now put the spotlight firmly on Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report), two key players in this market.Gilead is the undisputed leader in the HCV market with its HCV products bringing in sales of $5.4 billion in the first half of 2017. The company revolutionized the treatment paradigm in the HCV market with the introduction of Sovaldi by cutting down the duration of treatment to as few as 12 weeks instead of the prior standard of care of up to 48 weeks. Moreover, the need for peg-interferon injections, which come with several side effects, was reduced or eliminated completely.Gilead launched Harvoni next, the first once-daily single-tablet regimen for the treatment of the most prevalent HCV genotype in the United States. This was followed by the launch of Epclusa, the first all-oral, pan-genotypic, single-tablet regimen for the treatment of adults with genotype 1-6 chronic HCV infection. This year, Gilead gained approval for yet another HCV treatment, Vosevi.Although Gilead ruled the HCV market for quite a few years, sales are declining given intense pricing pressure, growing competition, pricing scrutiny and a declining patient population. The approval of newer HCV products has resulted in a rapid increase in the number of patients who were treated and cured followed by a decline in the number of patients seeking care and being able to access HCV treatment. Gilead expects HCV net product sales in the range of $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion in 2017 (announced with Q2 results), representing quite a drop from last year’s HCV product sales of $14.8 billion.Meanwhile, AbbVie’s HCV products include Mavyret (glecaprevir/pibrentasivr), Viekira Pak (ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir tablets co-packaged with dasabuvir tablets) and Viekira XR (dasabuvir, ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir). While Mavyret was approved recently, Viekira sales were $488 million in the first half of 2017. Mavyret, the company’s next generation HCV offering, should be a meaningful contributor to sales from 2018.Other HCV drugs include Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Daklinza (daclastavir) and Janssen Therapeutics’s Olysio (simeprevir).We remind investors that Merck is not the only company to have taken the decision to halt the development of HCV candidates. Last month, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) had announced its decision to terminate a collaboration agreement with Achillion Pharmaceuticals (ACHN  -  Free Report) for HCV.J&J’s Janssen Pharmaceuticals said that it would be discontinuing the development of the investigational HCV treatment regimen JNJ-4178, a combination of three direct acting antivirals: AL-335, odalasvir and simeprevir.With both Merck and J&J dropping their investigational HCV treatments, Gilead and AbbVie should benefit from the lack of additional competition entering the market, at least in the near term. While the companies will continue to face challenges like declining patient volume and intense pricing pressure, the lack of additional entrants in the market should slow down the rate of decline in sales.Gilead has been working on expanding the HCV market by encouraging baby boomers to get tested. According to the company, there has been an 80% increase in HCV antibody screening by baby boomers since the start of this initiative. Increased testing has led to an increase in diagnosis with about 190,000 people being newly diagnosed with HCV in 2016, up 32% from 2015. This represents a significant opportunity for the existing players in the HCV market.Both Gilead and AbbVie are Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

2186,ABBV,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that it is discontinuing further development of two of its next-generation hepatitis C (HCV) programs — MK-3682B and MK-3682C — as the market is becoming extremely crowded.MK-3682B was an all-oral, triple combination regimen (3682/uprifosbuvir, in combination with grazoprevir and ruzasvir1) developed for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. MK-3682C was a combination of ruzasvir/uprifosbuvir.Merck’s shares have risen 9.2% this year so far compared with a 16.4% increase for the industry.The company will now focus on growing sales of its key HCV drug in the market, Zeptier, which is approved for use with ribavirin to treat chronic HCV genotype 1 or 4 infection. Zepatier, a once-daily, fixed-dose combination tablet containing the NS5A inhibitor elbasvir and the NS3/4A protease inhibitor grazoprevir, is gradually becoming a key top-line driver for Merck along with cancer drug Keytruda.The medicine recorded sales of $517 million in the second quarter of 2017, much higher than $378 million in the first quarter, attributable to strong underlying demand trends in the United States, Europe and Japan as the company continues to launch Zepatier globally. However, we remind investors that at the second quarter conference call, management had warned that Zepatier uptake, going forward, may be impacted by the ongoing decline in overall patient volumes in many markets and increased competition.The HCV market is getting crowded and is thus seeing increased pricing pressure. Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) markets blockbuster HCV drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, while other well-known names in this market are AbbVie Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak, Bristol-Myers’ Daklinza and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Olysio.Moreover, other companies are also looking to bring new, improved, shorter-duration HCV treatments to market.AbbVie’s pan-genotypic shorter-duration HCV regimen of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P), Mavyret, received approval in the United States., Canada and the EU in July/August. Meanwhile, Gilead already markets Epclusa, an all-oral, pan-genotypic, single tablet HCV regimen since 2016. Meanwhile, Gilead’s single-tablet regimen (STR) of Sovaldi, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir, Vosevi received approval in the United States, EU and Canada in July/August. Vosevi became the first once-daily STR available as a salvage therapy for patients infected with HCV genotype 1–6 who have failed prior treatment with DAA regimens including NS5A inhibitors.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2187,ABBV,"We expect Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter and full year 2017 results on Jan 30, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.08%.The pharma giant has a fairly decent record of earnings surprises. The company’s earnings surpassed expectations in three of the last four quarters while missing in one, resulting in an average positive surprise of 0.79%.Pfizer’s shares have risen 18.7% in the past year, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 24.7% for the industry.Factors at PlayNew products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain), Chantix (smoking cessation) and Eliquis (blood thinner) are likely to contribute meaningfully to the top line.However, the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for some products (primarily Pristiq in the United States and Vfend and Lyrica in developed Europe), supply shortages in legacy Hospira products, and divesture of the Hospira Infusion Systems unit will continue to hamper top-line growth.Blockbuster drug Enbrel’s sales will continue to decline in the quarter due to biosimilar competition. The Prevnar/Prevenar 13 vaccines franchise is likely to see lower sales while lower demand is expected to hurt sales of Viagra.On the third-quarter call, Pfizer said that it is facing supply shortages for products from legacy Hospira portfolio mainly due to capacity constraints and technical issues. At the time of acquiring Hospira in September 2015, Pfizer had estimated that it would take a couple of years to integrate the manufacturing plants and resolve the majority of the supply chain issues. The company also stated that the remediation of the business has taken longer than expected. We expect the supply shortages to hurt sales in the fourth quarter.Meanwhile, the bottom line is likely to be driven by cost savings and share buybacks.Two leukemia treatments - Besponsa/inotuzumab ozogamicin (approved in EU in June 2017 and in the United States in August 2017) for relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Mylotarg for newly diagnosed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were approved in third-quarter 2017.Xeljanz, Sutent and Bosulif were approved for line extensions in the fourth quarter while Ixifi, Pfizer’s second biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug Remicade, was also launched in December.All these new products and line extensions should bring in some additional sales in the fourth quarter.We also expect management to update on the commercialization plans for new approved oral SGLT-2 inhibitor, Steglatro (ertugliflozin) tablets on the conference call. Apart from being approved as a monotherapy to treat type II diabetes, Steglatro has also been approved for use in combination with metformin under the brand name, Segluromet and with Januvia, under the brand name Steglujan.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model shows that Pfizer is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.

2188,ABBV,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because AbbVieis seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ABBV in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.46 per share for ABBV, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.44 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ABBV, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.30% heading into earnings season.Why is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that ABBV has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for AbbVie, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2189,ABBV,"We expect AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 26 before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.44%.AbbVie’s shares have soared 73.9% in a year’s time, ahead of the industry’s rally of 24.6%. Notably, AbbVie’s earnings history is quite impressive with the pharmaceuticals company outpacing estimates in three of the last four quarters and meeting the same in one. Overall, AbbVie has an average beat of 1.12%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors to ConsiderAbbVie expects fourth-quarter 2017 earnings in the range of $1.42-$1.44 per share. Revenues are estimated to grow approximately 10% on an operational basis. Foreign exchange is anticipated to have a 2% favorable impact on sales in the period to be reported.The company’s key drug, Humira, is likely to remain the growth driver in the fourth quarter, backed by strong demand trends for the drug. AbbVie expects Humira full-year sales growth in the mid to high-teens range while internationally, the metric is projected in a mid-single-digit range on an operational basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Humira is $4.8 billion for the to-be-reported quarter.Significantly, on fourth-quarter conference call, investors’ focus will also be on the performance and label expansion updates of AbbVie’s another cancer drug, Imbruvica. The drug has been recording strong sales since the past few quarters, a trend that we expect to continue even in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Imbruvica is $704 million for the period.Other drugs like Duopa and Creon are also likely to continue to perform well in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.However, AbbVie’s Hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment, Viekira, will continue to see declining sales impacted by an intense pricing and competitive pressure in the HCV market.Notably, AbbVie’s eight-week, pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, once-daily HCV treatment, Mavyret, gained approval in the United States, EU, Canada and Japan in third-quarter 2017. Mavyret recorded $100 million global sales in the quarter. The initial uptake of the drug has been impressive and we expect its higher sales in the fourth quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that the stock is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.Zacks ESP: AbbViehas an Earnings ESP of +1.30%, representing the difference between the Most Accurate estimate ($1.46 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($1.44).

2190,ABBV,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) reported encouraging results for fourth-quarter 2017 wherein both earnings and revenues beat estimates driven by strong performance of Cosentyx and Entresto.Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise  Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise | Novartis AG Quote Fourth-quarter 2017 core earnings of $1.21 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16 and were up from $1.12 recorded in the year-ago quarter.Revenues increased 5% to $12.9 billion as volume growth driven by Cosentyx and Entresto was partially offset by the negative impact of generic competition and pricing. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.6 billion. Novartis’ stock has rallied 3.5% in the last six months compared with the industry’s 10.8% gain.All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-over-year basis and at constant exchange rates.Quarter in DetailNovartis operates under three segments: Innovative Medicines (Pharmaceuticals), Alcon (Ophthalmology unit) and Sandoz (Generics).The Innovative Medicines division recorded sales of $8.8 billion, up 4%. Generic competition impacted sales at the segment, primarily due to the entry of generics for Gleevec in the United States and Europe. Pricing too impacted sales. Nevertheless, growth products — Cosentyx, Entresto, Promacta/Revolade, Jakavi, Tafinlar + Mekinist and Gilenya boosted sales.Psoriasis Cosentyx achieved multi-blockbuster drug status in 2017 on the back of strong growth in its three approved indications while Entresto’s sales benefited from continued access improvements and expansion of sales force in the United States.  Cosentyx generated sales of $2.1 billion in 2017. Entresto sales came in at $507 million in 2017. Oncology franchise (excluding Gleevec) grew 13%.Sales at the Sandoz division were $2.6 billion, down 4% as volume growth was offset by price erosion in the Unites States. Sales in the United States declined 17% due to pricing pressure. Biopharmaceuticals sales grew 6% mainly driven by Zarxio in the United States and launches of Rixathon, the biosimilar version of Roche Holdings, Inc.’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan (rituximab) and Erelzi, the biosimilar of Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel in EU.Sales at the Alcon division were $1.6 billion, up 6%. Surgical sales increased 9% driven by broad recovery across most market segments, including strong growth from vitreoretinal products. Vision Care sales were up 2% fueled by the continued double-digit growth of Dailies Total1.Earlier, Novartis announced that it is mulling over strategic options for its lagging eye-care unit Alcon which includes retaining the business, or a separation via capital market transactions such as a spin-off or an initial public offering.  The company updated its strategic plan and announced that it has the potential to grow sales at or above market while delivering profitability in line with the industry. The company also made significant progress on developing a potential capital markets solution, including financial carve-outs, tax and legal entity structuring, and identifying listing and incorporation locations.  A final decision will be taken depending on Alcon’s sales performance which is not likely to happen before the first half of 2019.Meanwhile, Novartis has moved the Ophthalmic OTC products to the Alcon Division, effective Jan 1, 2018, to allow the Innovative Medicines Division to focus on pharmaceutical pipeline.2017 ResultsSales came in at $49.1 billion, up 2% from 2016 and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $48.9 billion. Earnings per share came in at $4.86 beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.79 and up from $4.75 per share in 2016.2018 OutlookNovartis expects net sales in 2018 to grow low to mid-single digit. Innovative Medicines is projected to grow in mid-single digit. Revenues from Sandoz is expected to be broadly in line or decline slightly. Alcon sales are estimated to grow in low to mid-single digits.Pipeline UpdateNovartis’ pipeline candidates’ progress has been encouraging.  2017 was a good year for Novartis with 16 major approvals. The oncology portfolio continues to gain traction.  In a significant boost, the FDA approved its breakthrough gene transfer treatment, Kymriah suspension for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is refractory or in second or later relapse.  Kymriah has been launched in the United States.  Novartis is seeking to expand Kymriah’s label.Novartis’ supplemental Biologics License Application for Kymriah suspension for intravenous infusion, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who are ineligible for or relapse after autologous stem cell transplant has been accepted by the FDA for Priority Review.Breast cancer drug Kisqali was approved in Europe as a first-line option for HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with any aromatase inhibitor. The drug is already approved in the United States. The company also received approval of Rydapt in Europe for the treatment of newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia and three types of systemic mastocytosis.Sandoz continues to progress with its biosimilars pipeline. The proposed biosimilar version of AbbVie. Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira (adalimumab) has also been accepted for review by the FDA.  The biosimilar version of Humira is already review in the EU.Tasigna was approved in Europe for the treatment of pediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) and pediatric patients with Ph+ CML-CP with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib.Our TakeNovartis fourth-quarter results beat both earnings and sales estimates on strong performance of Cosentyx and Entresto. The generic division, Sandoz also combatted pricing pressure strongly buoyed by biosimilar launches of Rixathin and Erelzi. Meanwhile, the strategic decision on Alcon to retain the business or separation via capital market transactions such as a spin-off or an initial public offering has been postponed. The company believes that the Alcon division has revived well for now and hence a decision on a possible spin-off will be taken in 2019. The recent approvals of Kymriah and Kisqali will further boost the oncology portfolio and drive growth.Zacks RankNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2193,ABBV,"The fourth-quarter earnings season is in full swing and the trend so far appears impressive. Notably, 53 S&P 500 companies have posted results (as of Jan 19, 2018) with earnings up 11.7% on revenue growth of 7.5%, per the latest Earnings Preview. Also, 62.3% of these companies topped on earnings and revenues.Focusing our attention on the Large Cap Pharma sector, we are yet to witness the main show from this space with only one company having reported quarterly results till now/so far. The Large Cap Pharma sub-industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of #112, placing it among the first 42% of the 265 plus Zacks industries. Our back testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one.We remind investors that the drug stocks had a prolific run in 2017, courtesy of a slew of FDA approvals. The regulatory body approved 46 novel drugs last year, easily surpassing 2016’s total tally of 22. Particularly, large-cap players in the industry raked in stellar returns, up 23.9% in the last 12 months.Upbeat quarterly results, rise in demand for new product sales, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results as well as a continued strong performance of legacy products propelled the large-cap drug sector to scale new highs in 2017. Moreover, these tailwinds are expected to drive the sector’s growth in 2018.Meanwhile, jubilant Republicans passed the tax overhaul bill for the first time in 30 years. The tax bill was signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump only last month on Dec 22.The corporate tax rate having been slashed from 35% to 21% can now boost profits of large drug/biotech companies. Meanwhile, the change in tax code will also allow companies to bring back the huge cash stashed overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%. Also, the tax cuts are expected to prevent the earlier inversions rampant in the drug industry.Importantly, the outlook for the upcoming fourth-quarter results looks bright. Per the Earnings Preview, the broader Medical sector (inclusive of drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is expected to record 4.6% year-over-year growth in revenues and a 3% rise in earnings this time around.How to Pick Likely Q4 WinnersGiven the enormity of the healthcare space, the task of selecting stocks with potential to beat estimates could appear quite daunting. But our proprietary methodology makes this job fairly simple. One way to taper the list of choices this earnings season is by looking at the stocks with the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP. More often than not, a positive earnings surprise delivered by a company leads to its stock price appreciation.Per our well-researched quantitative model, the Earnings ESP is used for identifying stocks with higher or 70% chances of delivering a positive surprise in the upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Investing in stocks with large market cap is a much more reliable investment as the same controls a large portion of the respective industry. Also, companies with a larger market cap have evidently performed well throughout 2017.Here are three large-cap pharma stocks poised to surpass estimates in the fourth quarter according to our methodology.Our first pick is AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report). This North Chicago, IL-based company has an Earnings ESP of +1.30% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2017 earnings being pegged at $1.44 per share.

Merck is slated to announce results on Feb 2.AstraZeneca plc (AZN  -  Free Report) too has a pleasing earnings profile with the company having consistently outpaced earnings expectations in all the last four quarters with an average beat of 126.62%.

Juluca is under review in the EU while Tremfya was approved in the United States in July last year.In the quarter, J&J also gained FDA approval for several line extensions - a lower dose of Xarelto, two new indications of Simponi Aria - psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and use in adolescents for Stelara.Medical Devices segment sales came in at $6.97 billion, up 8.3% from the year-ago period. It included an operational increase of 6.5% and positive currency movement of 1.8%.Domestic market sales rose 5.3% year over year to $3.31 billion. International market sales increased 11.1% (operational increase of 7.5%) year over year to $3.66 billion.The Consumer segment recorded revenues of $3.54 billion in the reported quarter, up 3.1% year over year (operational increase of 0.4%). Foreign currency movement positively impacted sales in the segment by 2.7%. Sales in the domestic market declined 0.6% from the year-ago period to $1.38 billion.Meanwhile, the international segment recorded an increase of 5.7% to $2.16 billion, reflecting an operational increase of 1.2% and a positive currency impact of 4.5%.2017 ResultsFull-year 2017 sales rose 6.3% to $76.5 billion, falling slightly short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $76.8 billion.Adjusted earnings for 2017 were $7.30 per share, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.28 and up 8.5% year over year. Earnings were at the higher end of the guidance range of $7.25 - $7.30per share.2018 Outlook IssuedJ&J issued a decent guidance for 2018 wherein the earnings range was above the consensus estimate while sales fell slightly short of the same.J&J expects 2018 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $8.00 - $8.20, reflecting an operational growth rate between 6.8% and 9.6%. The company’s guidance exceeds theZacks Consensus Estimate of $7.86 per share.It expects revenues in the range of $80.6 billion to $81.4 billion, reflecting operational constant currency sales growth rate in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. However, the sales guidance falls slightly short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $81.55 billion.Our TakeThe acceleration in underlying sales growth seen in the third quarter continued in the fourth quarter. Though quite a few key products in J&J’s portfolio like Remicade and Concerta  faced generic competition, we believe that new products in all segments, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and contribution from Actelion led to better sales trends in the second half of 2017 compared to the first half. The 2018 profit outlook is also quite upbeat.J&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2196,ABBV,"Sanofi, Inc. (SNY  -  Free Report) and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) announced that a phase II study evaluating its injection Dupixent for the treatment of adults with active moderate-to-severe eosinophilic esophagitis met its primary endpoint.Sanofi’s shares have risen 22.7% this year so far compared with 18.3% increase for the industry.Dupixent is already marketed for treating atopic dermatitis (AD)/eczema in the United States since March this year and was approved for AD in the EU last month.Eosinophilic esophagitis is a chronic, allergic inflammatory disease in which the patients suffer from difficulty in swallowing. Presently, this condition, mainly caused by food allergies, is treated only with diet modification, corticosteroids or surgery.Data from the study showed that patients treated with Dupixent injection weekly experienced a significant improvement in the ability to swallow when compared with placebo. Meanwhile, treatment with dupilumab weekly also led to significant improvement in the severity of inflammation of the esophagus and endoscopic signs of the disease. Please note that Dupixent enjoys orphan drug designation for this indication.We are optimistic on sales prospects of Dupixent, which could prove to be an important growth driver for the company. Dupixent generated sales of €26 million in the second quarter backed by strong demand.Apart from AD and eosinophilic esophagitis, Dupixent is also being evaluated for other inflammatory indications including asthma and nasal polyposis in late stage studies. Last month, Sanofi and Regeneron announced that Dupixent met its two primary endpoints in a phase III asthma study. Data from the LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study showed that Dupixent, when added to standard therapies, reduced severe asthma attacks and improved lung function. Based on this positive data, the companies plan to submit a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the FDA by the end of this year.Sanofi has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the large-cap pharma sector include AbbVie, Inc.

2197,ABBV,"Janssen, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), announced that the FDA has approved the label expansion of its plaque psoriasis drug, Stelara for use in adolescents (12 years of age or older). The drug is approved for adults in this indication since 2009.The company believes that the label expansion is a significant achievement as plaque psoriasis develops before the age of 20 years in approximately one-third of the patients. Moreover, the number of treatments available for adolescents is limited.Patients are administered only four doses a year after two starter doses of Stelara, which has become a leading therapeutic option.Shares of the company are up 18.4% so far this year, almost in line with the industry’s performance. The industry has gained 18.3% in the same time frame.The latest approval for Stelara is based on data from a phase III study, which evaluated the subcutaneous administration of the drug in adolescent patients. The data showed that the drug achieved minimal psoriasis or clear skin in at least two-thirds of the patients. The safety data was also consistent with what was achieved in adult patients.There are almost 7.5 million people suffering from psoriasis in the United States per the American Academy of Dermatology. Moreover, the National Center for Biotechnology Information stated that the majority of psoriasis patients suffer from plaque psoriasis. The numbers represent a huge opportunity for the drug following its label expansion..Moreover, with this approval Stelara has gained an edge over competing drugs like AbbVie Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira, Novartis AG’s Cosentyx and Celgene Corporation’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Otezla, which are only approved for adult plaque psoriasis patients. However, Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Enbrel will compete with Stelara in the adolescent segment.Johnson & Johnson Price and Consensus  Johnson & Johnson Price and Consensus | Johnson & Johnson QuoteJohnson & Johnson carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2199,ABBV,"Varian Medical Systems Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 24, after the market closes. In the previous quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19. Further, adjusted earnings declined from $1.38 in the year-ago quarter.On an average, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 6.6% in the trailing four quarters. Also, a lackluster price performance is a woe. Over the last year, the stock has returned 22.6% compared with the industry’s rally of 33.2%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus  Varian Medical Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus | Varian Medical Systems, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayDeclining Financials:Varian Medical experienced declining revenues in fourth-quarter of 2017. The trend is expected to continue in the quarter-to-be-reported as well. Lackluster performance by the company’s Halcyon cancer-treatment device will hamper sales in Latin America. In fact, sales in the Halcyon platform declined 46% in Latin America in the fourth quarter, thanks to several tenders pushing out, mainly from public-sector deals. Revenues from Asia-Pacific and Japan are also expected to decline significantly due to plummeting orders of Halcyon.Further, softness in the market for freestanding clinics is a headwind for Varian Medical in the to-be-reported quarter.Performance in the proton-therapy unit has been dampened due to intense competition in the niche space. This is anticipated to be a major concern for Varian Medical.Narrowing Customer Base:The majority of Varian Medical's X-Ray tube and flat panel detector sales cater to a small number of (large imaging system) original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers. The equipment manufacturing majors incorporate these X-Ray products into their own medical diagnostic imaging systems and industrial imaging systems. Due to the pattern of client concentration, a loss of any one of these clients may have an adverse effect on Varian Medical’s operating results.Earnings WhispersBuoyed by the above factors, our proven model does not conclusively indicate earnings beat for Varian Medical in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Varian Medical currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.76%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 99 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at 98 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Varian Medical currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). This decreases the predictive power of ESP and makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revision.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider, per our model, which have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter.AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.30% and a Zacks Rank #3.Agios Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AGIO  -  Free Report) has an earnings ESP of +0.12% and a Zacks Rank #3.

2200,ABBV,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 24, 2018. The Swiss pharmaceutical company’s stock has rallied 3.2% in the last six months compared with the  industry's 10.4% gain.Novartis has an excellent track record. In the last quarter, Novartis delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.2%. The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 3.25% in the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayConcurrent with the third-quarter results, Novartis reiterated its annual guidance. Net sales are expected to be in line with the 2016 levels after including the impact of continued genericization of Gleevec/Glivec in the United States and Europe.Novartis operates under three segments: Innovative Medicines (Pharmaceuticals), Alcon and Sandoz (Generics). Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu, and Kisqali. The recent approval of Kymriah for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a major boost for Novartis, given the potential in the CAR-T therapy space. Sales from this division are expected to grow marginally.New products like Cosentyx and Entresto are expected to boost the top line. Cosentyx has been strong and the company has grabbed market shares from rivals like AbbVie, Inc.'s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Amgen. Inc's (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel. Cosentyx achieved the blockbuster status in 2016 and recorded over $1 billion of sales. While Entresto is expected to record $500 million revenues, sales of Cosentyx are projected to reach $2 billion in 2017.Additionally, Novartis' generic arm, Sandoz, is making efforts to strengthen its biosimilars portfolio. The company plans to launch five biosimilars of major oncology and immunology biologics across key geographies by 2020. The company is, however, facing significant pricing pressures which might impact the fourth-quarter results. The company now expects sales to decline or broadly in line.Meanwhile, the loss of exclusivity of some of the key drugs in Novartis' portfolio will continue to hurt the company's top line.  The company's blockbuster drug, Diovan, is facing stiff generic competition in the United States, the EU and Japan. Gleevec lost exclusivity in the United States in February 2016 and in the EU in December 2016, thereby leading to generic competition. Exforge is also facing generic competition in the United States and the EU. Further, the oncology drugs are facing new competition in the form of immuno-oncology therapies. The negative impact of generic competition is expected to impact sales by $2.5 billion.The performance of the ophthalmology division, Alcon business was weak due to competition faced by intraocular lens and a slowdown in demand for equipment purchases. Consequently, Novartis took a few steps to revive the business. The turnaround has been encouraging and management believes creating a standalone company via a capital markets exit could create additional shareholder value. A decision is expected in the first half of 2019, depending on Alcon’s performance in the future.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Novartis will beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Novartis is 0.00%.  This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.16. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter .Zacks Rank: Novartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Although the rank is favorable, the company's 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stock to ConsiderHere is one stock in the healthcare sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.90% and a Zacks Rank #1.

2201,ABBV,"2017 was a good year for pharma and biotech stocks with the sector witnessing some positive developments that led to a much-awaited recovery.A key reason for the sector’s improved performance was the willingness of investors to look beyond the drug pricing controversy and focus more on fundamentals instead. Although the drug pricing controversy, which was a major overhang in 2016, will remain a headline risk, investors seem more comfortable with the issue. Moreover, a significantly higher number of FDA approvals in 2017 has restored investor confidence in the sector. The approval of the first gene cell therapy last year was a major breakthrough for the sector.Hopes of more mergers and acquisitions (M&As) have also gone up with tax reform in place and big players on the lookout for companies with innovative pipelines/technology. There has already been quite a bit of M&A buzz this year about potential deals with Celgene rumored to be interested in buying Juno , Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) in Acorda and Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) in Bioverativ. Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk recently confirmed that it is looking to acquire Belgium-based biopharma company Ablynx though Ablynx rejected Novo Nordisk’s offer.Looking forward, new product sales ramp up, R&D success and innovation, continued strong performance from key products, more M&A activity, growing demand for drugs especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should keep the momentum in 2018.Headwinds include drug pricing scrutiny, pricing pressure, increasing competition, the growing presence of biosimilars, generic competition, a slowdown in the growth of legacy products, concerns regarding Amazon’s interest in entering the healthcare arena and major pipeline setbacks.4 Biotech & Pharma Stocks to Keep an Eye on This Earnings SeasonAccording to the Zacks Earnings Trends article, the medical sector, which has been among the better performing sectors over the last several quarters, is expected to record earnings growth of 3% on revenue growth of 4.7% in the fourth quarter.Given this scenario and with medical sector earnings round the corner, it would make sense to look at some pharma and biotech stocks that are expected to report a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.Investing in such stocks could prove beneficial for investors as an earnings beat usually leads to significant share price appreciation.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed-in on four pharma and biotech stocks that sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) and have a positive Earnings ESP. Earnings ESP is a very valuable tool for investors looking for stocks that are most likely to beat earnings estimates. Moreover, adding a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 has produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. While you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here, you can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report): Alexion has a strong presence in the rare diseases market. Marketed drugs include Soliris (for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), and anti-acetylcholine receptor (AchR) antibody-positive generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG)), Strensiq (enzyme replacement therapy for patients with hypophosphatasia (“HPP”)) and Kanuma (enzyme replacement therapy for patients with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D)).Alexion is focusing on growing and maximizing its presence in the rare disease business. Core areas of focus include hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders. Alexion has consistently surpassed earnings expectations in each of the last four quarters with an average surprise of 11.9%. The Zacks Rank #3 stock, which will report fourth quarter results on February 8, has an Earnings ESP of +5.93% for the quarter. While 2017 Soliris revenues are expected in the range of $3,090 million - $3,125 million, metabolic revenues are expected in the range of $385 - $400 million.Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report): Celgene is focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of treatments for cancer and inflammatory diseases through next-generation solutions in protein homeostasis, immuno-oncology, epigenetics, immunology and neuro-inflammation.

2202,ABBV,"Hepatitis C is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) markets blockbuster HCV drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, while other well-known names in this market are AbbVie Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak, Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Daklinza and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Olysio.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 3.2 million people in the United States are living with chronic hepatitis C infection while many remain unaware of being infected. There are about 17,000 new hepatitis C cases each year in the United States, many of which go unreported.Considering these numbers, it is not a surprise that quite a few pharma and biotech companies are working on bringing new, improved, shorter-duration HCV treatments to the market. The market is thus getting crowded and seeing increased pricing pressure.  A lot has happened in the HCV space of late.  In September 2017, Gilead Sciences’ Sovaldi received approval in China, as a component of a combination antiviral treatment regimen. It is the first Gilead HCV drug to be approved in China.  Meanwhile, Gilead’s single-tablet regimen (STR) of Sovaldi, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir, Vosevi received approval in the United States, EU and Canada in July/August. Vosevi became the first once-daily STR available as a salvage therapy for patients infected with HCV genotype 1–6 who have failed prior treatment with DAA regimens including NS5A inhibitors.Gilead’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has rallied 16.6% compared with the industry’s gain of 14.5% in the same time frame. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Meanwhile, AbbVie’s 8-week, pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, once-daily HCV treatment, Mavyret/Maviret, gained approval in the United States, EU and Canada in the past couple of months. Mavyret, AbbVie’s next-generation HCV program, is a combination of glecaprevir, a potent protease inhibitor and pibrentasvir, a NS5A inhibitor. Maviret has the potential to rejuvenate growth in the HCV franchise. According to AbbVie, Mavyret may be used in up to 95% of HCV patients, depending on the stage of liver disease and prior treatment history.Abbvie’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has rallied 44% compared with the industry’s gain of 17.9% in the same time frame. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3.However, last week, pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that it is discontinuing further development of two of its next-generation hepatitis C (HCV) programs — MK-3682B (grazoprevir/ruzasvir/ uprifosbuvir) and MK-3682C (ruzasvir/uprifosbuvir). The company made this decision based on review of available phase II efficacy data and a heavily crowded HCV market.Merck’s shares have underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has gained 9.7% compared with the industry’s gain of 17.9% in the same time frame. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3.Besides Merck, another giant Johnson & Johnson also discontinued the development of its investigational HCV treatment regimen JNJ-4178, a combination of three direct acting antivirals: AL-335, odalasvir and simeprevir. The company took this decision considering that there are several highly effective therapies available for this indication.Johnson & Johnson’s shares have underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has gained 15.6% compared with the industry’s gain of 17.9% in the same time frame. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3.It is believed that the discontinuation of Merck and J&J’s combination HCV regimens should act in favor of Gilead and AbbVie. Gilead and AbbVie should benefit from the lack of additional competition entering the market, at least in the near term. However, the companies will continue to face challenges in the form of declining patient volume and intense pricing pressure. The lack of additional entrants in the market should also slow down the rate of decline in sales.Where Do Zacks' Investment Ideas Come From?You are welcome to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buy"" stocks free of charge.

2203,ABBV,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) shares have gained an impressive 16.7% in the past month, comparing favorably with a gain of 4.5% recorded by the industry.The share price surge was supported by a series of positive news for the company in the past few weeks.Last week, AbbVie announced the resolution of its ongoing patent dispute with Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), which has delayed the launch of the latter’s biosimilar version of AbbVie’s blockbuster arthritis drug, Humira to 2023. Per the settlement, AbbVie will grant a non-exclusive license to Amgen, which will allow the latter to sell Amjevita in the United States from Jan 31, 2023 and in most countries in the EU from Oct 16, 2018 and in other markets on different dates.Against the license, Amgen will pay AbbVie pre-specified royalties. This agreement has removed a major overhang on AbbVie’s shares though the company is still facing a patent challenge from Boehringer Ingelheim, which gained approval for its biosimilar version of Humira, Cyltezo, in August. Moreover, the agreement gives AbbVie ample time to focus on developing its pipeline and launching new products that will help make up for the loss of revenues once biosimilar Humira enters the market.Secondly, AbbVie’s 8-week, pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, once-daily HCV treatment, Mavyret/Maviret, gained approval in the United States, EU and Canada in the past couple of months. Mavyret, AbbVie’s next-generation HCV program, is a combination of glecaprevir, a potent protease inhibitor and pibrentasvir, a NS5A inhibitor. Maviret has the potential to rejuvenate growth in the HCV franchise. According to AbbVie, Mavyret may be used in up to 95% of HCV patients, depending on the stage of liver disease and prior treatment history.AbbVie announced positive data from the phase III MURANO study of Venclexta plus Rituxan in relapse/refractory CLL last month. The data showed that Venclexta plus Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan met the primary endpoint of prolonged progression-free survival compared with Treanda (bendamustine) plus Rituxan in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (“CLL”).  Label expansion for this indication should expand the patient population for Venclexta significantly and boost its commercial potential.AbbVie also announced a collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) for evaluating a combination of its investigational antibody drug conjugate ABBV-399 and Bristol-Myers's immunotherapy Opdivo in c-met overexpressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Lastly, AbbVie’s oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib (ABT-494) met primary endpoints in a phase III study for the treatment of RA with highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful results for both the doses (15 mg and 30 mg) of upadacitinib compared to placebo. Upadacitinib also met primary endpoints in a phase IIb study for the treatment of adult patients with atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema. The company plans to advance the candidate into phase III studies next year. Data from both the upadacitinib studies were announced last month.In fact, so far this year, AbbVie’s share price has increased 43.5%, also comparing favorably with a gain of 17.7% for the industry.AbbVie carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2204,ABBV,"Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced that its blockbuster hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection drug, Sovaldi has now been approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) also. The drug was approved for the treatment of adults and adolescents (aged 12-18 years) infected with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 as a component of a combination antiviral treatment regimen. We note that Sovaldi is the first Gilead HCV drug approved in China.We note that HCV is the fourth-most commonly reported infectious disease in China, with approximately 10 million patients. Hence, the approval in the country holds promise for growth.We note that Sovaldi was approved in the United States in 2013 and in Europe in 2014.  The drug is currently approved in 79 countries.In addition, Gilead is evaluating its HCV single-tablet regimens Harvoni and Epclusa at clinical trials sites across China.Gilead is known for its presence in the HCV market, thanks to its blockbuster HCV drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni. The HCV portfolio received a huge a boost with the approval of Epclusa in both the United States (June 2016) and the EU (July 2016) and became the first and only all-oral, pan-genotypic, STR consisting of Sovaldi and velpatasvir (an NS5A inhibitor), for the treatment of adults with genotype 1-6 chronic HCV infection. The FDA approval of Vosevi (Sovaldi, velpatasvir 100 mg/voxilaprevir 100 mg) tablets also boosted the company’s portfolio. The drug is a single-tablet regimen (STR) for the re-treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection in adults with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, previously treated with an NS5A inhibitor-containing regimen, or with genotype 1a or 3 previously treated with a Sovaldi-containing regimen without an NS5A inhibitor.However, the HCV franchise is under pressure due to competition and pricing issues. We note that Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa, face competition from AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR among others. Competition as well as pricing pressure intensified further with the launch of Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zepatier.Gilead recently announced plans to acquire Kite Pharma, Inc.  to foray in the emerging field of cell therapy. Kite is a pioneer in cell therapy having developed engineered cell therapies that express either a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or an engineered T-cell receptor (TCR), depending on the type of cancer. The acquisition will diversify Gilead’s portfolio and poise the company in a dominant position in cellular therapy space. We note that investors were expecting Gilead to announce an acquisition in the near term given the decline in the once lucrative HCV market due to competitive pressure.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2205,ABBV,"A key development this week was the FDA approval of the first cancer biosimilar - Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Allergan’s Mvasi, a biosimilar version of Roche’s blockbuster cancer drug, Avastin. Other updates include important data presentations from companies like Nabriva Therapeutics (NBRV  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report).Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesFirst Cancer Biosimilar Gets FDA Nod: The FDA approved Amgen and Allergan’s Mvasi, a biosimilar version of Roche’s blockbuster cancer drug, Avastin (bevacizumab). Mvasi can be used for all eligible indications of the reference product. Approval was in line with expectations considering the favorable vote the biosimilar got from an FDA advisory panel recently. The approval is quite a boost for the companies as well as the effort to lower drug prices though so far biosimilars are yet to make a significant dent in referenced product sales in the United States. Mvasi is under review in the EU (Read more: Amgen/Allergan's Avastin Biosimilar Secures FDA Approval).Nabriva up on Positive Antibiotic Data: Nabriva got a major boost with the company posting positive top-line results on oral lefamulin in patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (“CABP”), the leading cause of infectious death in the United States. The LEAP 1 study, the first of two pivotal late-stage studies being conducted with lefamulin, met the FDA’s primary endpoint of non-inferiority compared to moxifloxacin with or without adjunctive linezolid for early clinical response. The European Medicines Agency’s (‘EMA”) criteria were also met. Nabriva is looking to position lefamulin as a first-line empiric monotherapy. The second pivotal study is currently enrolling with topline results expected next year in spring. Positive results would allow the company to file for FDA approval in the second half of 2018. Nabriva has gained 54.2% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 15.6% rally (Read more: Nabriva's Lefamulin Positive in Pivotal Study, Stock Surges).No FDA Advisory Panel Meeting for BioMarin Drug: BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN  -  Free Report), known for its strong presence in the market for serious and life-threatening rare disorders, said that the FDA is not looking to hold an advisory panel meeting for the company’s Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for pegvaliase. BioMarin is looking to get pegvaliase approved for the reduction of blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in adult patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) who have uncontrolled blood Phe levels on existing management. Pegvaliase is currently under priority review with a response from the FDA expected by Feb 28, 2018. However, this could well be pushed out by three months as the agency has asked BioMarin for additional Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (“CMC”) information (Read more: BioMarin Says FDA Not Planning an AdCom for Pegvaliase BLA).TESARO’s Zejula a Step Closer to EU Nod: Cancer-focused TESARO (TSRO  -  Free Report) got some good news with the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issuing a positive opinion for Zejula (niraparib) as a monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Given the positive opinion, chances of gaining EU approval look high. Approval would make Zejula the first oral, once-daily PARP 1/2 inhibitor in Europe for use in patients regardless of BRCA mutation or biomarker status. Zejula is already approved in the United States (Read more: TESARO Ovarian Cancer Drug Zejula Gets Positive CHMP Opinion).AbbVie/Roche Cancer Drug Positive in Late-Stage Study: AbbVie and partner Roche are looking to expand the label of their cancer therapy, Venclexta/Venclyxto and results from a late-stage study (MURANO) should help in these efforts. Venclexta plus Rituxan met the primary endpoint of prolonged progression-free survival compared with Treanda (bendamustine) plus Rituxan in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (“CLL”) in the MURANO study.  An independent data monitoring committee has recommended the unblinding of the study based on the positive results. Label expansion for this indication will expand the patient population for Venclexta significantly and boost its commercial potential (Read more: Roche Announces Positive Data on Leukemia Drug).Halozyme Signs Deals, Raises View: Halozyme Therapeutics’s (HALO  -  Free Report) shares shot up with the company announcing deals with Roche and Bristol-Myers Squibb for its ENHANZE drug-delivery technology and raising its outlook for the year. Under the Roche agreement, Halozyme stands to receive $30 million upfront and up to $160 million on the achievement of specified development, regulatory and sales-based milestones. The company will also receive tiered, mid-single digit royalties on sales of commercialized products.The Bristol-Myers deal will see the company getting $105 million upfront plus future milestone and royalty payments. Based on these two licensing deals, Halozyme upped its revenue guidance by $130 million and expects to exit the year with a cash balance of $380 million to $395 million, $135 million more from its previous guidance (Read more: Bristol-Myers Collaborates With Halozyme for ENHANZE).Halozyme is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index was down 1.6% over the last five trading sessions.

2206,ABBV,"Roche Holdings AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced positive results from the phase III study, MURANO.The study evaluated Venclexta in combination with Rituxan in patients suffering from relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Data showed that the study met its primary endpoint as the results depicted a statistically significant improvement in the time patients lived without their disease progressing or progression-free survival (PFS), when treated with Venclexta plus Rituxan compared to Treanda plus Rituxan.We note that Roche is developing Venclexta in collaboration with AbbVie, Inc (ABBV  -  Free Report). Both the companies are commercializing the drug in the United States while AbbVie will commercialize outside the country.We remind investors that the FDA approved Venclexta in April 2016 for the treatment of people with CLL, who have received at least one prior therapy, with 17p deletion, as detected by an FDA-approved test. The FDA also granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Venclexta in combination with Rituxan for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CLL based on promising results from the phase Ib M13-365 study.The company is conducting MURANO study to convert the current accelerated approval of Venclexta to a full approval. Data from this study will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and submitted to global health authorities.As per estimates, there will be more than 20,000 new cases of CLL diagnosed in the United States in 2017. CLL is the most common type of adult leukemia. Hence, a potential approval for this indication will boost sales potential.Roche’s hematology portfolio includes approved drugs like MabThera/Rituxan, Gazyva, Tecentriq, and Venclexta along with pipeline candidates, polatuzumab vedotin/RG7596) and a small molecule antagonist of MDM2 (idasanutlin/RG7388).Last week, the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on a phase Ib and phase I/II b trials evaluating immuno-oncology drug, Tecentriq due to safety issues. A partial hold was put due to emerging safety data from clinical trials evaluating Merck & Co. (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda in combination with Celgene Corp.’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Revlimid and Pomalyst. We note that the FDA had put a hold on several trials in the FUSION program by Celgene. Roche’s stock has gained 13.6% compared with the industry’s gain of 19.4% in the year so far.Roche has a strong presence in the oncology market. The company dominates the breast cancer space due to the strong demand for its HER2 franchise drugs like Herceptin, Perjeta and Kadcyla. However, sales of Avastin and Tarceva continue to decline. Generic competition for Xeloda continues to hurt sales. Competition from biosimilars looms large on Roche's key drugs like Herceptin, Avastin and Rituxan.Zacks RankRoche currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2207,ABBV,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) announced that the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has granted a positive opinion recommending approval of its pipeline candidate, guselkumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in the EU.The drug was approved in the United States in July this year and is marketed by the trade name of Tremfya for the treatment of this immune system related skin disorder. A decision from the European Commission (EC) is expected later this year.So far this year, J&J’s share price has increased 16.7%, comparing favorably with a gain of 16.4% recorded by the industry it belongs to.The application in the EU was based on three studies – phase III VOYAGE 1, VOYAGE 2 and NAVIGATE – evaluating the efficacy and safety of guselkumab, an anti-IL-23 human monoclonal antibody, administered by subcutaneous injection for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.Data from the VOYAGE 2 trial (n=992) showed that significantly higher proportion of patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis treated with guselkumab achieved high rates of skin clearance compared to those receiving placebo. Around 70% of the patients receiving guselkumab achieved at least 90% clearer skin versus 2.4% on placebo.The VOYAGE 2 trial evaluated guselkumab versus AbbVie, Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug, Humira. The study demonstrated the statistically significant efficacy of guselkumab compared to Humira at week 16, which was maintained through 24 weeks of treatment. Almost 46.8% of the patients treated with Humira achieved at least 90% clearer skin versus 70% for guselkumab.The NAVIGATE (n=871) study evaluated the efficacy and safety of switching to guselkumab in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis patients who were not achieving clear or almost clear skin with J&J’s other plaque psoriasis medicine, Stelara. Data from the study showed that patients who switched to guselkumab showed significantly greater improvements in skin clearance compared with patients who continued to receive Stelara.Meanwhile, a phase III head-to-head study of Tremfya against Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Cosentyx for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis is ongoing. Also, a phase III study evaluating guselkumab in moderate-to-severely active psoriatic arthritis is also ongoing.J&J had previously mentioned that Tremfya has blockbuster potential and could rake in sales of more than $1 billion.J&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderA better-ranked biotech stock is Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

2208,ABBV,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) announced long-lasting skin clearance rates of Cosentyx in plaque psoriasis patients from a phase III study, which evaluated the drug for five years. Cosentyx is the first and only fully human IL-17A inhibitor to achieve sustained skin clearance rates over five years, reinforcing its long-term favorable impact.Data from the study showed that Cosentyx maintained 100% Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 and PASI 100, a measure of skin clearance, from year one to year five in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.Data from this study were presented at the 26th European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Congress in Geneva, Switzerland.Shares of the company have outperformed the industry, having surged 17.4% so far this year, while the industry increased 16%.The drug is approved in the United Sates for the treatment of adults with active ankylosing spondylitis, active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Since its launch, the drug has been prescribed to more than 100,000 patients. Cosentyx achieved blockbuster status in 2016, recording $1.1 billion in sales. In first-half 2017, it generated solid sales of $900 million.The long-term safety and efficacy data of the drug is expected to further boost its growth.Meanwhile, in the second quarter, the drug was granted approval in Europe for a label update to include 52-week data from the CLEAR study. It demonstrated the long-term superiority of Cosentyx compared to Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Stelara in psoriasis. Also, patient recruitment is underway for the new head-to-head clinical trial, EXCEED, to evaluate the superiority of Cosentyx versus AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira in PsA.Novartis expects the next growth phase to begin in 2018 driven by Cosentyx (in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis indications), Entresto, Kisqali and a deep pipeline with candidates like BAF312, AMG 334, RTH258. Moreover, the approval of Kymriah (CTL019) in August made Novartis the first company to bring CAR-T cell therapy to treat cancer. Going forward, we expect that the approval of new drugs and label expansion of existing ones to bode well for Novartis.Novartis AG Price and Consensus Novartis AG Price and Consensus | Novartis AG QuoteZacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderNovartis has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2209,ABBV,"AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) shares increased almost 2% after the company announced that its oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib (ABT-494), met primary endpoints in a phase III study for treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).In fact, AbbVie’s shares have rallied 38.9%, outperforming the industry’s 15.8% rise so far this year.The phase III SELECT-BEYOND study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study. It is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two doses (15 mg and 30 mg) of upadacitinib compared with placebo over 12 weeks in patients with moderate-to-severe RA, who are on a stable dose of conventional synthetic DMARDs and have had shown an inadequate response to the dosage.The study met its primary endpoints with highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful results for both the doses as compared to placebo. The trial’s primary endpoints were ACR20 responses and low disease activity (LDA).The results showed that 65% of patients, receiving 15 mg and 56% of patients, administered with 30 mg dose once daily of upadacitinib, achieved ACR20 responses after 12 weeks of treatment in comparison to 28% of patients receiving placebo.LDA was achieved by 43% and 42% of patients in the 15 mg and 30 mg dose arms, respectively, compared with 14% of patients receiving placebo. Additionally, the study met its secondary endpoints too.Notably, SELECT-BEYOND is the second out of the six ongoing phase III studies in the SELECT RA clinical trial program, conducted on upadacitinib.Other researches are also underway for upadacitinib for treating Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and atopic dermatitis.We remind investors that last week, the company announced upadacitinib to having met primary endpoints in a phase IIb study for atopic dermatitis. The company plans to advance the candidate into phase III studies next year for the given indication.We note that AbbVie already has a strong presence in the RA market with its blockbuster drug, Humira. However, several companies are working on developing biosimilar versions of Humira which could induce competition in the market for the company. Also, the RA market is extremely crowded including drugs like Johnson & Johnson’s Simponi and UCB’s Cimzia among others.Significantly, Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) JAK inhibitor, Olumiant, was recently approved in the EU and Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xeljanz is marketed in the United States for treating RA, which might pose a strong competition for upadacitinib on approval.Also, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) has already received approval to market a Humira biosimilar but the drug has not been launched yet due to ongoing litigation. If upadacitinib is approved, it may reduce the potential negative impact of Humira generics on AbbVie’s top line.AbbVie Inc. PriceAbbVie Inc. Price | AbbVie Inc.

2210,ABBV,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) along with partner Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy status to its experimental candidate, cemiplimab (REGN2810).Sanofi/Regeneron are looking to get cemiplimab, a checkpoint inhibitor targeting PD-1 (programmed death 1), approved for treating adults with advanced metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) type of skin cancer. The companies anticipate submitting a biologics license application (BLA) for cemiplimab to the FDA in the first quarter of 2018.The FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy designation aims to expedite the development and review of drugs, intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and provide access to patients as soon as possible.Significantly, shares of Regeneron have declined almost 6% despite the good news as AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced its skin treatment candidate upadacitinib to having met primary endpoints in phase IIb study which in turn might increase market competition for cemiplimab. However, shares of the company have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has surged 28.5% compared with the industry’s 15.7% rally during the period.We remind investors that in June, the companies reported positive, preliminary results from two expansion cohorts of phase I study (n=400), evaluating cemiplimab in patients with advanced CSCC. Data from the study showed that treatment with cemiplimab achieved an overall response rate (ORR) of 46.2% and a disease control rate (DCR) of 69.2%. The data was presented at the 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual meeting.Another phase II trial, EMPOWER-CSCC 1, is examining REGN2810 in metastatic CSCC and is currently in the enrolment phase. Additionally, a phase III study evaluating REGN2810 as a first-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer was initiated in the second quarter of 2017.Notably, cemiplimab is put under a joint development program by Regeneron and Sanofi, post a global collaboration agreement, entered in July 2015. Regeneron had also inked clinical study agreements with other pharmacy biggies namely, Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (INO  -  Free Report) and SillaJen, Inc. in the second quarter of 2017 to assess cemiplimab in combination with their respective cancer candidates.Per the company’s press release, CSCC is the second most common and deadliest skin cancer after melanoma in the United States. The disease is also responsible for most deaths among non-melanoma skin cancer patients. Although it is easier to apprehend the condition in early stages, it becomes quite difficult to treat the same once progressed to advanced stages. Hence, the candidate is expected to provide the company with access to a market promising huge potential.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

AbbVie is looking to get elagolix approved as an oral medicine for the management of pain associated with endometriosis.The NDA filing is supported by positive results from two replicate pivotal phase III trials evaluating elagolix, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist, in this indication. The detailed data from the study, presented in October last year, showed that treatment with elagolix resulted in statistically significant reductions in menstrual and non-menstrual pelvic pain associated with endometriosis compared to placebo. Data from the studies also demonstrated superiority compared to placebo in reducing painful intercourse associated with endometriosis.Endometriosis affects an estimated one in 10 women of reproductive age and is associated with pain symptoms. At present there is no cure for endometriosis. The pain associated with endometriosis is currently managed with oral contraceptives, progestins, danazol, NSAIDS, opioids, and GnRH agonists. Many of these medicines are not specifically indicated for the treatment of endometriosis.So far this year, AbbVie’s share price has increased 23%, comparing favorably with a gain of 11.8% recorded by the industry.Elagolix is also being evaluated in phase III studies for reducing heavy menstrual bleeding in premenopausal women with uterine fibroids.

2213,ABBV,"Investors in AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Oct 13, 2017 $89.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for AbbVie shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, AbbVie is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry that ranks in the Bottom 38% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, three analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.37 per share to $1.38 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about AbbVie right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

2215,ABBV,"Companies like Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Endocyte (ECYT  -  Free Report) were in the news with Amgen signing a deal with AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) related to the entry of its biosimilar version of Humira and Endocyte signing an in-licensing deal which could prove to be transformational for the company.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesEndocyte Soars on In-Licensing Deal: Endocyte’s shares have shot up a whopping 317% following the company’s announcement that it has got an exclusive worldwide license for PSMA-617 from ABX GmbH. Endocyte said that it will quickly move 177Lu-PSMA-617 into phase III development. 177Lu-PSMA-617 is a radioligand therapeutic (“RLT”) that targets the prostate-specific membrane antigen (“PSMA”) present in about 80% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).   The transformational deal provides Endocyte with the most advanced targeted radioligand therapy in development for prostate cancer, representing a market opportunity of more than $1 billion. The company hopes to start phase III development in the first half of 2018 and complete the program as early as 2020. The terms of the deal include a $12 million upfront payment as well as the issuance of 2 million shares to ABX plus a warrant for the purchase of up to 4 million additional shares of Endocyte common stock. ABX also stands to receive milestone payments of up to $160 million and tiered royalties starting in the mid-teens. Endocyte will bear all future development expenses (Read more: Endocyte Inks Deal For Prostate Cancer Candidate, Shares Up).AbbVie-Amgen Sign Deal Delaying Humira Biosimilar Entry: AbbVie has gained some breathing space by entering into a settlement agreement with Amgen related to biosimilar competition for AbbVie’s multi-billion dollar drug, Humira. Amgen, which gained FDA approval for Amjevita, its biosimilar version of Humira, has acknowledged the validity of AbbVie’s extensive intellectual property portfolio for Humira. According to the deal, the non-exclusive license for Humira will commence on Jan 31, 2023 in the United States and on different dates in other markets including Oct 16, 2018 in most countries in the EU. Amgen will also pay royalties.This agreement has removed a major overhang on AbbVie’s shares though the company is still facing a patent challenge from Boehringer Ingelheim, which gained approval for its biosimilar version of Humira, Cyltezo, in August.Humira generated sales of $8.8 billion in the first half of 2017 including $5.9 billion in the United States, which remains a key market for the drug. With Humira continuing to perform well, it will remain a major contributor to the top-line in the coming years. Moreover, the agreement gives AbbVie ample time to focus on developing its pipeline and launching new products that will help make up for the loss of revenues once biosimilar Humira enters the market. Expectations are high that AbbVie and Boehringer Ingelheim will announce a similar settlement agreement and dismiss all patent litigation.  While AbbVie is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, Amgen is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

Ablynx is currently seeking approval for caplacizumab in the EU and expects to submit a regulatory application in the United States in the first half of 2018. Caplacizumab has Fast Track designation in the United States for the treatment of aTTP and timely approval would make it the first therapeutic specifically indicated for the treatment of aTTP, an acute, life-threatening autoimmune blood clotting disorder.CytomX in Immuno-Oncology Deal with Amgen: CytomX Therapeutics (CTMX  -  Free Report) has entered into an immune-oncology focused strategic collaboration with Amgen for the development of a CytomX Probody T-cell engaging bispecific against the epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”).While early development will be led by CytomX, Amgen will lead later development and commercialization. The companies will share global late-stage development costs. The deal will see CytomX getting an upfront payment of $40 million and issuing $20 million of common stock to Amgen. CytomX could also earn up to $455 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones for the EGFR program. Global commercial activities will be led by Amgen with CytomX having the option to opt into a profit share in the United States and receive tiered, double-digit royalties on net product sales outside the United States.The agreement also covers up to three additional, undisclosed targets. If Amgen decides to pursue all these targets, CytomX could get up to an additional $950 million in upfront and milestone payments and high single-digit to mid-double digit royalty payments. CytomX will also receive the rights to an undisclosed preclinical T-cell engaging bispecific program from Amgen for which it will make milestone and royalty payments on any resulting products under this arrangement. We expect investors to react favorably to this deal.Regeneron, Sanofi Eczema Drug Gets EU Nod: Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report) and partner Sanofi gained EU approval for their eczema treatment, Dupixent.

2216,ABBV,"AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) entered into a deal to evaluate the combination of AbbVie's investigational antibody drug conjugate, ABBV-399, and Bristol-Myers Squibb's immune-oncology drug, Opdivo (nivolumab), in c-Met overexpressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Currently, the combination is in a phase I study that evaluates the patients for second line treatment who have failed one prior line of chemotherapy. But the specific terms of the deal were not disclosed. Notably, AbbVie is the sponsor conducting the trial.AbbVie’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has been up 39.7% compared with the industry’s gain of 17% in the same time frame.We remind investors that Opdivo is approved for varied indications in the EU and the United States. The drug has also received approvals for several indications including melanoma, head and neck, lung, kidney and blood cancer.ABBV-399 is an anti-c-Met antibody drug conjugate that targets both MET-amplified and c-Met-overexpressing tumors. It is currently being developed to treat advanced solid tumors.In fact, Opdivo continues to be launched globally on approvals and label expansions. Label expansion into additional indications would give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug, significantly.  Markedly, Opdivo is being studied in combination with Bristol-Myers’ other drug Yevroy.  In the melanoma indication, the Opdivo+Yervoy regimen is contributing to growth in both Opdivo and Yervoy. Also, the drug became the first PD-1 inhibitor to be approved for a hematological malignancy – classical Hodgkin lymphoma in the United States (May 2016) and the EU (November 2016).In the second quarter of 2017, Opdivo generated revenues of $1.19 billion, up 42% from the year-ago period.AbbVie Inc.

2217,ABBV,"Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced that Health Canada has granted a Notice of Compliance (NOC) for updated label of hepatitis C virus drug, Epclusa.The drug’s label has been expanded to extend the drug’s use for patients co-infected with HIV-1.The drug was approved in Canada in July 2016 for the treatment of adults with genotype 1-6 chronic HCV infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, or with decompensated cirrhosis in combination with ribavirin.We expect the drug’s sales to increase with this label expansion as HCV co-infection remains a major cause of morbidity in HIV-infected individuals.Last month, Health Canada granted a NOC for single-tablet regimen, Vosevi (sofosbuvir 400 mg/velpatasvir 100 mg/voxilaprevir 100 mg), for chronic HCV infection.Gilead is known for its presence in the HCV market, courtesy of its blockbuster HCV drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni. The HCV portfolio received a huge a boost when Epclusa gained approval in both the United States (June 2016) and EU (July 2016) and became the first and only all-oral, pan-genotypic, STR consisting of Sovaldi and velpatasvir (an NS5A inhibitor), for the treatment of adults with genotype 1-6 chronic HCV infection. The approval of Vosevi is expected to boost Gilead’s strong HCV portfolio further.However, the HCV franchise is under pressure due to competition and pricing issues. We note that Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa, face competition from AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR among others. Competition as well as pricing pressure intensified further with the launch of Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zepatier. Gilead’s stock has gained 17.5% year to date against the industry’s 17.3%.Gilead recently announced plans to acquire Kite Pharma, Inc.  to foray in the emerging field of cell therapy. Kite is a pioneer in cell therapy having developed engineered cell therapies that express either a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or an engineered T-cell receptor (TCR), depending on the type of cancer. The acquisition will diversify Gilead’s portfolio and poise the company in a dominant position in cellular therapy space. We note that investors were expecting Gilead to announce an acquisition in the near term given the decline in the once lucrative HCV market due to competitive pressure.Zacks RankGilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

With these efforts, the company expects to generate annual pre-tax savings of about $250 million by 2019. Savings will be used for growth opportunities and optimization. Alexion is guiding toward operating margin growth of 50% in 2019 and expects to reinvest about $100 million every year in R&D starting from 2018.  Alexion is focusing on growing and maximizing its presence in the rare disease business. Core areas of focus include hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders. As a result of the restructuring, the company expects to incur pre-tax costs of about $340 million - $440 million of which $240 million - $300 million will be recorded this year.Alexion is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. The company has gained 17.8% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 15.9% rally.Regeneron/Sanofi Asthma Drug Positive in Phase III: Regeneron and partner Sanofi announced positive top-line results from a late-stage study on Dupixent (dupilumab) for uncontrolled persistent asthma.  Dupixent was found to reduce severe asthma attacks and improve lung function. While overall results were good, less activity was observed in patients with lower eosinophilic cells. Regeneron and Sanofi intend to file for FDA approval by year end. The asthma market is huge with about one million people in the United States living with uncontrolled, persistent asthma despite being treated with standard therapies. Dupixent, which has blockbuster potential, is currently approved for eczema and is being evaluated for additional indications like pediatric atopic dermatitis, nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis (Read more: Regeneron/Sanofi's Dupixent Asthma Study Meets Endpoints).AbbVie’s Upadacitinib Positive in Studies: AbbVie came out with positive data with the company saying that its experimental oral JAK1-selective inhibitor, upadacitinib (ABT-494), met all primary and ranked secondary endpoints in a late-stage study for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (Read more: AbbVie's RA Candidate Meets Primary Endpoint in Phase III). The company also presented promising data on upadacitinib for atopic dermatitis or eczema from a phase IIb study (Read more: AbbVie's Upadacitinib Meets Primary Endpoint in Phase IIb). Upadacitinib is being evaluated for additional indications including psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis.Intercept Hit by “Dear Doctor” Letter: Intercept Pharmaceuticals’s (ICPT  -  Free Report) shares were down on a “Dear Doctor” letter issued by the company related to the use of its sole marketed product, Ocaliva. The letter lays emphasis on the use of the recommended dosage on the label as liver injury, liver decompensation, liver failure, and death were reported when Ocaliva was dosed more frequently than recommended. Ocaliva, approved in May 2016 for primary biliary cholangitis (“PBC”) in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B and C), brought in sales of $30.4 million in the second quarter of 2017. While Intercept’s shares were down 16.1%, the company said on a recent call that it does not expect any label changes or a boxed warning.Sage Drug Disappoints in Late-Stage Study: Sage Therapeutics’s (SAGE  -  Free Report) shares were down 13.7% on disappointing top-line data from a late-stage study on brexanolone (SAGE-547) for treatment super-refractory status epilepticus (“SRSE”). The study failed to meet the primary endpoint. Brexanolone is currently in late-stage development for the treatment of postpartum depression (“PPD”).Kura Soars on Promising Cancer Study Data: Kura’s shares jumped more than 70% on positive topline results from a mid-stage study on its lead pipeline candidate, tipifarnib, in patients with HRAS mutant relapsed or refractory squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (“HNSCC”). The primary endpoint was achieved before the completion of enrollment.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index gained 0.6% over the last five trading sessions.

2220,ABBV,"AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) shares have increased more than 6% after the company announced that its oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib (ABT-494), met primary endpoints in a phase IIb study for treatment of adult patients with atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema. The company plans to advance the candidate into phase III studies next year.AbbVie’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has surged 30.6% compared with the industry’s 14.5% rally during the period.The phase IIb, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three doses (30 mg, 15 mg and 7.5 mg once-daily) of upadacitinib in patients with the aforementioned indication. The study met its primary endpoints across all dose groups with highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful results compared with placebo.The study’s primary outcome was the mean percentage change in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, a tool used to measure the extent of disease severity. In the trial, upadacitinibshowed greater mean percentage change from baseline in EASI score compared with placebo at 16 weeks. Also, 50% of patients receiving 30 mg once-daily dose of upadacitinib showed almost clear skin. Additionally, the study met secondary endpoints, demonstrating a significant reduction in skin-itching.Upadacitinib is also being investigated in six phase III studies for rheumatoid arthritis. Other researches are also underway for treatment of Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and psoriatic arthritis.Per National Eczema Association, around 31.6 million people in the United States have some form of atopic dermatitis. Of them, 4.1 million children are affected by the disease. Hence, approval of the drug will provide the company with access to a huge patient population suffering from the disease in the United States.Notably in March, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) along with partner Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) had launched Dupixent (dupilumab) Injection for treating atopic dermatitis. Thus, upadacitinib awaits a combat against competitive pressure in the market, once approved.AbbVie Inc. PriceAbbVie Inc. Price | AbbVie Inc.

2222,ABBV,"Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the U.S. preceded only by heart disease.The traditional cancer treatments include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. However, immunotherapy, gene therapy and other new novel therapies are being developed to improve, supplement or replace traditional cancer treatments with the target to reduce or remove cancerous growths.According to a report by the American Cancer Society, almost 1.7 million new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed in 2017, which creates significant need for effective cancer medication. It goes without saying that all big pharma companies are gearing up to develop and bring innovative cancer treatments to market as well as expand the labels of their marketed oncology drugs. These pharma/biotech giants have significant financial resources at their disposal and have even collaborated to pool their resources and technology.Here we discuss four pharma giants, which possess the industry’s strongest oncology pipeline portfolios.AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report)AstraZeneca is working on strengthening its oncology product portfolio and has several candidates in its pipeline. The company’s target is to launch at least six new oncology medicines between 2014 and 2020, including Lynparza, Tagrisso and Imfinzi, which are already approved and marketed.An interesting candidate in the company’s immuno-oncology pipeline is Imfinzi (durvalumab) being evaluated for multiple cancers (either alone or in combination with other regimens), including phase III trials in combination with tremelimumab in first-line urothelial cancer, NSCLC, small cell lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) among others. Imfinzi was launched in the U.S. for the first indication – second line advanced bladder cancer - in May 2017.Other phase III oncology candidates in AstraZeneca’s pipeline include acalabrutinib (blood cancers.), moxetumomab pasudotox (leukaemia), selumetinib (thyroid cancer) and savolitinib (kidney cancer).Lynparza, presently marketed for advanced ovarian cancer, is also in different studies for a range of tumor types including breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers as well as earlier-line settings for ovarian cancer. Tagrisso is also being evaluated in earlier-line settings for lung cancer.AstraZeneca carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.So far this year, AstraZeneca’s shares have moved up 10%, comparing unfavorably to a 12.3% increase for the large-cap pharma industry.Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report)Pfizer’s newly approved immunotherapy, Bavencio, is being considered a significant top-line driver for this New York-based pharma giant.Bavencio/avelumab received FDA approval for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in March 2017 and for advanced bladder cancer in May. Bavencio is under review in the EU for MCC with a decision expected in the third quarter of 2017. Pfizer is focusing on continuously growing and expanding Bavencio into new indications and markets globally.Pfizer has also initiated avelumab double/triple combination studies for chemotherapy and targeted therapies and has 11 avelumab combination therapies with immuno-oncology agents under development.Pfizer’s two other oncology candidates have also been approved by the FDA recently – Besponsa - for relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia in August and Mylotarg for new or relapsed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia in September. Other cancer candidates in Pfizer’s pipeline include talazoparib (advanced breast cancer) and dacomitinib (advanced NSCLC with EGFR activating mutations).Pfizer is also aggressively working on expanding the labels of approved cancer drugs like Ibrance and Xalkori.Pfizer also carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). So far this year, Pfizer’s shares have moved up 4.1%.AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report)AbbVie is working on expanding and accelerating its presence in oncology and building upon its growing position in hematological oncologyAbbVie’s Imbruvica, currently approved for several cancer indications, has multi-billion dollar potential and AbbVie is exploring the potential to expand Imbruvica’s label into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. AbbVie is positioning Imbruvica as a “pipeline in a molecule” - the treatment is in several company-sponsored studies.With the 2016 acquisition of cancer drugmaker, Stemcentrx AbbVie gained a late-stage candidate, rovalpituzumab tesirine or Rova-T, four additional early-stage compounds in solid tumor indications and a significant portfolio of pre-clinical assets. Rova-T is currently in registrational studies for small cell lung cancer (SCLC). A phase I, eight-arm ""basket study"" on Rova-T in neuroendocrine tumors is also ongoing. According to AbbVie, the candidate has blockbuster potential and could be launched in 2018. AbbVie intends to study the candidate for additional indications and estimates peak sales close to $5 billion.AbbVie is also studying marketed cancer drug Venclyxto/Venclexta to expand the label to address the broader relapsed/refractory CLL patient population, expand into earlier lines of therapy, and broaden into other hematologic malignancies.AbbVie also carries a Zacks Rank #3. So far this year, AbbVie’s shares have moved up 20.2%.Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report)Bristol-Myers PD-1 inhibitor, Opdivo, has been performing impressively while Bristol-Myers is working on expanding the label of Opdivo further, alone or in combination therapies with Yervoy and other anti-cancer agents.Further, Bristol-Myers’ cancer portfolio includes multiple myeloma drug, Empliciti and leukemia drug, Sprycel, contributing to the top line. In addition, Bristol-Myers is evaluating other immune system pathways for the treatment of cancer. These pathways may help the company bring to market potentially transformational immunotherapies – in combination or as monotherapy – to help fight different types of cancers.Bristol-Myers also carries a Zacks Rank #3. So far this year, Bristol-Myers’ shares have moved up 2.3%.Others Not Far BehindMerck (MRK  -  Free Report) is also conducting numerous studies to evaluate its highly successful anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 550 studies, including more than 300 combination studies.Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) dominates the breast cancer space with strong demand for its HER2 franchise drugs like Herceptin, Perjeta and Kadcyla. Apart from its strong breast cancer franchise, Roche’s oncology portfolio also boasts of lung cancer drugs like Avastin and Tarceva, immuno-oncology drugs like Tecentriq and newly approved multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus. Label expansion efforts are ongoing for all these cancer drugs.Swiss drugmaker Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) also boasts many experimental cancer drugs in its R&D pipeline including a couple of biosimilar versions of popular cancer drugs. Novartis' cancer pipeline was bolstered by the deal to buy most of Glaxo's (GSK  -  Free Report) oncology portfolio in 2014.Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) also laid out its oncology strategy at its Q2 call held in July, which involves building on key treatments like Cyramza, Lartruvo and abemaciclib as foundational agents while focusing on developing new standard-of-care changing therapies and combination regimens, including immuno-therapies.ConclusionCompetition in the cancer market is fierce and not all pipeline candidates will be successful. However, pharma biggies have enough late-stage cancer programs in their portfolios and there are chances of quite a few rollouts in the coming years.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

2223,ABBV,"Biotech giant Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced that it will buy Kite Pharma, Inc.  to foray into the emerging field of cell therapy.Terms of the Agreement As per the agreement, Gilead will pay $180.00 per share in cash at a transaction valued at approximately $11.9 billion. The price represents a 28% premium over the closing share price of Kite as of Aug 25, 2017.The transaction was approved by shareholders of both companies and is expected to close by the fourth quarter of 2017. The acquisition is expected to be neutral to the bottom line by the third year and accretive thereafter.Strategic BenefitWe note that Kite is a pioneer in cell therapy having developed engineered cell therapies that express either a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or an engineered T cell receptor (TCR), depending on the type of cancer. The most advanced therapy candidate in Kite’s pipeline is axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) which is being developed for the treatment of refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which includes diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL) and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). The Biologics License Application (BLA) for the candidate was submitted in Mar 2017.This CAR T therapy is currently under priority review in the United States and the FDA is expected to give a decision on Nov 29, 2017. The candidate is also under review in the EU with a tentative approval expected in 2018. While Kite is prepared for a commercial launch in the United States as manufacturing preparation are complete, the company is currently building infrastructure in Europe. We remind investors that another pipeline candidate in clinical trials in both hematologic cancers and solid tumors is KITE-585, a CAR T therapy candidate that targets BCMA expressed in multiple myeloma.Our TakeThe acquisition will diversify Gilead’s portfolio and position the company in a dominant position in cellular therapy space.We note that investors were expecting Gilead to announce an acquisition in the near term given the decline in the once lucrative hepatitis C (HCV) market due to competitive pressure. Gilead is known for its presence in the HCV market because of its blockbuster HCV drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni. However, the HCV franchise is under pressure because of competition and pricing issues.We note that Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa face competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR, among others. Moreover, Gilead was sitting on $21.1 billion of cash and short-term marketable securities. Hence, an acquisition announcement was lurking.CAR T is manufactured for each individual patient using their own cells thereby making it different from typical small molecule or biologic therapies. During the treatment process, T cells are drawn from a patient's blood. These cells are then reprogrammed in the manufacturing facility to create T cells that are genetically coded to express a chimeric antigen receptor to recognize and fight cancer cells and other Bcells expressing a specific antigen.While the deal might look expensive given the premium Gilead paid for Kite, the CAR T space is expected to be revolutionary in treatments for cancer.  The CAR T space represents immense potential at this juncture and a potential approval of axi-cell will be a significant boost for Gilead’s prospects which has dampened of late.Gilead’s stock has declined 4.3% in the year so far, against the industry’s 9.3%.Apart from Kite, Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) is another company that is focussed on CAR T treatments.  In July, the FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) unanimously recommended the approval of immunocellular therapy candidate CTL019 (tisagenlecleucel) and a decision is expected shortly (September-October).CTL019 could become the first CAR T cell therapy if approved. CTL019, an investigational CAR-T therapy, is being evaluated for the treatment of relapsed or refractory (r/r) pediatric and young adult patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A potential approval will also open new frontiers in the treatment of cancer by advancing immunocellular therapy for children and young adults with r/r B-cell ALL.On the other hand, shares of Kite were up 28% on the news as the company will immensely benefit from Gilead’s dominant position in the biotech space upon an anticipated approval for its lead candidate. In fact, this year so far, Kite Pharma’s stock is up 297.1%, which compares favorably with a 9.3% increase registered by the industry.Zacks RankGilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

We remind investors that priority review is given to those drugs which the FDA believes have the potential to provide significant improvements in the safety and effectiveness of the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a serious disease.We note that Gazyva in combination with chlorambucil is approved for patients suffering from previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).A potential approval in follicular lymphoma is expected to boost sales further.The drug is also being evaluated with other approved or investigational medicines, including cancer immunotherapies and small molecule inhibitors.Roche’s stock has gained 11.0% against the industry’s 10.8% gain.Roche’s hematology portfolio at present consists of MabThera/Rituxan, Gazyva/Gazyvaro and VenclextaTM/VenclyxtoTM in collaboration with AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) along with a pipeline which has a small molecule antagonist of MDM2 (idasanutlin/RG7388) and polatuzumab vedotin.The company also has a hemophilia A candidate, emicizumab, in its pipeline. Last week, the FDA granted emicizumab prophylaxis (preventative) priority review as a once-weekly subcutaneous treatment for adults, adolescents and children with hemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors. The FDA is expected to announce its final decision by Feb 23, 2018.

2225,ABBV,"Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced that Health Canada has granted a Notice of Compliance for its single-tablet regimen, Vosevi (sofosbuvir 400 mg/velpatasvir 100 mg/voxilaprevir 100 mg), for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.Vosevi has been approved for the treatment of HCV infection in adults with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 previously treated with an NS5A inhibitor-containing regimen, or with genotype 1, 2, 3 or 4 previously treated with sofosbuvir-containing regimen without an NS5A inhibitor. The drug is already approved in the U.S.Gilead is known for its presence in the HCV market because of its blockbuster HCV drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni. The HCV portfolio received a huge a boost when Epclusa gained approval in both the U.S. (Jun 2016) and EU (Jul 2016) to become the first and only all-oral, pan-genotypic, STR consisting of Sovaldi and velpatasvir (an NS5A inhibitor), for the treatment of adults with genotype 1-6 chronic HCV infection. The approval of Voseviwill further boost Gilead’s strong HCV portfolio.However, the HCV franchise is under pressure as a result of competition and pricing issues. We note that Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa, face competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR and Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Daklinza among others. Competition as well as pricing pressure intensified further with the launch of Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zepatier. Gilead’s stock has moved up 1.0% in the year so far compared with the industry’s gain of 7.3%.Meanwhile, the HIV franchise maintains momentum driven by the rapid adoption of TAF-based regimens in the U.S. and EU, which now represent 51% of total prescription volume. Genvoya is now the company’s bestselling HIV product with a treatment-naïve patient share of 41%. Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting is expected to further boost sales.

2226,ABBV,"Lately, the MedTech space has been facing the brunt of frequent regulatory changes. While the Trump administration is faced with a socio-economic upheaval, investors are apprehensive about its impact on stocks.Historic trends suggest that investor sentiments have always been partially inclined toward fancy brand names in a volatile economic backdrop. As a result, companies with a solid brand value and robust fundamentals generally enjoy a smooth sail even during political turbulence.One such bigwig from the MedTech space is Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report), which has greatly evolved over the recent years. The company has pursued a slew of mergers and divestments, and has also seen solid growth in its Diabetics business. Among its strategic buyouts, the acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals, Tendyne Holdings, and St. Jude Medical are worth mentioningAfter spinning off its proprietary pharmaceutical products division in 2013 to form AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report), Abbott has gained traction in the Established Pharmaceuticals Division. Since then, revenues have seen a CAGR of 7.6% over the last three years. Over this period, the company has more or less reported strong quarterly numbers, indicating fundamental strength.Shares Lack LusterHowever, the share price performance of Abbott has been disappointing over the same time frame. The company represents a meager return of just 19.2%, lower than the broader industry’s gain of 22.3% and the S&P 500’s return of 23.3% over the same time frame.Of the main issues plaguing Abbott, foreign exchange is a major headwind. The strengthening of the euro and some other developed market currencies have constantly hampered the company’s performance in international markets. Abbott currently expects currency exchange to have a negative impact of around 1% on sales in 2017.Apart from this, the business environment continues to be challenging across the globe. Slow growth in the nutrition business in China and economic problems in Venezuela are expected to remain unresolved for some time, dampening the company’s top-line growth.Bleak ProspectsWhile Abbott boasts solid fundamentals, the company’s prospects are dull. We note that the company promises long-term earnings growth of just 10.7%, lower than the broader industry’s estimated growth rate of 13%. Furthermore, Abbott’s revenues have declined 10.7% in the last five years compared to the broader industry’s revenue growth of 6.1%.Secondly, Abbott’s historical cash-flow growth has been extremely low at -14.3%, comparing unfavorably with the broader industry’s positive growth of 5.7%. These unfavorable growth metrics are indicative of the fact that despite a solid brand value, Abbott might not prove to be a lucrative pick for the long haul.4 Growth Stocks in FocusThe long-term growth parameters are not in favor of Abbott, as it holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) now. So instead of opting for brand values, let’s take a look at the following four not-so-fancy MedTech stocks that are expected to gain over the long haul. Apart from flaunting a strong Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), these stocks promise a long-term expected growth rate of 15% or higher, comparing favorably with the broader industry. We also have taken a Growth Style Score of A or B into consideration.Our Growth Style Score highlights all of the vital metrics of the company’s financials to obtain a clearer picture of the quality and sustainability of its growth.

2229,ABBV,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced that its pan-genotypic regimen of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P), Mavyret, has been approved of in Canada for treating chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection across all major genotypes (GT1-6).It is important to note that the ribavirin-free Mavyret recently gained an approval in  the United States and the EU. The combination medicine is under priority review in Japan for the same indication.AbbVie’s shares have marginally outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has rallied 11.5% compared with the broader industry’s increase of 9.8%.The approval in Canada was backed by data from nine registration studies in AbbVie’s G/P clinical development program. The clinical trials were conducted on more than 2,300 patients across major HCV genotypes. Data from these studies showed that eight weeks of treatment with G/P achieved 97% cure rates across all major genotypes of chronic HCV.Significantly, glecaprevir (GLE) is a potent protease inhibitor while pibrentasvir (PIB) is a new NS5A inhibitor. Glecaprevir was discovered under a collaboration agreement with Enanta Pharmaceuticals (ENTA  -  Free Report) for HCV protease inhibitors.Per the company’s press release, three million Canadians are chronically infected with HCV. More than 10,000 new cases of hepatitis C were reported in 2012 with approximately 40% of patients estimated to be unaware of the disease. Also, while GT1 is the most common genotype in Canada, GT3 is the most difficult to treat and cure. Hence, the drug’s approval is expected to provide the company access to a market with huge potential.We remind investors that Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) launched Epclusa, the first all-oral, pan-genotypic, single tablet regimen for treating adults with genotype 1-6 HCV infection in the United States and the EU last year. This could lend a strong competition to Mavyret.To those not informed, Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) is also evaluating an all-oral triple combination therapy MK-3682B, a mix of MK-3682, grazoprevir and ruzasvir1, for treatment of chronic HCV genotype (GT) infection.Pricing pressure in the HCV market is increasing. The company said that it experienced market share loss and price erosion due to competitive dynamics within the HCV arena. This downturn continues this year with Viekira (HCV treatment) sales expected to decline to $1 billion in 2017.AbbVie Inc. PriceAbbVie Inc. Price | AbbVie Inc.

The FDA has set a target action date under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) of Feb 12, 2018.A marketing application for BIC/FTC/TAF is also under review in the European Union, and was validated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in July.A potential approval is expected toboost Gilead’s HIV portfoliofurther.Gilead is a dominant player in the HIV market with an impressive portfolio for the same.The newly launched TAF-based products Genvoya, Odefsey and Descovy are performing well with strong adoption in both the U.S. and EU. Genvoya has already become the most-prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients since its launch in Nov 2015. The TAF-based regimens now represent 51% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and Odefsey and Descovy in 2016. Genvoya is now the company’s bestselling HIV product, surpassing both Truvada and Atripla since fourth-quarter 2016. Genvoya is now the company’s bestselling HIV product with a treatment-naïve patient share of 41%.Gilead expects use of Truvada for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to continue boosting sales of HIV franchise going forward, particularly in the U.S. Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting should also boost sales as the company saw a significant uptick in PrEP usage in 2017 with an estimated 136,000 patients using Truvada by the end of the second quarter.Meanwhile, Gilead’s stock has gained only 1.1% in the year so far, against the industry’s gain of 6.1%.The uptake in HIV franchise should help the company combat the persistent decline in HCV franchise due to competitive pressure. The HCV business saw some improvement in the second quarter. The HCV franchise was boosted by the FDA approval of Vosevi. HCV patient starts in the first half were better than expectations but should see a gradual decline in the second half due to increased competition.Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa has being facing competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Daklinza.

The advisory panel, which had voted 12 to 1 in favor of the safety data for Heplisav-B, had commented on the design of Dynavax's proposed post-marketing study. Based on this, the company and the FDA agreed that more time is needed to finalize key details of the post-marketing study. As a result, the FDA action date was pushed back by three months to Nov 10, 2017. The company still expects to launch Heplisav-B in the U.S. in early 2018. Dynavax’s shares are up a whopping 372.2% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 9.7% rally.AbbVie’s New HCV Treatment Gets FDA Nod: AbbVie’s 8-week, pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, once-daily hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment, Mavyret, gained FDA approval for use in HCV patients without cirrhosis and who are new to treatment. With this approval, competition in the HCV market is going to heat up further. According to AbbVie, Mavyret may be used in up to 95% of HCV patients, depending on the stage of liver disease and prior treatment history. The company said that about 3.4 million Americans are chronically infected with HCV. Mavyret gained EU approval recently.FibroGen Hits 52-Week High on IPF Drug Data: FibroGen’s (FGEN  -  Free Report) shares shot up 48.2% on positive data on the company’s investigational idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) drug, pamrevlumab, from a mid-stage study as well as two combination safety sub-studies.

2232,ABBV,"Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (INFI  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 34 cents per share in second-quarter 2017, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of 22 cents. The company had reported a loss of 12 cents in the year-ago quarter.Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteSince Infinity does not have any approved product in its portfolio, the company earns revenues in the form of royalties, license and milestone payments as well as research and development (R&D) support fees paid by its partners.Infinity did not record any revenues during second-quarter 2017. However, it recorded collaboration revenues of $9.5 million in the year-ago quarter, related to Infinity's previous collaboration agreement with AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report).Infinity’s share price has increased 0.7% year to date compared with the industry’s gain of 1.0%.Quarter in DetailIn the reported quarter, R&D expenses plummeted to $3.9 million from $52.9 million. The decline was mainly related to a decrease in clinical development expenses for duvelisib in addition to the company's 2016 restructuring activities.General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $6.2 million for the reported quarter, down from $15.7 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was mainly due to the company's 2016 restructuring activities.2017 Outlook ReiteratedInfinity expects net loss to be in the range of $40–$50 million in 2017. The company anticipates ending 2017 with year-end cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities balance in the $40–$50 million band. Moreover, Infinity expects that its existing cash and cash equivalents as of Jun 30, 2017, should be adequate to fund the company's capital needs into the first-quarter 2019.Pipeline UpdateCurrently, Infinity is evaluating IPI-549 as a monotherapy and in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo (nivolumab) in a phase I study in patients with advanced solid tumors.The company completed an evaluation of escalating monotherapy doses of IPI-549 ranging from 10 – 60 mg QD once daily and has determined the 60 mg dose for evaluation in the expansion component of the study. The selection of the mentioned dose was based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic analyses, which showed that IPI-549 maintained full suppression of PI3K-gamma at this dose level.Further, data from the study also showed that the IPI-549 dosed at 60 mg QD was well tolerated, and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Subsequently, the monotherapy expansion component of the study is now available for enrolment. The study will evaluate the safety and activity of IPI-549 dosed at 60 QD in approximately 25 patients.Meanwhile, dose escalation evaluating IPI-549 in combination with Opdivo is currently ongoing. The company plans to initiate the combination expansion component of the study in the second half of 2017.On the other hand, the company amended its license agreement with Takeda Oncology in Jul 2017 for IPI-549. Per the amended agreement, the company will no longer have an obligation to pay Takeda future royalties on worldwide net sales of selective inhibitors of PI3K-gamma, including IPI-549. In lieu, Infinity issued unsecured convertible notes of $6.0 million to Takeda that mature in 2018 and accrues interest at an annual rate of 8%.Our TakeThe wider-than-expected loss in the second quarter was disappointing. Infinity received a huge setback when AbbVie terminated their collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of duvelisib. Hence, we expect investor focus on pipeline progress in the upcoming quarters.Zacks Rank & Key PickInfinity currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Gilead Sciences.

Companies like Gilead and Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) also provided regulatory updates. Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesA Look at Q2 Earnings Results: Gilead’s results were strong with the company’s HIV franchise putting in a strong performance and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) franchise performing better than expected. The company raised its revenue outlook including for the HCV franchise (Read more: Gilead Tops Q2 Earnings & Revenue Estimates, Stock Up).

The approval came ahead of the FDA action date of Aug 30, 2017.This makes Idhifa the first and only FDA-approved therapy for this patient population, which represents 8 – 19% of AML patients, as per information provided by the companies. More than 21,000 new cases of AML are detected every year in the U.S. with the majority of patients seeing their disease relapse eventually. The prognosis for R/R AML is poor with overall survival for this patient population estimated to be less than six months. Although Idhifa comes with a boxed warning regarding differentiation syndrome, uptake should be strong given the significant unmet medical need.Will it be Third Time Lucky for Dynavax’s Heplisav-B? Dynavax’s (DVAX  -  Free Report) shares shot up on a favorable recommendation (12-1) from the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) for Heplisav-B, a vaccine for immunization against hepatitis B infection in adults.

With this label expansion, Vertex upped its 2017 sales guidance for the drug to $770 million - $800 million (old guidance: $740 - $770 million). Vertex now expects total CF product revenues of $1.87 billion - $2.1 billion (old guidance: $1.84 - $2.07 billion), including Orkambi sales of $1.1 billion - $1.3 billion (unchanged).Regulatory Updates from Amgen and Gilead: Amgen provided quite a few regulatory updates over the last few days. The company said that it has submitted a regulatory application in the U.S. seeking label expansion for Prolia for the treatment of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP). Prolia brought in sales of $930 million in the first half of 2017.Amgen along with partner Allergan also said that they have filed for FDA approval of ABP 980, a biosimilar candidate to Roche’s Herceptin (trastuzumab). Herceptin is approved for the treatment of HER2+ adjuvant breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer in the U.S.Meanwhile, Amgen’s PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha, got priority review in the U.S. for the inclusion of FOURIER cardiovascular outcomes study data on the reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events. A decision from the agency is expected on Dec 2, 2017. Amgen said that a second application for the expansion of the lipid-lowering indication to include additional patient populations studied was also accepted by the agency.Gilead also had some updates on the regulatory front.

The reported loss was, however, wider than the year-ago loss of 31 cents.Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteRevenues in the quarter improved 10.8% to $23.6 million and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.9 million.Momenta’s stock has rallied 6.3% year to date compared with the industry’s rally of 9.9%. Quarter in DetailMomenta’s top line comprises product revenues of $19.1 million earned from Sandoz’s sales of Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone (20 mg), compared with $20.7 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales deductions in the second quarter of 2016, as well as legal reimbursement in the second quarter of 2017.Collaborative research and development revenues came in at $4.4 million, down from $5.8 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline in revenues was mainly due to the termination of the Baxalta Collaboration Agreement, effective Dec 31, 2016.While, research and development expenses were up to $39.1 million from $33.2 million, general and administrative expenses increased 52% to $22.6 million.Outlook UpdatedMomenta now expects operating expenses (excluding stock-based compensation and net of collaborative revenues) in the range of $210–$230 million, compared with the previous guidance of $200–$240 million in 2017. The guidance also includes approximately $55 million of capital expenditure on M923. Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2017 are projected around $50–$60 million.Momenta expect to generate revenues of $45 million from Mylan N.V. (MYL  -  Free Report) as upfront payment on a quarterly basis. In Jul 2017, Momenta earned a $10 million milestone payment from Sandoz as Glatopa 20 mg continues to be the sole FDA-approved generic of Copaxone 20 mg.Pipeline UpdateSandoz’s abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for the 40-mg thrice-weekly formulation of Copaxone (Glatopa 40mg) was under the FDA review. However, Momenta suffered a setback with the FDA issuing a warning letter to Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) in Feb 2017, which is Sandoz’s contracted fill/finish manufacturing partner for Glatopa.Pfizer has submitted a comprehensive response to the observations cited in the warning letter. The ANDA approval is now contingent on the satisfactory resolution of the compliance observations stated in the warning letter issued to Pfizer.Meanwhile, Momenta continues to progress with its other pipeline candidates. Currently, Momenta’s M923, a biosimilar version of AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira, is being evaluated in a phase III study in patients suffering from moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Moving ahead, the company plans to submit the candidate for approval to regulatory bodies in the fourth quarter of 2017. Also, it expects first commercial launch of M923 to be as early as the 2020 timeframe.The company completed enrolment in the phase I study on M834, a biosimilar version of Orencia (abatacept) in Apr 2017 under its collaboration with Mylan. Top-line data from the study are expected in the second half of 2017.Furthermore, Momenta’s novel autoimmune portfolio includes: M230, a Selective Immunomodulator of Fc receptors (SIF3) and M281, an anti-FcRn monoclonal antibody. In Jan 2017, the company entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with CSL for M230 and potential future Fc multimer programs. The candidate is expected to enter clinic in 2017.Momenta successfully completed a phase I single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers for M281. The multiple ascending dose portion of the study was initiated in Jan 2017 (expected to be completed in Aug 2017) and data from the single and multiple ascending dose portions of the study are projected in the second half of 2017.Our TakeMomenta’s loss per share came in line with estimates in the second quarter of 2017 while sales beat estimates. The ANDA approval for Glatopa is contingent on the satisfactory resolution of the compliance observations stated in the warning letter issued by the FDA, resulting in a delay of approval. We expect the warning letter will remain a drag on the company's shares till the issue is solved.Nevertheless, sales of Glatopa 20mg continue to do well. Glatopa 20mg has captured approximately 40% of the market in the U.S. In addition, a potential approval of M923 will boost investor confidence.Zacks RankMomenta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2235,ABBV,"The FDA, which approved 22 treatments last year, has given its approval to 26 drugs so far in 2017 including 3 in July. Key approvals this year include Gilead’s Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron and Sanofi’s eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and BioMarin’s Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease) among others. Some of these drugs have blockbuster potential.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming and requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Here is a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of August.Another New Indication for Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo?Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) is looking to get the label of its PD-1 inhibitor expanded for use in patients with mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) after prior fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy. The regulatory application is currently under priority review with a response expected on Aug 2, 2017. Opidivo is currently approved for a wide range of indications and brought in sales of $2.3 billion in the first half of 2017. Bristol-Myers has lost 2.6% of its value year to date (YTD) versus the 10.5% growth of its industry.Will J&J RA Drug Win Support of FDA Panel?The FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee will be meeting tomorrow to discuss the BLA for Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) investigational rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, Plivensia (sirukumab), an IL-6 inhibitor. The company is looking to get Plivensia approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response or are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RA is a common, chronic, life-long, autoimmune disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the U.S. While new treatment options have entered the market over the last couple of decades, RA patients are still not adequately managed with many left with fewer therapeutic options due to loss of response to available agents, and poor compliance due to inconvenient dosing.Earlier this week, the FDA had released briefing documents for the meeting which indicate a lot of emphasis will be placed on the safety profile of the drug especially the imbalance in all cause death between Plivensia and placebo. If approved, Plivensia would enter a pretty crowded market given the presence of drugs like Humira, Actemra and Kevzara among others, though its once-monthly dosing schedule could give it an advantage. Shares of J&J have gained 15.2% YTD, outperforming the industry’s rally.Will FDA Follow in EU’s Path and Give the Green Signal to AbbVie’s Maviret?AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) also has an important regulatory event coming up with the FDA expected to respond on the approval status of the company’s latest hepatitis C virus (HCV) offering this month. Maviret, an investigational, pan-genotypic regimen of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P), is a once-daily ribavirin-free treatment that has the potential to provide a faster path to virologic cure for all major HCV genotypes (GT1-6). Maviret represents blockbuster potential and could help AbbVie gain major market share once approved and launched. We note that Maviret gained EU approval just last week. Shares of AbbVie have gained 11.6% YTD, outperforming the industry’s rally.Third Time Lucky for Dynavax’s Heplisav-B?It’s been a great week for clinical-stage immunology company Dynavax Technologies Corp. (DVAX  -  Free Report) which got a favorable recommendation (12-1) from the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) for Heplisav-B, a vaccine for immunization against hepatitis B infection in adults. With the positive vote, will it be third time lucky for the company which has previously received two complete response letters for Heplisav-B (one in Nov 2016 and the other in Feb 2013) from the FDA? A decision from the agency is expected on Aug 10. If approved, Dynavax plans to launch the vaccine early next year. Dynavax’s shares shot up 71.4% on the positive panel vote and are up a whopping 301.3% YTD, significantly outperforming the industry’s10.5% rally.Pfizer’s Xeljanz to Be Reviewed by FDA Advisory PanelPfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) has two regulatory events this month -- the first is an FDA advisory panel meeting and the other a PDUFA date. The FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee will be meeting on Aug 3 to discuss supplemental new drug applications (sNDAs) submitted by the company for its JAK inhibitor, Xeljanz and Xeljanz XR, for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis. Efficacy and safety data and benefit-risk considerations will be discussed by the panel. Xeljanz, currently approved for RA, brought in sales of $927 million in 2016.Meanwhile, the FDA is expected to give a response regarding the approval status of Pfizer’s Besponsa which recently gained approval in the EU. If approved in the U.S., Besponsa will provide a new treatment option for adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), an aggressive type of blood cancer with poor prognosis in adults. According to information provided by Pfizer, the 5-year overall survival rate for patients with relapsed or refractory adult ALL is less than 10%. Pfizer stock has gained 2.1% YTD, lagging the industry it belongs to. Pfizer is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some other FDA decisions scheduled for this month include a response regarding Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AGIO  -  Free Report) and partner Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Idhifa (under priority review for relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an IDH2 mutation) on Aug 30. Meanwhile, the FDA is expected to decide on the approval status of Valeant’s eye drug, Vesneo (latanoprostene bunod) and Adamas’ ADS-5102 (treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in people with Parkinson's disease) on Aug 24.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

2237,ABBV,"Earnings season is upon us, which means that countless publicly traded companies continue to release quarterly earnings reports, updating investors on the company’s financial results and providing insight on how the economy has performed throughout the past quarter.However, the insane amount of press releases during earnings season make it easy to for investors to become lost in the ocean of reports. Fortunately, the Zacks Earnings Calendar lists each company that is expected to report earnings on any given calendar date, making it a useful organizational tool for any investor.With that said, let’s break down a few of the most important upcoming reports. Check out these four major companies that will release earnings reports on Friday, July 28:Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report)) – Friday, July 28 – Before Market OpenCrude oil giant Exxon Mobil will release its quarterly earnings report tomorrow morning before the market opens. Our Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for revenues of $61.16 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 6%. Additionally, the company is projected to report earnings of $0.83 per share, which would constitute year-over-year growth of a whopping 101.90%.Exxon has collaborated with Russia for exploring potential commercial reserves in the country, yet tensions between the United States and Russia might lead to sanctions on the country. This would thwart any attempt Exxon could make to capitalize on oil reserves within Russia. Also, Exxon features a dividend yield of 3.8%, which is one of the lowest among major energy firms and sits below the industry average of 4.76%. These facts, along with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), should turn heads for the wrong reasons as the company prepares to release its earnings report.Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report)) – Friday, July 28 – Before Market OpenEnergy behemoth Chevron is expected to post its quarterly earnings report before the market opens on July 28. Our Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for Chevron to real in $31.18 billion in revenues and report earnings of $0.89 per share, which would constitute strong year-over-year growth of 6.49% and 85.68%, respectively.However, in the first-quarter, Chevron generated just $3.9 billion in operating cash flow while dealing out around $5.3 billion in dividends and capital expenditures. This trend could be detrimental for the company if it continues over the next few quarters, as the company would be relying on asset sales and debt to fill the deficit. Also, Chevron’s mass production in the violence-prone regions of Nigeria poses additional risk for investors. Chevron currently holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which could provide a gloomy financial outlook moving forward. Merck & Company, Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report)) – Friday, July 28 – Before Market OpenMerck & Company is a large global research-driven pharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and manufactures vaccines and medicines to address unmet medical needs. More importantly, the company is expected to release its quarterly earnings report tomorrow morning. According to the latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, Merck & Company is projected to report sales of $9.79 billion and earnings of $0.87 per share.Merck features an impressive product portfolio and pipeline, including many candidates in the advanced stages of development targeting multiple diseases such as atherosclerosis, cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The company has continued to prioritize its pipeline so that the candidates with the highest potential get the required support. Investors should feel a sense of optimism since Merck currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has beaten its earnings estimates in each of its past thirteen operational quarters dating back to 2014.AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report)) – Friday, July 28 – Before Market OpenAbbVie is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company which focuses developing and marketing advanced therapies that address some of the world’s most complex diseases. According to the Zacks Consensus Estimates, AbbVie is projected to report revenues of $6.93 billion and earnings of $1.40 per share, which would constitute year-over-year growth of 7.43% and 11.27%, respectively.AbbVie’s flagship product, Humira, continues to drive revenues. The anti-inflammatory product has witnessed sales increases of 11.7% in 2015 and 16.1% in 2016. The company expects Humira to real in total sales of more than $18 billion in 2020. The fact that AbbVie has defeated its earnings projections in each of its past thirteen operational quarters dating back to 2014, coupled with its adequate Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), should instill some confidence in investors as we approach the report.  More Stock News: Tech Opportunity Worth $386 Billion in 2017From driverless cars to artificial intelligence, we've seen an unsurpassed growth of high-tech products in recent months.

2238,ABBV,"The second-quarter reporting cycle is in full swing. The quarter, undoubtedly, is off to a strong start.As of Jul 26, 2017, 171 S&P 500 members, accounting for 44.1% of the index’s total market capitalization, reported results, according to Earnings Preview.Total earnings for these 171 index members were up 8.8% from the year-ago quarter on a 3.4% improvement in revenues.

(BIIB  -  Free Report) released their second-quarter results this week. Both the companies beat earnings and revenue estimates and raised their sales and earnings expectations for the full year. Moreover, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) and Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) reported encouraging second-quarter results on Jul 26, beating estimates on both counts.

2239,ABBV,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 10 cents (including the impact of stock-based compensation expense), which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 6 cents. Notably, the company had posted a loss of 1 cent in the year-ago quarter. Strong product revenues led to higher profits in the quarter.Excluding stock-based compensation expense, second-quarter adjusted earnings were 39 cents per share compared with the year-ago figure of 24 cents.Vertex reported revenues of $544.1 million in the second quarter, up 26.1% year over year driven by strong product revenues. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $487.9 million by 11.5%.CF Franchise Sales StrongVertex’s second-quarter revenues consisted of sales from cystic fibrosis (CF) products — Kalydeco and Orkambi, collaborative ($27.3 million) and royalty revenues ($2.9 million). CF product revenues were $514 million in the second quarter, up 21% year over year.Kalydeco sales rose 5% to $190 million gaining from inventory stocking of $5 million ahead of the Jul 4 holiday.In May this year, Kalydeco was approved for use in CF patients 2 years and older who have one of 23 residual function mutations in the CFTR gene. More than 900 people in the U.S. have one of these mutations. The expanded indication should boost sales of the drug in future quarters.Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) delivered sales of $324.0 million, up 32% year over year. On a sequential basis, Orkambi sales rose almost 10% in the second quarter, supported by continued uptake globally and further uptake in the pediatric indication for which approval was received in Sep 2016. Meanwhile, an inventory stocking of $10 million ahead of the Jul4 holiday also benefited sales in the second quarter.Costs RiseAdjusted (including stock-based compensation expenses) research and development expenses increased 10% to $284.3 million in the second quarter due to higher costs related to development of triple combination CF regimens. Adjusted (including stock-based compensation expenses) selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 10.7% to $121.7 million due to increased investment to support the global launch of Orkambi.Maintains 2017 GuidanceVertex maintained its 2017 guidance for Orkambi and Kalydeco sales but raised its guidance for combined operating costs.Orkambi revenues are expected in the range of $1.1–$1.3 billion while Kalydeco revenues are estimated in the range of $740 million - $770 million. We remind investors that following the approval for the additional indication in May, Kalydeco 2017 revenue guidance was upped to $740 million - $770 million from $710 to $730 million. Total CF product revenues are expected in the range of $1.84 billion to $2.07 billion in 2017.Combined adjusted research and development (R&D) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2017 are anticipated in the range of $1.33 to $1.36 billion, higher than $1.25–$1.30 billion expected previously.Costs are expected to be higher due to accelerated development of the triple combination CF pipeline and investment to develop CTP-656.Focus on Triple Combination CF RegimensVertex is evaluating some next-generation CFTR correctors (VX-152, VX-440, VX-659 and VX-445) as part of a triple combination withVX-661 (tezacaftor) and ivacaftor.Data from VX-152 and VX-440 phase II and VX-659 phase I triple combination studies, conducted on CF patients who have one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation (F508del/Min), were presented last week. The data demonstrated that all three combinations led to pronounced improvement in lung function. In fact, these are the first data to show the potential to treat the underlying cause of CF in patients who have a severe and difficult-to-treat type of the disease.Following discussions with regulatory agencies, Vertex will initiate pivotal phase III studies on one or two of the four triple combination regimens in the first half of 2018.Other CF Pipeline UpdateIn March, positive data from two phase III studies – EVOLVE and EXPAND – evaluating Kalydeco in combination with VX-661 (tezacaftor) in CF patients with two copies of the F508del mutation were also announced. Both studies met their primary endpoints and demonstrated statistically significant improvements in lung function. Based on positive outcome from the studies, the company recently submitted regulatory applications in both the U.S. and EU. Encouragingly, the combination was also granted Orphan Drug designation by the FDA in June.Earlier this week, Vertex announced that it has closed the previously announced agreement to buy Concert Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (CNCE  -  Free Report) CF pipeline candidate, CTP-656. Vertex plans to develop CTP-656 for potential use in future once-daily regimens in combination with its other pipeline drugs to treat the underlying cause of CF.Our TakeVertex’s second-quarter results were encouraging, topping estimates on both counts as sales of both its CF drugs rose.Shares declined slightly in after-hours trading probably in response to the hike in operating costs expectations for the year. However, so far this year, Vertex’s share priceis up a massive 121.8%, comparing favorably with an increase of 12% for the industry.Meanwhile, Vertex’s CF pipeline is quite strong with a broad portfolio of next-generation CF correctors. Its triple combination CF regimens are considered crucial for long-term growth. If the triple-combo regimes are successful, Vertex can address a significantly larger CF patient population– almost 90% of patients with CF - in the future.However, one cannot forget potential competition for Vertex’s triple combos. Belgian company, Galapagos NV (GLPG  -  Free Report) and AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) are also developing triple CFTR combination therapy for CF.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated QuoteVertex sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2241,ABBV,"Every year on Jul 28, World Hepatitis Day (WHD) is observed to raise awareness about viral hepatitis, one of the leading causes of death across the world.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), viral hepatitis caused 1.34 million deaths across the world in 2015 and many people remain unaware of being infected by the same. While there are five types of hepatitis (A, B, C, D and E), hepatitis B and C are the two main killers with 257 million people living with hepatitis B and 71 million people living with hepatitis C.About 90% of people living with hepatitis B and 80% living with hepatitis C are unaware of their status. Hepatitis B and C together account for 80% of liver cancer cases across the world.Considering these numbers, it is not a surprise that quite a few pharma and biotech companies are working on bringing innovative treatments in this area to the market. However, challenges in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) market exist in the form of intense competition and pricing pressure.  Stocks in FocusHere is a look at some of the key players in the hepatitis B and/or C markets.Biotech major, Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) is perhaps the most well-known name in the HCV market. HCV drugs include Harvoni, Sovaldi, Epclusa and the recently approved Vosevi while HBV offerings include Viread and Vemlidy.However, the Foster City, CA-based company has seen a lot of ups and downs in this market. Gilead’s HCV franchise was a major revenue contributor bringing in multi-billion dollar sales but increasing competition and pricing pressure resulted in a significant decline in HCV product sales in 2016. Even though Gilead recently raised its 2017 guidance for its HCV franchise, sales are nevertheless expected to witness a significant decline.  Gilead launched an educational campaign in 2016 to encourage baby boomers to get tested. According to the company, there has been an 80% increase in HCV antibody screening by baby boomers since the campaign started resulting in an increase in diagnosis as well. The company estimates that about 190,000 people were newly diagnosed with HCV in 2016, up 32% from 2015.Gilead is conducting additional studies on Harvoni as well as Vemlidy and has an early-stage HBV candidate in its pipeline (GS-9688, a TLR-8 agonist). Gilead is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. Year-to-date (YTD), the company’s stock is up 4.7%, lagging the 10% rally of the industry it belongs to. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Large-cap pharma company, Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report), is another big name in the HCV market. According to information provided by Merck, about 3.5 million people in the U.S. have chronic HCV infection. Merck’s HCV portfolio comprises Zepatier, which was launched last year, PegIntron and Victrelis. However, the company’s HCV franchise is not a major revenue generator. Earlier this year, Merck took a major impairment charge related to an HCV candidate that became a part of its pipeline following the 2014 acquisition of Idenix. The decision was taken based on changes to the product profile, as well as changes to the company’s expectations for pricing and the market opportunity. Merck is a Zacks Rank #2 stock. YTD, the company’s stock is up 8.2%, lagging the 10.7% rally of the industry it belongs to.AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) also has a major presence in the HCV market. The company’s HCV products include Viekira Pak and Technivie. AbbVie is currently seeking approval for Maviret, an investigational, pan-genotypic regimen of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P). The once-daily ribavirin-free treatment has the potential to provide a faster path to virologic cure for all major HCV genotypes (GT1-6). Maviret represents blockbuster potential and could help AbbVie gain major market share once approved and launched.AbbVie is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. AbbVie stock has gained 14.6% YTD, performing better than the industry it belongs to.Watertown, MA-based Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ENTA  -  Free Report) has a collaboration with AbbVie for its protease inhibitors – paritaprevir and glecaprevir. While paritaprevir is a key compound in AbbVie’s direct-acting-antiviral (DAA) regimen Viekira Pak and its other 3-DAA and 2-DAA treatment regimens currently on the market for HCV, glecaprevir in combination with pibrentasvir (G/P, Maviret) is currently under regulatory review. Enanta earns royalties from AbbVie on product sales. Meanwhile, Enanta is also working on developing its HBV pipeline -- the focus is currently on core inhibitors with clinical candidate identification planned for 2017.Enanta is a Zacks Rank #3 stock. YTD, Enanta stock has gained 13.6%, outperforming the 5.5% rally of the industry it belongs to.Bottom LineThe HCV market will continue to face challenges as more treatments enter the market resulting in increased competition and additional pricing pressure. In fact, HCV drugs have faced immense scrutiny due to their high prices. That said, the market nevertheless represents significant commercial opportunity. As per information provided by Enanta, the market for HCV therapies was worth about $16 billion in 2016. HCV patient starts usually witness a surge following the introduction of new drugs in the market. With a major part of HCV-infected people remaining undiagnosed, there remains significant opportunity in this market as awareness increases and newly diagnosed patients seek treatment.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2242,ABBV,"Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s (GILD  -  Free Report) reported results for the second quarter wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed expectations.Second-quarter 2017 earnings (including the impact of stock-based compensation expenses) of $2.51 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.11. However, earnings were below the year-ago quarter figure of $3.03.Moreover, total revenue in the reported quarter was $7.1 billion and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.4 billion. However, revenues declined 8.2% year over year. Shares were up 1.8% in after-market hours trading following the release of second-quarter results. However, shares of Gilead have underperformed the Zacks classified industry in the year so far with the stock gaining 3.6% during this period, compared with the industry’s gain of 11.5%.HIV Impresses Yet AgainProduct sales came in at $7.0 billion, down 9% year over year. The decline was due to lower hepatitis C virus (HCV) sales, partially offset by higher sales across HIV and other therapeutic areas.Antiviral product sales, which include Gilead's HIV and liver disease portfolios, came in at $6.4 billion in the reported quarter, down 9.8%.HCV product sales, which include Harvoni, Sovaldi and the recently launched Epclusa, were $2.9 billion, down from $4.0 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside was mainly attributed to lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi across all major markets, partially offset by sales of Epclusa (launched in 2016) across various locations.Sales of Harvoni declined 46.1% year over year to $1.4 billion in the reported quarter. The decline was mainly due to lower sales in the U.S and Europe. Further, Sovaldi sales recorded a steep year-over-year decline of 76.8% to $315 million.Epclusa garnered sales of $1.2 billion in the reported quarter, lower than the prior-quarter figure of $892 million. We note that Epclusa was launched in the U.S. and Europe in June and Jul 2016, respectively.Meanwhile, HIV and HBV product sales came in at $3.6 billion, up 16.1% year over year. The increase was primarily driven by continuous strong uptake of tenofoviral afenamide (TAF)-based products such as Genvoya, which generated sales of $857 million, up from $302 million in the year-ago quarter, Descovy, which recorded sales of $286 million, up from $61 million, and Odefsey, which registered sales of $258 million, up from $58 million. HIV treatments like Stribild and Complera/Eviplera sales declined. Viread sales were up at $300 million, up 4.5%. Atripla sales tanked 29.4% to $475 million, while Truvada sales fell 13.8% to $812 million.Other products like Letairis, Ranexa, AmBisome and Zydelig recorded sales of $230 million (up 13.3%), $200 million (up 30.7%), $92 million (up 8.2%) and $35 million (down 14.6%), respectively.Research & development (R&D) expenses declined 41.8% to $864 million due to purchase of Nimbus Apollo, Inc. and a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) priority review voucher. On the other hand, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were roughly flat at $897 million. Adjusted product gross margin was 87.3%, up from 91.5% in the year-ago period.2017 Guidance UpdatedBased on a better-than-expected performance in the first half of 2017 specifically in the U.S, Gilead raised its guidance for 2017. Gilead now expects net product sales in the range of $24.0–$25.5 billion, up from $22.5–$24.5 billion provided earlier. Non-HCV product sales are projected between $15.5 and $16.0 billion (earlier projection: $15 and $15.5 billion). HCV product sales are projected between $8.5 and $9.5 billion (earlier projection: $7.5 and $9.0 billion). Adjusted R&D expenses and adjusted SG&A expenses are now projected in the range of $3.2–$3.4 billion and $3.2–$3.4 billion, respectively. Adjusted product gross margin is expected in the range of 86–88%. Earnings per share are now projected around 86 – 93 cents (earlier projection: 84 – 91 cents).Dividend and Share RepurchaseConcurrently, Gilead declared a cash dividend of 52 cents per share of common stock for third-quarter 2017. The dividend is payable on Sep 28 to stockholders of record at the close of business on Sep 15. During the second quarter, the company paid cash dividends of $680 million and repurchased 2 million shares for $130 million.Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise   Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Gilead Sciences, Inc. QuoteOur TakeThe better-than-expected performance in the second quarter was driven by positive trends in the non-HCV business and better-than-expected results from HCV business (market share of 80%), particularly in the U.S due to rapid uptake of Epclusa. The HCV franchise was boosted by the FDA approval of Vosevi. HCV patient starts in the first six months were better than the company’s expectation. The company, however, expects a gradual decline in the second half of the year (market starts of 185,000 to 200,000 in the U.S) for 2017 due to increased competition. We note that Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa, face competition from AbbVie’s, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) Daklinza among others.Meanwhile, the HIV franchise maintains momentum driven by the rapid adoption of TAF-based regimens in the U.S. and EU. The TAF-based regimens now represent 51% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and the launches of Odefsey and Descovy in 2016. Genvoya is now the company’s bestselling HIV product with a treatment-naïve patient share of 41%.Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting is alsoexpected toboost sales as the company saw a significant uptick in PrEP usage in 2017 with an estimated 136,000 patients using Truvada by the end of the second quarter. However, Gilead will lose exclusivity for Viread in 2017 in some countries outside the U.S. which may impact sales.Zacks Rank & Key PickGilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).   A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Exelixis has delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 512.11%.

2244,ABBV,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter 2017 earnings, before the opening bell on Jul 28.AbbVie’s shares have rallied 18.2% so far this year, while the industry has recorded an increase of 13.2%.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 1.59%. We note that AbbVie’s earnings history is a mixed bag as the pharmaceuticals company delivered positive surprises in the two of the last four quarters but recorded in-line earnings in the other two. The average earnings beat for the last four quarters is 1.65%.AbbVie Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAbbVie Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AbbVie Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors to ConsiderAt the first-quarter 2017 conference call, management revealed that it expects second-quarter 2017 earnings in the range of $1.39–$1.41 per share. Revenues are expected to grow between 7% and 8% on a reported basis. Currency headwinds are expected to hurt revenues by 1%.The company’s key drug, Humira, is likely to remain the main growth driver in the second quarter. Increasing awareness, favorable clinical data, additional indications and expansion into new markets are expected to help the product continue making significant contributions to the top line. This quarter, AbbVie also expects Humira sales growth in the U.S. in the mid-to-high teens range while internationally, Humira sales are expected to rise in a mid-single-digit range on an operational basis.Though Humira is doing well, the company is concerned about the product’s long-term prospects owing to the potential biosimilar competition.Another area of focus is the performance of Imbruvica, added to AbbVie’s portfolio following its May 2015 acquisition of Pharmacyclics. The drug recorded strong sales since past few quarters, a trend that we expect to continue. Imbruvica has multi-billion dollar potential and the company is looking to expand the drug’s label for solid tumors and autoimmune diseases.The company expects the Imbruvica sales growth in the U.S. to approach 35% in the second quarter.Although Imbruvica has huge commercial potential, investors should know that revenues from it will be shared with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), which has a collaboration agreement with Pharmacyclics.Other drugs like Duopa and Creon are also expected to continue to perform well in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.However, Abbvie’s Hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment, Viekira, will continue to be adversely impacted by an intense pricing and competitive pressure in the HCV market.Notably, last month, the company announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended a marketing approval of its investigational, hepatitis C virus (HCV) combo regimen of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P). The candidate will be marketed by the trade name of Maviret.A decision from the European Commission is expected in the third quarter of 2017. An approval will definitely provide the company with a stronger presence against the competitive dynamics in the HCV market.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that AbbVie is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for AbbVie is -0.71% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.39 per share and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands higher at $1.40. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Though AbbVie’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of the ESP, its -0.71% Earnings ESP makes the surprise prediction difficult.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some better-ranked health care stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release its results on Aug 9.

2245,ABBV,"Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved Vosevi (Sovaldi, velpatasvir 100 mg/voxilaprevir 100 mg) tablets. The drug is a single-tablet regimen (STR) for the re-treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, previously treated with an NS5A inhibitor-containing regimen, or with genotype 1a or 3 previously treated with a Sovaldi-containing regimen without an NS5A inhibitor.The approval came on the back of positive data from the phase III studies – POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4 studies. The studies evaluated 12 weeks of Vosevi in direct-acting antiviral-experienced chronic HCV-infected patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.However, Vosevi has been warned for its product label regarding the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in HCV/HBV co infected patients.Nevertheless, the approval makes Vosevi the first once-daily STR available as a salvage therapy for patients infected with HCV genotype 1–6 who have failed prior treatment with DAA regimens including NS5A inhibitors. The approval is expected to boost Gilead’s strong HCV portfolio.Gilead has a strong presence in the HCV market due to its blockbuster HCV drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni. While Sovaldi continues to be a very important product for the company, Harvoni’s label has been expanded twice in the U.S. since approval and is now approved for use in a broader range of patient population. The HCV portfolio got a huge a boost when Epclusa gained approval in both the U.S. (Jun 2016) and the EU (Jul 2016) to become the first and only all-oral, pan-genotypic, STR consisting of Sovaldi and velpatasvir (an NS5A inhibitor), for the treatment of adults with genotype 1-6 chronic HCV infection. Initial uptake of Epclusa has been encouraging while formulary reviews are on track. Gilead expects to launch Epclusa in other large EU markets once pricing and reimbursement is in place by the second half of 2017, which should boost sales further.Last month, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion on the company’s Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for Vosevi following an accelerated assessment procedure.Gilead’s HCV franchise is under pressure due to intense competition and pricing issues. HCV product sales were weaker than expected mainly due to fewer new patient starts for Harvoni and lower revenues per patient. Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa has being facing competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR, Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Daklinza and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Olysio.The company expects that the persistent decline in HCV patient starts will be the primary factor behind the year-over-year decrease in revenues in 2017 along with increased competition which will impact patient share and pricing.Shares of Gilead have underperformed the Zacks classified Medical-Biomedical and Genetics industry in the year so far, with the stock losing 0.1% during this period, against the industry’s gain of 8.8%. Nevertheless, the HIV franchise of Gilead is performing well and is expected to help the company combat the persistent decline in HCV franchise.Zacks Rank Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing UpsiZacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2246,ABBV,"Repros Therapeutics Inc.  announced that it received preliminary feedback from the FDA on its clinical development program for Proellex to treat uterine fibroids by oral mechanism. Per the FDA’s review, Proellex will remain on partial clinical hold and the company will be required to accumulate a large pre-approval safety data base in order for the candidate to be evaluated further. To meet the FDA’s requirement, the company will be required to conduct a much larger clinical study which will be time consuming and also expensive.The shares of the company plunged about 34% on Monday after the news was announced. We note that Repros' shares have underperformed the Zacks classified Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry in the last year. The stock has declined 70.8% as against the industry’s gain of 8.7% in the same period.We remind investors that Proellex studies on oral dose for the treatment of endometriosis and uterine fibroids were placed under clinical hold in 2009. But later the FDA allowed the studies to be conducted under partial clinical hold with low oral dosage.We note that the company is also evaluating Proellex, a selective progesterone modulator (SPRM), in a phase IIb study for uterine fibroids by vaginal delivery. However, this study has no clinical hold issues. The company said that it will now increase its focus on this study. The company presented positive top line data from this study in November last year.Meanwhile, Repros also mentioned that it received a notice that on Aug 2, 2017 it will be granted a European patent relating to the use of SPRMs, in particular Proellex, with an Off Drug Interval (ODI) for the treatment of estrogen-dependent hyperproliferative uterine conditions, such as uterine fibroids and endometriosis.Notably, Repros' other key pipeline candidate, enclomiphene, is being evaluated for the treatment of low testosterone level in overweight men. The company submitted a marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for enclomiphene ifor secondary hypogonadism in Europe in Sep 2016.  There are other companies that have been evaluating candidates for uterine fibroids.

2247,ABBV,"Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 18.A look at Novartis’ share price movement year to date shows that the stock has outperformed the Zacks classified Large Cap Pharma industry. Its shares have rallied 13.3% compared with the industry’s gain of 11.3%.In the last reported quarter, Novartis delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.7%. The company has posted an average positive earnings surprise of 3.28% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Impact the QuarterNovartis operates under three segments: Innovative Medicines (Pharmaceuticals), Alcon and Sandoz (Generics).New products like Cosentyx and Entresto should boost the top line. Cosentyx has been strong and the company has grabbed market shares from rivals like AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel. Cosentyx achieved the blockbuster status in 2016 and recorded over $1 billion of sales.Novartis has broadened its oncology portfolio through acquisitions. FDA’s recent approval of Kisqali, for use in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer will further boost the company's oncology portfolio.  Meanwhile, the FDA has also recently approved a label expansion of Zykadia as the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.Additionally, Novartis’ generic arm, Sandoz, is making efforts to strengthen its biosimilars portfolio. The company plans to launch four biosimilars of major oncology and immunology biologics across key geographies by 2020. The company is, however, facing significant pricing pressures in the U.S. due to a delay in the launch of Glatopa 40mg. This is expected to impact the second-quarter results.Also, exclusivity of some of the key drugs in Novartis’ portfolio is hurting the company’s top line.  The company’s blockbuster drug, Diovan, is facing stiff generic competition in the U.S., the EU and Japan. Gleevec lost exclusivity in the U.S. in Feb 2016 and in the EU in Dec 2016, thereby leading to generic competition. Exforge is also facing generic competition in the U.S. and the EU. Furthermore, the oncology drugs are facing new competition in the form of immuno-oncology therapies.The negative impact of generic competition is expected to impact sales by $2.5 billion in 2017.The company’s ophthalmologic division, Alcon, continues to face challenges due to lower surgical equipments sales. Stiff competition faced by intraocular lens and a slowdown in demand for equipment purchases continue to act as dampeners. We do not expect any improving trends in the division’s sales in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Novartis will beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Novartis is 0.00%.  This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.16. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Novartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Although the rank is favorable, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise  Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise | Novartis AG QuoteStock to ConsiderHere is one stock in the healthcare sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +16.7% and a Zacks Rank #1.

2248,ABBV,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report), a well-known name in the multiple sclerosis (MS) market, surpassed expectations both for earnings and sales in the second quarter of 2017. The drugmaker also raised its revenue guidance for 2017 as sales of its newest drug Spinraza (spinal muscular atrophy) witnessed faster-than-expected adoption in the U.S.Shares of Biogen rose almost 5% in pre-market trading in response to the strong results. However, we note that Biogen’s shares have inched up 0.8% so far this year, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s increase of 12.7%.                                                                    Biogen reported second-quarter 2017 earnings per share of $5.04, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.36 by 15.6%. However, earnings decreased 3% year over year.Sales came in at $3.08 billion, up 6% from the year-ago period. Sales also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.81 billion by 9.6%.

The company spun off its hemophilia business in February.Quarter in Detail                           Biogen’s MS revenues grew 5% year over year in the second quarter of 2017 with stable global share.Tecfidera sales rallied 13% from the year-ago period to $1.11 billion. The drug recorded a 16% sequential surge in revenues. This included the U.S. sales of $875 million and ex-U.S. sales of $235.6 million. In the U.S., Tecfidera revenues benefited from seasonal recovery in both unit volumes and discounts as well as allowances.Second-quarter Tysabri revenues were flat year over year and the same decreased 9% sequentially to $496 million (U.S. $289.4 million, ex-U.S. $206.6 million).Note that Tysabri revenues in the first quarter of 2017 benefited by approximately $45 million in the ex-U.S. markets due to an agreement with the Price and Reimbursement Committee of the Italian National Medicines Agency (AIFA) related to Tysabri sales. This benefit was missing in the second quarter, leading to the sequential decline.Combined interferon revenues (Avonex and Plegridy) in the second quarter were $691 million (U.S. $501.7 million, ex-U.S. $188.9 million), down 5% from the year-ago period. Avonex revenues declined 8% from the year-ago period to $557 million. Plegridy contributed $133 million to second-quarter 2017 revenues, up 8% year over year and 19% sequentially.U.S. Interferon revenues are experiencing declining trends due to patients transitioning to other oral MS therapies as well as higher discounts and allowance.Zinbryta, launched in collaboration with AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) in August last year, contributed $16 million to revenues in the second quarter compared with $11 million in first-quarter 2017.Newly launched Spinraza brought revenues of $203 million (U.S. revenues $195 million) in the second quarter, registering massive growth of 328% sequentially as the drug witnesses a strong demand in the U.S. U.S. Spinraza revenues included approximately $30 million related to an inventory build in the U.S. The company is working on expanding access to all patients.Notably in Jun 2017, Spinraza was granted a marketing authorization in the EU for treatment of 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). It was also approved of in Japan and Canada recently.This quarter, Biogen recorded biosimilar revenues of $91 million compared with $66 million in first-quarter 2017. The company markets Benepali, a biosimilar referencing Amgen Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel in Europe. Benepali recorded revenues of $88.7 million, thus registering a growth rate of 35.8% sequentially. Biogen also markets Flixabi, a biosimilar referencing Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug Remicade, which recorded revenues of $1.9 million in the reported quarter compared with $0.6 million in the first quarter.Revenues from Anti-CD20 therapeutic programs, which include Biogen’s shares of Rituxan and Gazyva operating profits, climbed 14% from the year-ago period to $397 million in the second quarter.R&D spend soared 68% in the reported quarter to $796 million, while SG&A spend decreased 12% year over year to $430 million. This quarter, the company repurchased 2.9 million shares worth $782 million under its $5.0 billion share repurchase program.2017 OutlookBiogen raised its earnings and revenue outlook for 2017.Biogen now expects earnings in the range of $20.80-$21.40 per share (old guidance: $20.45-$21.25 per share) for 2017.Revenues are now expected in a range of $11.5-$11.8 billion comapred with the earlier guidance of $11.1-$11.4 billion in 2017. This increase from prior guidance is primarily attributed to faster-than-anticipated adoption of Spinraza in the U.S.In terms of percentage of the total revenue, the company’s R&D and SG&A expenses are expected to be 19% and 16% respectively.Biogen Inc.

2249,ABBV,"Despite the hurdles in Trump’s plans to repeal and replace Obamacare, healthcare is the second best performing sector this year lagging technology. The optimism comes especially from encouraging industry trends and hopes of a favorable policy environment.The Trump administration plans to focus on easing regulatory hurdles rather than lowering drug prices, and expedite new drug approvals. Additionally, the shift in investors’ sentiment to defensive sectors like healthcare, which generally outperform during periods of low-to-moderate growth and rising geopolitical uncertainty, has led to a rally in healthcare stocks (read: Top Ranked Healthcare ETFs for Long Term Investors).As such, popular funds – Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV  -  Free Report), Vanguard Health Care ETF (VHT  -  Free Report), iShares U.S. Healthcare ETF (IYH  -  Free Report) and Fidelity MSCI Health Care Index ETF (FHLC  -  Free Report) – have gained at least 18% so far this year.

2250,ABBV,"Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, after the market closes. Last quarter, the company beat expectations by 0.92%.Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Gilead Sciences, Inc. QuoteGilead’s track record is pretty mixed, with the company beating estimates in three of the last four and missing in the other one. Overall, the company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 3.52%.Shares of Gilead have moved up 1.5% in the year so far, underperforming the Zacks classified Medical-Biomedical and Genetics industry’s gain of 10.5%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this biotech major for this announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Gilead is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter. This is because it has the right combination of two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +3.32%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $2.18 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $2.11. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayConcurrent with the first-quarter earnings call, Gilead reiterated its guidance for annual guidance for 2017.  Gilead expects net product sales in the range of $22.5–$24.5 billion. Non-HCV product sales are projected between $15 billion and $15.5 billion.  HCV product sales are projected between $7.5 billion and $9.0 billion.Strong performance by HIV and other antiviral product sales driven by continued uptake of its tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) based products – Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey continue to boost sales. We expect the trend to continue in the second quarter as well. Genvoya has already become the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients since its launch.By the end of first-quarter 2017, the TAF-based regimens made up 42% of Gilead's HIV prescription volume in the treatment market. Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting is also expected to boost sales.  However, Gilead will lose exclusivity for Viread in 2017 in some countries outside the U.S. which might impact sales.However, the HCV franchise continues to be under competitive and pricing pressure leading to a massive decline in Harvoni and Sovaldi sales in 2016. Harvoni and Sovaldi has been facing competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR among others. Higher discounts and payer mix continue to impact sales adversely. Total HCV treatment starts in the U.S. were an estimated 231,000 in 2016, approximately 25,000 less than 2015. The company expects a further decline in patients starts in 2017.On a positive note, the HCV portfolio received a major boost when Epclusa gained approval in 2016 to become the first and only all-oral, pan-genotypic, STR consisting of Sovaldi and velpatasvir (an NS5A inhibitor), for the treatment of adults with genotype 1–6 chronic HCV infection. Initial uptake of Epclusa has been encouraging while formulary reviews are on track. The recently approved HBV drug Vemlidy is also expected to start contributing to the top line. The FDA recently approved Vosevi (Sovaldi, velpatasvir 100 mg/voxilaprevir 100 mg) tablets as a single-tablet regimen (STR) for the re-treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, previously treated with an NS5A inhibitor-containing regimen, or with genotype 1a or 3 previously treated with a Sovaldi-containing regimen without an NS5A inhibitor.During the second-quarter call, investors are likely to keep an eye on Gilead’s performance while pipeline updates will also be keenly awaited. Focus would also be on the performance of Epclusa and TAF-based regimens.Other Stocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some other health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +66.7% and a Zacks Rank #1.

2251,ABBV,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report), a well-known name in the multiple sclerosis (MS) market, will report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.63%.Biogen’s shares have declined 0.4% this year so far while the Zacks classified Biomed-Genetics industry recorded an increase of 8.8%.Biogen’s earnings performance has been pretty impressive so far, having delivered back-to-back positive surprises. The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 5.29%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAt the first quarter call, the company had said that it expects relatively stable demand for both Tecfidera and Tysabri (its multiple sclerosis drugs) in 2017 as patient growth in ex-U.S. markets offsets the modest decline in the U.S. due to rising competition from drugs like Roche’s Ocrevus. It remains to be seen whether its second-quarter performance reflects the trend.Meanwhile, the combined number of patients using Avonex and Plegridy is on the decline as patients transition to other oral multiple sclerosis therapies or other high-efficacy products.Zinbryta, launched in collaboration with AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) in Aug 2016, is expected to continue to contribute to revenues in the U.S. and the EU. The drug benefits from increased use of high-efficacy products.Spinraza approved for spinal muscular atrophy in Dec 2016 was off to a promising start backed by robust underlying demand Notably, Spinraza, which added $47.4 million to the top line in the first quarter of 2017, should contribute further to sales. At the Q1 conference call, the company had said that it is working on expanding access to Spinraza to all patients.However, at the call, the company had warned of possible logistics and coverage restriction on the drug in the U.S. as well as other markets. We expect management to provide an update on the issue at its second quarter conference call.Biogen’s biosimilar products - Flixabi (a biosimilar referencing Remicade) and Benepali (a biosimilar referencing Enbrel) are also generating higher revenues. The trend should continue this quarter as well.Headcount reduction and restructuring initiatives are expected to continue to lower operating expenses. Meanwhile, R&D expenses are expected to increase due to increased business development payments.At the second quarter call, investor focus will remain on Tecfidera’s scrip trends, sales ramp-up of Spinraza, pipeline progress and acquisition plans.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Biogen is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -5.61% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at $4.21 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $4.46. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Biogen’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Biogen Inc.

The drug is indicated for replacement therapy in males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone. Annual market sales for Androgel Topical Gel, 1.62% packets for the 12 months ending May 2017 were about $88 million.Shares of Perrigo have significantly underperformed the Zacks classified Medical Products industry so far this year. The stock has declined 12.8% against the broader industry’s gain of 21.3%.Simultaneously, Perrigo also declared that its subsidiary has filed a Paragraph IV Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) with the FDA for a generic version of Galderma’s Soolantra (ivermectin) cream, 1% indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea.

Dymista is indicated for the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients between six years of age and older, who require treatment with both azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate for symptomatic relief.The approval for the generic version of a drug bodes well for the company as it will help in boosting revenues.

The drug will be marketed by the trade name of Tremfya.The drug was approved under an accelerated process, following the filing of a priority voucher by J&J.J&J’s shares have gained 14.4% so far this year, significantly ahead of the 11.3% increase witnessed by the Zacks classified Large-Cap Pharma industry.Coming back to the latest news, the FDA approval was based on three studies – phase III VOYAGE 1, VOYAGE 2 and NAVIGATE – evaluating the efficacy and safety of guselkumab, an anti-IL-23 human monoclonal antibody, administered by subcutaneous injection for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.Data from the VOYAGE 2 trial (n=992), announced earlier, had showed that significantly higher proportions of patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis treated with guselkumab achieved high rates of skin clearance compared to those receiving placebo. Around 70% of the patients receiving guselkumab achieved at least 90% clearer skin versus 2.4% on placebo.The VOYAGE 2 trial evaluated guselkumab versus AbbVie, Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira. The study demonstrated the statistically significant efficacy of guselkumab compared to Humira at week 16, which was maintained through 24 weeks of treatment. Almost 46.8% of the patients treated with Humira achieved at least 90% clearer skin versus 70% for guselkumab.The NAVIGATE (n=871) study evaluated the efficacy and safety of switching to guselkumab in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis patients who were not achieving clear or almost clear skin with J&J’s other plaque psoriasis medicine Stelara. Data from the study showed that patients who switched to guselkumab showed significantly greater improvements in skin clearance compared with patients who continued to receive Stelara.Per the company’s press release, around 7.5 million Americans suffer from this disease in which an overproduction of skin cells can cause itching, pain, burning sensation and skin tightness. Hence, an approval of guselkumab has given the company access to a wide patient population in the U.S.Guselkumab is under review in the EU and Japan for the plaque psoriasis indication. A phase III head-to-head study of Tremfya against Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Cosentyx for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis is ongoing. Meanwhile, a phase II trial evaluating guselkumab in moderate-to-severely active psoriatic arthritis is also ongoing.J&J had previously mentioned that Tremfya has blockbuster potential and could rake in sales of more than $1 billion.
