News reports Friday said Intel was considering a takeover of Broadcom, in order to avert the competitive threat of a Broadcom/Qualcomm combination.It is difficult to tell how prominent other events in Washington were in investors minds Tuesday. The White House's sudden, though not unexpected, replacement of Rex Tillerson with Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State, the break between GOP and Democrats in the House Intelligence Panel's release of findings in its Russia probe, and the Senate's progress toward Dodd-Frank banking oversight reforms may all have weighed on the stock market today.The result showed the Dow clearly stymied at its 50-day moving average, while the S&P 500 again met resistance at the 2800 level and the Nasdaq pulled back to test support at the level of its recent high, from Jan. 26.On the Dow, General Electric dived more than 4% after JPMorgan slashed its price target, with Microsoft (MSFT) and American Express (AXP) each booking losses of more than 2%.Among medical stocks, hospital operators Community Health System (CYH) and software developer Tabula Rasa Healthcare (TRHC) each skidded 7% lower.

5,XRX,"Some of America's most venerable tech companies aim to renew growth by breaking up.The jury is still out on whether that will work for Conduent (CNDT), which has a long road ahead, analysts say. Separated from Xerox (XRX) in January, Conduent helps other companies get their financial house in order in the field known as business process outsourcing.Some analysts say Conduent aims to build a more competitive business. Others contend it could be a more attractive takeover target down the road. Its results have been lackluster of late, though the company's outlook indicates a growth path ahead.Complicating matters is activist investor Carl Icahn, who has a piece of Conduent. The big question is what will happen if its turnaround starts clicking.""We think Conduent is an unlikely (merger) target,"" Keith Bachman, a BMO Capital Markets analyst, said in a recent report. ""We don't think any of the established BPO leaders, such as Accenture (ACN), IBM (IBM) or Genpact (G), have any interest in acquiring Conduent, given its focus on the low end of the market.""But others say a sell-off could come piecemeal.""(Chief Executive Ashok) Vemuri may choose to divest/sell portions of the business that are either 'noncore' or less profitable,"" said Frank Atkins, a SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst, in a recent note to clients. ""While this would have impact on top-line trajectory on a reported basis, it is a quick way to drive margin as well as restore balance-sheet powder for strategic investment. In our view, this could be in low-margin, more commoditized work, or in certain geographies which may not be of adequate scale.""In investor meetings, Vemuri has outlined plans to increase its sales force, invest in digital technologies such as data analytics, and focus on North America and Europe as core markets.What the company also wants to do is exit low-margin contracts and pursue new deals with better pricing. It aims to migrate toward higher-value-added work rather than being a soup-to-nuts services provider.""The core philosophy now is to drive a more repeatable, scalable and predictable business,"" Vemuri said on Conduent's fourth-quarter earnings call in February.  ""We are not in the business of trying to capture a headline by doing a big deal that we do not even understand how to start working on.""Regardless of what awaits the company, the split/merger strategy isn't unfamiliar. Silicon Valley stalwart Hewlett-Packard in 2015 split into two publicly traded companies: Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to focus on services and products for businesses, and HP Inc. (HPQ) to focus on PCs and printers.HPE in early April took a step further, spinning off its enterprise services businesses. But that entity merged with IT consulting firm Computer Sciences to create DXC Technology (DXC), now a rival of Conduent.Whether Conduent pursues a strategic direction similar to HP's remains to be seen. Xerox stock gapped up on Jan. 3, the day the spinoff was completed, and is up about 8% this year. Xerox is set to launch a slew of new products, aiming to spur revenue growth in the back half of 2017, analysts say.The move to split from Xerox was endorsed by Icahn, who built up a stake in the copy machine maker.Icahn now holds a nearly 10% stake in Conduent and picked three members of its board of directors. So he figures in whatever strategic options Conduent is looking at, analysts say.IBD'S TAKE: Conduent hasn't been a publicly traded company for long, but it's already is forming a cup-with-handle base that could lead to higher stock gains. Read here for more information on stocks forming cup bases.As its own entity, Florham Park, N.J.-based Conduent handles such services for businesses as state Medicaid payments, tollbooth collections, and other transactions.Along with Accenture, IBM and Genpact, a number of other business process providers compete with Conduent. They include Convergys (CVG), ExlService (EXLS) and WNS Holdings (WNS), as well as large multinational tech service providers including Automatic Data Processing (ADP), Cap Gemini (CGEMY), and the new DXC Technology.The worldwide BPO market is growing about 5% annually, says Citigroup. In 2018, it's expected to reach $197 billion, from $188 billion in 2017.As it grows, CEO Vemuri aims to provide multiple services to customers rather than spread out too thinly.""The thing we have to work on is to take various service capabilities, find the common thread between them, and sell (services) as a bundled solution,"" he said on Conduent's earnings call.Prior to joining Conduent last year, Vemuri was chief executive of iGate, an information services firm. France-based Cap Gemini acquired iGate for roughly $4 billion in 2015. Vemuri earlier worked at Infosys (INFY), an India-based consulting and tech services firm.Current results may not bode well for a takeover, though. Conduent's 2016 revenue fell 4% to $6.4 billion. Adjusted revenue in the December quarter fell 6.5% to $1.6 billion, below estimates.Conduent posted a fourth-quarter loss of $4.69 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of 3 cents. Excluding a goodwill impairment charge and restructuring-related costs, Conduent said it earned an unadjusted profit of 29 cents per share vs. analysts' estimate of 23 cents. Analysts estimate that Conduent profit will rebound to 95 cents in 2018 from 75 cents this year. But it notched $1.06 in unadjusted profit last year.With a market valuation of some $3.2 billion, Conduent does not plan to repurchase shares or issue a dividend in the near term. Conduent has told analysts that if cost-cutting generates more free cash flow it could start making small acquisitions in 2018 to expand into new areas.Conduent has moved quickly to reduce its worldwide workforce to 91,000 as of Feb. 15, down from 96,000 at the end of 2016.While shares in Conduent are up about 7% since its spinoff from Xerox, Citigroup says one drag on Conduent stock has been that the company was not added to either the S&P 500 or midcap S&P 400 index post-spinoff, limiting its exposure to index investors.RELATED:Analysts Shoot Down Oracle-Accenture Deal; 'Why Buy The Cow?'

6,XRX,"No. 2 drugmaker Pfizer (PFE) could boost its value by $5 billion in a takeover of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), an analyst said Monday, acknowledging Bristol-specific and macro uncertainties limit the likelihood.Still, it's been a common question ""given some of the challenges Bristol-Myers Squibb is facing and the activist involvement in the name,"" Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan says. Questions of a takeout center on the next nine to 12 months, he said in a note to clients.""Pfizer commentary in our recent 'Meeting with Management' and at other investor conferences makes us think they are certainly looking at all possibilities when it comes to business development,"" he wrote.Overall, Credit Suisse sees Bristol having a positive impact on Pfizer's return on capital. An all-cash deal, assuming Pfizer pays a 25% premium and can extract 30% synergies, would lead to value creation of 80 cents a share.But if Pfizer opts for a cash-and-stock deal, ""dilution from issuing 'undervalued' shares will offset the initial value creation,"" analysts wrote. ""A deal partially financed with an 18% stock issuance would be a break-even for Pfizer shareholders.""IBD'S TAKE: Bristol-Myers has two immuno-oncology drugs approved, meaning it competes against other FDA-approved treatments from Roche and Merck. Head to IBD's Technology page for a breakdown of this drug sector.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Bristol was up fractionally to 56.04 while Pfizer ticked up 0.5% to 34.18. Shares of Bristol have been under pressure this year and are down 4.4% since January.Activist investor Carl Icahn reportedly took a stake in Bristol-Myers in February. Icahn is known for his investments in companies like PayPal (PYPL), Xerox (XRX) and Allergan (AGN). Jana Partners, another activist investor, bought a stake in Bristol in during the fourth quarter.That, compounded with added pressure from the likes of Merck (MRK) and Roche (RHHBY) are adding to macro uncertainties for Bristol-Myers. In February, Bristol lost share in the immuno-oncology market to Merck while Roche remained flat on a month-over-month basis.RELATED:Bristol-Myers Partner Hits 18-Month High On Immuno-Oncology DealMerck Could Be Nearing This Rival With Another Keytruda ApprovalIncyte Spikes To Record High On Rumors Gilead Could Acquire It

7,XRX,"Activist investor Carl Icahn has reportedly taken a stake in cancer biotech Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) following an investment by Jana Partners in Q4, according to inside sources cited by the Wall Street Journal.In after-hours trading after the rumor broke, Bristol-Myers stock edged up a fraction. Shares rose a fraction in Tuesday's regular session, to 54.78, but they're down 27% over the last six months amid investor worries that Merck (MRK) has the upper hand in the lung cancer market.Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo both belong to a class of immuno-oncology drugs that target PD-1 checkpoints in a patient's immune system.

11,XRX,"HP Inc. (HPQ) stock sank on Friday, a day after the PC and printer maker announced plans to cut 3,000 to 4,000 jobs over the next three years and guided to below-consensus earnings and free cash flow for fiscal 2017, which starts Nov. 1.HP stock plunged 4.4% to close at 14.48 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: HP stock has a so-so IBD Composite Rating of 52. It ranks No. 3 out of 16 companies in IBD's Computer-Hardware & Peripherals industry group. To see which company leads the sector, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.At the company's annual analyst meeting on Thursday, HP executives presented their near- and longer-term goals from the company.Based on the midpoint of its guidance, HP expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.60 in fiscal 2017, vs. Wall Street's consensus of $1.61. HP is forecasting free cash flow next year of $2.5 billion, below the Street's target of $2.6 billion.HP raised its dividend by 7% and authorized a $3 billion incremental share-repurchase plan, bringing the total authorized amount to about $4 billion.The planned job cuts will start in fiscal 2017 and run through fiscal 2019. HP expects annual savings of $200 million to $300 million from the restructuring plan starting in fiscal 2020.When HP split from the former Hewlett-Packard nearly a year ago, it had almost 50,000 employees worldwide. But it expected to cut 3,000 jobs in fiscal 2016, which ends Oct. 31.HP CEO Dion Weisler described HP as a ""pillar of stability"" compared with its competition, according to Jefferies analyst James Kisner.""Weisler noted that its competitors are particularly distracted right now; Dell (DVMT) and EMC are merging, Lexmark (LXK) is being sold, Xerox (XRX) may be separating, and Lenovo is distracted with fixing its mobile and server segments,"" Kisner said in a research report. This environment should help HP gain market share, he said.Wall Street gave the HP news generally positive notices. At least four analysts raised their price targets on HP after the event.Kisner maintained his buy rating and 16.75 price target on HP stock.""HP sees fiscal 2017 as a transition year with a focus on stabilizing (its printing supplies business, and) fiscal 2018 is the year to accelerate growth with its key initiatives such as A3 copier and 3D (printing),"" Kisner said.

""These include a change in business mix within (its PC unit to more premium computers), a model to optimize the supplies for (its) printing installed base, Samsung printer deal, and the optionality of 3D printing. While secular challenges in its end markets remain, we believe the valuation remains compelling.""In the PC market, HP is looking to sell more higher-margin machines, such as detachable tablet-notebooks and gaming PCs, as the overall market remains in the doldrums.In the printer market, HP is trying to find ways to improve ink sales and expand into new markets like commercial copiers and printers.CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino kept his buy rating on HP, but raised his price target to 17 from 15.""We expect printer supplies to remain a headwind in fiscal 2017, but note long-term growth initiatives (copier A3 penetration, commercial mobility and 3D printing),"" he said in a report.While several analysts were upbeat following HP's analyst day, others were from Missouri (the Show Me State) and took a wait-and-see stance.Mizuho Securities analyst Abhey Lamba maintained his neutral rating on HP, but upped his price target to 14 from 12.""We walked away (from HP's analyst meeting) acknowledging management's efforts to stabilize the PC and printing businesses,"" Lamba said in a report. ""However, we continue to see macro and secular challenges in these markets and believe HP's go-to-market and selling initiatives are unlikely to yield results in the near term.""Wells Fargo Securities analyst Maynard Um stuck with his market perform rating on HP, yet raised his valuation range on the stock to $14-$15 from $13-$14.BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long said he had ""generally neutral takeaways"" from the analyst day presentations. He reiterated his market perform rating and price target of 13 on HP stock.""Management is executing well on cost reduction and stabilizing the two businesses, but we believe headwinds will continue to dominate the story before the longer-term growth drivers start to contribute,"" Long said in a report.UBS analyst Steven Milunovich maintained his neutral rating on HP, but raised his price target to 15 from 14.""HP manages its business tightly, driving out cost, carefully pursuing profitable share gains in declining markets, and investing in adjacent markets,"" Milunovich said. ""Opportunities in A3 and 3D printing are promising, but will take time.""RELATED:HP Gains On Lenovo In PCs; Apple Mac Sales TumbleHP Stock Gets Price-Target Hike Ahead Of Analyst Day

15,XRX,"The surprise move by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to spin off and merge its enterprise-services division with Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC) could put pressure on IBM (IBM) to respond, analysts say.Shares in Hewlett Packard Enterprise rose 6.7% to 17.34 on the stock market today after HPE late Tuesday announced the tax-free spinoff of its services business. HPE also reported better-than-expected fiscal Q2 earnings, but EPS was still down 2% year over year.“We believe the HPE Services plus CSC transaction will cause Xerox (XRX) services to be looked at as an acquisition target, as well as put pressure on IBM to consider making acquisitions in its services business,” Citigroup analyst Jim Suva said in a report.The combination of HPE’s enterprise services business and Computer Sciences will have about $26 billion in annual sales. The deal is expected to close in March 2017.Jason Kupferberg, analyst at Jefferies, says the HPE-CSC deal has merit.“We believe the combined firm will trail only IBM Global Services and Accenture (ACN) in terms of global IT Services revenue,” Kupferberg said in a report. “While neither CSC or HPE enterprise services are industry growth leaders and have been in turnaround mode, we see strategic rationale for the merger, given the complementary vertical exposures (CSC strong in insurance, health care and banking, with HPE enterprise services known for pharmaceuticals, transportation, and telecom.)”Hewlett-Packard split into two publicly traded companies last November, with HP Inc. (HPQ) due to report late Wednesday. Shareholders of HP Enterprise and CSC will each own half of the new company's shares.Computer Sciences stock shot up 42.2% to 50.68.

17,XRX,"Great corporate managers focus. Joe Wilson was no exception.He really had no choice: Soon after rising to president at Rochester, N.Y.-based Haloid Corp. in 1944, he saw the writing on the wall.Heavy government spending during World War II gave the photographic paper firm’s sales a boost. But with the war over the next year, the young executive saw his company’s profit growth melt under the heat of competition from bigger rivals Agfa, DuPont (DD) and Eastman Kodak (KODK).Haloid had already been forced to stop paying a dividend to stockholders. And if Wilson simply coasted, Haloid likely would have had to let most of its staff go, sell out to another firm or shut down completely.Wilson (1909-71) decided to change his company’s future, so he came up with a radical blueprint.The Empire State native channeled his mind, managerial talent and the energy and skill of his staff into realizing that plan.In the works was the Xerox 914, a product that would showcase innovative photocopying technology and turn Haloid into a business empire of its own.The new product used technology developed by inventor Chester Carlson in the 1930s to 1940s. It took nearly two decades to perfect.Haloid employees, many of whom were seasoned chemists, had to change as well. Wilson never quit inspiring his employees to learn how to design, manufacture and service an intricate electrical machine grounded in optics and physics.When the 914 was finally ready and made its debut in the fall of 1959, it shook the business world.It gave offices the world’s first easy-to-use photocopier that made clean, precise duplicates on ordinary paper -- the first copy in under a minute, then up to seven pages a minute after that. No more dirty, messy carbon copies. No more expensive machines in which creating master plates was hard, exacting work.Wilson’s innovation also made photocopying affordable. Demand exploded.From 1959 to 1965, sales boomed from $33 million to $385 million -- a compound annual increase of 51%. Haloid debuted on the New York Stock Exchange as Xerox (XRX) in July 1961. The name was coined by Wilson after he convinced his staff to market the firm’s new technology as ""xerography,"" hatched from the fusion of the Greek word xeros (or dry) and photography.That year, Xerox’s earnings grew 151%.In the week ended April 5, 1963, Xerox shares broke out of a 12-week, flat-base pattern at 11 (adjusted for a pair of large splits) to new highs. The stock then soared 1,463% to its peak nine years later at 171.88 in August 1972.Today, Xerox remains on the NYSE, with a float of 942 million shares trading back near 11 a share. The company serves customers in over 180 countries in the fields of copying, scanning and document management. In 2015, Xerox earned 98 cents a share on $18 billion in revenue.“More than a half-century ago, Joe Wilson put a premium on imagination and on creating a company where change is a way of life,” Sophie Vandebroek, Xerox chief technology officer and president of Xerox Innovation Group, told IBD. “His leadership at Xerox resulted in both a successful company that transformed business communications and a culture of innovation that continues today.”How did Wilson turn Carlson’s new technology into a commercial gold mine?One key was focusing resources on developing a revolutionary product that would be superior to everything else in the marketplace.Wilson took drastic measures to achieve this. Research spending jumped from $250,000 in 1947 to $2 million in 1958. Xerox accountants constantly fretted over the escalating R&D costs. Wilson never relented, even if it meant cutting costs elsewhere within the company.“The whole bent was toward research,” Jack Hartnett, a former Xerox board member and Wilson confidante, was quoted as saying in Charles Ellis’ “Joe Wilson and the Creation of Xerox.” “It meant sacrifices all along the line. I had no capital expense budget for the sales division of the business for years. No one could buy a chair for an office -- or a typewriter. I had no money. None. No appropriations at all. It all went into research. It had to.”Wilson thought deeply and carefully in choosing Carlson’s patented technology as the engine to carry Xerox forward.His team studied other photocopying processes hard, and they were all less desirable. The diffusion-transfer process had no patent protection, so barriers to entry were low. The Verifax and Thermofax technologies, Wilson decided, would not offer the same quality of copies as Carlson’s electrophotographic technique.A third Wilson key: He ignored skepticism from company outsiders.In the late 1950s, Xerox asked office automation giant IBM (IBM) to help finance and sell the copiers. IBM agreed to hire management consultant Arthur Little to see if the 914 would score in the marketplace. After a nearly yearlong study, Little dismissed Xerox’s product. It was too big and cumbersome to fit inside an office; too costly; too heavy for salesmen in IBM’s typewriter division to transport.Little’s report added that “direct copying had little if any recognizable advantage over duplicating, which was clearly faster,” Ellis wrote.IBM politely refused to join Xerox. That didn’t stop Wilson from believing he had a monster product. One reason: He and his managers came up with a simple yet lucrative pricing model.In 1959, it would have cost a potential Xerox customer $20,000 — $108,000 in today’s dollars — to buy a 914 machine outright. That price tag was a nonstarter.So John Glavin, marketing manager for the 914, came up with a novel idea: New customers, upon receiving the machine for free, would pay a rental fee of less than $100 a month to get 2,000 copies, then pay just 5 cents for every extra copy. No charge for repairs and maintenance.Wilson took a few minutes to think it over, then gave Glavin the green light to proceed.The idea of pricing such a brand new, high-tech product at 5 cents caught fire. Xerox salesmen fashioned buffalo nickels into cufflinks to communicate the message. Over the next two decades, Xerox made incremental improvements in the 914 and later models that reduced the frequency of service visits to customers’ locations. Profit margins bulged.Joe Wilson was born in Rochester, the first son of J.R. Wilson, head of Haloid from 1939 to 1944. Wilson’s mother, Kate, taught Joe polite manners and an early love of reading. The boy grew to love Shakespeare and other literary greats, became class valedictorian at West High School in Rochester, majored in economics at the University of Rochester and earned an MBA at Harvard Business School.After becoming Haloid’s boss, Wilson showed a modern approach to management.Gilbert Mosher, who led Haloid from 1907 to 1939, rode in a chauffeured Cadillac and wore spats and a flower in his jacket buttonhole. He kept no chairs in his office for visitors and demanded employees stand up whenever he entered a room, according to Ellis.Wilson avoided such arrogance. He strove to know every one of his employees by name.He tried hard to boost the employment of racial minorities during the civil rights turbulence of the 1960s.One day, a recent Xerox hire confided to Wilson that he could not take kids from inner-city Rochester on a two-week summer camping trip because he hadn't worked long enough to get the time off. Wilson told him not to worry; the company sponsored the trip.Anne Mulcahy, the CEO at Xerox from 2001 to 2009, learned of Wilson’s strong desire to be a man of his community. In the introduction to Ellis’ book, she noted that when Wilson died at age 61, he had a card in his wallet that carried these words:“To be a whole man; to attain serenity through the creation of a family life of uncommon richness; through leadership of a business which brings happiness to its workers, serves well its customers and brings prosperity to its owners; by aiding a society threatened by fratricidal division to gain unity.”Built Haloid into the corporate giant Xerox, which brought affordable and convenient photocopying to the workplace and the masses.Overcame: Limited financial resources, skepticism from potential corporate partners.Lesson: Envision a product or service that can make business more productive, then make it the most affordable and easy to use.“We believe with Oliver Wendell Holmes that: ‘The mind of man is the only instrument that, when stretched, does not return to its original dimension.’ At Haloid, we stretch our minds through research.”

"
20,XRX,"Take your eye off iconic copier maker Xerox (XRX) for too long -- heck, Xerox stock had done little more than fall since December 2014 -- and you would have missed its run-up to Tuesday's eight-month high at 11.39, up 34% since touching a nearly three-year low in January at 8.48. Xerox stock closed Friday at 11.16, flat for the session.Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha doesn't see much upside potential, giving Xerox a 12-month price target of 11 and a neutral rating in a research note issued Friday. He does see more first-quarter earnings in Xerox, modeling 1 cent more adjusted EPS than Wall Street's 23-cent consensus, which would be up 10% from the year-earlier quarter. Xerox is scheduled to release Q1 earnings before Monday's open.But Garcha sees slightly smaller sales than the $4.24 billion consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. That Q1 consensus would be a 5.1% decline from 2015's Q1 sales and Xerox's 17th consecutive quarter of shrinking year-on-year revenue, albeit slower shrinkage than the 8% decline in Q4 and 10% contraction in Q3.The rise in Xerox stock may be tied to anticipation over its imminent split into two companies: the legacy copier/printer/office machine business and the business-process outsourcing (BPO) spinoff.Based on $18 billion in 2015 sales, down 8% from 2014, the business-machine side would wind up with about $11 billion a year in sales, and the outsourcing spinoff about $7 billion, Xerox CEO Ursula Burns said when she announced the split on Jan. 29, concurrent with the Q4 earnings release. Inspired by activist investor Carl Icahn, Burns said the breakup would unlock value in both companies. Icahn would get three seats on the new BPO board, while Xerox would get six.BPO sales, grouped currently as services under Xerox, is a ""show me story,"" Credit Suisse's Garcha said.""Management is trying to transition the business away from low-margin to more value-added business,"" he wrote in a research note. ""However, we think management has to show consistent improvement and deliver on results to regain investor confidence.""Garcha anticipates a Q1 decline of 5.4% to $2.4 billion in services revenue.As for the so-called ""document technology"" core hardware, software and document management businesses, Garcha estimates that about $1.6 billion of Xerox's annual cost of goods sold are ""yen-denominated,"" coming from the Fuji Xerox joint venture (75% owned by Fujifilm (FUJIY)). With the yen up about 9% year to date, foreign exchange ""will impact margins,"" but less than was earlier expected, Garcha said.For Q1, Garcha forecasts document tech segment revenue fell 12% to $1.6 billion.Not all of Xerox outsourcing will be part of the BPO spinoff. Document outsourcing, which fell 2% to $852 million in Q4 revenue, will stay with the larger portion of the split, a Xerox spokesman told IBD.Effective April 1, Xerox borrowed $1 billion unsecured from a consortium of seven banks to be repaid within a year or upon execution of the spinoff, whichever comes first. Xerox says the spinoff should be complete before year-end.With a market cap of $11.3 billion, Xerox is the fourth-largest member of IBD's Computer-Hardware/Peripherals industry group, following Canon (CAJ), the newly reorganized HP Inc. (HPQ), and Fujifilm.Xerox carries a middling 66 IBD Compositing Rating. Its formidable BPO rivals, Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) and Infosys (INFY) rate better, with CRs of 75 and 80, respectively.

The S&P 500 managed a gain of almost 1%. But those totals are a little misleading. The market fell hard through the first six weeks of the year.

22,XRX,"As President Obama stands beside Cuban President Raul Castro in Havana and brokers historic talks to thaw relations between the two countries, online travel giants and other Silicon Valley titans have set their sights on building businesses on the island nation.The $8.4 billion tourism industry is likely to swell once Washington allows general tourism to the island nation. For now, a license from the Treasury Department is required for legal travel to Cuba, but the online travel kings have been quick to strike deals to build sales to that nation.Still, online travel firms shouldn't expect any big returns on their efforts for three to five years, says Douglas Quinby, an analyst with travel research firm Phocuswright.""But once all the ducks are lined up, I think you’re going to see a lot of interest for U.S. travelers,"" Quinby told IBD. ""It’s a huge Caribbean destination, it’s got great beaches and sun.""Online travel giant Priceline (PCLN), via its Booking.com platform, already is setting up shop in Havana and allowing U.S. citizens to reserve and pay for rooms at Cuban and foreign-owned hotels.""Members of our leadership spent many weeks working hand in hand with the Cuban government and tourism authorities, hotel partners, and banks to ensure that when we launch a few weeks from now our customers will experience the secure and seamless service they’ve come to expect from Booking.com,"" Todd Dunlap, managing director of Booking.com Americas, told IBD via email.Expedia (EXPE) is working on getting travel to Cuba online as well -- though it did not share a timetable or a specific date that bookings could begin.""We currently have a team working across multiple channels to help enable U.S.-to-Cuba travel, taking every step to ensure that the solutions align with the laws governing travel between the countries,""  Expedia spokeswoman Sarah Gavin said in an emailed statement.Privately held Airbnb has been operating in Cuba for a year, and is available to U.S. citizens in Cuba. The San Francisco-based firm lets travelers rent homes, rooms in homes and apartments.According to an Airbnb blog post, U.S. visits to Cuba rose 77% in 2015, to 161,000.The company says it's working closely with the Cuban government.TripAdvisor (TRIP) spokeswoman Julie Cassetina told IBD via email that the company is ""now displaying hotel metasearch for Cuban hotels"" on its website, but she declined to make executives available for an interview.Outside of the online travel agency kings, the tech contingent included IBD Leaderboard stock PayPal (PYPL). In a blog post Sunday, PayPal CEO Dan Shulman outlined his case for targeting Cuba.The major cash cow for the firm is likely to be in assisting Cubans who receive money from sources in the U.S., an influx which at the moment, according to the blog, accounts for $2 billion, or 3%, of the Cuban economy each year. It's a chance for PayPal to expand the reach of its Xoom subsidiary, which handles international transfers. PayPal bought Xoom for $890 million in July 2015.The blog also makes the pitch that PayPal plans to find ways to attract Cuban small businesses -- which at the moment are mostly not set up to process credit and debit cards.Privately held Stripe, which competes with PayPal payments-processing subsidiary Braintree, also made the trip to Cuba. Stripe said in a blog that it would start offering Cuban businesses the ability to set up bank accounts and incorporate in the U.S.On the trip, President Obama said Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google would try to help ensure that Cubans have access to broadband Internet, which remains scarce, especially outside of large cities.""We know, from the experience of many countries around the world, that new technologies and improved internet access can help people in their daily lives, provide new information and experiences, and help harness a country’s creativity and ingenuity,"" Brett Perlmutter, the Cuba lead for Google Access, wrote in a blog post Monday. ""We hope to have the chance to offer more services to the Cuban people in the future.""Xerox (XRX) CEO Ursula Burns also attended the trip in a fact-finding capacity.""Recent changes in U.S. regulations may afford new commercial opportunities in Cuba,"" Burns told IBD in an emailed statement, ""but the parameters of those opportunities are not always obvious. The U.S. government has worked hard to describe what the recent changes mean. I think part of my job on this trip is to evaluate what they mean in light of the economic realities here in Cuba.""

23,XRX,"Highly rated business process outsourcing firm Cognizant Technology Solutions gapped down 8% after the Monday stock market opening bell, shortly after management disappointed investors with guidance lower than Wall Street expected for the first quarter and 2016.Cognizant (CTSH) beat analysts estimates for Q4 earnings growth and came in short of analysts' revenue expectations. Its stock fell as low as 53.46 early Monday in a rough market, 23% below its all-time high 69.80 reached Oct. 28. Shares were down 7% midday in the stock market today.Cognizant stock enjoys a high IBD Composite Rating of 90, meaning it's performing better than 90% of stocks across a variety of metrics. That's a hair better ranking than its larger business process outsourcing (BPO) rivals Infosys (INFY), somewhat better than Accenture (ACN) and far better than IBM (IBM). Like Cognizant with huge operations in India, Infosys was down 5% at midday Monday. Accenture about 4.5% and IBM was off 1%.A new concern for BPO companies -- not that they haven't been competing already -- is Xerox's (XRX) BPO spin-off, announced just 10 days ago. Xerox has been offering outsourcing for years, but as a free-standing publicly traded company its BPO is likely to receive heightened attention in the market. Cognizant declines to discuss Xerox, a spokeswoman said. Xerox stock was down about 5% at midday.Cognizant said the current Q1 earnings per share should reach 78-80 cents on revenue of $3.18 billion to $3.24 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters thought Cognizant could do better on earnings, expecting adjusted EPS up 12% to 81 cents from 71 cents a year ago, on sales up 14% to $3.319 billion from $2.911 billion in Q1 2015.For Q4 2015, Cognizant said it earned 80 cents per share minus items, up 19.4% from 67 cents a year earlier, on revenue up 17.9% to $3.23 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had on average been expecting 78-cents EPS minus items on $3.24 billion in revenue.""Our cash and investment balances, net of debt, grew by $1.5 billion during 2015 due to our strong business performance and strong cash flows,"" said CFO Karen McLoughlin in Cognizant's earnings release. She said Cognizant spent more than $375 million buying back stock in 2015, ""reflecting our commitment to drive shareholder value.""Said President Gordon Coburn: ""While digital opportunities significantly expand our addressable market, our rapidly growing consulting, infrastructure and business process services and geographic market expansion, continue to be solid drivers of demand for our services.""Cognizant and Infosys recovered in December from heavy flooding in Chennai, India, where they employ tens of thousands of workers.

24,XRX,"Xerox and activist shareholder Carl Icahn announced Friday that Xerox will split into two companies by spinning off its business-processing outsourcing (BPO) activities to shareholders, typically intended as a tax-free transaction alternative to selling a spin-off.The shrinking Xerox (XRX) -- once ubiquitous for its revolutionary photocopiers but now struggling as people rely more on digital documents on screens rather than paper documents -- has not increased annual revenue since 2011, when sales hit $22.6 billion after it bought Affiliated Computer Services.Also Friday, Xerox disclosed fourth-quarter adjusted earnings up 3% to 32 cents per share, its first quarterly earnings gain in a year and 4 cents better than the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. But that was on revenue down 8% to $4.653 billion. Analysts had expected $4.728 billion. For the year, adjusted earnings fell 8.4% to 98 cents per share on sales down 7.7% to $18.045 billion, the company reported before the market open.Xerox stock was trading up 6.5% to near 10 in afternoon trading in the stock market today, but was still 30% off a 14.02 high set Feb. 20. The stock hit a 31-month low of 8.48 on Jan. 20.Xerox stock carries a weak IBD Composite Rating of 43, meaning about 57% of publicly traded stocks are performing better. Competitors for investor capital in its industry include highly rated Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH), which carries a near-perfect 98 CR, and Infosys (INFY) with a 94 CR, among others.Cognizant stock was up about 3% and Infosys was up 3.5% in afternoon trade Friday.Business process outsourcing revenue, according to Xerox's 2015 financials, slipped 4% to $1.786 billion in Q4, compared with a year earlier, amounting to 38% of Xerox's total sales. Document outsourcing, down 2% to $852 million in Q4, will remain with Xerox, a spokesman told IBD.Xerox's BPO sales are smaller than Cognizant's, which generates about $3 billion quarterly, and Infosys', which does about $2.4 billion quarterly.The BPO ""decline was primarily driven by the anticipated run-off of the student loan business and our third-quarter 2015 decision to not fully complete the Health Enterprise implementations in California and Montana,"" Xerox said in its earnings release. ""Partially offsetting this decline was moderate acquisition contribution and organic growth in several lines of business.""Xerox said BPO revenue came 45% from business groups excluding health care, 27% from the public sector, 15% from commercial health care accounts and 13% from government health care.Xerox Chair and CEO Ursula Burns said the deal with Icahn ""ensures that we will have strong leadership and best-in-class governance for the new (BPO) Business Process Outsourcing company.""Said Icahn: ""We strongly believe that an independent BPO company with fresh, focused leadership and best-in-class corporate governance will greatly enhance shareholder value. . . .”They said the new company board will have six directors appointed by Xerox and three named by Icahn. A committee named by Xerox has begun searching for an ""external candidate"" to be the BPO CEO.

27,XRX,"Apple (AAPL) missed Wall Street’s December-quarter sales targets for iPhones, iPads and Mac computers, so it tried to focus attention on its robust services business.Apple stock was down 6%, near 94, in late-afternoon trading on the stock market today as investors reacted to the company’s fiscal-first-quarter results and Q2 guidance announced late Tuesday. At least nine analysts cut their price targets on Apple stock following the earnings release.In the quarter ended Dec. 26, Apple earned $3.28 a share, up 7.2% year over year, on sales of $75.87 billion, up 1.7%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Apple to earn $3.23 a share on sales of $76.54 billion.For the current quarter, Apple’s fiscal Q2, the Cupertino, Calif.-based company expects sales of $50 billion to $53 billion. The midpoint of its sales guidance would represent an 11.2% year-over-year drop in revenue. Wall Street had been modeling for Q2 sales of $55.48 billion. Apple, though, is known for giving cautious guidance.Here are five key takeaways from the Apple report:With sales of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers losing steam, Apple executives late Tuesday attempted to divert attention to the company's fast-growing services business.On the earnings conference call with analysts, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company recently crossed a major milestone of having 1 billion devices in use. That’s up 25% year over year, he said.The fast-growing installed base of devices has fueled Apple’s services business, which include the App Store, iTunes Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and AppleCare.Apple generated $6.06 billion in service revenue in Q1, up 26% from the year-earlier period. That sum included $548 million received from Samsung as part of a patent infringement dispute.Excluding the patent award, Apple’s services revenue was up 15% to $5.5 billion, thanks in part to strong growth in app sales, Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said on the call.UBS analyst Steven Milunovich wondered if Apple emphasizing its services business is a good or bad thing.“The investor concern is that companies like Xerox (XRX) and semi-cap names start talking about services as they are going ex-growth,” Milunovich said in a research report Wednesday.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani echoed those concerns.“The fear is: Is Apple showing (its) services/recurring revenue stream because iPhone units have peaked and market is saturated?” he said in a report Tuesday.Apple presented a “sobering” view of the global economic climate in its quarterly report, Mizuho Securities analyst Abhey Lamba said in a report Wednesday.“Apple’s commentary about the macro (economic picture) will likely have an impact on the entire technology space,” Lamba said. “As such, we expect cautious outlook from most of the companies as they report over the next few weeks.”Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said Apple’s tone spooked investors.“While we were expecting some level of cautious macro commentary given the volatility in global stock markets, decline of commodity prices and uncertainty in the Chinese economy, the level of caution described by Apple was greater than we would have expected,” Munster said in a note Tuesday. “In our review of the earnings call transcript, we noted cautious macro commentary nine times in the prepared remarks and four cautious comments in the Q&A. This compares to one cautious macro related comment in the September-quarter call in October.”Cook said Apple’s results were impressive given the global macroeconomic environment.“We’re seeing extreme conditions, unlike anything we’ve experienced before, just about everywhere we look,” Cook said. “Major markets including Brazil, Russia, Japan, Canada, Southeast Asia, Australia, Turkey and the eurozone have been impacted by slowing economic growth, falling commodity prices and weakening currencies.”Even Greater China, which had been holding up for Apple, started showing of economic softness this month, most notably in Hong Kong, Cook said.Apple’s December quarter sales would have been up 8% year over year if not for the impact of foreign-exchange rates. Apple generates 66% of its revenue outside the U.S., and so foreign-currency fluctuations have a meaningful impact on its business.To illustrate, Cook said $100 of Apple’s non-U.S. dollar revenue in Q4 of 2014 translated to only $85 last quarter due to the weakening currencies in international markets.“Since the end of fiscal 2014, for instance, the euro and British pound are down double-digits, and major currencies such as the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Mexican peso and Turkish lira have declined 20% or more. The Brazilian real is down more than 40% and the Russian ruble has declined more than 50%,” Cook said.Apple managed to eke out growth in its iPhone business in the December quarter, but just barely. It sold 74.78 million iPhones in Q1, up 0.4% from the same quarter a year earlier.But even Cook admits that iPhone sales will fall in the current quarter. That would mark a first for the iconic product, introduced in 2007.Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said Apple’s Q2 guidance seemed to indicate a 15%-20% unit decline in iPhones. He asked Cook on the conference call about his estimate.“We do think that iPhone units will decline in the quarter,” Cook responded. “We don’t think that they will decline to the levels that you’re talking about.”Still, other analysts agreed with Sacconaghi on the scale of the iPhone unit decline in Q2.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves said he expects iPhone unit sales to decline 20% year over year in Q2, but that will likely be the low point of the cycle.Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha is projecting sales of 45.6 million iPhones in the March quarter for a 25% year-over-year decline.FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi expects Apple will sell about 48 million iPhones in the March quarter. Before Apple’s latest report, Wall Street analysts on average were modeling for 55 million units, he said.Apple is rumored to be developing virtual reality or augmented reality technology for future products.One analyst asked Cook what he thought of virtual reality technology in general.“I don’t think it’s a niche,” Cook said. “It’s really cool and has some interesting applications.”Apple recently hired Doug Bowman, previously the director of the Center for Human-Computer Interaction at Virginia Tech. Bowman joins a growing team of virtual and augmented reality experts at Apple, following the company’s acquisitions of Faceshift, Metaio and Emotient, the Verge reported.In their post-earnings reports, a number of analysts said the lack of a new growth driver will weigh on Apple stock.Apple stock is likely to be “range-bound” in the near term because of “limited catalysts” to get investors interested, Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner said in a report Wednesday.With uninspiring sales of the Apple Watch so far, “investors could legitimately start to question innovation” at Apple, Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri said in a note Wednesday.Arcuri rates Apple stock as market perform, with a price target of 125.In addition to the innovation concern, Arcuri is worried about slowing growth in China and whether the iPhone 7, expected this fall, will be a compelling handset.“What we know about iPhone 7 is evolutionary, not revolutionary,” he said. An OLED screen could be the next big innovation for the iPhone, but that’s not going to happen until 2018, he said.

29,XRX,"Stock futures bobbed in narrowly positive territory ahead of Friday's open, as the market prepared for a short post-holiday trading session. Dow futures traded 14.6 points above fair market value and had halved their gains over the prior hour. Nasdaq 100 futures doubled their hour-earlier gains to 18 points.

76,XRX,"Synaptics, a force in fingerprint recognition and touchscreen technology, finished calendar 2014 with a bang, and its CEO tells IBD that the company is poised for continued robust growth amid rising global demand for smartphones and tablets.It's not without some cutting-edge competition, however.The San Jose, Calif.-based company earlier this year posted earnings of $1.46 per share for the quarter ended in December 2014, ex special items, a 70% jump from a year earlier. Sales surged 125% to $464 million. For its fiscal 2015 third quarter, ending in late March, Synaptics (SYNA) projects sales of $450 million to $490 million. At the midpoint of that forecast, sales would more than double from a year earlier.Synaptics President and CEO Richard Bergman said in an interview that the company has, over the past few years, deftly made the transition from a PC-focused firm to one with a broader approach that resulted in a dominant position devising ever-advancing technology for mobile devices. Its interface software is designed to bolster the user experience and security for smartphone and tablet owners.Smartphones ConnectAbout 86% of Synaptics' sales derived from mobile products in the December quarter, compared with 14% from PC products, including notebook computers. Three years ago, Bergman says, PC sales accounted for about 50% of revenue. He says sales linked to PC products have only inched down in that time, meaning Synaptics has maintained share in that arena while producing whopping growth in the mobile field to shift its revenue mix to capitalize on high demand.""I'm proud of how we've been able to cross that bridge,"" he said.Synaptics should keep enjoying ""the leading position across high-end smartphones, particularly with content on three leading OEMs (Apple (AAPL), Samsung, Xiaomi),"" Cowen & Co. analyst Robert Stone said in a research note on March 2.Samsung unveiled its high-end Galaxy S6 smartphone at the start of the month. It goes on sale April 10.""Improved Galaxy S6 designs, area fingerprint sensors and Samsung Pay should drive unit growth"" for Synaptics, Stone wrote, adding that he thinks some touch technology in that phone, a touch controller, is by STMicroelectronics (STM).Synaptics' blue-chip customers, he notes, include nine of the top 10 notebook original equipment manufacturers — all but Apple — and that Synaptics' designs are in phones or tablets by the likes of Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi, LG, Sharp and others.Synaptics is part of the Computer-Hardware-Peripherals industry group and has a Composite Rating of 95 from IBD, making it a group leader along with Apple, Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI). It's seventh-largest in the group by market value, after Apple, Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), Canon (CAJ), Fujifilm Holdings (FUJIY), Xerox (XRX) and Zebra.Synaptics carved out a dominant position in fingerprint recognition with its so-called ""swipe"" sensor, embedded in smartphones — including high-end offerings from Samsung — and other devices. This technology works as the name implies: a user swipes a finger or thumb across the sensor and it reads the fingerprint, serving as a higher level of security than typing in a password. Fingerprint Log-Ins EvolveBergman says Synaptics will continue to develop advancing versions of the swipe sensor while it simultaneously rolls out new developments in ""area"" technology, expected to be a key driver of growth in the year ahead and beyond. With an area sensor, users merely touch a finger in a designated area on the device — a simpler process than swiping and one that affords faster reading of the fingerprint to unlock phones, tablets and computers.Synaptics already is mass-producing area sensors, Bergman says, and the company anticipates they will be increasingly adopted by numerous mobile producers over the course of calendar 2015.""We expect several announcements as we go through the year,"" he said.In his March 2 research note, analyst Stone mentioned Synaptics' announcement ""that the small area 4 x 10mm fingerprint sensor is now in mass production"" while describing the Samsung Galaxy S6.""We estimate that the dollar content per phone (for Synaptics) should be slightly higher compared to the GS5, as the area fingerprint sensor should be worth more than the combination of touchscreen controller and swipe sensor on the GS5,"" Stone wrote.The new fingerprint readers, analysts say, could boost growth in mobile as well as in the PC business. Such advances are in high demand as consumers in the U.S., Europe and Asia increasingly access online services such as retail, banking and social media portals, amplifying the appeal of easy-to-manage security measures and providing Synaptics with a long-term growth driver.Market research firm IHS recently predicted that the global volume of fingerprint sensor-enabled devices would balloon from 317 million units at the end of 2014 to 1.4 billion units by 2020.Synaptics is ""always focused on product improvement and solid execution,"" Liwen Zhang, an analyst at Blaylock Beal Van, told IBD. ""I think they will continue to do well, continue to deliver.""Fingerprint recognition is one of ""two pillars of growth going forward"" for Synaptics, Bergman said. The other is touch display driver integration, or TDDI, which combines into a single chip both touch control and the technology used to display the screen on computers and mobile devices.This simplifies design, resulting in thinner touchscreens and brighter displays. It also reduces the number of components needed in the manufacturing process, trimming costs and providing Synaptics' customers added incentive to invest in the chips. Synaptics estimates that more than half of all smartphones will have a display-integrated touchscreen by the end of this year.TDDI Chips Fire UpIn a billion-unit-per-year business, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy said, Synaptics' forecast means the TDDI chips could soon be in some 500,000 smartphones, adding ""that's a pretty big market.""The TDDI advance grew out of Synaptics' 2014 acquisition of Renesas SP Drivers, or RSP, a supplier of display drivers for smartphones and tablets. Synaptics combined RSP's display expertise with its own, aiming to lift the caliber of TDDI and accelerate its adoption.Bergman said that near-term, Synaptics is squarely focused on its efforts in fingerprint recognition and TDDI and doesn't have more acquisitions on its front burner.Deals could help the company drive future growth, he said, adding, ""we will continue to look.""The December-quarter results were the first to include the acquisition of RSP, which contributed about half of Synaptics' sales. Without RSP, sales would have grown about 10% vs. a year earlier.The vast majority of what Synaptics produces gets sold into Asia, where PC and mobile devices are typically manufactured. Though he did not have a geographic breakdown, Bergman said the end products that contain Synaptics' technology are sold all over the world, from the U.S. to Europe to China.The latter is where Synaptics is now seeing tremendous growth. It expects that to continue, Bergman said, not only due to China's massive population but also because the average resident there is gaining spending power, fueling demand for new tech-driven products.""We have a big emphasis on China,"" he said.Qualcomm ChallengesAnalysts note that competition in the tech world, particularly when it comes to those working on mobile devices, is fierce and presents a prominent possible downside for Synaptics. Just this month, chipmaking giant Qualcomm (QCOM) announced new technology that uses ultrasonic sound waves to read fingerprints, even more seamlessly than what is already being rolled out by Synaptics and Apple's own in-house efforts for its iPhones. Qualcomm has said its Snapdragon Sense ID 3D Fingerprint Technology can read fingerprints when a finger is wet or dirty, for instance. Analysts covering Synaptics point to the company's long history of innovation and of staving off competitive pressures.It has operated in the touchpad space for 15 years and has long maintained a roughly two-thirds market share in the segment, Cassidy said. The company, he added, gets ahead of competition and stays there by constantly developing new technology while finding ways to do so at reasonable costs. Its acquisition of RSP, he said, gives it significant added scale that should enable it to continue to produce on these fronts. On Qualcomm specifically, Cassidy said it remains to be seen how well the new offering will be received by consumers and, perhaps more important, whether the technology can be brought to market at a favorable price. He said Qualcomm's decision to go with the technology ""adds a lot of credibility to it,"" but pricing of smartphone components is ""very sensitive,"" as makers of the phones are in heated competition to deliver innovation at attractive rates.""I don't think anyone new to the (fingerprint recognition) market is going to make a shift in who controls volume for at least another year,"" he added.Longer term, Cassidy said, he expects Synaptics to become a force in developing technology for touchscreens in cars and, eventually, in other areas of consumers' daily lives, from appliances to products that have yet to be invented.""I think they are going to be the survivor throughout all of this,"" Cassidy said of Synaptics. ""They've proven that they always find a way.""Synaptics' stock is up 17% so far this year.

135,XRX,"Joe Wilson had one little problem in trying to launch the Xerox copier in the late 1950s.His early machines sometimes caught on fire.He couldn't exactly tell prospects not to worry, since each came with an extinguisher.Wilson's solution was, naturally, to build machines that didn't light up — but also to show how easy they were to operate.He used a chimpanzee to make copies at demos. That changed the conversation and revolutionized business communication.Today, Xerox (XRX) brings in $22 billion annually from a wide range of copying and digital printing products and consulting services. And its stock, struggling since 1999, has almost doubled in the past year.Wilson (1909-71) grew up in the family business, Haloid Photographic Co., which sold photo-sensitive paper at a lower price than its Rochester, N.Y., neighbor, film giant Eastman Kodak.His grandfather, J.C. Wilson, who founded the company in 1906 and became mayor, inspired young Joe with his self-discipline and will power.The LearnerWilson developed an appetite for reading at an early age. By the time he was an adult, he was consuming two books a week, able to quote Shakespeare and Plato for insight into solving business problems.After graduating from the University of Rochester in 1931, Wilson spent two years getting an MBA from Harvard. He then joined Haloid as a management apprentice to his father, J.R., granddad having died in 1930.The next year, Haloid acquired control of Rectigraph Co., which had a primitive process to produce document copies without using photographic paper.Wilson married Peggy Curran in 1935 and was good about not bringing his work home. Later, as head of the company, he insisted that all calls from his children be put through so they didn't feel business was more important than family.In 1936, Wilson was put in charge of hiring, and displayed an extraordinary ability to remember and understand people. Even after Xerox became a global corporation, he would astonish line workers by asking for updates on family matters.Naturally shy, Wilson hated speaking in public, but forced himself to give as many speeches in the community as he could accommodate. He would eventually be regarded as one of the most eloquent business leaders of his time.Although Haloid's sales rose from $3.9 million in 1940 to $9.7 million in 1949, its profit margin was cut by half because its photo paper was out of date. Meanwhile, it struggled to create an affordable copier that could be used in offices.Kodak and 3M (MMM) already had image transfer machines, although they were slow and required expensive, special paper. Wilson wanted his firm to pass them.He was in a position to do so, having become Haloid's president in 1945 (later adding the CEO title) when his father retired. Knowing he had to re-invent the company, he had his research director, John Dessauer, comb trade publications for product ideas.Right up there was a process developed by a Columbus, Ohio, lawyer named Chet Carlson.In 1938 he transferred an image on a page without chemicals or special paper by creating a picture with an electrostatic charge (like plastic wrap that clings to your hand) on a drum, using dry powder to make the picture visible.Carlson approached 34 companies, including IBM (IBM) and General Electric (GE), to make a copying machine in partnership, but they all passed. Finally, in 1944 he signed an agreement giving 60% of any revenue to Battelle Memorial Institute, a nonprofit research lab in Columbus, for further development. Battelle named the process xerography, Greek for dry writing.Wilson and Dessauer visited two years later and agreed to pay $25,000 to Battelle each year, plus 8% of future revenue, if Haloid was able to develop a photocopier based on Carlson's principles.No one knew that producing a commercially viable machine would take 13 years and $92 million (worth $750 million now), wrote Charles Ellis in ""Joe Wilson and the Creation of Xerox.""The company survived by doing research for the U.S. military and licensing other companies to use its increasing number of patents for niche products. It saved every penny, working in tiny, shabby offices and using subcontractors for manufacturing. Wilson mortgaged his house, while Haloid borrowed $1 million from a bank and $3 million from an insurance company.""Wilson had studied corporate finance at Harvard and understood the importance of demonstrating consistently prudent financial discipline, having clearly articulated business plans designed to capitalize on opportunity and matching this with actions, so lenders would have confidence,"" wrote Ellis. ""Wilson's priority was not sales or profits, but cash flow, and he was a stickler for accuracy, which appealed to bankers.""In 1958, the firm changed its name to Haloid-Xerox, since it was banking on xerography, and aimed to launch its 914 machine, which would make one duplicate on 9-by-14-inch paper in 22 seconds.Big And ExpensiveWhen the 914 came out in March 1960, it had 1,260 components, weighed 650 pounds and cost $29,500 (worth $230,000 today).Most companies couldn't afford that, so Wilson made a crucial call: He would lease the copier at $95 per month.The 914 and Wilson's strategy vaulted Xerox ahead of the pack. Other companies came up with 40 competing copiers, but they were slower, difficult to use, required special paper and proved more expensive per copy.Forbes magazine, which had dismissed Wilson as a dreamer in 1957, now reported, ""He is nothing if not a big thinker,"" as noted by the editors of Forbes' ""Greatest Business Stories of All Time."" ""Potentially, Xerox is not so much a company as an industry.""The firm's revenue leapt from $31 million in 1959 to $59 million in 1960. By 1962, 10,000 machines had been installed across America and the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange with its new name, Xerox Corp.It turned into a sensational stock winner, rocketing 3,300% into the early 1970s.The Right PriceXerox helped its cause by cutting the cost of the 914 dramatically in 1965. Making the machine for $2,400, the firm leased it for $25 a month at 4 cents per copy. The average user made 8,000 copies, so Xerox collected $4,500 per machine each year. It had 60,000 installed by 1965, for 61% of the copier market, and revenue soared.Photocopying changed daily life in innumerable ways:• Dozens of employees working on a project could easily circulate status reports for comments.• Government departments were able to distribute new policies to workers quickly.• Teachers could pass out copies of lessons, while students no longer had to tediously write down information from reference books.• Doctors could give patients an X-ray on paper for 5 cents instead of making another original for $5.Xerox continued to spend heavily on innovation. It filed its 500th patent in 1966, when it used $40 million for research and development out of its $500 million in revenue. The company reports that it now has 11,500 active U.S. patents.Also in 1966, the number of copies made using all brands of machines stood at 14 billion, a massive rise from 20 million in the mid-1950s.Xeroxing was now a generic term for making copies. The company fought this term, preferring the less catchy ""copying on a Xerox Brand copying machine.""Wilson stepped down as CEO in 1968, becoming chairman. In 1970, Xerox revenue reached $1.5 billion. The next year he died at 61.""Wilson was an inspiration to everyone to persevere, taking calculated risks with a daring vision of creating the office of the future,"" George Cook, who worked at Xerox for 32 years and is now a professor at the University of Rochester's business school, told IBD.Today Xerox has 140,000 employees in 160 countries and is headquartered in Norwalk, Conn.

136,XRX,"The world looked a bit flat from a market standpoint early Tuesday, with global markets and commodities largely unmoved and stock futures steering the U.S. market toward a mixed open.Dow futures were down 65.4 points, with IBM (IBM) pulling hard to the downside. S&P 500 futures were off a fraction. Nasdaq 100 futures were up 5.4 points.The focal point of the stock market today. Microsoft (MSFT), Yahoo (YHOO) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) also report after the close, as do a number of leading stocks, including Blackhawk Network (HAWK), Illumina (ILMN) and GoPro (GPRO).The economic calendar is blank Tuesday, but big names in motion after early earnings reports included Verizon (VZ) (down 2%), Travelers (TRV) (up 2%), Lockheed Martin (LMT) (unchanged) and United Technologies (UTX) (down 4%).IBM dragged 5% lower after reporting its Q2 earnings beat but revenue fell slightly more than analysts had expected. It was the tech giant's 13th straight quarter of declining revenue, and profit margins in its software division — the source of about half the company's profit — narrowed during the quarter. IBM shares have been in a gradual uptrend since January, fighting to climb out of a 10-month consolidation.Tesla Motors (TSLA) slumped nearly 4% ahead of the open. The stock may have been nicked by a UBS downgrade to sell, in a note that reportedly questioned the company's battery storage and auto delivery targets. Shares rose almost 3% in strong trade Monday. The stock is extended after a rebound from 10-week support and above a 258.85 cup-with-handle buy point.India-based software engineer Infosys (INFY) surged 12%. The country's second largest software developer reported better-than-expected Q2 earnings and raised its full-year revenue guidance above consensus expectations.Management said the company signed six contracts during the quarter with a total value of $688 million. Infosys has been consolidating sine February and battling to retake its 10-week line of support for the past five weeks.The dollar was mixed and commodities were generally flat. Mining stocks, which had dragged hard on the S&P 500 on Monday, were rebounding, with Agnico Eagle (AEM), Barrick Gold (ABX), Yamana Gold (AUY) and Newmont Mining (NEM) posting solid premarket gains.

149,XRX,"First Data Corporation (FDC  -  Free Report) yesterday announced a strategic deal with Navient Corporation (NAVI  -  Free Report) wherein First Data will act as the primary technology solutions provider for Navient’s federal and private education loans. As part of the deal, First Data will also purchase Navient’s student loan technology platform.Currently, both the companies carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Navient is one of the leading providers of business processing and asset management solutions for education, healthcare, and government clients. The company’s offerings include customer service, back office support, data insights, default prevention and other related services.The deal will enable First Data to enjoy a competitive position in the student loan technology market, while leveraging its technology and expertise for the said purpose. To better cater to demand, it will introduce First Data Education, which will be run by Jeff Whorley. Jeff has been Navient’s Group President, Asset Management and Servicing. He will become a member of First Data’s Management Committee.The deal, subject to certain closing conditions, is anticipated to close in third-quarter 2018. It is an expansion of a long-term alliance between the two companies to support private student loans.Growing GFS SegmentWe believe the partnership with Navient will perfectly complement First Data’s capabilities in the student loan technology industry, while boosting its Global Financial Solutions (GFS) segment. GFS provides technology solutions for all types of financial institutions.The segment accounts for almost 21-22% of the company’s total reported yearly revenues. In 2017, it accounted for almost 22% of total revenues, which marked an improvement from a contribution of 21% in 2015. Additionally, in first-quarter 2018, revenues from this segment grew 2% on a reported and comparable accounting basis and 1% on an organic constant-currency basis to $400 million.Further, the GFS segment continues to grow with the help of new deals, partnerships and renewed agreements, globally.The company recently expanded its partnership with Lloyd's Banking Group and signed an agreement to provide processing services for the group's recently acquired MD&A portfolio with more than 3 million accounts. First-quarter 2018 witnessed the renewal of some processing agreements globally such as Finance Informatic in Germany, Alior Bank in Poland, DBS in Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Indonesia and two leading banks in the Middle East. Expansion of partnership with SBI Card on Jan 25, 2018 - a leading credit card issuer in India - has expanded the company’s client base and is likely to boost the top line.Price PerformanceIn the last six months, shares of First Data have returned 16.8%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 2.9%. We believe First Data’s focus on globalizing its offerings, acquisitions and strategic partnerships along with a healthy business around large and small banks have acted as the major driving factors behind the company’s impressive price performance.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Avis Budget Group, Inc.

151,XRX,"Stocks in the Business Services industry have been strong performers of late, reflecting overall favorable trends. These are expected to further drive the companies in the near- to medium-term.GDP Growth to AccelerateGross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.3% in the first quarter of 2018, following 2.6% gain in the fourth quarter of 2018, per the “advance” estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.The slowdown in growth was mainly due to seasonal quirk and economists expect growth to accelerate in the second quarter. Lower corporate and individual tax rates along with increased government spending are expected to push annual economic growth to the 3% target.Significant Job Additions The industry, which offers intangible products, has immense employment opportunities as it requires both skilled and unskilled labor for its smooth functioning.In April, unemployment dropped to 3.9%, the lowest since December 2000, indicating that the labor market continues to be robust.Meanwhile, U6, the most rigorous metric of unemployment in the U.S., declined to 7.8%, its lowest level in 11 years. This measure takes into account individuals who are not searching for employment or those who are working part time since they cannot secure full-time employment.Payrolls were added for 91 straight months, the longest streak since the Labor Department started tracking this data in 1940s.At the forefront of jobs gains last month was professional and business services, which added 54,000 jobs. Over the year, the sector has added 518,000 jobs. Manufacturing and healthcare sectors added 24,000 jobs each in April. Job additions in mining amounted to 8,000. Broadly, the Trump administration’s business-friendly approach, a strong U.S. economy, reduced tax rates, robust manufacturing and non-manufacturing activity, and improvements in the labor market and higher government spending should support additional hiring and wage gains this year. Global ExpansionMajor business services companies are exploring growth opportunities abroad, especially in the growing markets. Recently Avis Budget Group’s (CAR  -  Free Report) subsidiary Avis Car Rental announced its relaunch in Japan at Chitose International Airport on Hokkaido Island. The move is Avis’ latest strategy to enhance its global footprint by focusing on growing markets, which are witnessing rising car rental demand.First Data Corporation (FDC  -  Free Report) has designed its business segments in a manner that supports global expansion. Appropriate segmentation of business allows the company to strengthen its client base and further globalize its offerings. The company’s comprehensive offerings include retail point-of-sale, e-commerce services, credit solutions, next generation offerings such as mobile payment services, webstore-in-a-box solutions, cloud-based point-of-sale operating system and value-added solutions. First Data has made steady progress with its SMB turnaround plan, which is expected to boost the company’s North American merchant business.Cost ReductionAll business operators prefer to minimize cost of operation and maximize margins. The business services industry offers cost-effective services that would otherwise be far more expensive for companies.With specialized services, these providers reduce operational cost and, in turn, lower the overall cost of companies. Notably, a higher number of companies opting for such specialized services would increase volumes for service providers. This would eventually lead to services at lower costs and a further reduction in costs for companies, thereby fueling margin expansion.Our data shows that Business Services margins have consistently grown in the past few quarters and will likely retain the momentum in the near term too. Importantly, Business Services margin expansion is better than that of S&P 500 Index.Key PicksTop-ranked stocks in the business services space include First Data Corp., Avis Budget Group and Xerox Corp. (XRX  -  Free Report). While Avis Budget currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), First Data and Xerox carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.First Data reported strong first-quarter 2018 results, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate on earnings and revenues. Innovative product and services portfolio and expanding enterprise business continue to drive growth.Avis Budget’s first-quarter 2018 results also surpassed the consensus mark on both counts. The company continues to benefit from higher demand, strong pricing and increased efficiency in business.Xerox reported mixed first-quarter 2018 results, wherein the company’s bottom line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line surpassed the same. Check out our latest “Business Services Industry Outlook” here for more on the current state of affairs from an earnings and valuation perspective as well as the trend for this important industry.Bottom LineGiven an improving economy, the business services industry is likely to be a worthy investment proposition in the near-to-medium term.Rise in GDP, a better employment scenario, inflation approaching 2%, easing of the U.S. dollar and momentum in oil prices are all signs of improvement of the U.S. economy, which in turn should boost the business services industry. Trump’s business-friendly policies, including tax cuts and repeal of regulations, are additional tailwinds.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

154,XRX,"Per a Reuters report, Xerox Corporation (XRX  -  Free Report) might be charged a fine of more than $1 billion by FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation (“Fujifilm”) for ending the previously announced merger with Fuji Xerox and inking a new deal with its two activist investors —Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason.Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd. (“Fuji Xerox”) is a joint venture between Xerox and Fujifilm, wherein the latter holds a 75% interest and Xerox holds the remaining 25% stake. Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason are two of Xerox’s investors who together hold a 15% ownership stake in XeroxFujifilm has accused Xerox of violating the contract, thereby bowing to the pressure from Icahn and Deason. The lawsuit, filed in theU.S. District Court in Manhattan, also calls for a merger termination fee of $183 million, per the report.Following this news, share price of Xerox fell 0.6% to $27.24 per share on Jun 18. Moreover, a glimpse at Xerox’s price trend reveals that the stock has had a disappointing run on the bourse lately. Shares of Xerox have declined 6.6% against the industry’s gain of 4.6% year to date. Course of EventsOn Jan 31, 2018, Xerox and Fujifilm inked a definitive deal worth $6.1 billion to combine the Fuji Xerox joint venture with Xerox. Per the deal, Fujifilm would own 50.1% of the combined company. However, the company’s decision was challenged by its two largest shareholders who not only claimed the Fujifilm deal to be undervalued but also demanded the resignation of the then CEO.In April, the two investors won a court case and succeeded in temporarily blocking the Fujifilm deal. On May 13, Xeroxended the proposed merger with Fuji Xerox due to delay in the delivery of audited financials of Fuji Xerox within the stipulated date of Apr 15. The company also noted discrepancies in the audited and unaudited financial statements of Fuji Xerox.Additionally, Xerox inked a new deal with Icahn and Deason and madechangesto the board of directors. Five new members namely Jonathan Christodoro, Keith Cozza, Nicholas Graziano, Scott Letier and John Visentin were appointed, replacing Robert J. Keegan, Charles Prince, Ann N. Reese, William Curt Hunter and Stephen H. Rusckowski. Gregory Brown, Joseph Echevarria, Cheryl Krongard and Sara Martinez Tucker continue to serve as members of Xerox’s board.On May 16, John Visentin was appointed as the chief executive officer (CEO) of Xerox, replacing Jeff Jacobson. Visentin was also elected as Vice Chairman of the company’s board of directors. Keith Cozza became the new chairman of Xerox’s board of directors. The company’s 2018 annual shareholders’ meeting is scheduled on Jul 31.In view of the latest development, we expect investor focus to remain on the burning issue.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Xerox is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

155,XRX,"Reportedly, FUJIFILM Holdings (FUJIY  -  Free Report) has sued Xerox (XRX  -  Free Report), demanding more than $1 billion for scrapping the $6.1 billion merger deal announced in January this year.Fujifilm and Xerox had agreed to combine the latter into the existing joint venture – Fuji Xerox – which would have given the former a majority stake in the new entity. Fujifilm currently owns 75% stake in the 56-year old joint venture that operates in Asia with Xerox.Xerox’s board called off the deal after activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, who together own about 15% stake, stated that the deal undervalued the company. Among other things, the company also cited unresolved accounting issues with Fujifilm as a reason to end the merger.Notably, Fujifilm seeks damages for breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and a finding that Fujifilm is entitled to a $183 million termination fee, per a Bloomberg report.Scrapped Deal to Hurt FujifilmThe Fuji-Xerox joint venture contributes revenues to the Document Solutions business of Fujifilm. However, the segment has witnessed declining revenues on lower demand for the office printer business.Apart from providing support to the Document Solutions business, the acquisition would have increased Fujifilm’s presence in 3D smart printers market. Notably, Fuji Xerox generates 53% of revenues from Japan alone. According to a IDC Japan report, about 85.7% of the companies in Japan are using 3D printers to develop prototypes.Moreover, Fujifilm had estimated the deal to deliver at least $1.7 billion of cost savings and $1 billion of new revenues annually. However, the company lost these synergies after Xerox decided to walk out.The termination of the deal has also hurt Fujifilm’s share price. On a year-to-date basis, the stock has lost 5% compared with industry’s decline of 1.5%.Portfolio Strength to Help Fujifilm’s ReboundWe expect Fujifilm’s expanding portfolio based on acquisitions to help the stock rebound in the rest of 2018.The buyouts of Irvine Scientific Sales (ISUS) and IS JAPAN (ISJ), both subsidiaries of JXTG Holdings, to expand Fujifilm’s product portfolio in the cell culture media market, which is projected to grow 10% annually.Moreover, robust performance of the Imaging Solutions and Healthcare & Material Solutions is expected to be the primary growth driver going forward. Stronger medical systems and electronic materials businesses are expected to drive Information Solutions’ growth.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Fujifilm has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Ricoh Co. (RICOY  -  Free Report), holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

157,XRX,"While a steady U.S. economy and President Trump’s reformative announcements are acting as tailwinds for the markets, heightened tensions related to trade war remain a major concern.Fears of a trade war between the United States and its trading partners have been around since March. It all started with Trump’s announcement of imposing 25% tariff on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports on America’s biggest allies —  European Union, Canada and Mexico.America’s trading partners retaliated by targeting its products worth billions of dollars. The European Union intends to hit back with higher tariffs on roughly $7.5 billion worth of U.S. exports and file a legal notice against American measures at the World Trade Organization. Canada’s retaliatory tariffs on $12.8 billion worth of U.S. exports will be effective from Jul 1. Mexico is also set to impose a 20% tariff on U.S. pork and ham imports in response to Trump’s steel and aluminum import levies, per Reuters.Relations between China and United States have been tensed for a while, with the latter announcing a hefty 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods. The final list of Chinese goods subject to new import taxes is expected to be announced tomorrow. Trump also plans to restrict Chinese investment in U.S. companies and limit the number of goods that these companies can sell to China. China retaliated by announcing tariffs on U.S. goods (including soybeans, aircraft and vehicles) worth $50 billion.Adding fuel to the ongoing trade tensions, the Trump administration initiated a national security investigation into whether automobile imports are harming U.S. national security. The investigation, under Section 232, is the same tactic used by the Trump administration before it imposed global tariffs on steel and aluminum import earlier this year. The public hearings for the aforesaid investigation into auto imports is expected to be held around Jul 19-20.Given these developments, tensions over trade policy are most likely to escalate again in the coming months. All these events are hinting toward a global trade war.What’s Going in Favor of the Business Services Sector? As tensions over trade policy intensify, the business services sector stands to gain from the growing U.S. economy. This is because it is firmly tied to manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities that are currently benefiting from the all-round strength in the economy. The sector has recorded the highest jobs, with an addition of 483,000 jobs in the past 12 months.In May, the sector added 31,000 jobs, the second highest among all sectors.Economic activity in the manufacturing sector expanded in May as PMI measured by Institute of Supply Management (ISM) touched 58.7%. This shows strong growth in manufacturing for the 21st consecutive month, driven by continued increase in new orders, production activity and employment. Of the 18 manufacturing industries, 16 reported growth in May.As far as the non-manufacturing sector is concerned, NMI was 58.6% in May, recording the 100th consecutive month of expansion. This expansion was driven by continued increase in business activity, new orders, employment, inventories, prices and supplier deliveries. Out of the 18 non-manufacturing industries, 14 reported growth.Although U.S. economic growth decelerated in the first quarter to an annualized pace of 2.2%, after averaging higher than 3% in the previous three quarters, the economy is likely to rebound in the coming quarters. Income tax cuts along with increased government spending are expected to push annual economic growth to the 3% target.Additionally, the current 18-year low unemployment rate of 3.8% recorded in the month of May further raises optimism about the economy.6 Stocks to Secure Your Portfolio Amid Trade War TensionsGiven the promising developments in the business service sector, adding stocks from the sector looks like a smart move to safeguard your portfolio amid trade war fears.The buoyancy in the sector is further confirmed by its Zacks Sector Rank in the top 44% (7 out of 16 sectors). Additionally, we observe that the sector has performed well in the past year compared with the benchmark. It has gained 22.5%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500’s rally of 13.7% in the said time frame. With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed in on six promising stocks from the sector. These stocks have a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), a VGM Score of A or B and solid expected earnings growth rate for the current quarter and year.

"
161,XRX,"The business services industry’s outlook is a function of the health of the broader economy, which is currently quite favorable.A rise in GDP, an improving employment scenario, inflation approaching 2%, easing of the U.S. dollar and momentum in oil prices are all signs of improvement in the U.S. economy, which in turn is positive for the business services industry. The Trump administration’s business-friendly policies, including tax cuts and the repeal of regulations, are additional tailwinds.The Zacks Business Services Industry has performed well in the past three months compared with the benchmark. It has gained 3.9%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500’s rally of 0.6% in that time frame. The stand-alone Zacks sector that covers this space – the Zacks Business Services sector – has gained +7.9% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the S&P’s +2.6% gain.What’s in Favor for Business Services?Stronger GDP a Key CatalystGross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.3% in the first quarter of 2018, following 2.6% gain in the fourth quarter of 2018, per the “advance” estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.The slowdown in growth was mainly due to seasonal quirk and economists expect growth to accelerate in the second quarter. Lower corporate and individual tax rates along with increased government spending are expected to push annual economic growth to the 3% target.Tax Cuts, Trump’s Business Friendly MovesThe Trump administration remains focused on improving the ease of doing business as evident from the recent tax cuts. The historic overhaul of the tax structure to reduce tax liabilities from 35% to 21% has given a boost to corporate earnings, investments and in some instances reflected in employee rewards. In addition, Trump’s pledge to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years and regulatory rollbacks remain tailwinds.Employment and Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing ActivityThe employment index registered growth of 54.2% in April, which indicates employment growth in April for the 19th consecutive month. Of the 18 manufacturing industries, 12 reported employment growth. The increase came as companies are hiringmore skilled workers and indirect personnel.Economic activity in the manufacturing sector expanded in April and the overall economy grew for the 108th consecutive month. U.S. manufacturing activity continued its robust performance in April as the PMI measured by ISM touched 57.3%. This shows strong growth in manufacturing for the 20th consecutive month, driven by continued increase in new orders, production activity and employment and inventories. Of the 18 manufacturing industries, 17 reported growth in April.As far as the non-manufacturing sector is concerned, NMI stood at 56.8% in April, recording the 99th consecutive month of expansion. While the Prices Index gained 0.3% to 61.8%, the Employment Index declined 3% to 53.6%. As many as 18 non-manufacturing industries reported growth.Continuous upsurge in the PMI, NMI as well as greater number of jobs offered by manufacturing giants buoys further optimism.What are the Headwinds?Expenses on a HighBusiness service providers need to stay abreast of the latest technologies, which involves continued spending on research and development. Moreover, training of unskilled workers or taking in new skilled workers increases operational costs, in turn affecting margins. Since skilled workers are always in demand, there is the possibility of a high turnover rate, which further adds to cost.Higher labor costs due to a competitive labor market are expected to continue keeping profits under pressure. For example, Avis Budget (CAR  -  Free Report) or Budget continues to face hurdles like high fleet costs and unfavorable currency headwinds. Though the company is progressing well with its disciplined pricing initiatives and expects these to offset the rising fleet costs, we would wait to see more pronounced results on this front before turning optimistic.Competition IntenseMaintaining or increasing market share remains challenging for business service providers. As discussed earlier, the main business of one company can be a business service for another. So, target customers for both may at times be the same. Strategic mergers and consolidations also pose competition for players.Therefore, business service providers need to be adequately equipped to win over customers. While larger providers bank on the broad variety of service offerings and can effectively take up difficult ventures, relatively smaller players compete in an industry backed by specialized services.Zacks Industry RankWithin the Zacks Industry classification, hotel companies are broadly grouped under the Consumer Discretionary sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors).We rank 265 industries into 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. We put our X industries into two groups: the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).In fact, ourback-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by more than twice as much. The Zacks Industry Rank for Business - Services industryis currently #201 (bottom 21%).The ranking is available on the Zacks Industry Rank page.Earnings TrendsSo far, the first-quarter 2018 financial performance for business services companies has been encouraging. While First Data Corp. (FDC  -  Free Report) surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues, Xerox (XRX  -  Free Report) beat the consensus mark for revenues but missed on earnings.Earnings prospects for Q1 are encouraging with the sector expected to be up 22.6% from the year-earlier level on 6.8% higher revenues.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Valuation PictureLooking at the industry’s trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, the space’s valuation picture remains rich. The sector is currently trading at 25.3X trailing 12-month earnings. Over the last 5 years, the sector has traded as high as 25.8X and as low as 19.8X, with a median of 23.1X. The S&P 500 index is currently at 20X trailing 12-month earnings, with the broader index’s 5-year high, low and median at 21.9X, 15.3X, and 18.1X, respectively.Looking at forward estimates, the sector is currently trading at 21.5X forward 12-month earnings estimates. Over the last 5 years, the sector has traded as high as 22X and as low as 17.2X and 5-year median of 19.4X. The S&P 500 is currently trading at 17X, with the index’s high, low and median of 19.1X, 14X, and 17.1, respectively.In other words, the sector’s valuation picture is far from attractive.Bottom LineThe U.S. economy is now improving and population continues to increase in a nation. The business services industry, being labor intensive, involves lower capital investments and confidently addresses the issue.While emerging nations are becoming important destinations for business services, these economies pose challenges to employment growth in developed economies. However, given the inherent strengths, the business services space has enough steam left to drive the engine toward growth.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

162,XRX,"Xerox Corporation (XRX  -  Free Report) announced its decision to end the previously announced merger with Fuji Xerox due to a delay in the delivery of audited financials of Fuji Xerox by the stipulated date of Apr 15, 2018. The company also noted discrepancies in the audited and unaudited financial statements of Fuji Xerox.Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd. (“Fuji Xerox”) is a joint venture between Xerox and Fujifilm, wherein Fujifilm holds a 75% interest and Xerox holds the remaining 25% stake.Additionally, Xerox inked a new deal with its two investors – Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason – who together hold a 15% ownership stake in Xerox. The new settlement is expected to resolve the pending issue related to its 2018 annual shareholders’ meeting, along with the legal disputes against its directors in connection with the proposed combination with Fuji Xerox.Terms of the New DealFive new members namely Jonathan Christodoro, Keith Cozza, Nicholas Graziano, Scott Letier and John Visentin will be replacing Robert J. Keegan, Charles Prince, Ann N. Reese, William Curt Hunter and Stephen H. Rusckowski.Gregory Brown, Joseph Echevarria, Cheryl Krongard and Sara Martinez Tucker will continue to serve as members of Xerox’s board.Cozza — the former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Icahn Enterprises L.P. — is likely to be the new chairman of Xerox. Visentin will be replacing Jeff Jacobson as the company’s new CEO.Additionally, Xerox and Icahn have agreed to withdraw their board candidates from the upcoming shareholder meeting.Course of EventsOn Jan 31, 2018, Xerox and FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation (“Fujifilm”) inked a definitive deal worth $6.1 billion to combine the Fuji Xerox joint venture with Xerox. Per the deal, Fujifilm would own 50.1% of the combined company.However, the company’s decision was challenged by its two largest shareholders - who not only claimed the Fujifilm deal to be undervalued but also demanded the resignation of the then CEO.In April 2018, the two investors won a court case and succeeded in temporarily blocking the Fujifilm deal. With the recent termination of the merger, it seems like they have finally won the battle. Not only did they settle for a new contract with Xerox but also succeeded in making necessary changes to its board of directors.Zacks Rank & Price PerformanceCurrently, Xerox is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

166,XRX,"Xerox Corporation (XRX  -  Free Report) has a post-sale driven business model and is currently going through a three-year Strategic Transformation program.In the first quarter of 2018, the company reported mixed results. Adjusted earnings per share of 68 cents were up by a penny from the year-ago quarter but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. Total revenues came in at $2.43 billion, which outpaced the consensus mark of $2.38 billion. However, the top-line figure decreased 0.8% year over year on a reported basis and 4.6% on a constant-currency basis.Xerox’s earnings surprise history has been impressive, having surpassed the consensus mark in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 6%. For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged at 92 cents over the past 30 days.Strategic Transformation ProgramXerox has a track of record strong margins, which it has been attaining through cost and productivity initiatives. In 2016, the company initiated a three-year Strategic Transformation program with an aim to achieve productivity and cost reduction beyond the historical range of $300 to $350 million of annual savings. Targeted areas include delivery, sales productivity, remote connectivity, pricing optimization, supply chain optimization and design efficiency. In the first two years, Xerox achieved more than $1.2 billion in gross productivity gains and cost savings and expects approximately $475 million of additional cost reductions in 2018. The company targets achievement of approximately $1.7 billion in savings over the three-year period.We believe that the program will help the company improve its earnings and revenues and in turn lift its share price.  The stock has gained 0.1% in the past year compared with the 5% gain of the industry it belongs to.   Post-Sale Driven Business ModelXerox has a post-sale driven business model that leads to significant recurring revenue and cash generation. In 2017, more than 75% of the company’s total revenues stemmed from post-sale revenues encompassing equipment maintenance, document services, consumable supplies and financing. This business model supports strong cash flows that help the company to make strategic investments and penetrate in markets with high growth potential.SMB Coverage ExpansionXerox continues to expand its Small and Mid-sized (SMB) coverage through distribution acquisitions. In 2017, the company acquired Ohio-based multi-brand dealer MT Business Technologies an, and two other multi-brand dealers in North and South Carolina and Iowa. These acquisitions opened up market opportunities for the company in large metropolitan regions. Moreover, the company has significantly expanded internationally, with a footprint across approximately 160 countries. We believe expansion of SMB coverage will help Xerox improve its top line going forward.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderXerox currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other top-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report), The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (DNB  -  Free Report) and TransUnion (TRU  -  Free Report).

170,XRX,"The big banks had an easier run this earnings season, with a combination of fewer litigation charges, tighter cost controls and modest improvement in core businesses giving earnings a boost despite constrained revenues as a result of the tough interest rate backdrop. But the going is a lot tougher outside of the Finance sector.
"
171,XRX,"The fact that growth is so challenged isn’t much of a surprise given what we saw on the estimate revisions front ahead of the start of this earnings season. But it is disappointing to see so fewer companies beat revenue estimates despite the low expectations. We must acknowledge however that revenue beat ratios have picked up a bit lately after remaining at extremely low levels earlier.
"
172,XRX,"The list of headwinds isn’t new - the strong U.S. dollar and global growth issues have been persistent themes in earnings reports lately. Even the mighty Google’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) report showed plenty of currency issues in an otherwise strong showing, with investors cheering the search giant’s uncharacteristic cost discipline.

174,XRX,"This week’s reporting docket represents a blend of bellwethers from different sectors, ranging from ‘growthy’ names like Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) to smokestacks like Dow Chemicals (DOW) and plenty of others in the middle. By the end of this week, we will have seen Q2 results from 37% of the S&P 500 members, with the trends established already getting fully confirmed by then.
"
175,XRX,"The key earnings reports this week include:Monday (7/20) –Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) will be the key report in the morning, while IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) will report after the close.Tuesday (7/21) – The spotlight today will be on Apple (AAPL), with the iPhone maker joining Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Yahoo (YHOO) to report after the close on a busy reporting day with 23 S&P 500 members coming out with quarterly results.Earnings ESP, our proprietary leading indicator of earnings surprises, is showing Apple coming out with an earnings beat. Our research shows that stocks with Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) coupled with positive Earnings ESP are highly likely to beat EPS estimates. Apple currently has Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and Earnings ESP of +5.03%.Wednesday (7/22) – The notable companies among the 27 S&P 500 members reporting today include Boeing (BA) and Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), both before the market’s open.Earnings ESP is showing Boeing beating EPS estimates.

If we are looking at a stock that has reported that morning, then the day before price is compared to the intraday price on the release date.

178,XRX,"Figure 1: 2015 Q2 Scorecard (as of 7/17/2015)Putting Q2 Results in Context  
"
179,XRX,"Figure 2 below shows the comparison of the results thus far with what we have been seeing from the same group of 61 companies in other recent quarters.
"
180,XRX,"Figure 2: 2015 Q2 Results Compared
"
181,XRX,"The left-hand side chart compares the earnings and revenue growth rates for these 61 S&P 500 members with what these same companies reported in the preceding quarter and the average growth rates for these companies in the preceding four quarters (the 4-quarter average is through 2015 Q1). The right-hand side chart does the same comparison for these 61 S&P 500 members, but compares only the earnings and revenue beat ratios.
"
182,XRX,"Here are the takeaways from looking at this chart:
"
183,XRX,"The earnings growth rate (+2.9%) is notably weaker compared to other recent quarters.
"
184,XRX,"Similar to the earnings growth pace, the revenue growth rate (+0.8%) is below what we saw from this group of companies in Q1 (+2%) as well as in the 4-quarter average (+3.3%).
"
185,XRX,"The earnings beat ratio (69.4%) is below what we saw from this group of companies in Q1, but about in-line with the 4-quarter average.
"
186,XRX,"The revenue beat (43.5%) ratio is better than what these same companies reported in the preceding quarter, but notably below the 4-quarter average. Please note that the revenue beat ratio started out even weaker than Q1, but has been improving lately.The Finance Effect
"
187,XRX,"Total earnings for the 41.1% of the Finance sector’s market cap that has reported results are up +11.7% on essentially flat revenues (down -0.1%), with 68.8% beating EPS estimates and 50% coming ahead of top-line expectations. This is better performance than we have seen from this group of Finance sector companies in other recent quarters.
"
188,XRX,"Figure 3 below compares the Finance sector results thus far with what we have been seeing from the same group of companies in other recent quarters.
"
189,XRX,"Figure 3: Finance Sector Q2 Results Compared
"
190,XRX,"Please keep in mind that a big part of the +25.6% earnings growth for the sector in the preceding quarter was thanks mostly to easy comparisons at Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report).
"
191,XRX,"Adjusted for the Bank of America results, Q2 earnings growth for the sector is tracking better relative to the recent past. Revenues of course are a different matter, as briefly referred to earlier. These results have been better than expected, as the right-hand side chart above shows.Comparing the ex-Finance Results
"
192,XRX,"Given this discussion of Finance sector results, it would probably make sense to look at the results thus far on an ex-Finance basis. Figure 4 below recasts the earlier Figure 2 on an ex-Finance basis.
"
193,XRX,"Figure 4: Q2 Results Outside of Finance compared
"
194,XRX,"Comparing Figure 4 with Figure 2 shows:
"
195,XRX,"That the earnings and revenue growth rates outside of Finance are weaker than what we have been seeing in other recent quarters.
"
196,XRX,"That the earnings beat ratio is about in-line with what we had seen from this group of ex-Finance companies in other recent periods, while the revenue beat ratio is modestly above Q1 levels but below historical levels.The Composite Picture for Q2
"
197,XRX,"Figure 5 below presents the composite summary picture for Q2 contrasted with what companies actually reported in the 2015 Q1 earnings season. Basically, the table below presenting Q1 as a whole, combining the actual results from the 61 S&P 500 members that have reported with estimates from the still-to-come 439 index members.
"
198,XRX,"Figure 5 – The Composite Summary Picture
"
199,XRX,"As you can see in the above summary table, total Q2 earnings are expected to be down -4.6% from the same period last year on -4.8% lower revenues, with Energy as the biggest drag on the growth rate. Excluding Energy, total earnings for the remainder of the S&P 500 index would be up +2.4% on +1%. Among the major sectors, Finance and Medical are big growth contributors this quarter, with Finance sector earnings expected to be up +10.5% and Medical earnings up +7.3%. Overall, 9 of the 16 sectors are expected to see earnings decline from the same period last year.   Putting Q2 Growth Expectations in Context
"
200,XRX,"Figure 6 below shows current consensus earnings growth expectations for the coming quarters contrasted with what is expected for Q2 and what was actually achieved in Q1. As you can see, not much in expected in the second half of the year either. But the growth pace is expected to materially ramp next year, with full-year 2016 earnings expected to be up in double digits.
"
201,XRX,"Figure 6: Quarterly Earnings Growth estimates
"
202,XRX,"These optimistic looking expectations for the outer periods isn’t unusual – Wall Street analysts always tend to be more optimistic about the future. But estimates start coming down as the period in question comes closer. The erosion of 2015 growth estimates was driven largely by what happened to the Energy sector. But estimates for other sectors came down as well……………and we will likely see something similar to current 2016 estimates as well.Note: Want more articles from this author?

205,XRX,"HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) delivered another quarter of stellar performance wherein its revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while earnings matched the same. Moreover, the company’s revenues increased for the seventh consecutive quarter, out of which the last six recorded double-digit growth after a prolonged period of decline. Also, the Personal Systems and Print segments’ performance improved for the fifth straight quarter, after 2010.In fact, the company’s outstanding results for the last few quarters substantiate that the spin-off from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report), along with its diligent restructuring initiatives, is finally paying off.HP’s total revenues climbed 13% year over year to $14 billion and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.6 billion. The better-than-expected top-line performance was driven mainly by strength in the Personal System and Printing segments, as well as successful product roll outs.The company’s bottom-line results were also impressive, wherein its non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations of 48 cents per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, and came toward the higher-end of management’s guided range of 45-49 cents. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP earnings improved 20%. The robust bottom-line performance was mainly backed by higher revenues and lower share counts.HP Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise HP Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | HP Inc. QuoteQuarter in DetailThe Personal Systems segment generated revenues of $8.8 billion, up 14% year over year, mainly driven by strong demand for high-end products and a 7% rise in prices.  While commercial revenues increased 16%, consumer revenues were up 10%.We believe the spin-off from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, and restructuring initiatives, such as focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, are ultimately paying off.Notably, International Data Corporation (IDC), in its latest report on first-quarter 2018 PC shipment, stated that this quarter marked the eighth consecutive quarter of overall shipment growth for HP.Coming to the Printing business, the segment’s revenues were up 11% year over year to $5.2 billion, primarily stemming from an 8% increase in supplies revenues and inclusion of the recently-acquired business of Samsung’s printing (S-Print) business. It should be noted that the buyout of S-Print has helped HP in the $55-billion high-end copy-machine market where Xerox Corporation (XRX  -  Free Report) is currently the leader.HP’s total hardware unit sales grew 13%, backed by the Consumer hardware unit’s increase of 4% and the Commercial hardware unit’s year-over-year growth of 88%. The robust growth in Commercial hardware units chiefly stemmed from the recent inclusion of S-Print business.Region wise, the company registered double-digit growth in every region it operates. Revenues from Americas were up 7% year over year. While revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) climbed 21%, the same from the Asia Pacific and Japan region jumped 13% year over year.Gross margin expanded 10 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 19.3%. This was primarily supported by increased pricing and improved mix in the Personal Systems segment, which more than offset elevated component costs, particularly the NAND flash chips.Non-GAAP operating expenses flared up 16% year over year to $1.7 billion. This was mainly due to the inclusion of the S-Print business, and increased investment in research and development, as well as go-to-market sales strategies.Non-GAAP operating margin from continuing operations remained flat year over year at 7%, as benefit from improved gross margin was fully offset by elevated operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. HP’s non-GAAP net income from continuing operations came in at $798 million compared with $685 million reported a year ago.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowHP ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $4.2 billion compared with $5.5 billion recorded in the previous quarter. The company had long-term debt of $4.5 billion compared with $6.3 billion reported in the last reported quarter.The company generated cash flow of $2 billion from operational activities during the first half of fiscal 2018. HP repurchased shares worth $1.3 billion and paid dividends worth $457 million, during the same time frame.GuidanceBuoyed by improving market share across the PC and Printer businesses, HP raised its non-GAAP earnings guidance for fiscal 2018. The company now estimates non-GAAP earnings to lie between $1.97 and $2.02, up from the earlier guidance of $1.90 and $2.00. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.93.On the cost front, the company anticipates that overall component and logistic costs for Personal Systems will escalate throughout fiscal 2018. Moreover, from the beginning of the fiscal second quarter, the company has been witnessing rise in material costs in the Printing segment, which are expected to continue flaring up in the second half of the fiscal too.Coming to the fiscal third quarter, HP projects non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations in the range of 49-52 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 49 cents.Our TakeWe are impressed by the performance of HP’s PC segment, wherein the year-over-year increase can be attributed to growth in Commercial and Consumer revenues. Additionally, the company’s efforts to turn around its business have been commendable. Meanwhile, it has been working on product innovation, differentiation and enhancing the capabilities of its printing business to stabilize the top line.The latest PC shipment data by IDC indicates that HP’s restructuring initiatives, including focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, divestment of non-core assets and cutting jobs to lower costs, are paying off gradually. Per the data compiled by IDC, the company witnessed year-over-year shipment growth for the seventh quarter in a row, after witnessing declines for five consecutive quarters.With the commencement of the shipping of A3 multifunction printers to more than 80 countries, which covers all its key markets, HP is likely to revive the company’s printing business and grab a bigger share in the inkjet printer market. Also, the acquisition of Samsung’s printing business is anticipated to support the development and manufacturing of printers.Nonetheless, prices of components such as DRAM and NAND are likely to remain high in 2018, which will continue to drag down the company’s margins. Although the company’s strategic efforts are driving top-line growth, those might not be enough to offset this incremental cost.Moreover, competition from the likes of Lenovo, Dell and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) is another key concern.HP currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

210,XRX,"FUJIFILM Holdings (FUJIY  -  Free Report) continues to focus on rapid expansion of its footprint in the fast growing healthcare sector.Apart from investments in developing research & development (R&D) infrastructure and partnerships, the company is also making strategic acquisitions. These buyouts are expected to drive growth in the healthcare market.FUJIFILM recently announced the buyouts of Irvine Scientific Sales (ISUS) and IS JAPAN (ISJ), both subsidiaries of JXTG Holdings Inc., for almost $800 million. The acquisition expands its product portfolio in the cell culture media market, which is projected to grow 10% annually.We note that strong growth in the Imaging Solutions (19.8% of total revenues) and Information Solutions (39.8% of total revenues) segments has been the primary growth driver in the last reported quarter.Information Solutions segment increased 12.3% year over year, primarily driven by stronger medical systems and electronic materials businesses. We believe the expanding product portfolio will boost company’s market share in the healthcare market, consequently driving top-line growth.FUJIFILM has returned 2.3% in the past year, compared with the industry’s decline of 21.8%. Acquisitions Expand Cell Culture Media OfferingBoth ISUS and ISJ are well-known providers of cell culture media, which is essential for cell culturing in the R&D and manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals and regenerative medicine products.Notably, FUJIFILM acquired Wako Pure Chemical Industries, a leading reagent manufacturer, in April 2017, to enter the cell culture media market. The company has also acquired Cellular Dynamics International, biotechnology firm, to expand its healthcare offerings.Cell culture media market is anticipated to grow on solid demand for biopharmaceuticals that are focused on antibody drugs and the increasing need for treatments using cells.The latest acquisitions will aid FUJIFILM to offer products for biopharmaceutical production, in vitro fertilization and cell therapy. Moreover, the buyout will increase the company’s distribution capabilities in the United States and Europe.Healthcare Offers Strong Growth OpportunitiesFUJIFILM has also forged partnerships to solidify its position in the healthcare market. Recently, the company collaborated with Takeda Pharmaceutical for inventing newfangled regenerative medicine therapies for the treatment of heart failure.FUJIFILM is also set to invest ¥4 billion in the pharmaceutical manufacturing site of its group company, Toyama Chemical. Moreover, the company is launching the Bio-Science & Technology Development Center for conducting R&D activities for its biopharmaceuticals business.Xerox Deal Remains an OverhangIn January 2018, FUJIFILM and Xerox Corporation (XRX  -  Free Report) inked a definitive deal worth $6.1 billion to combine the FujiXerox joint venture with Xerox. Per the deal, Fujifilm will own 50.1% shares of Fuji Xerox that will continue to trade with the same name on the NYSE.However, the deal has been heavily criticised by activist investors — Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason — who own more than 10% of Xerox. Both the investors believe that the deal significantly undervalues Xerox.The expected proxy fight between FUJIFILM and activist investors is likely to hurt share price momentum at least in the near term.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderFUJIFILM has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Micron (MU  -  Free Report) are stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector. Both sport Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

212,XRX,"Is the Earnings Improvement for Real?
"
213,XRX,"The Finance sector gave us a good start to the 2014 Q2 earnings season. It isn’t ‘good’ in terms of growth – there is not much of that for the big banks and brokers. There weren’t many surprises on the net interest margins, trading volumes, and mortgage business fronts – they have been weak for a while and we saw more of that in Q2 as well. What came as a pleasant surprise were signs of modest improvement in lending and investment banking.
"
214,XRX,"These improvements coupled with tight cost controls resulted in better than expected result for the Finance sector. As the charts below ‘beat ratios’ for the sector shows, the 42% of the sector’s market capitalization that have reported Q2 results are overwhelming coming out with positive surprises.
"
215,XRX,"With results from the big banks and brokers now behind us, attention in the sector will shift to the insurance industry which will start reporting this week. Overall, total earnings for the Finance sector companies that have reported are essentially flat (up only +0.2%) on modestly lower revenues (down -0.6%).
"
216,XRX,"The composite (or blended) Q2 picture for the sector, combining the actual results for the 17 companies that have reported with estimates for the still-to-report 63 companies, is for earnings growth of +2.9%. This is better than pre-season estimates and the sector’s Q1 performance when earnings were down -7.1% from the same period last year. Hopes remain high that the sector will resume its growth trajectory in the coming quarters, as the chart below shows.
"
217,XRX,"These growth projections reflect aggressive estimates for the sector, but the strong results thus far in Q2 has likely increased confidence in these estimates.Earnings Calendar (week of July 21)
"
218,XRX,"Next week’s reporting calendar (the week of July 21) takes us into the heart of the Q2 earnings season this week with almost 600 companies reporting results, including 141 S&P 500 members. This week’s line-up of reports spans the entire breadth of the U.S. economy – from Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) to Coke (KO), Ford (F), Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report) and a lot more in the middle.
"
219,XRX,"With a little over a tenth of the Q2 results already in, we can say that the reporting season is off to a good start. By the end of next week, we will know definitively how good this earnings season has been.The Scorecard Thus Far (as of Thursday evening, July 17th)
"
220,XRX,"Total earnings for the 73 S&P 500 members that have reported results are up +5.5% from the same period last year, with a ‘beat ratio’ of 68.5% and a median surprise of +3.5%. Total revenues are up +3.8%, with a revenue ‘beat ratio’ of 50.7% and a median surprise of 1.4%.
"
221,XRX,"In terms of growth rates and beat ratios, this is better performance than what this same group of 73 companies reported in Q1. The performance thus far even compares favorably with the 4-quarter average, as the chart below shows.  The grorwth rate compared
"
222,XRX," The beat ratios compared Expectations for 2014 Q2
"
223,XRX,"The composite (or blended) growth picture for Q2, combining the actual results for the 73 companies that have reported with estimates for the 427 still-to-come reports, shows total earnings increasing by +4.8% on +2.2% higher revenues and modestly higher net margins. This would follow earnings growth of +0.8% in Q1 on +0.7% higher revenues. The Q2 earnings growth rate is steadily going up, as more companies report and beat estimates.
"
224,XRX,"The table below compares what is expected for Q2 with what was actually achieved in Q1.
"
225,XRX,"In-line with the pattern that has been in place for almost two years now, estimates for Q2 fell in the run up to the start of the reporting cycle. But the magnitude of negative revisions was low relative to other recent quarters. With the reporting cycle getting into high gear in the coming days following a good-enough start, the focus will be on how companies guide towards the current and coming quarters on the earnings calls.
"
226,XRX,"Guidance has been mixed thus far, but commentary along the lines of what we heard from Intel (INTC), Sherwin-Williams (SHW  -  Free Report) and a few others will raise greater confidence in the aggregate estimates for Q3 and beyond.
"
227,XRX,"The chart below shows consensus earnings growth expectations for the coming quarters. 
"
228,XRX,"Corporate guidance, which has persistently been on the weak side in recent quarters, will determine whether those expectations will hold or will need to come down.For a detailed look at the earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Tends report.Monday-7/21

244,XRX,"The market will likely get a lift from a number of positive earnings announcements today, even as it waits for the European deal on Wednesday. Stocks did not take a negative view of the inconclusive weekend Euro-zone summit, but it may not be as charitable if faced with another delay.
"
245,XRX,"The market appears to have priced in some sort of a viable European plan and fresh doubts on that front will likely put a stop to the current market rally. Stocks have made impressive gains this month, up almost 14% since October 3, on rising European hopes and the reassuringly strong quarterly earnings reports.
"
246,XRX,"A number of this morning's earnings reports were particularly reassuring. DuPont (DD) handily beat earnings and revenue expectations and guided higher. UPS (UPS  -  Free Report) came out with a positive earnings surprise on in-line revenue and reiterated its earlier guidance. Xerox (XRX  -  Free Report) also came ahead of earnings and revenue expectations and reiterated its guidance. 3M (MMM  -  Free Report) missed expectations and guided lower on weakness in its electronics business, citing economic factors.Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) came short of expectations after the close on Monday, citing economic headwinds, and guided lower. Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) shares will be in the spotlight for the wrong reasons as the company provided downbeat guidance even as it came ahead of expectations in its quarterly results.
"
247,XRX,"Contrary to some of the more exaggerated concerns about earnings outlooks, the overall tone of earnings reports in this cycle has been positive. With economy no longer a pressing concern, as will likely be confirmed by this week's GDP report, and reassurance on the earnings front, all we need at this stage is a viable enough plan out of Europe.RELATED ARTICLESMarket Remains OptimisticGood - Not Great - Earnings SeasonA Guide to Econ Reports This Week

"
260,XRX,"Investors loved the earnings news, but the broader sell off weighed on the stock giving it an even better value. Take a look at the chart below. 
"
261,XRX,"Document equipment giant Xerox (XRX  -  Free Report) sees its current Average Broker Rating (ABR) rise to 2.5  up 0.25 from the previous week.  A recently announced near-$100 million contract agreement with the U.S. Navy, as well as a strategic buyout the previous month, have helped buoy the companys average rating.
"
262,XRX,"According to our Zacks Research Digest analysts, Xerox maintains its market dominance in the production segment, though one analyst sees increased competition in the future as other industry players are attracted to the higher margins and more robust annuity revenue streams that follow placement of high-end devices.  Most analysts believe the color devices business remains an area of concern, as ongoing commoditization at the lower end and the anticipated emergence of new entrants will accelerate pricing pressure that has been plaguing the industry increasingly up the hardware value chain.
"
263,XRX,"Furthermore, the average selling price of certain products could come under pressure as less expensive printer-based technology is adopted, without enough corresponding unit growth to sustain current revenue levels.  The annuity stream flow of revenue stemming from service and parts (for current A3 devices) could atrophy as devices become inexpensive, making service contracts no longer economically appealing. 
"
264,XRX,"Other Large-Cap Stocks Recently Upgraded Include:
"
265,XRX,"Oft-embattled tobacco behemoth Altria Group (MO) was another big gainer in ABR, up 0.11 to an even 2.  This, despite potentially damaging litigation risks, which continually persist (though they are moderating substantially).
"
266,XRX,"Zacks Research Digest analysts earnings growth forecast over the next three to five years range from 6.0% to 8.0%, with the average being 7.0%. Market share in the U.S. and Western Europe has stabilized after several quarters of real volume decline in the U.S. and severe competition in Europe.  Promotions continue, particularly in Europe, but MO chose to offer a new cigarette at the low end in Germany rather than discount Marlboro there.  The analysts state that while non-U.S. and European markets offer the most growth potential, the company may have to contend with the fact that emerging markets may not be those from which the highest margins can be obtained.
"
267,XRX,"Chicago area-based Walgreens (WAG) improvement in ABR  to 2.47 after an 0.07 increase  was likely influenced by the companys proposals for growth. WAG expects to open 550 new stores in FY08, with a net increase of more than 475 stores after relocations and closings. By the year 2010, it plans to have 7,000 drugstores in operation.
"
268,XRX,"Our Research Digest analysts state that the presence of positive drivers in the drugstore industry mainly driven by solid Rx share growth  and growing generic penetration and contribution from Medicare Part D should benefit the industry as a whole.  Specific to Walgreen Company itself, despite rapid store expansion plans, it generates positive free cash flow, and has a pristine balance sheet with zero debt.
"
269,XRX,"Finally, new drug-eluting stents and a new spinal fixation system may have assisted Medtronic, Inc.s (MDT) rise in ABR from 1.84 to 1.89.  A leader in the cardiology industry, MDT has a strong balance sheet with manageable debt and a high cash balance.
"
270,XRX,"Research Digest analysts report that management at Medtronic has reiterated that it can achieve long-term EPS growth of 15% without acquisitions.  It has the resources to make investments into any area of the medical device and medical technology industry.  The Digest average long-term growth rate is 13.9%, ranging between a low of 11.0% and a high of 16.0%.
