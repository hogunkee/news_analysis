1,SNA,"When the stock market indicates a new uptrend is underway, many individual investors who want to trade growth stocks and make money ironically remain skeptical.A bullish follow-through signal comes after a mostly negative period in the market, so the negative reaction is natural.The reaction may be natural but, to be blunt, it's not too smart. The investor is heeding the recent past while ignoring a signal that says present conditions have changed.What is a follow-through day? It's a bottoming signal that occurs when a major index surges in higher volume than the previous day, and at least four days from an index low.The prudent investor will make an effort to buy something on a follow-through day. The stock should be highly rated and breaking out in strong volume.What if there aren't any stocks breaking out on the follow-through? That happens, and it justifies caution.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhat if the stocks breaking out are stocks the investor has never heard of? That too happens, but it only means the investor hasn't been doing his or her homework.Rallies are often made of stocks that nobody but professional fund managers and devoted IBD readers have heard about.Here are several stocks that broke out on a follow-through day in recent years and the size of the gains that followed. The condition of the relative strength line, which points to outperformance vs. the S&P 500, is also noted. See the RS line painted in blue in every daily and weekly chart at Investors.com.March 1, 2010: SanDisk broke out in volume 89% above average. The RS line was at a 52-week high. The stock  rose 57% in three months. (Western Digital (WDC) acquired SanDisk in May 2016.)On the same follow-through, Power Integrations (POWI) broke out in volume 237% above average. The RS line was also at a new high. The stock gained 24% in about six weeks.Sept. 1, 2010: Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) broke out of a solid 10-week cup with handle that featured a 154.53 buy point (1)  in 124% faster turnover than usual.The accompanying weekly chart clearly shows that volume during the breakout week surged vs. the prior week, a sign of superb institutional demand. Notice how turnover was also the highest in six weeks.The RS line was at a new high. You can see historical relative strength lines and earlier charts via MarketSmith, IBD's premium stock charting and screening service. Some of the charts go back decades in time.The stock rose 70% in three months before peaking at 262.77 and dipping beneath its 10-week moving average (2) to begin a new base.June 21, 2011: Lululemon Athletica (LULU) broke out in volume 61% heavier than usual. The RS line was at a new high. Lulu advanced 25% in one month.Lululemon, a leader in premium-priced athletic apparel, is a current member of IBD Leaderboard.June 29, 2012: Anheuser Busch InBev (BUD) broke out in volume 200% above the 50-day average. The RS line was at a new high. The parent of Budweiser rose 21% in about three months.July 26, 2012: Cabela's (CAB) retook a lost buy point in volume 271% above average. The RS line was at a new high. Cabela's posted a 41% gain in a little more than two months.Oct. 21, 2014: Snap On (SNA) broke out in volume 49% above average. The RS line was at a new high. Snap On advanced 34% in 10 months.May 14, 2015: Criteo (CRTO) broke out in volume 197% quicker than normal. The RS line was at a new high. The stock gained 22% in about two months.The point here isn't that investors should fill up the portfolio with new buys on the follow-through day. Instead, an investor should buy one or two stocks and see if they continue to act well. Avoid the extremes of either jumping in too aggressively or refusing to test the waters at all.And keep track of the relative strength line. It's an important indicator of strength.(A version of this column was originally published on Sept. 4, 2017.

4,SNA,"When people mention the building sector, many folks think of homebuilders. Sometimes, though, such associations can be misleading. It's not enough to ask which of the 33 sectors are doing well. You have to know where the strength is within the sector.That's why IBD breaks the market into 197 industry groups.Homebuilders, for example, have a Relative Strength line that has been moving sideways since August. (The RS line measures performance vs. the S&P 500. A rising line points to outperformance; a falling line to laggard action; and a sideways line to performance in line with the S&P 500.)Meanwhile, the building sector has been in the top five among 33 sectors in that same period.So where is the real strength?Nine industry groups make up the building sector. Only three show rising RS lines over the past few months. Hand tools' RS line is at a 52-week high. Within the group, the top three stocks are Toro (TTC), Snap-on (SNA) and Stanley Black & Decker (SWK).Of those three, Toro has delivered the best earnings growth in the most recently reported quarter. Earnings jumped 121% on a 16% increase in revenue.Toro's Boss unit boosted results — it wrapped up the acquisition of Boss, a designer and maker of snowplows and salt and sand spreaders, in November 2014.The stock is in the 5% buy zone above a 74.22 buy point. Wood products' RS line is just off a recent high. The industry group has four stocks, and only two posted earnings gains in the past two quarters.Universal Forest Products (UFPI) grew earnings 19% and 31% in Q2 and Q3, respectively. Revenue rose 8% and 7% in the same quarters.The stock, though, fell 8% Dec. 8 on DA Davidson's downgrade from neutral to underperform. Universal is thinly traded, with a daily average volume of $12 million.April initial public offering Enviva Partners (EVA) posted a profit of 4 cents a share in Q2 vs. a loss of 8 cents a share in the year-earlier quarter. In Q3, earnings rose 108% to 27 cents a share. Revenue jumped 60% and 53% in the same quarters.Enviva is a master limited partnership involving wood pellets, which customers use to replace coal in power generation. The manufactured homes and RV group has enjoyed a rising RS line, though the line recently faded.The group has six stocks, but only one has delivered double-digit earnings growth in two or more consecutive quarters.Patrick Industries (PATK) grew EPS at least 27% in each of the past six quarters. Sales growth varied from 14% to 31% in the same six quarters.The stock has two drawbacks: A late October breakout failed, eventually driving the stock under its 50-day line and testing the 200-day line. Also, the stock is thinly traded, with a daily average dollar volume of about $5 million.

Two of them haven’t missed in over 5 years.Will the recent stock market volatility play a factor in the trade after these companies report?Or will they be able to overcome stock market weakness to keep their upward momentum intact?5 Top Earnings Charts for This Week1.    Snap Inc. (SNAP  -  Free Report) only went IPO in 2017. Doesn’t it seem like it has been public for much longer? It’s beat 2 out of the last 3 quarters but shares have sunk since the IPO. It’s expected to lose 63 cents in 2017 and another 54 cents in 2018. Revenue growth is key.2.    Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report) hasn’t missed in 5 years but shares sank to a multi-year low in 2017 on worries that retail, even in the luxury category, was going to be Amazoned. But results started to turn around late last year and the shares are off the lows. At 16x earnings, is there still a buying opportunity?3.    Yum China (YUMC  -  Free Report) was spun-off from the parent, Yum, in 2016. It owns KFC and Pizza Hut in China. It is coming off its first miss as a public company last quarter. Shares have skyrocketed in 2018, however, as many think the Chinese consumer is back spending again. Are shares too hot to handle?4.    Snap-On (SNA  -  Free Report) makes auto diagnostic tools. It has a great track record of beating, having done so for 5 years, but shares have stalled the last few years.

36,SNA,"Sales growth is an important metric for any company, as it is a vital part of growth projections and influences strategic decision-making. By monitoring this key metric over multiple time periods, one can clearly understand a company’s growth trend.Sales growth is essential to justify the fixed and variable expenses incurred to run a business. Low revenues lead to unprofitability of business and disappointing financial results. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit but can’t rev up enough growth to attract new investors.Also, in a growing economy, lack of sales growth most likely denotes that the company is not gaining market share over its competitors. In simple terms, some sustained sales growth is necessary to support the bottom line.Focusing solely on sales growth is not enough though. A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks, but it does not ensure profits. Hence, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy.Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns. Most importantly, a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow more than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (four weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (average last five years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for it.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 13 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Kenosha, WI, Snap-on Incorporated (SNA  -  Free Report) manufactures and markets tools, equipment, diagnostics, and repairs information and systems solutions.

38,SNA,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Career Education (CECO  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move, with the stock up 14.9% over the past month. CECO hit a new 52-week-high of $16.67 in the previous session. Career Education has gained 37.3% since the start of the year compared to the 7.7% move for the Consumer Discretionary sector and the 11% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 2, 2018, Career Education reported EPS of $0.25 vs. the Zacks Consensus of $0.22.For the current fiscal year, Career Education is expected to post earnings of $0.95 per share on $587.2 million in revenues. This represents a 206.45% change in EPS on a -1.55% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $1.16 per share on $613.8 million in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 22.11% and 4.53%, respectively.Valuation MetricsCareer Education may be at a 52-week-high right now, but what might the future hold for CECO? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Career Education has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 17.5X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 32X versus its peer group's average of 19.8X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Career Education currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Career Education fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though CECO shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does Career Education Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Career Education have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also impressive, including Strayer Education (STRA  -  Free Report), Johnson Outdoors (JOUT  -  Free Report), and Snap-On (SNA  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Schools industry is in the top 26% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for CECO, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

39,SNA,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Snap-on Incorporated (SNA  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Snap-on Incorporated has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.1, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.5. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Snap-on Incorporated’s current PE ratio somewhat below its midpoint (which is 18.4) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 18.2. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Snap-on Incorporated has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 13.6, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Snap-on Incorporated’s stock in the near term too.   P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Snap-on Incorporated has a P/S ratio of about 2.5. This is slightly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Snap-on Incorporated currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes SNA a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Snap-on Incorporated is just 1.3, a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1.8. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 13.1, which is somewhat better than the industry average of 14.6. Clearly, SNA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Snap-on Incorporated might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of D. This gives SNA a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days and three lower, while the full year estimate has seen five upward and one downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has dipped 0.3% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has nudged up 1.6%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Snap-On Incorporated Price and Consensus  Snap-On Incorporated Price and Consensus | Snap-On Incorporated QuoteThis mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineSnap-on Incorporated is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a decent industry rank (top 43% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happen, this stock could be a compelling pick.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

The move came on solid volume too with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This breaks the recent trend of the company, as the stock is now trading above the volatile price range of $143.64 to $151.70 in the past one-month time frame.The move came after the company reported strong first-quarter 2018 results.The company has seen one negative estimate revision in the past few weeks, while its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has also moved lower over the past few weeks, suggesting there may be trouble down the road.

41,SNA,"Snap-on Incorporated (SNA  -  Free Report) maintained its impressive earnings beat streak for the tenth straight quarter, as the company posted first-quarter 2018 net earnings of $2.79 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.73 by 2.2%. The figure also improved 16.7% from the year-ago quarter’s tally.The bottom line benefited from Snap-on’s robust business model and focus on value-creation processes. Also, strong contribution from acquisitions proved conducive to the earnings performance.Inside the HeadlinesNet sales in the quarter increased 5.5% year over year to $935.5 million and trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $931 million by a whisker, despite persistent headwinds in the Snap-on Tools Group. Excluding acquisition-related sales and unfavorable foreign currency-translation effect, organic sales inched up 0.8% year over year.Solid sales growth at Snap-on Repair Systems & Information and Commercial & Industrial Group drove the top line. However, the company’s U.S. franchise operations in the Tools Group remained subdued.Segment wise, Commercial & Industrial Group sales improved 11% to $331.6 million. Organic sales were up 1.9%. Higher sales to customers in critical industries along with strong European-based hand tools business drove the top line in this segment. Growth in Asia/Pacific operations contributed to growth, which was somewhat offset by weak sales of power tools.Snap-on’s Tools Group revenues continued to show weakness, descending 1.1% year over year to $404.7 million. Organic sales at the segment contracted 2.7%, which was somewhat offset by favorable foreign currency-translation impact of $6.7 million. Tepid sales in the company’s U.S. franchise operations continued to drag the segment’s growth.Repair Systems & Information continued to display strength, as revenues climbed 5.7% year over year to $337 million. Meanwhile, organic sales in the segment improved 2.6%. Higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers as well as OEM dealerships drove strong organic growth in the segment.Meanwhile, the Financial Services business reported revenues of $83 million compared with $76.8 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.Operating earnings before financial services in the quarter came in at $177.7 million, up 4.4% from $170.2 million in the prior-year quarter. Snap-On Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Snap-On Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Snap-On Incorporated Quote LiquidityAt the end of the reported quarter, Snap-on’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $97.5 million compared with $92 million at the end of 2017. The company’s long-term debt came in at $946.3 million at quarter end, up from $753.6 million recorded at the end of 2017.Also, Snap-on expects capital expenditures in the range of $90-$100 million for 2018, of which $18 million was incurred in the first quarter.AcquisitionsIn second-quarter 2017, Snap-on acquired Norbar Torque Tools along with its U.S. and Chinese joint ventures, for roughly $72 million. Norbar is a leading European manufacturer which boasts a complete range of torque products and enjoys a robust foothold in critical industries like power generation, oil and gas, mining as well as railroad. Norbar will enhance and expand Snap-on’s existing torque portfolio and enable it to cater to critical industries, particularly in powered torque products.In fourth-quarter 2016, Snap-on purchased Sweden-based firm — Car-O-Liner — to reinforce the Repair Systems & Information Group’s position and fortify its hold in the auto and heavy duty markets. The company projects the acquisition and favorable industry trends to strengthen its relationship with repair-shop owners and managers.Snap-on also acquired torque wrench marker — Sturtevant Richmont — which is engaged in the designing, manufacturing, and distributing of mechanical and electronic torque wrenches. Snap-on believes that the strategic buyout will improve its critical mechanical performance by addressing critical torque requirements.To ConcludeDespite industry headwinds, Snap-on continues to perform impressively. The company’s overarching business model, which aims to maximize value creation by focusing on areas like safety, quality of service, customer satisfaction and innovation, has emerged as a tried and tested growth driver. Snap-on is committed to its rapid continuous improvement (RCI) program, designed to enhance organizational effectiveness and minimize costs.Solid prospects across business segments, accretive acquisitions and impressive traction of the recently-launched products continue to add to the company’s strength.Nevertheless, in recent times, oil market sluggishness and currency fluctuations have been eroding the profitability of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company. Further, persistent contraction in capital expenditure by auto dealers and intense used-car asset quality pressure are formidable headwinds. These factors are substantial risks for Snap-On in the times to come.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader space include Roper Technologies, Inc. (ROP  -  Free Report), Kadant Inc (KAI  -  Free Report) and Manitex International, Inc. (MNTX  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

42,SNA,"Snap-on Incorporated (SNA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Feb 8.Snap-on has an excellent earnings surprise history. The company has not missed estimates in over seven years. Last quarter, it delivered a positive surprise of 0.8%, reflecting an average beat of 1.9% for the trailing four quarters.We expect Snap-on to beat on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that Snap-on has the right combination of the two key ingredients. For a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. And this is precisely the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Snap-on has an Earnings ESP of +0.50% as the Most Accurate estimate of $2.67 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.66. A positive ESP indicates a likely earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Snap-On Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Snap-On Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Snap-On Incorporated Quote Zacks Rank: Snap-on carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. Further, combined with a positive ESP, chances of an earnings beat are always pegged higher.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Reasons Driving Better-Than-Expected ResultsOver the past few quarters, Snap-On has been witnessing encouraging prospects in most of its business lines that signal toward brighter prospects going forward. The company’s Repair Systems & Information business has been gaining traction, driven by a rising penetration in the emerging markets, apart from continued software and hardware upgrades as well as productivity enhancements. For instance, the third quarter saw some substantial achievements across the segment with improving position of repair shop owners and managers. We believe that Repair Systems & Information group’s business deals with independent repair shop owners and managers will likely emerge a major growth driver in the near term.Segment wise, the company’s Commercial & Industrial Group has been enjoying strong momentum. It has been benefiting from increased sales to customers in critical industries and a strong European-based hand tools business. For instance, the segment’s contribution to revenues exceeded estimates 0.6% and grew 8.7% year over year to $315 million in third-quarter 2017 results. Additionally, the company’s recent buyout of Car-O-Liner has strengthened its Repair Systems & Information Group position, allowing it to fortify its footprint in the auto and heavy duty markets.  Moreover, one of the company’s key fortes includes its ability to innovate, having led to meaningful sales growth over the last nine decades. The company has been investing in new products and growing brand awareness across the world. Particularly, it has been working toward expanding its base “beyond the garage” and offering advanced exclusive solutions to professionals performing critical tasks. Going forward, we believe that selected investment opportunities along with the company’s broad product line, offer modest growth options.Despite the above positives, a prevalent softness in the industrial markets has significantly impacted client spending, marring the company’s prospects. Also, the aerospace project is facing some weakness in the Middle East region, thereby adding to its woes further. Besides, a sluggish oil and gas market activity continues to affect the company’s revenues from the industrial market, which in turn is likely to thwart Snap-on’s top line in the quarter to be reported.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other stocks worth considering from the same space as these too comprise the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around:Churchill Downs, Incorporated (CHDN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +29.03% and a Zacks Rank of 1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Party City Holdco Inc. (PRTY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +9.02% and the company is a Zacks #1 Ranked player.G-III Apparel Group, LTD. (GIII  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +14.29% and a Zacks Rank #2.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

44,SNA,"This is the first big week of earnings season and that means we’ll get a lot of big cap companies reporting, including several Dow components.We’re also hearing from some companies that you might not pay much attention to, but you should. They run the gamut of industries from drug manufacturers, to equipment plays, paint and coatings, high end tool providers and pool products.But these companies all have something else in common: great earnings surprise track records.It’s not easy to beat every quarter for years. There is just a couple dozen companies that have perfect records. Even one miss, however, is an impressive track record and hard to maintain.These are some of the best earnings charts of those companies reporting this week.5 Amazing Earnings Charts This WeekAbbott Labs (ABT  -  Free Report) has a perfect record and the shares have finally broken out to new highs. 2018 has been a little dicey though. Will another earnings beat help the shares regain momentum?United Rentals (URI  -  Free Report) has missed just once in the last 5 years. Shares have rallied on hopes that the Congress would pass a big infrastructure plan which would boost this big equipment lender.PPG Industries (PPG  -  Free Report) hasn’t missed in 5 years but shares have been stuck in a narrow trading range the last 3 years. What will take them to new heights?Snap-On (SNA  -  Free Report) hasn’t missed in 5 years either but the shares are also stalled in a narrow trading range. It looked like they might break out to start the year but, instead, they have sunk to the low end of the range. Will the corporate tax cuts help the stock regain momentum?Pool Corporation (POOL  -  Free Report) specializes in pools and pool products. It has missed only once in the last 5 years and shares are near 5-year highs. With the consumer feeling good, and looking for leisure and experiences, Pool could be perfectly positioned to benefit.[The author of this article owns shares of URI in her personal portfolio.]

45,SNA,"Snap-on Incorporated (SNA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19, before the opening bell.Snap-on has an excellent earnings surprise history. The company has not missed estimates in the last seven years. Last quarter, it delivered a positive surprise of 1.1%, with an average beat of 1.5% for the trailing four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderOver the past few quarters, Snap-On has been witnessing encouraging prospects in most of its business lines that indicate at brighter prospects in the future. The company’s Repair Systems & Information business has been gaining traction, driven by a rising penetration in the emerging markets apart from continued software and hardware upgrades as well as productivity enhancements. For instance, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the company witnessed substantial achievements in the segment with improving position of repair shop owners and managers. We believe that Repair Systems & Information group’s business, which deals with independent repair shop owners and managers, is likely be a major growth driver in the near term.Segment wise, the company’s Commercial & Industrial Group has been enjoying strong momentum. It has been benefiting from increased sales to customers in critical industries and a strong European-based hand tools business. Additionally, the company’s recent buyout of Car-O-Liner has strengthened its Repair Systems & Information Group position, fortifying its footprint in the auto and heavy duty markets. Moreover, one of the company’s key fortes includes its ability to innovate, which led to sales growth over the last nine decades. The company has been investing in new products and growing brand awareness across the world. Particularly, it has been working toward expanding its base ‘beyond the garage’ and offering advanced exclusive solutions to professionals performing critical tasks. Further, we believe that selected investment opportunities along with the company’s broad product line, offer modest growth options. Snap-On Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Snap-On Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Snap-On Incorporated Quote Despite these positives, persistent softness in the industrial markets has significantly impacted client spending, marring the company’s prospects. Also, the aerospace project is facing some weakness in the Middle East region, which is adding to its woes. Besides, a sluggish oil and gas market activity continues to affect the company’s revenues from the industrial market, which in turn is likely to thwart Snap-on’s top line in the quarter to be reported.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Snap-On is likely to beat estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is +1.59%, as the Most Accurate Estimate is $2.77 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.73. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Snap-On has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (ATI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +9.38% and a Zacks Rank of 1. The company is expected to release quarterly numbers around Apr 24. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Century Aluminum Company (CENX  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +29.41% and a Zacks Rank of 1, is slated to report results on Apr 24.Watsco, Inc.

46,SNA,"Snap-on Incorporated (SNA  -  Free Report) maintained its impressive earnings beat streak, posting third-quarter 2017 net earnings of $2.45 per share, reflecting an increase of 10.4% from the year-ago figure. Earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.43 by a couple of cents.The bottom line benefited from Snap-on’s robust business model and focus on value-creation processes. Also, strong contribution from acquisitions and organic growth proved conducive to the earnings performance.Inside the HeadlinesNet sales in the quarter increased 8.4% year over year to $903.8 million and trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $890 million comfortably. Excluding acquisition-related expenses and unfavorable foreign currency translation effect, organic sales rose 2.3% year over year.Solid sales growth at Snap-on Repair Systems & Information and Commercial & Industrial Group drove the top line. However, the company’s U.S. franchise operations in the Tools Group remained subdued.Segment wise, Commercial & Industrial Group sales rose 8.7% to $314.6 million. Organic sales were up 0.2%. Higher sales to customers in critical industries, along with and strong European-based hand tools business, drove the top line at this segment. Weak sales of power tools and tepid growth in Asia/Pacific operations offset the growth to an extent.Snap-on’s Tools Group revenues continued to show weakness, edging down 1.1% year over year to $392.7 million. Organic sales at the segment declined 1.6%, while favorable foreign currency translation impact of $2 million offset the same somewhat. Dismal sales in the company’s U.S. franchise operations continued to drag the segment’s growth.Repair Systems & Information continued to display impressive strength, as revenues climbed 16.6% year over year to $333.5 million. Meanwhile, organic sales at the segment improved 8.2%. Higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, OEM dealerships and undercar equipments drove strong organic growth at the segment.On the other hand, the Financial Services business reported revenues of $79 million compared with $71.6 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.Operating earnings before financial services (excluding a legal charge) in the quarter came in at $168.1 million, up 6.7% from $157.6 million in the prior-year quarter.Snap-On Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Snap-On Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Snap-On Incorporated QuoteLiquidityAt the end of the reported quarter, Snap-on’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $94.1 million compared with $77.6 million at the end of 2016. The company’s long-term debt came in at $755 million at quarter end, up from $708.8 million at the end of 2016.AcquisitionsIn second-quarter 2017, Snap-on acquired Norbar Torque Tools, along with its U.S. and Chinese joint ventures, for roughly $72 million. Norbar is a leading European manufacturer which boasts a complete range of torque products and also enjoys a robust foothold in critical industries, like power generation, oil & gas, mining and railroad. Norbar will complement and expand Snap-on’s existing torque portfolio, and help it cater to critical industries, particularly in powered torque products.Earlier, in fourth-quarter 2016, Snap-on purchased Sweden-based firm — Car-O-Liner — to reinforce the Repair Systems & Information Group’s position, and fortify its hold in the auto and heavy duty markets. The company anticipates this acquisition and favorable industry trends to strengthen its relationship with repair shop owners and managers.Snap-on also acquired torque wrench marker — Sturtevant Richmont — which is engaged in the designing, manufacturing, and distributing of mechanical and electronic torque wrenches. Snap-on believes this strategic buyout will improve its critical mechanical performance by addressing critical torque requirements.To ConcludeDespite industry headwinds, Snap-on continues to perform impressively. The company’s overarching business model, which aims to maximize value-creation by focusing on areas like safety, quality of service, customer satisfaction and innovation, has emerged as a tried and tested growth driver. Snap-on is committed to its rapid continuous improvement (RCI) program, designed to enhance organizational effectiveness and minimize costs.Snap-on announced plans to enhance the franchise network, expand ties with repair shop owners and managers, and foray into critical industries to strengthen its hold in emerging markets, going forward. Solid prospects across business segments, accretive acquisitions and impressive traction of the recently-launched products continue to add to the strength of this company.However, in recent times, oil market sluggishness and currency fluctuations have been eroding the profitability of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company. Further, persistent contraction in capital expenditure by auto dealers and intensifying used car asset quality pressure are formidable headwinds. The ongoing softness in industrial markets are impacting client spending, which, in turn, is adding to the company’s woes, primarily affecting its industrial business. These factors remain substantial risks for Snap-On in the times to come.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader space include Barnes Group Inc. (B  -  Free Report), A.O. Smith Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report) and SPX FLOW, Inc. (FLOW  -  Free Report). Barnes Group sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while A.O. Smith and SPX FLOW carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Barnes Group has a solid earnings surprise history for the trailing four quarters, having beaten estimates each time for an average of 11.6%.A.O. Smith also has a decent earnings surprise history, with an average beat of 3.3% over the trailing four quarters, beating estimates thrice.SPX FLOW is expected to chart current-year growth of 9.4%, while its next year’s growth estimate is an impressive 64.1%Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

"
59,SNA,"One high-growth tech stock that is still thriving under the radar and should be in investors’ spotlight is Sony Corporation (SNE  -  Free Report) — the Japanese gaming giant. Sony’s shares have appreciated 36.9% over the past six months, as it enjoys solid momentum in games, music, and home entertainment — its highest margin segments. This compares favorably with the industry’s rally of 23%.Despite such impressive price momentum, the company’s trailing 12-month price to earnings ratio stands at 14.1, lower than S&P 500 Index’s PE multiple of 20.6. The stock is trading at a discount relative to its industry, which indicates that it is undervalued compared with its peers.In the chart below, we can clearly see how the company’s steep earnings growth over the past year has outpaced the modest and gradual increase in share price.The discounted valuation combined with the growth catalysts make this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company an attractive pick right now. Let’s briefly discuss some of these growth drivers.Growth DriversSony is perhaps best known for its PlayStation gaming console, televisions and headphones. In gaming, the company has reportedly sold more than 75 million PlayStation 4 consoles since the launch of the line four years ago. The figure is almost double the estimated unit sales of Microsoft Corporation’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Xbox One consoles and quadruple of Nintendo Co.'s (NTDOY  -  Free Report) Wii U console.In fiscal third-quarter 2018 results, Sony’s Game & Network Services segment climbed an impressive 16.2% year over year. Burgeoning demand for next-generation video game consoles, explosion in eSports and the massive digital shift in the video game industry are tailwinds for the segment. Further, augmented and virtual reality might prove to be catalysts for Sony’s gaming business. Sony's VR products are set to capitalize on its existing base of more than 75 million PS4 users.The company’s Music segment is benefiting from elevated Visual Media and Platform sales. In addition, Recorded Music sales are growing on the back of a steady rise in digital streaming revenues. Sony's TV business is also set to benefit from an industry upswing as more and more consumers upgrade to OLED and 4K screens. Home Entertainment & Sound segment is another strong growth driver for the company.Semiconductors are riding high on demand for camera chips for smartphones, including Apple’s iPhone. Semiconductors carry robust margins and expanding image sensors demand for mobile products should boost its growth prospects.Sony managed to chart positive growth in its operating segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. All in all, we can see that Sony’s high-margin segments are accelerating at a swift pace, which implies healthy earnings growth over the coming quarters.In ConclusionSony has been firing on all cylinders to boost profits and results are slowly beginning to manifest themselves in better operating income and margin performance. Sony’s restructuring efforts and streamlined operations will help generate sustainable profit in the coming quarters, propelling future growth.Clearly, Sony has its fingers in several pies and there are high chances that the company will soon become a tech powerhouse in multiple industries.The industry trends are in Sony’s favor as well. The rise of autonomous cars and factory robots can help its semiconductors business move beyond smartphones. In gaming, soaring software and service revenues can extend the PlayStation 4 up-cycle and smoothen profits between new hardware launches. In fact, we believe that secular trends might make Sony a solid long-term growth story.The company’s quarterly numbers have been surpassing estimates, while future projections are climbing higher. Sony has scored consecutive earnings beats over the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 79.8%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Further, analysts have also revised the company’s estimates higher in recent times. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 has gone up from $3.30 recorded a couple of months back to $3.86 today — an improvement of 17%. This indicates that analysts are feeling distinctly bullish about the stock.We believe that this is be a great time for investors to consider this stock for their portfolio, given the discounted valuation and strong growth catalysts.Sony Corporation Price and Consensus Sony Corporation Price and Consensus | Sony Corporation QuoteAnother stock worth a look is Snap-On Incorporated (SNA  -  Free Report), which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Snap-On has an average positive surprise of 1.5% in the trailing four quarters, beating estimates all through.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

60,SNA,"Snap-on Incorporated (SNA  -  Free Report) could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective, as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for SNA broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 4.3% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for SNA stock.If that wasn’t enough, Snap-on isn’t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.Consider that in the last 30 days, 1 estimate have been reduced, while none has moved higher. Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead. So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for SNA.

62,SNA,"Snap-on Incorporated (SNA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Oct 19.Snap-on has an outstanding earnings surprise history — it has not missed estimates in over seven years. Last quarter, the company registered a positive earnings surprise of 2%, generating an average positive surprise of 2.5% for the trailing four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement and whether Snap-on will be able to maintain its long-standing winning streak.Factors to ConsiderSnap-on’s successful earnings streak highlights its consistent capability to leverage on market opportunities for augmenting growth. Encouragingly, the company has been witnessing robust prospects in most of its business lines which signal brighter days ahead.Segment wise, Snap-on’s Commercial & Industrial Group has been enjoying strong performance in the European-based hand tools business. It has been benefiting from elevated sales to customers in critical industries, including the military. The segment’s contribution to revenues exceeded estimates by 4.4% and grew 8.5% year over year to $310 million in the second-quarter 2017 results. In the upcoming quarterly results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s sales is pegged at $313 million, reflecting slightly positive sequential growth.The Repair Systems & Information business has been the company’s strongest growth driver in the recent times, and we expect that higher sales of the diagnostics and repair information products will drive solid organic growth in the quarter under review as well. The Financial Services business is also anticipated to do well. Additionally, the company’s financial services portfolio has been recording steady growth for the past few years.Snap-On Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Snap-On Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Snap-On Incorporated QuoteSnap-On believes the recent Car-O-Liner buyout will strengthen its Repair Systems & Information Group offering, enabling the company to fortify its footprint in the auto and heavy-duty markets. Snap-On anticipates this company will generate operating income margin comparable to the RS&I undercar equipment business, going forward.Overall, we expect Snap-on to post $890 million in sales this quarter.Though Snap-On’s bottom-line performance remained unaffected amid macroeconomic woes, the company is faced with multiple issues that may hurt the third-quarter results. The prevalent softness in industrial markets has significantly impacted client spending, marring the company’s prospects. Also, sluggish oil and gas market activities are likely to thwart the company’s top line in the quarter to be reported.The Tools Group has also been seeing diminishing sales in the tool storage product line, which has hurt revenues in the recent past. Consequently, we expect the segment to see weak growth sequentially in the to-be-reported quarter.Further, persistent contraction in capital expenditure by auto dealers and intensifying used car asset quality pressure is a formidable headwind for the company. Year to date, Snap-on’s shares have declined 11.3%, grossly underperforming the industry’s average decline of 2.4%.Moreover, foreign currency fluctuations pose a major concern as one-third of the company’s revenues are derived from its European businesses. Due to foreign currency woes, in the second quarter, the Commercial & Industrial Group sales declined $4.9 million, Tools Group sales decreased $5 million, and Repair Systems & Information segment witnessed a $3.7-million sales reduction. We believe currency fluctuations will remain a risk to the company’s top line in the quarter under review as well.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Snap-on will likely beat earnings estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is currently pegged at -0.07%.

63,SNA,"Snap-on Incorporated (SNA  -  Free Report) has been struggling lately, but the selling pressure may be coming to an end soon. That is because SNA recently saw a Hammer Chart Pattern which can signal that the stock is nearing a bottom.What is a Hammer Chart Pattern? A hammer chart pattern is a popular technical indicator that is used in candlestick charting. The hammer appears when a stock tumbles during the day, but then finds strength at some point in the session to close near or above its opening price. This forms a candlestick that resembles a hammer, and it can suggest that the market has found a low point in the stock, and that better days are ahead.Other FactorsPlus, earnings estimates have been rising for this company, even despite the sluggish trading lately. In just the past 60 days alone 6 estimates have gone higher, compared to none lower, while the consensus estimate has also moved in the right direction.Estimates have actually risen so much that the stock now has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) suggesting this relatively unloved stock could be due for a breakout soon. This will be especially true if SNA stock can build momentum from here and find a way to continue higher of off this encouraging trading development.

64,SNA,"One high-growth tech stock that is still thriving under the radar and should be in investors’ spotlight is Sony Corporation (SNE  -  Free Report) — the Japanese gaming giant. Sony’s shares have appreciated 29.5% over the past six months, as it enjoys solid momentum in games, music, and home entertainment — which happens to be its highest-margin segments. This compares well with the industry’s rally of 18.7%.Despite such impressive price momentum, the company’s trailing-twelve-month price to earnings ratio stands at 14.1, lower than S&P 500 index’s PE multiple of 21.4. The stock is also trading at a discount relative to its industry, which indicates that the stock is undervalued compared with its peers.The discounted valuation combined with the growth catalysts make this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company an attractive pick right now. Let’s discuss some of these growth drivers.Growth CatalystsSony is perhaps best known for its PlayStation gaming console, televisions and headphones. In gaming, the company has reportedly sold more than 75 million PlayStation 4 consoles since the launch of the line four years ago. The figure is almost double the estimated unit sales of Microsoft Corporation’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Xbox One consoles and quadruple of Nintendo Co.'s (NTDOY  -  Free Report) Wii U console. PS4 clearly emerges as the leader in the current generation of video game consoles and continues to be the best-selling gaming hardware.Console sales generate additional revenues from game downloads and subscription fees for online gaming. In the recent fiscal third-quarter results, Sony’s Game & Network Services (GN&S) segment climbed an impressive 16.2% year over year. Burgeoning demand for next-generation video game consoles, explosion in eSports and the massive digital shift in the video game industry are tailwinds for the segment. Further, augmented and virtual reality might prove to be catalysts for Sony’s gaming business.The company’s Music segment also witnessed a 22.4% surge in sales on a year-over-year basis, benefiting from elevated Visual Media and Platform sales and driven by “Fate/Grand Order” application. In addition, Recorded Music sales improved on the back of a steady rise in digital streaming revenues. Sony's TV business is set to benefit from an industry upswing as more and more consumers upgrade to OLED and 4K screens.Home Entertainment & Sound segment was another strong growth driver for the company, with sales in the segment jumping nearly 22% on the back of improvement in product mix of televisions. This indicates a shift to high value-added models.Semiconductors are also riding high on demand for camera chips for smartphones, including Apple’s iPhone. Semiconductors carry robust margins and expanding image sensors demand for mobile products should boost its growth prospects.Sony managed to chart positive growth across its operating segments in the fiscal third quarter. All in all, we can see that Sony’s high-margin segments are accelerating at a swift pace, which implies healthy earnings growth over the coming years.Recent ProjectionsSony expects to sustain the momentum in Music and Home entertainment businesses. Overall, the GN&S segment is likely to benefit from an expected increase in PS4 hardware and network sales. Sony's VR products are set to capitalize on its existing base of more than 75 million PS4 users.Music sales are projected to be driven by higher-than-expected Visual Media and Platform sales, as well as Recorded Music sales. Image sensor unit sales for mobile products are likely to drive Semiconductors sales higher, while an expected increase in television unit sales will drive HE&S revenues.Summing UpSony has really been firing on all cylinders to boost profits and the results are slowly beginning to manifest themselves in better operating income and margin performance. The company has created an impressive ecosystem of the PlayStation family. The company’s restructuring efforts and streamlined operations will help generate sustainable profit in the coming quarters, thus propelling future growth.Clearly, Sony has its fingers in several pies and there are high chances that the company will soon become a tech powerhouse, in multiple industries.The industry trends are in Sony’s favor as well. The rise of autonomous cars and factory robots can help its semiconductors business move beyond smartphones. In gaming, soaring software and service revenues can extend the PlayStation 4 up-cycle and smoothen profits between new hardware launches. In fact, we believe that secular trends might make Sony a solid long-term growth story.The company’s quarterly numbers have also been surpassing estimates, while future projections are climbing higher. Sony has scored consecutive earnings beats over the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 79.8%. Sony Corp Ord Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Sony Corp Ord Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Sony Corp Ord QuoteFurther, analysts have also revised the company’s estimates higher in recent times. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 has gone up from $2.89 recorded a couple of months back to $3.86 today — a move of 33.6%. This indicates that analysts are feeling bullish about the stock.We believe that this would be a great time for investors to consider this stock for their portfolio, considering the discounted valuation and strong growth catalysts.Another stock worth a look is Snap-On Incorporated (SNA  -  Free Report), which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Snap-On has an average positive surprise of 1.5% in the trailing four quarters, beating estimates all through.

65,SNA,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Snap-on Incorporated (SNA  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Snap-on Inc. has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.1, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Snap-on Inc.’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is significantly below the highs for this stock, suggesting that the stock is undervalued compared to its historical levels.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with its industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 18.2. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Snap-on Inc. has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 14.4, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Snap-on Inc. has a P/S ratio of about 2.4. This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2 right now.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Snap-on Inc. currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of ‘B’, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Snap-on Inc. a solid choice for value investors.For example, the PEG ratio for Snap-on Inc. is just 1.4, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 2.5. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 13, which is a little better than the industry average of 14.1. Clearly, SNA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Snap-on Inc. might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of ‘C’ and a Momentum score of ‘F’. This gives SNA a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of ‘B’. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been discouraging. The current quarter and year has seen no estimates go higher in the past thirty days compared to two lower.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 0.8% in the past one month, while the current year estimate has decreased by 0.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Snap-On Incorporated Price and Consensus Snap-On Incorporated Price and Consensus | Snap-On Incorporated QuoteThis negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineSnap-on Inc. is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Furthermore, a robust industry rank (among the Top 41%) and a instills investor confidence. However, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall as over the past six months, its industry has underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait analysts’ sentiment and estimates to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.This proven stock-picking system is grounded on a single big idea that can be fortune shaping and life changing.

90,SNA,"Snap-on Incorporated (SNA  -  Free Report) maintained its impressive earnings beat streak, posting second-quarter 2017 net earnings of $2.60 per share. Earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.55 by 1.6%. The bottom line also reflected an increase of 10.2% from the year-ago figure of $2.36.The bottom line benefited from Snap-on’s robust business model and focus on value-creation processes. Also, organic top-line growth proved conducive to the earnings performance.Inside the HeadlinesNet sales in the quarter increased 5.6% year over year to $921.4 million, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $922 million by a whisker. Excluding acquisition-related expenses and unfavorable foreign currency translation effect, organic sales rose 2.7% year over year.Solid sales growth at Snap-on Repair Systems & Information and Commercial & Industrial Group drove the top line. However, unfavorable foreign currency translation restricted revenue growth to some extent.Segment wise, Commercial & Industrial Group sales rose 8.5% to $310 million. Organic sales were up 4.7% primarily owing to strong performance in the European-based hand tools business. Also, higher sales to customers in critical industries, including military, drove the top line at this segment. Unfavorable foreign currency translation had a $4.9-million impact on sales, thereby offsetting organic growth to an extent.Snap-on’s Tools Group revenues edged down 0.7% year over year to $413.8 million. Organic sales at the segment recorded a minor improvement of 0.5%, but unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $5 million more than offset the same.Repair Systems & Information continued to display strength, as revenues climbed 14.5% year over year to $338.1 million. Meanwhile, organic sales at the segment improved 8.3%. Higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, OEM dealerships and undercar equipments drove strong organic growth at the segment.On the other hand, the Financial Services business reported revenues of $77.7 million compared with $69.3 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.Operating earnings before financial services in the quarter came in at $183.7 million, up 10.4% from $166.4 million in the prior-year quarter.Snap-On Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Snap-On Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Snap-On Incorporated QuoteLiquidityAt the end of the reported quarter, Snap-on’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $89 million compared with $77.6 million at the end of 2016. The company’s long-term debt came in at $755.6 million at quarter end, up from $708.8 million at the end of 2016.Other ActivitiesDuring the reported quarter, Snap-on acquired Norbar Torque Tools, along with its U.S. and Chinese joint ventures, for roughly $72 million. Norbar is a leading European manufacturer which boasts a complete range of torque products and also enjoys a robust foothold in critical industries, like power generation, oil & gas, mining and railroad. Norbar will complement and expand Snap-on’s existing torque portfolio, and help it to cater to critical industries, particularly in powered torque products.Earlier, in fourth-quarter 2016, Snap-on purchased Sweden-based firm – Car-O-Liner – to reinforce the Repair Systems & Information Group’s position, and fortify its hold in the auto and heavy duty markets. The company anticipates this acquisition and favorable industry trends to strengthen its relationship with repair shop owners and managers.Snap-on also acquired torque wrench marker – Sturtevant Richmont — which is engaged in the designing, manufacturing, and distributing of mechanical and electronic torque wrenches. Snap-on believes that this strategic buyout will improve its critical mechanical performance by addressing critical torque requirements.To ConcludeDespite industry headwinds, Snap-on continues to perform impressively. The company’s overarching business model, which aims to maximize value-creation by focusing on areas like safety, quality of service, customer satisfaction and innovation, has emerged as a tried and tested growth driver. Snap-on is committed to its rapid continuous improvement program, designed to enhance organizational effectiveness and minimize costs.Moving ahead, Snap-on announced plans to enhance the franchise network, expand ties with repair shop owners and managers, and foray into critical industries to strengthen its hold in emerging markets. Solid prospects across business segments, accretive acquisitions and impressive traction of the recently launched products continue to add to the strength of this company.However, in recent times, oil market sluggishness and currency fluctuations have been eroding the profitability of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. Further, persistent contraction in capital expenditure by auto dealers and intensifying used car asset quality pressure are formidable headwinds for the company. The ongoing softness in industrial markets are impacting client spending, which, in turn, is adding to the company’s woes, primarily affecting its industrial business. These factors remain substantial risks for Snap-On in the times to come.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader sector include A.O.

92,SNA,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Snap-On Incorporated (SNA  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 4.6% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is SNA due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Snap-On Q4 Earnings Beat on Robust Top-Line GrowthSnap-on maintained its impressive earnings beat streak for the ninth straight quarter, as the company posted fourth-quarter 2017 net earnings of $2.69 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.66 by 1.1%. The figure also reflected an increase of 8.9% from the year-ago tally.The bottom line benefited from Snap-on’s robust business model and focus on value-creation processes. Also, strong contribution from acquisitions and organic growth proved conducive to the earnings performance.For the full year, the company reported adjusted earnings of $10.12 per share, up 10% from the previous year’s figure.Inside the HeadlinesNet sales in the quarter increased 9.5% year over year to $974.6 million and trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $941.6 million comfortably. Excluding acquisition-related expenses and unfavorable foreign currency-translation effect, organic sales rose 4.3% year over year. Both the total sales increase and the organic growth for the quarter were the highest in 2017.For the full year, the company reported a 7.5% increase in sales to $3686.9 million compared to the previous-year tally, with organic sales growing 3.4%.Solid sales growth at Snap-on Repair Systems & Information and Commercial & Industrial Group drove the top line. However, the company’s U.S. franchise operations in the Tools Group remained subdued.Segment wise, Commercial & Industrial Group sales rose a striking 19.4% to $341.7 million. Organic sales were up 10.1%. Higher sales to customers in critical industries, along with strong European-based hand tools business, drove the top line at this segment. Also, robust sales of power tools and growth in Asia/Pacific operations contributed to growth.Snap-on’s Tools Group revenues continued to show weakness, descending 2% year over year to $409.2 million. Organic sales at the segment contracted 3%, which was somewhat offset by favorable foreign currency-translation impact of $4.3 million. Tepid sales in the company’s U.S. franchise operations continued to drag the segment’s growth.Repair Systems & Information continued to display impressive strength, as revenues climbed 11.6% year over year to $356.8 million. Meanwhile, organic sales at the segment improved 6.2%. Higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, and OEM dealerships drove strong organic growth at the segment.On the other hand, the Financial Services business reported revenues of $79.9 million compared with $74.2 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.Operating earnings before financial services (excluding a legal charge) in the quarter came in at $188.6 million, up 7.1% from $176.1 million in the prior-year quarter.LiquidityAt the end of the reported quarter, Snap-on’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $92 million compared with $77.6 million at the end of 2016. The company’s long-term debt came in at $753.6 million at quarter end, up from $708.8 million recorded at the end of 2016.AcquisitionsIn second-quarter 2017, Snap-on acquired Norbar Torque Tools, along with its U.S. and Chinese joint ventures, for roughly $72 million. Norbar is a leading European manufacturer which boasts a complete range of torque products and also enjoys a robust foothold in critical industries, like power generation, oil & gas, mining and railroad. Norbar will complement and expand Snap-on’s existing torque portfolio, and help it cater to critical industries, particularly in powered torque products.Earlier, in fourth-quarter 2016, Snap-on purchased Sweden-based firm — Car-O-Liner — to reinforce the Repair Systems & Information Group’s position, and fortify its hold in the auto and heavy duty markets. The company anticipates this acquisition and favorable industry trends to strengthen its relationship with repair-shop owners and managers.Snap-on also acquired torque wrench marker — Sturtevant Richmont — which is engaged in the designing, manufacturing, and distributing of mechanical and electronic torque wrenches. Snap-on believes this strategic buyout will improve its critical mechanical performance by addressing critical torque requirements.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been four revisions higher for the current quarter compared to one lower. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted by 5.4% due to these changes.Snap-On Incorporated Price and Consensus Snap-On Incorporated Price and Consensus | Snap-On Incorporated QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, SNA has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is more suitable for value investors than those looking for growth and momentum.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise SNA has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.

93,SNA,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Snap-on Incorporated (SNA  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Snap-on Incorporated has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.8, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.8. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Snap-on Incorporated’s current PE ratio somewhat below its midpoint (which is 18.4) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19.2. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Snap-on Incorporated has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 13.8, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Snap-on Incorporated’s stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Snap-on Incorporated has a P/S ratio of about 2.5. This is somewhat lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.5 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is noticeably below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Snap-on Incorporated currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes SNA a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Snap-on Incorporated is just 1.3, a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 2.1. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, SNA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Snap-on Incorporated might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of A. This gives SNA a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days, and one lower, while the full year estimate has seen six upward and no downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen about 5.4% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased 5%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Snap-On Incorporated Price and Consensus  Snap-On Incorporated Price and Consensus | Snap-On Incorporated QuoteThis favorable trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineSnap-on Incorporated is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Boasting a formidable industry rank (top 8% out of more than 250 industries) and a strong Zacks Rank, the company deserves attention right now. However, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Despite positive estimate revision activity, investors should wait for industry trends to turn around first.  When it does, this stock could be a compelling value pick.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018 In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocksportfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

96,SNA,"One high-growth tech stock that is still flying under the radar and should be in investors’ spotlight is Sony Corporation (SNE  -  Free Report) — the Japanese gaming giant. Sony’s shares have appreciated 55.2% over the past year, as the company enjoys solid momentum in games, music, and home entertainment — which also happens to be its highest-margin segments. This compares well with the industry’s gain of 45.2%.  Growth CatalystsSony is perhaps best known for its Playstation gaming console, televisions and headphones. In gaming, the company has reportedly sold more than 73.4 million PlayStation 4 consoles since the launch of the line four years ago. The figure is almost double the estimated unit sales of Microsoft Corporation’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Xbox One consoles and quadruple of Nintendo Co.'s (NTDOY  -  Free Report) Wii U console. PS4 clearly emerges as the leader in the current generation of video game consoles.Console sales generate additional revenues from game downloads and subscription fees for online playing. In the recently reported fiscal third-quarter results, Sony’s Game & Network Services (GN&S) segment climbed an impressive 16.2% year over year. Burgeoning demand for next-generation video game consoles, explosion in eSports and the massive digital shift in the video game industry are tailwinds for the segment. Further, augmented and virtual reality might prove to be catalysts for Sony’s gaming business.The company’s Music segment also experienced a 22.4% surge in sales on a year-over-year basis, benefiting from elevated Visual Media and Platform sales and driven by “Fate/Grand Order” application. In addition, Recorded Music sales improved supported by a steady rise in digital streaming revenues. Sony's TV business is set to benefit from an industry upswing as more and more consumers upgrade to OLED and 4K screens.Home Entertainment & Sound segment was another strong growth driver for the company, with sales in the segment jumping nearly 22% on the back of improvement in product mix of televisions. This indicates a shift to high value-added models.Semiconductors are also riding high on demand for camera chips for smartphones, including Apple’s iPhone. Semiconductors carry robust margins, and expanding image sensors demand for mobile products should boost its growth prospects.Sony managed to chart positive growth across its operating segments in the fiscal third quarter. All in all, we can see that Sony’s high-margin segments are accelerating at a swift pace, which implies healthy earnings growth over the coming years.Recent ProjectionsSony's fiscal third-quarter sales and operating revenues rose 11.5% year over year, while earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a striking 64.4%.Sony expects the momentum in Music and Home entertainment businesses to continue. Overall, the GN&S segment is likely to benefit from an expected increase in PS4 hardware sales as well as network sales. Music sales are predicted to be driven by higher-than-expected Visual Media and Platform sales, as well as Recorded Music sales. Image sensor unit sales for mobile products are likely to drive Semiconductors sales higher, while an expected increase in television unit sales will boost HE&S revenues.Summing UpSony has been firing on all cylinders to boost profits and the results are slowly beginning to manifest themselves in better operating income and margin performance. Sony has created an impressive ecosystem of the PlayStation family. The company’s restructuring efforts and streamlined operations will help generate sustainable profit, thus propelling future growth.The industry trends are in Sony’s favor as well. The rise of autonomous cars and factory robots can help its semiconductors business move beyond smartphones. In gaming, soaring software and service revenues can extend the PlayStation 4 up-cycle and smooth out profits between hardware launches. In fact, we believe that secular trends might make Sony a solid long-term growth story.The company’s quarterly numbers have also been coming in well ahead of estimates, and future estimates have been climbing higher. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has scored consecutive, striking earnings beats over the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 79.8%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Further, analysts have revised the company’s estimates higher in recent times. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 has gone up from $2.87 recorded a couple of months back to $3.30 today. This indicates that analysts are feeling bullish about the stock.We believe investors should keep an eye on this stock, as there is strong potential for appreciation.Sony Corp Ord Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Sony Corp Ord Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Sony Corp Ord Quote Another stock worth a look is Snap-On Incorporated (SNA  -  Free Report), which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The company’s overarching business model, which aims to maximize value creation by focusing on areas like safety, quality of service, customer satisfaction and innovation, has emerged as a tried and tested growth driver. Snap-on is committed to its rapid continuous improvement (RCI) program, designed to enhance organizational effectiveness and minimize costs.Snap-on announced plans to enhance the franchise network, expand ties with repair-shop owners and managers, and foray into critical industries to strengthen its hold in emerging markets in the near future. Solid prospects across business segments, accretive acquisitions and impressive traction of the recently-launched products continue to add to the strength of this company.Nevertheless, in recent times, oil market sluggishness and currency fluctuations have been eroding the profitability of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. Further, persistent contraction in capital expenditure by auto dealers and intensifying used-car asset quality pressure are formidable headwinds. These factors remain substantial risks for Snap-On in the times to come.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader space include Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc.

140,SNA,"Snap-on Incorporated (SNA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Jul 20.Snap-on has an outstanding earnings surprise history — it has not missed estimates in over seven years. Last quarter, the company registered a positive earnings surprise of 2.1%, generating an average positive surprise of 3.6% for the trailing four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement and whether Snap-on is set to add yet another earnings beat to its long-standing winning streak.Factors to ConsiderSnap-on’s successful earnings streak reflects its consistent capability to leverage on market opportunities for augmenting growth. Encouragingly, the company has been witnessing robust prospects in most of its business lines which signal brighter days ahead. Snap-On’s broad product line adds to its strength. Additionally, the company’s financial services portfolio has been recording steady growth for the past few years.Snap-On believes that its recent Car-O-Liner buyout will strengthen its Repair Systems & Information Group offering, enabling it to fortify its footprint in the auto and heavy-duty markets. Moving ahead, Snap-On anticipates this company will generate operating income margin comparable to the RS&I undercar equipment business.Snap-On Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Snap-On Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Snap-On Incorporated QuoteAdditionally, Tools Group and Repair Systems & Information segments are anticipated to act as major profit churners on the back of positive industry trends. While factors like rising penetration in emerging markets, and constant software and hardware upgrades have been fueling Tools Group’s growth, Repair Systems is gaining from business deals with independent repair shop owners and managers.Though Snap-On’s bottom-line performance remained unaffected amid macroeconomic woes, the company is faced with multiple issues that may hurt the second-quarter results. The ongoing softness in industrial markets has significantly affected client spending, marring the company’s prospects. Also, sluggish oil and gas market activities are likely to affect the company’s top line in the quarter to be reported.Further, persistent contraction in capital expenditure by auto dealers and intensifying used car asset quality pressure are formidable headwinds for the company. Year to date, Snap-on’s shares have declined 9.1%, grossly underperforming the Zacks categorized Tools – Handheld industry’s average positive return of 4.6%.Moreover, foreign currency fluctuations pose a major concern as one-third of the company’s revenues are derived from its European businesses. Due to foreign currency woes, in first-quarter 2017, Commercial & Industrial Group sales declined $4.7 million, Tools Group sales decreased $3.2 million and Repair Systems & Information segment recorded a $2.9-million sales reduction. We believe currency fluctuations will remain a risk to the company’s top line in the quarter under review as well.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Snap-on will beat earnings estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is currently  -0.78%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.53, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.55. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Snap-on has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Imperial Oil Limited (IMO  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +7.69% and a Zacks Rank #3, is expected to release quarterly numbers around Jul 28. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Belden Inc. (BDC  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +0.83% and a Zacks Rank #1, is slated to report results on Aug 2.Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +11.76% and a Zacks Rank #2, is expected to report quarterly numbers on Jul 25.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively. And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

"
143,SNA," OVERVIEWback to topAlmost 90% of the companies in the S&P 500 have now released first quarter 2005 earnings. Of the companies that have reported, 82% have met or exceeded their estimates. The average earnings gain has been 18 % from last years first quarter. The expectation for the companies that have reported was for 13%. When all companies report, we expect final first quarter 2005 earnings growth of 16% for the S&P 500.The good news on the earnings front has been offset by some negative data on the economic front. Quite simply, we believe many investors are nervous that second quarter and second half 2005 earnings estimates will be reduced. The Zacks consensus second quarter 2005 earnings growth estimate for the S&P 500 currently stands at 9%. That is exactly where it was one month ago. Therefore, we have found no evidence that earnings estimates for the S&P 500 are getting cut. As a matter of fact, due to the better than expected first quarter 2005 results, we actually have seen the consensus 2005 annual earnings estimate creep up 0.5% point over the past thirty days.Zacks industry rankings are provided toward the back of this report. The rankings are based on a quantitative model developed by Zacks that focuses on past earnings trends and forward earnings revisions from Wall Street analysts. The model has an excellent track record of outperforming the market. Therefore, the Zacks industry rankings should provide a great starting point for your equity research. Companies in the spotlight

"
145,SNA,"Chicago-based Jones Lang LaSalle, Incorporated is a leading full-service real estate firm that provides corporate, financial, and investment management services.  The company caters to corporations and other real estate owners, users, and investors worldwide.  A broad real estate product and service range, and extensive knowledge of domestic and international real estate markets, enable Jones to operate as a single-source provider of real estate solutions.Jones Lang LaSalle was formed following the 1999 merger of LaSalle Partners, Incorporated, and Jones Lang Wootton companies.  Its diverse operations span more than 100 markets in approximately 34 countries across the globe.  The company divides its business into two primary segments:  Investor and Occupier Services (IOS), and Investment Management.  The IOS segment (which produced $1.035 billion in revenue in 2004) is sub-divided into three units:  Americas, with its strong focus in implementation and management services, providing 35.9% of revenue; Europe, where Jones Lang has a strong capital markets transaction business, providing 42.8%; and Asia-Pacific, generating 21.3% of revenue, at year-end 2004.  These units collectively manage owned or leased real estate in international locations; represent tenants for the acquisition and disposition of properties; provide leasing to agencies; service corporate properties; manage property; and provide valuation services.The Investment Management (IM) division generated 12.7% of revenue in 2004, but contributed more than 34.5% to total operating income of $92.2 million in 2004.  IM, with $26 billion under management, provides real estate investment-management services, mainly to institutions, corporations, and affluent individuals.  Its prominent customers include the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Microsoft, and Procter & Gamble.  The company runs its global investment management business under the LaSalle Investment Management brand.  Jones Lang LaSalle usually invests its clients funds in publicly traded securities of real estate investment trusts (REITs), and via acquisition and development joint venture structures. Sell-off After First-Quarter 2005 Announced Overdone
"
146,SNA,"First-quarter 2005 results were roundly met with disapproval from investors, as the stock traded off nearly 20% during the day results were announced.  While volatility like that should be considered before making an investment in a small-cap, fairly illiquid security like Jones Lang, we believe the selling was clearly overdone.  It is true the companys first-quarter 2005 loss was wider than results reported in the prior years first quarter (-$0.27 per share in 1Q05 versus -$0.20 per share in 1Q04), the first quarter is not only the seasonally weakest time of the year for most real estate services companies, Jones Lang used the slowdown to increase investment in its segments, which positions the company more favorably longer-term.  We believe much of the sell-off was due to momentum investors bailing on news they do not understand.  Likely, they saw Jones Langs peers (Trammell Crow and CB Richard Ellis) report positive first quarter earnings, and panicked.  With a business that is typically back-end loaded (fourth quarter is generally the strongest period for the company), we recommend taking advantage of the sale and adding to positions. Improving Economies in U.S. and Europe Driving Margin Improvement in IOS
"
147,SNA,"The U.S. economy has regained its footing and should improve further in 2005, which should drive increasing demand for real estate services.  Jones Lang is already starting to see improvement, as evidenced by the 230 basis point operating margin improvement in its Americas IOS segment in 2004, versus 2003.  We are forecasting continuing improvement in margins in 2005.  With more than 2 million new jobs expected to be created in 2005, we believe the company should be able to grow its Americas business in the mid-double-digits, and see operating margin expansion in the 100-150 basis point range.We believe out-performance for Jones Lang could derive from its Europe IOS segment, which has lagged in performance due to a slower economic recovery, and to rising interest rates in Europe that are hurting the companys transactions business.  We expect strong revenue growth, but are forecasting relatively flat operating margins in this business, due to increasing competitiveness and declining transaction volumes.  We believe, however, that our margin assumption (at 4.1% for 2005) could prove conservative, particularly if leasing and management services can become a bigger proportion of revenues. Strong Growth Prospects for Investment Management Business
"
148,SNA,"With recent strong real estate returns in the capital markets (according to NAREIT, publicly traded real estate companies delivered a total return of 30.4% for 2004, versus 10.9% for the S&P 500 over that same time period), we believe Jones Langs investment management business should see increasing interest from investors looking to capture strong real estate returns.  With interest rates expected to increase at a measured pace, and real estate fundamentals improving across all property types, we believe real estate investors should continue to see returns that outpace the broader market.  As such, we expect strong growth in funds under management in 2005 for Jones Langs IM division.  In the first quarter, assets under management grew nearly $2 billion, from $24 billion at yearend 2004 to $26 billion currently.  As the company continues to monetize funds that have reached target performance metrics, given the strong equity and private market performances of real estate investments, we are forecasting that incentive fees could increase by at least 50% in 2005, from the $20 million the division generated in 2004, even if the $20 million is well-above normalized fees.  Incentive fees are highly accretive, given that they are not budgeted to cover fixed costs, and generally only trigger higher variable bonus payments for managers. Outsourcing Driving Strong Demand for Real Estate Services in Asia Pacific
"
149,SNA,"U.S. companies continue to offshore tasks overseas to India and China.  We believe that Jones Lang is uniquely positioned to capture the increasing demand for space, be it call-centers, manufacturing and distribution facilities, or office space, via its brokerage services and capital markets operations in these countries.  Additionally, China continues to be the best growth market in the world, and we believe that despite recent interest rate increases by its central bank, China should continue to pace the world in economic expansion.  With very little infrastructure in the country to support expected growth, we believe demand for real estate services should be increasing long-term, which should serve to accelerate growth for Jones Lang in 2005 and beyond.  Moreover, the company is seeing strong transaction-based fee growth, particularly in its hotel business, and that should continue into 2005, as interest rates remain low for most Asia Pacific countries.  We particularly like prospects in the Japanese market, where transaction volume should increase. Re-iterating our Buy Recommendation
"
150,SNA,"Given improving real estate fundamentals and economic growth around the world, we believe shares of Jones Lang will continue to outperform the broader market.  Jones Lang reported such great fourth-quarter results, we are affirming our cash flow estimate for 2005 of $2.35 per share.  We are forecasting the same EBITDA for 2005 as in our prior report; however, the company has more shares outstanding, and as such, we are tweaking our EBITDA per share estimate to $4.65 per share.  We are reaffirming our Buy recommendation, but are lowering our price target to $42.00 per share, based on a 10.2x enterprise value to EBITDA multiple we believe the company merits. Sell  Snap-on (Ticker: SNA)
"
151,SNA,"Snap-on  is a global provider of professional tools, equipment, and related solutions for technicians, vehicle service centers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and other industrial users. Products include a broad range of professional hand and power tools; tool storage; vehicle diagnostics and service equipment; business management systems; equipment repair services; and other tool and equipment solutions. The company operates through four reportable business segments: the Snap-On dealer group, the commercial & industrial group, the diagnostics & information group, and the financial services segment. In 2004, Snap-on generated net sales of over $2.3 billion, of which 44% was derived by the Snap-On dealer group, 41% from the commercial & industrial group, 12% from the diagnostics & information group, and 3% from the financial services segment.Over the past few years, management of Snap-on has focused on delivering a more predictable and consistent financial performance as well as enhancing shareholder value. To this end, the company implemented its Driven to Deliver strategy in 2001, which has resulted in an increased focus on customer relationships and business processes. The company has also looked to improve asset utilization by rationalizing production through plant closures and making more effective use of working capital. The company has also become more customer-driven, invested in new products, and increased brand awareness. In addition, Snap-on is returning value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.While we believe that Snap-on is steadily progressing towards a turnaround, the pace of change remains below both managements and investors expectations. As a result, managements earnings expectation for fiscal year 2004 deviated substantially from an original forecast at the beginning of the year of $1.80 to $2.20 per diluted share to an actual reported $1.40 per diluted share.  Further, we do not expect the company to achieve the high end of its original guidance until 2007. In our view, management has substantial work to do in order to generate the type of margin improvement investors now expect from the company. In line with this, management indicated that the company will take an additional $20 to $25 million in restructuring-related charges in fiscal year 2005 as it looks to further reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies.  As such, we continue to believe that the companys valuation remains well ahead of the current stage of recovery.We expect near-term results to continue to be hampered by rising raw material and freight costs and disappointing organic growth for the dealer group in the U.S. While the company has worked to rationalize asset utilization and manufacturing costs, production relocation has led to previously unanticipated operational inefficiencies and higher freight costs. We expect these costs, combined with rising raw materials costs, to largely offset the benefits associated with the headcount reduction and the closure of production facilities. In addition, we expect higher spending in 2005 related to the companys initiative to transition to a build to order production process for its higher volume products.  We also expect disappointing organic growth and a decline in the average number of dealer vans to hold back company-wide organic sales growth in 2005. Finally, we are somewhat concerned about the departure of the companys CEO and the replacement by a member of the board.  Given our negative outlook for the company, and the current high valuation, we maintain our Sell rating. 1Q 2005 Earnings Scorecard  S&P 50069% (of the companies) exceeded estimates
