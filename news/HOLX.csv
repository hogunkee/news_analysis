0,HOLX,"Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) caters to a niche clientele, keeps pushing back the launch of its next product, and trades at a multiple of about 60 times earnings.XTo investors, that might sound like a big ""no thanks.""Yet Wall Street pros laud this veterinary diagnostics company's management as ""brilliant,"" with an ""unbelievable grasp of their business.""""Simply put, the company's execution continues to be second to none,"" Raymond James analyst John Ransom said in a recent note to clients.Ransom went on to say: ""Further, it is not often that a player in any space with dominant (approximately) 60% market share is able to maintain the base in highly competitive markets, yet Idexx posted placement numbers that suggest it could even be gaining share.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFor one thing, the niche market in question is the veterinary market, one that may sound small in number. There are fewer than 66,000 veterinarians across 31,000 animal health clinics in the U.S., according to the Census Bureau. Annually, though, vets serve millions of very passionate customers: pet owners. And, well, their pets.About 68% of U.S. households have a pet, according to the American Pet Products Association. That translates to nearly 90 million dogs and more than 94 million cats — not to mention the multitudes of birds, fish and other creatures hanging out in people's homes. Its most recent annual survey reveals that dog owners spent an annual average $731 on routine and surgical vet visits combined. Cat owners shelled out $427.Idexx is the industry leader in supplying vets with the technology to run those in-clinic tests and blood work. It caters primarily to beloved canines and felines in the U.S. and abroad. Like Raymond James' Ransom, Canaccord Genuity analyst Mark Massaro pegs the company's stateside market share at a hefty 60%.No. 2 player Abaxis (ABAX) has cornered a quarter of the American market, while smaller competitor Heska (HSKA) has about a tenth. VCA unit Antech Diagnostics and Zoetis (ZTS) —the latter of which is acquiring Abaxis — also number among its rivals.Water treatment and livestock products account for a sliver of Idexx's revenue, but the big money comes from its companion animal diagnostics business. That includes a suite of in-clinic products such as chemistry panels, rapid test kits, veterinary instruments and analyzers. There are also external laboratory services such as diagnostic imaging and testing.The companion animal diagnostics unit brought Idexx more than $1.7 billion in net revenue in 2017, or 86.5% of its overall $1.97 billion haul for the year.When a person simply takes a pet to the vet, it is likely to result in Idexx's tests and equipment being used. In the U.S., some kind of diagnostic test is administered about 40% of the time people bring their fluffy friends to the clinic, Idexx said during its investor day presentation last August.Pet owners tend not to object. In fact, millennial pet owners are more likely than their older peers to say ""money is no object to me when it comes to my pets,"" according to Idexx survey work. Forty-one percent of 19- to 36-year olds felt that way, vs. 36% of Gen Xers and 21% of Baby Boomers.As younger people get laser-focused about their careers and wait longer to get married and have kids, ""(they) go out and get the dog at 24, 25,"" years old, said Massaro.Millennials, he said, are ""prioritizing pets over some other things that maybe people from one or two generations ago held in greater esteem.""Idexx's most recent quarter was lauded by analysts, as per-share profit rose 55% to $1.01 a share and revenue grew 16.5% to $538 million, topping views for 93 cents and $526 million, respectively, according to Zacks Investment Research.The company has seen success with SediVue, the industry's first in-clinic urine sediment analyzer. And its recently launched product, Catalyst SDMA, an in-clinic test used by vets to look for kidney disease, was adopted by 42% of its North American customers in the first few months of its debut. Idexx Chief Executive Jonathan Ayers contends that's ""an amazing, amazing accomplishment.""""Nothing happens fast in veterinary,"" he told analysts on the call. ""The adoption rates are typically very slow. And in that context, the adoption of SDMA on the slide has been exceptional. And so we're very, very pleased with the success we've had.""The quarterly beat reinforced Piper Jaffray's bullish call on the companion animal industry, and William Blair analysts said they ""believe the long-term investment merits of Idexx remain very compelling.""""They beat on every single line, every single reference category,"" said Canaccord Genuity's Massaro, adding that ""it gets down to extremely strong commercial execution. (Idexx has) one of the most savvy sales organizations I've ever seen."" He points to the company's unusually large direct sales force — 435 sales reps in North America and more than 100 in Europe — as a particular strength.Shares of Idexx ended trading Thursday down close to 1% to 202.37 but barely remained above a 202.36 buy point. Shares were up marginally on Friday. It broke sharply out of a cup-with-handle base in high volume following the company's earnings report on May 4.Management also lifted its full-year earnings guidance by 2 cents to $4.06 to $4.20 and organic revenue outlook to 10.5% to 12.5% growth on a currency-neutral basis. It reaffirmed its sales outlook, adjusted for exchange rates, at 12% to 14% growth.Even though Raymond James' Ransom had high praise for the company, he only reaffirmed his market perform rating in the same note to clients, citing the high price-to-earnings multiple as a hindrance to a more positive rating.That comes after Idexx has, on more than one occasion, pushed back the launch of its SNAP Fecal Dx, which will allow vets to test, in house, for the presence of hookworm, whipworm and roundworm infections.Canaccord's Massaro brushed off the delay. In his view, that Idexx continues to ""crush their numbers, raise their guide without a product launch coming. (It) tells me and the Street they're beating their numbers.""It's ""startling that Idexx can consistently trade almost three times the premium multiple of other good health care companies,"" said Massaro. For example, Hologic (HOLX), a medical imaging company that he calls the ""undisputed leader in 3D mammography,"" trades at about 19 times earnings (vs. Idexx's 60 times earnings).But Idexx's consistent beat-and-raise quarters and model of nearly 90% recurring revenue — ""unusually high for a health care number"" — bolster his confidence.Idexx's management team has an ""unbelievable grasp of their business,"" he said.William Blair analyst Ryan Daniels believes that the company is ""a durable business franchise that warrants a premium multiple,"" and wrote in early May that the firm ""would be more aggressive with share purchases on pullbacks.""More broadly, Raymond James' Ransom said in April that investors shouldn't expect growth to ramp up in the end-market for companion animal diagnostics. That means shares of companies like Idexx, Abaxis and Heska are ""more likely to move on individual successes (share gains, new product launches, etc.) than to move uniformly on an all-encompassing cyclical dynamic.""But given the baseline growth rate of the animal health diagnostics industry, Canaccord Genuity's Massaro says that means that ""even the worst company in the space would grow 6% to 8%"" each year.""It really is a spectacular industry,"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:This Medtech Stock Breaks Out After Zoetis Snags It For $2 BillionStocks Showing Improving Market Leadership: Idexx Laboratories Earns 84 RS RatingThis Top Medical Stock Breaks Out After Its Beat-And-Raise

1,HOLX,"Think of the cup-with-handle pattern as a launching pad that great stocks use to rocket into huge price runs. But what about the cup base that forms with no handle? Can it work as well?XBut sometimes a dynamic moneymaker is in too much of a hurry to form a handle before blasting up to new highs. Savvy investors also know how to spot a cup base that forms without a handle.A CAN SLIM-type investor always first pays tremendous attention to a company's profits, revenue, profit margins, return on equity and other metrics of growth. But don't look at fundamentals in a vacuum. When it comes to winning the stock trading game, precise timing is of the essence.So it's dangerous and actually foolish to ignore technical analysis, a fancy term for simply rolling up your sleeves and analyzing a stock's behavior via charts.If you ignore price-and-volume action, you are clearly missing out on a significant factor in what makes certain stocks great. Ignoring the ""technicals"" means you disregard the all-powerful forces of supply and demand that drive a stock's price day in, day out, and over much longer time periods.As you would expect, the cup without handle resembles a U.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe base starts to develop when a stock begins to decline after an advance of 20% or more from a prior successful breakout. If there was no prior breakout, demand that the stock has risen at least 30% from any given price before it forms a cup pattern.IBD chairman and founder Bill O'Neil says this decline often outpaces the overall market's slide. ""It's normal for growth stocks to create cup patterns during intermediate declines in the general market and to correct 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times the market averages,"" he writes in his best-seller ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""At the same time, you want the stock to show some resilience too.O'Neil writes: ""Your best choices are generally stocks with base patterns that deteriorate the least during an intermediate market decline. Whether you're in a bull market or a bear market, stock downturns that exceed 2-1/2 times the market averages are usually too wide and loose and must be regarded with suspicion.""You want to see a drop of no more than 30% to 33%. While some cups shaped during severe bear markets can be 40%-50% deep or more and still work out, it's generally smart to focus on stocks that make shallower declines from their 52-week highs.A cup without handle must be at least six weeks long. Most are about three to six months long, and some can span a year or longer. Tight price action is preferable to wide and loose movements. In addition, there should be more up weeks in above-average volume (a sign of accumulation) than down weeks in fast trade (distribution).The buy point for a cup base is 10 cents above the high hit before the base took shape.As with all breakouts, look for the stock to clear its buy point in strong turnover, meaning trade that's at least 40% above its 50-day average.You can quickly see the 50-day average volume of any stock by either going to MarketSmith or viewing an IBD chart. Gen-Probe, an expert in diagnostic tests and blood-screening systems, went public in September 2002 and finished its debut week at around 16 a share. The stock then climbed to 28.45 by February 2003 (1), posting a solid gain of more than 70%. The medical play finally began its first true correction, sinking 27% from that high. investors were watching to see if the stock would clear its buy point of 28.55 in strong volume — or if it would tack on a handle to create a cup-with-handle base.Gen-Probe went with the first option. On the last trading day of April 2003, the stock gapped up 5 points, or 19%, barreling past its 28.55 trigger. Turnover that ballooned 702% above its 50-day average (2).Right before that April 30 breakout, Gen-Probe showed solid IBD ratings: a 97 Composite, 80 EPS, 91 RS, an A+ for industry group RS, B for SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on equity) and A- for Accumulation/Distribution. In the April 30 edition of IBD, Gen-Probe got featured in the Nasdaq Stocks In The News column, which is now called Stock Spotlight.The San-Diego-based firm gained 122% in 20 weeks.Not every cup without handle will work out, especially when they show flaws.58.com (WUBA) formed a cup without handle after pulling back in early December 2017. The buy point was 79.89, 10 cents above the left-side high. In the week ended Jan. 5, 2018, the e-commerce and personal ad network showed nice volume in its breakout and the stock rose 11%, surpassing the proper entry.58.com rallied over the next three weeks, but the gain failed to exceed 10%. During the February market sell-off, the stock took its lumps as well. It fell more than 8% below the 79.89 to trigger the most important defensive sell rule in investing and dove sharply back into the base.(Editor's note: A version of this column originally ran in the July 14, 2010, edition of IBD.

2,HOLX,"Botox-maker Allergan (AGN) topped Wall Street's second-quarter model Thursday, but stock reaction was muted on light sales of eye drug Restasis and stagnant revenue from fat-stripping drug Kybella.XFor the second quarter ended June 30, Allergan reported adjusted income of $4.02 per share on $4.01 billion in sales, up a respective 20% and 8.7% vs. the year-earlier period. The consensus expected adjusted earnings of $3.95 a share on $3.95 billion in sales.Allergan also raised its 2017 guidance to $15.85 billion to $16.05 billion in revenue and adjusted income of $16.05-$16.45 per share. Previously, Allergan had guided to $15.8 billion to $16 billion in sales and adjusted earnings of $15.85-$16.35 a share.""This raise was unexpected in our view,"" Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler said in a note to clients. Koffler kept her 267 price target and buy rating on Allergan stock. ""The stock may be held back by some mixed performance in key products.""Botox cosmetic revenue of $210.3 million in the U.S. missed Koffler's estimate for $212.7 million, though it grew 10.7% year over year. But Botox as a therapeutic in the U.S. brought in $346.9 million, topping Koffler's view for $325.6 million and grew 17.2%.Allergan cited ""trade buying patterns"" despite stable volume demand for a 9.4% decrease in sales of eye drug Restasis to $336.4 million. That number also missed consensus views for $359 million, Koffler said.IBD'S TAKE: Allergan leads the medical aesthetics market, but rivals like Hologic (HOLX), Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) have pieces of the sector. Head to Industry Snapshot for a closer look at the layout.In its gastrointestinal unit, sales of Linzess increased 11.5% vs. the year-earlier quarter to $167.8 million but widely missed Street expectations for $186 million to $188 million, Koffler said. This follows a $20 million destocking in the first quarter.Sales of Kybella, an injection used to improve the appearance of fat under the chin, were flat at $12.7 million. Juvederm collection sales climbed 7.3% to $126.2 million. CoolSculpting sales were $78.9 million, following the close of the Zeltiq acquisition in late April.On the stock market today, Allergan inched up less than 0.1% to close at 250.36.

3,HOLX,"XThe stock market closed mixed Thursday after a late wave of selling erased much of the day's work.The Nasdaq, which had been up 0.4%, closed less than 0.1% higher. The S&P 500 wiped out a modest 0.2% gain to close a fraction lower.The Dow Jones industrial average fell less than 0.1%. Medical companies Merck (MRK), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Pfizer (PFE), UnitedHealth (UNH) were four of the five best Dow components.Small caps performed better, with the Russell 2000 climbing 0.4%.The downward reversals certainly were not encouraging, but volume was lower across the board, according to preliminary data. That suggested that institutional investors did not sell in massive quantities. Also, the negative reversals were not severe in scale.Senate Republicans unveiled their own version of legislation to replace ObamaCare, and investors seemed to like what it could mean for the health care sector. Medical software, drug wholesalers, managed care and several other medical-sector industry groups were among the day's best performing, rising 0.7% to 2.2%.HealthSouth (HLS) broke out of a base-on-base pattern, closing above the 47.99 buy point. Volume was below average, which dampened an otherwise bullish move. Shares rose 3%.Hologic (HOLX) broke out of a flat base, rising past a 46.15 buy point. But it also suffered from weak volume. The relative strength line is at a new high, which backs the breakout. Two days ago, the company said it won FDA approval for its Aptima herpes treatment.Bankrate (RATE) had better volume as it broke out of a pattern with a buy point at 12.05. Volume was about 70% above average as the stock added 1.7%.On the downside, Taylor Morrison Home (TMHC) gapped down to a loss of 3%. In an SEC filing, the company said it priced an offering of 10 million shares, but did not specify the price. It also said in the filing that average sales per community for the two months ended May 31 was 2.9 homes per month vs.  2.2 in the same period in 2016, up 31.8%. Net sales orders for the same two months rose 24.3% and it expects home closings for the quarter ending June 30 to be about 1,800.RELATED:UnitedHealth, HCA, Merck Rally As Senate TrumpCare Bill Pares Near-Term Cuts2 Key Stock Index Plays In Buy Range As Biotechs Surge Again

4,HOLX,"Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Broadcom (AVGO) are three stocks that show why $1.7 billion USAA Growth & Income Fund (USGRX) is smart for using two oars rather than just one.The fund's management is divvied up between two teams, one tilting toward value-oriented stock, the other toward growth stocks. Last year, when the postelection Trump Bump lifted value-oriented stocks like energy and financials, bets in those sectors boosted the fund's value-oriented sleeve. This year it's the growth sleeve's turn to shine brighter.And with year-to-date gains of 34% for both Amazon and Facebook and 39% for Broadcom going into Thursday, those stocks have added octane to the growth sleeve's fuel. So have consumer discretionary names like Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH). And likewise for health care names like Hologic (HOLX) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH).The fund aims for a 60%-40% split in assets between its growth and value sleeves. ""That split makes sense in achieving a core fund experience for our shareholders,"" said USAA's Wasif Latif, who oversees the teams running the two sleeves. Subadvisors from Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss run the value sleeve. An in-house team from USAA mans the growth sleeve.Most of the fund's dividend comes from the Barrow Hanley sleeve.The tandem arrangement has resulted in a 23.46% return over the 12 months going into Thursday, topping 95% of its large-cap-blend rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500 was up 19.06%.So far this year, the fund is up 9.74% vs. 8.82% for its peer group and 9.86% for the big-cap bogey.John Jares, who runs the growth sleeve along with John Toohey, likes Amazon's strength in retail and web services. ""It's referred to as Hurricane Amazon because it's so disruptive,"" he said. Amazon Web Services' operating margin soared to 24.3% as of the first quarter, up from 3.8% in 2014. It's expected to hit 29% by the end of 2017, he says. With AWS' profit growing much faster than the overall company's, the overall company's operating margin will be pulled up by AWS, Jares adds. And its rapidly growing free cash flow will give the company ""more ammunition to invest against any of its competitors,"" he said.He's less enthused about Amazon's takeover of Whole Foods Market (WFM), wondering what role it will play in Amazon's future.His team is crunching numbers to decide whether investors have oversold other grocery chains. The fund also owns Kroger (KR).Jares likes the way Facebook has become a magnet for advertising dollars, largely by providing advertisers with sharper targeting of consumers. ""They can see the effectiveness of ad campaigns,"" Jares said. And Facebook can post additional ads at minimal cost. ""That's what attracted us to the stock,"" he said.The stock is trading around 153. Jares says 200 is not out of the range of possibility.A third cruise ship line that the fund owns is Carnival (CCL). ""The cruise lines have been on a tear this year,"" he said, referring to all three of his cruise ship stocks. ""Because of improved demand, they've had better pricing. Last year, there were problems from terrorism in Europe, fears about the Zika virus. With the improvement in employment and the future economic outlook of the U.S., cruise lines have seen rising demand. Plus, they've enjoyed easy comps (earnings comparisons) from last year.""Royal Caribbean is up 39% so far this year. Earnings per share grew 13%, 31% and 74% the past three quarters.IBD'S TAKE: Royal Caribbean ranks No. 3 in the Leisure-Services industry group. It has four straight years of annual earnings per share growth. Norwegian ranks No. 6 in the group. You can compare the two stocks fundamental and technical strengths in IBD's easy to use Stock Checkup tool.Norwegian, trading around 55, is up 29% this year. The stock is within its buy range for investors looking for optimal entry points.In health care, Jares says his team likes Hologic because relatively new CEO Stephen MacMillan is shifting the company to a faster growth profile serving female health, diagnostics and aesthetics.The team's view of UnitedHealth is that investors have underappreciated its Optum division, which includes a number of fast-growing ancillary businesses that improve the effectiveness of their standard insurance business.Building materials maker Owens Corning (OC), in the Barrow Hanley sleeve, is up 30% this year. EPS grew 9% and 60% the past two quarters. The stock has been driven by the housing rebound and strength in the U.S. economy.Michael Nayfa, a manager of the Barrow Hanley sleeve, said, ""Underlying fundamentals remain strong in the roofing and composite businesses, and the insulation business looks set to recover in 2017 as housing starts remain below normal and pricing is picking up. OC remains an attractive value trading at 14 times normalized earnings with a 1.2% dividend yield.""RELATED: Microsoft would surpass Amazon Web ServicesUSAA Growth & Income Fund Shows Two Heads Are Better Than OneHow To Turn A Glass Of Wine Into A $173,000 Bump In Your IRA

5,HOLX,"Hologic (HOLX) stock toppled to near a three-week low Thursday after the firm beat fiscal second-quarter sales and profit views, but reported lagging breast-screening revenue and noted ""significant disruption"" in its Cynosure unit.In late-afternoon trading on the stock market today, Hologic stock was down 5.4%, near 43.50, after earlier falling as much as 6.4%. As of Wednesday's close, Hologic shares are up 50% year to date following its acquisition of body-sculpting firm Cynosure.But Cynosure sales fell 19% year over year to $77 million for the full quarter. Under Hologic, Cynosure brought in $16 million. That beat the view of Canaccord analyst Mark Massaro who modeled $13 million.The ""blip"" in Cynosure sales was due to turnover around the time of Hologic's acquisition, the company said, citing a leak of the deal that created ""significant distraction."" Since then, Hologic has filled the vacancies and is looking to add skin tightening in the future.Hologic's Cynosure unit is expected to be ""huge,"" Massaro said. In a recent survey of 154 doctors, 22% of non-core doctors are performing non-invasive aesthetic procedures today with another 34% saying they might offer those procedures in the future.IBD'S TAKE: Hologic's acquisition of Cynosure followed Allergan's (AGN) acquisition of Zeltiq by a day. Cynosure and Zeltiq are rivals in the aesthetics business. But Allergan is pulling ahead of the market, analysts say. Head to Industry Snapshot for more on why Allergan is dominating the market.""Management won't quantify the opportunity other than to state it is 'huge,'"" he wrote in a note. Massaro kept his buy rating and 53 price target on Hologic stock. He noted the breast health unit, though stifled during the quarter, ""holds up better than feared.""Revenue from breast health grew 1.7% to $280.5 million, but that missed the consensus view for $286.3 million. Breast imaging, using a technique called tomosynthesis, slowed in the quarter. Hologic cited political unease for the decline.""Management noted that some U.S. hospitals have slowed spending based on concerns about the potential repeal of healthcare reform,"" Needham analyst Mike Matson wrote in a note to clients. U.S. breast health sales declined to 1.5% growth from 5.5% in the year-earlier quarter while international sales accelerated to 5.1% growth from 0.3%.Matson has a buy rating and 50 price target on Hologic stock.RELATED:Hologic Smashes Fiscal Q2 Sales Views, Beats On Profits By 4 Cents

Shares are up 50% for the year following Hologic's acquisition of body-sculpting firm Cynosure. Cynosure is a rival of Zeltiq, which was recently acquired by Allergan (AGN).For the second quarter ended April 1, Hologic reported adjusted income of 50 cents a share on revenue of $715.4 million. Earnings grew 6.4% on a year-over-year basis and topped by 4 cents. Sales were up 3.8% and beat the $685.4 million view.Hologic's molecular-diagnostics segment led the quarter, growing 12.6% to $142.1 million, comprising about 20% of total sales. Gynecological surgery revenue followed, up 11.2% to $101.1 million. But sales from skeletal health fell 1.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Allergan holds a dominant position in the medical aesthetics market. Can Hologic make a dent with its Cynosure acquisition? Head to IBD's Industry Snapshot for a closer look at the setup.This quarter, Hologic sold its blood-screening business to Grifols (GRFS). For part of the quarter before its sale, the blood-screening business brought in $38.3 million.

And those are just the transactions…

8,HOLX,"\Hologic (HOLX) announced a $1.65 billion plan to acquire body-sculpting firm Cynosure (CYNO) early Tuesday, a day after Allergan (AGN) said it would pay $2.5 billion for fat-freezing Zeltiq (ZLTQ).But investors were more forgiving of Allergan's purchase. Hologic stock fell 2.5% to 39.03 in the stock market today, touching a two-month low. Cynosure stock lifted 28%, near the purchase price of $66 a share and flirting with an all-time high.The all-cash transaction has a $1.44 billion enterprise value of net cash, the company said, and is subject to approval by Cynosure stockholders.Hologic, a leader in women's health, sees Cynosure as its ticket to the medical aesthetics market. Cynosure's portfolio includes more than 20 products in body sculpting, hair removal and skin revitalization.IBD'S TAKE: Hologic has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 73, meaning it outperforms nearly three-quarters of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics like sales performance. But it's only ranked 10th in the 59-company Medical-Systems/Equipment industry group. Masimo stock leads with a CR of 93. Head to IBD's Stock Checkup for the top five performers.Cynosure goes after the obstetrics and gynecological markets to make its sales — about 60% of its revenue is derived from that market vs. traditional plastic surgery and dermatology. Hologic has a strong presence in the OB/GYN market.The deal is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings per share ex items, adding 3-5 cents in 2017. In 2018, that will grow to 13-15 cents, Hologic said in a press release. The transaction also fills the hole left when Hologic divested its blood screening business.Hologic estimates the deal will help grow revenue by 150 base points and increase EPS ex items by double digits over the next several years. By year five, the return on interest will exceed Hologic's cost of capital, the company said.""We had identified medical aesthetics as an attractive and complementary growth opportunity through our strategic planning process, and are pleased to have agreed to acquire Cynosure, the best-in-class company in the space,"" Hologic CEO Steve MacMillan said in the company's news release.The medical aesthetics market is worth more than $2 billion annually across the globe, Hologic said. On Monday, Allergan put a $4 billion price tag on body sculpting alone when it announced its plan to buy Zeltiq, which uses a technique to freeze fat cells.Zeltiq stock hit an all-time high, in response.

The core business is in secular decline, which is why Massaro was surprised to see the price tag.Grifols agreed to pay $1.8 billion for $235 million in revenue, ""a lofty 7.9 times multiple,"" he wrote. Massaro kept his buy rating and 48 price target on Hologic stock. But the stock fell Thursday, likely on earnings concerns.Hologic's blood-screening business was expected to contribute $240 million in sales and 34 cents earnings per share ex items in 2017. The deal is expected to close in Q1, but Hologic said it doesn't expect to fill the EPS gap next year.On the stock market today Hologic shares fell 10 cents to 40.69. But shares remain above a 40.30 buy point out of a flat base achieved Monday.Grifols shot up 7% to 15.61, gapping above its 50-day moving average but still below its 200-day.IBD'S TAKE: Hologic is in a buy zone, but other stocks — like Cutera and Idexx Laboratories — are better rated. Get the top five medical suppliers at IBD Stock Checkup.After taxes, Hologic will have $1.1 billion in net proceeds to help offset EPS dilution. The company will use that ""dry powder"" to help it pay down $3.2 billion in debt, make one to three bolt-on acquisitions and repurchase stock, Massaro said.Needham analyst Mike Matson was equally as bullish on Hologic's sale, noting, ""The blood-screening business has been a drag on Hologic's revenue growth, and the blood-screening market is experiencing pricing pressure.""He kept a hold rating on Hologic stock.RELATEDNew Zika Screening Rule Could Boost Hologic Sales GrowthZika Blood Screening Test From Hologic, Grifols Gets FDA Nod

12,HOLX,"Diagnostics company Hologic (HOLX) got a bump on the stock market Friday on a new requirement to screen all donated blood in the U.S. for the Zika virus.Hologic's screening assay Procleix, developed with Spanish partner Grifols (GRFS), won emergency FDA approval in June after cases of Zika infection started appearing in Puerto Rico. This month, it won a $4.1 million contract to aid in the development of the test. Roche's (RHHBY) Cobas assay also won HHS support back in April.At the time, the FDA only required screening at blood centers in Puerto Rico and two counties in Florida, but now that the disease has spread the FDA advised that all blood centers in the U.S. and associated territories screen.Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar estimated that, after the 50/50 split with Grifols, the expanded screening could add $15 million in annual revenue and 2 cents to EPS.""In light of heightened investor fears over organic revenue trajectory for fiscal 2017, we note that (with) today's FDA update along with recent decision by Cigna (CI) to reimburse 3D Tomo mammography, we feel comfortable with Hologic revenues coming in above the Street's 4% estimate,"" Kumar wrote in a research note.Hologic stock rose 1% to 38.80 on the stock market today. Grifols stock fell 1% to 16.07.IBD'S TAKE: Hologic is a solid stock with a Composite Rating of 90, putting it in the top 10% of all stocks. It's only ranked 11th in the Medical Systems group, however, because the group is so strong -- currently No. 12 out of 197 Industry Groups. See its Stock Checkup to find out which companies lead the group.RELATED:Hospital Outlays On High-Tech Equipment Trend Higher

13,HOLX,"Diagnostics company Hologic (HOLX) and its Spanish partner Grifols (GRFS) said Monday that the FDA had granted emergency authorization for their new system for screening donated blood for the Zika virus.The Procleix Zika virus screening assay was approved for testing donated blood in areas of the southern U.S. deemed vulnerable to the virus, which has already been implicated in severe birth defects in Latin America. Although no indigenous cases have been reported in the continental U.S., mosquitoes have infected people as close as Puerto Rico.The Procleix Zika test is one of a suite of nucleic acid technology products developed under the Hologic-Grifols partnership, used in screening blood for HIV, hepatitis, West Nile virus and other pathogens.The FDA's decision follows another emergency authorization late Friday for Hologic's Aptima Zika virus assay to test individuals who are showing symptoms of infection or who have traveled in Zika-infested areas. The emergency authorizations allow use for as long as the agency considers the threat an emergency, but they aren't the same as a market approval.""While positive, the financial impact of the approval should be minimal,"" Jefferies analyst Raj Denhoy wrote after the Friday authorization. ""Hologic's test is the fourth now available, and the use case for individual testing is still very limited.""He added, however, that ""authorization for Zika testing in blood screening is expected any day, and that test has the potential to be more meaningful,"" presumably referring to the Procleix.Hologic stock rose 1% to 34.14 on the stock market today. Hologic stock holds a solid EPS Rating of 86, but its Relative Price Strength Rating has been floundering since its Q3 guidance disappointed investors in late April. Grifols stock has been forming a saucer-with-handle base since early November, with a 17.50 buy point, but its earnings have declined the last two quarters. Grifols stock closed up 0.7% at 15.58.

14,HOLX,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's health care plan, released over the weekend, could have a positive impact for some companies in the medical hardware and development market, says Evercore ISI.Analyst Ross Muken wrote in a research report that Clinton's plan to encourage research and development spending should give a boost to providers of life science tools and services used in pharmaceutical development.""The added focus on generics and biosimilars can add an additional leg of growth to the pharma end market, largely continuing to benefit chromatography (Agilent (A), Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO)), Waters (WAT)) and separations players (Pall/Danaher (DHR)),"" Muken wrote. ""The one potential offset would be if the increased scrutiny on drug pricing led to fewer total dollars spend on R&D (we view that as unlikely).""All the above stocks are currently highly rated by IBD metrics -- especially Danaher, which hold a highest-possible Composite Rating of 99 and is trading at all-time highs. Danaher stock closed down 1% at 80.08 on the stock market today, after touching a record high of 81.28 on Friday.Agilent shares fell 0.2%, Thermo Fisher also lost 0.2% and Waters eased 0.5%.Clinton also wants to clear out the backlog of generic drug applications in the FDA and shorten the seven-year exclusivity period granted to biosimilar drugs. Muken says this should accelerate production by companies making these drugs and drive business for contract research organizations (CROs).""Additionally, the plan's intention to hold drug companies accountable and require value-based studies to justify the high drug prices could accelerate pharma's adoption of real-world data services,"" he said. ""This adoption could provide CROs another avenue of growth outside the traditional clinical trial outsourcing and is one of the reasons highlighted by Quintiles' (Q) management for the Quintiles/IMS Health (IMS) merger.""Parexel (PRXL) has also named real-world data services as a growth driver, Muken noted.Quintiles stock, with a middling CR of 58, fell 0.8% Monday. Parexel, which holds an excellent IBD EPS Rank of 97, dipped less than 0.1%.The outlook is more mixed for clinical devices and systems. On the one hand, if the plan succeeds in expanding the number of covered lives it will help boost demand for things like orthopedic and cardiovascular implants, and the focus on women's health could be positive for Hologic (HOLX), Muken wrote. On the other hand, it could increase the pricing pressure that's already been dogging the industry.""Players like Medtronic (MDT) who are already shifting to a value-based business model are best positioned for the next leg of evolution in the health care space,"" Muken wrote.Medtronic stock, with a strong CR of 90, hit a new intraday high of 88.91 Monday before closing at 88.51. Hologic stock, which has been consolidating as the company goes through a financial turnaround, fell 0.9% to 35.61.

50,HOLX,"How To Spot A Fine Chart: First In A SeriesNot all cups are alike. Sometimes the differences jump out at you. But it's the subtle details that can trip you up.In this, the first in a new Corner series on how to assess the quality of a stock base pattern, we'll examine the left side of a cup — what it should and shouldn't look like.Simply put, a cup's left side is no place for panic.The left side of a cup appears when a stock falls. What do you want to see? Big volume, a steep retreat with the unmistakable stink of panic all over it?Certainly not. You're looking for a calm decline, without serious volume surges. The stock shouldn't just collapse like an old building. Rather, the decline should be smooth and orderly.Why do you care how a stock falls if you don't yet own it? The answer: You're still shopping, and you're tracking the professional big-money fund managers. That's what brought you to this stock in the first place. Dramatic, high-volume sell-offs are the footprints of those managers dumping as much as they can, as fast as they can.If you have been base-hunting for some time, you'll have noticed that some volume increases on a cup's left side are hard to avoid. But don't accept huge, scary surges.Now let's say your cup's left side shows no such panic. Look at the stock's weekly chart. You're looking for weekly closes in the upper 60% of the weekly range.This shows funds are likely adding to their positions — even on the way down. You want to see the big guys getting in, not out.Hologic (HOLX) built a 19-week consolidation starting in the week ended July 2, 2004. The left side appears with four straight weekly losses 1. Volume's biggest surge appears in Week 1 2, as trade climbed 22% above its usual pace.That's not much. The medical gear maker ended that week with a loss of just a few pennies — and in the upper 60% of its trading range.Week 5 shows Hologic's first weekly gain since the cup began 3. In fact, the stock had sliced below its 10-week moving average and then regained it, posting an upside reversal. This shows the hands of big funds accumulating shares. It's no coincidence that the stock bottomed just a week or two later.

Lately, the company announced a development and distribution agreement with Clarius Mobile Health for its portable ultrasound scanner system.Per the company, the integration of Clarius’ wireless ultrasound system with Hologic’s deep learning algorithms will improve the line of breast health solutions available to patients. However, the financial terms of the agreement remain undisclosed.We are upbeat about Hologic’s consistent efforts to gain traction in the Breast Health business. Last week, the company also announced the receipt of 510(k) clearance from the FDA for its Quantra 2.2 Breast Density Assessment Software. Notably, the software can be used with Hologic 3D Mammography systems.

This distributor covered sales in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and gives direct access to customers and has full control over commercial strategy. Moreover, this acquisition has started contributing to the top line. In this context, the company witnessed an increase in international sales in fiscal 2017, courtesy of the Medicor buyout.Per data provided by Markets and Markets, the breast imaging market is expected to reach a worth of $4.14 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 8.5% since 2016.

Excluding blood screening and medical aesthetics, international revenues increased 6.8% or 10.5% at constant currency.Segments in DetailRevenues at the Diagnostics segment (35.2% of total revenue) declined 8.3% year over year (down 7.4% at CER) to $284.1 million in the second quarter. Under this segment, molecular diagnostics revenues of $144.1 million increased 9.3% (10.3% at CER). In the U.S., this was primarily driven by an increasing market share and utilization of fully automated Panther system, plus market expansion by conforming to testing guidelines.  Internationally, results were strong from acquiring benefits of new leadership, healthy Panther placements and multiple new-product introductions, including viral load assays.Cytology and perinatal revenues of $121 million also showed a decline of 1% (up 0.2% at CER).Revenues at the Breast Health segment (35.1%) inched up 0.4% (up 0.9% at CER) to $283.7 million. Revenues in the U.S. declined 1.7% on reducing incremental placements of 3D gantries. International revenues however climbed 13% year over year.Revenues from the GYN Surgical business (13.2%) were up 4.4% (up 5.2% at CER) to $106.5 million. Medical Aesthetic business in the quarter reported revenues of $110 million, 13.6% of total revenue. Revenues at Skeletal Health (accounting for the rest) dropped 5.3% (down 5% at CER) to $21.8 million.Operational UpdateIn the fiscal third quarter, Hologic’s gross margin contracted 400 basis points (bps) to 50.8%. Adjusted gross margin also decreased 260 bps to 63.1% due to product and geographic revenues mix, divestiture of blood screening business and a full quarter of revenues from low-margin Cynosure products.Hologic’s adjusted operating expenses amounted to $276 million, up 19.9% year over year. Adjusted operating margin contracted a massive 480 bps to 29%.Financial UpdateHologic exited the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $588.4 million, considerably below $1.13 billion reported at the end of the second quarter. Total long-term debt was $3.22 billion at the end of the fiscal third quarter compared with $3.28 billion at the end of the preceding quarter.Year-to-date operating cash outflow was $158.3 million compared with  cash inflow of $569.7 million in the same period last year. Fiscal 2017 GuidanceHologic reduced its revenue guidance for fiscal 2017. The company currently expects revenues in the range of $3.04–$3.05 billion from the earlier band of $3.05–$3.08 billion. This new outlook reflects annualized growth of 7.3–7.8% (previously it was 7.7–8.7%). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.07 billion remains above the company-provided guidance.Management has however raised the lower end of the earlier provided adjusted EPS outlook for fiscal 2017. Hologic currently projects adjusted EPS in the range of $2.00–$2.02 (from previous $1.98–$2.02) for fiscal 2017, reflecting annualized growth of 2–3.1% (1–3.1%). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted EPS is pegged at $2.01, falling just below the upper end of the guided range.For fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, Hologic expects revenues of $785–$800 million, representing annualized growth of 8–10.1%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is $798.9 million, close to the upper end of the projected range.Adjusted EPS is projected at 48–50 cents, an annualized decline of 7.2–3.4%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter adjusted EPS is pegged at 49 cents, within the company’s guidance.Our TakeHologic posted better-than-expected third-quarter fiscal 2017 results in terms of both earnings and revenues. The company’s strong cash position is another encouraging factor.However, we are disappointed with the decrease of revenues at the company’s Diagnostics segment. The blood screening divestiture is expected to mar the company’s growth momentum in the days ahead. Overall, the company’s reduced revenue guidance for fiscal 2017 lowers investors’ confidence in the stock.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksHologic currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some of the medical stocks worth considering are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), INSYS Therapeutics, Inc.

354,HOLX,"The second-quarter earnings season has been quite impressive so far, with 286 members in the S&P 500 cohort having reported their results. Per the latest Earnings Preview, second-quarter earnings as a whole are expected to rise 9.2% year over year on 5% growth in revenues.Medical, one of the broader sectors among the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to record earnings growth in the quarter. As of Jul 28, 58.2% of the members from this sector posted impressive earnings and revenue beats of an average 84.4% and 68.8%, respectively.With the majority of bigwigs yet to report results, the next week will be crucial in deciding whether this quarter will turn out to be a real game changer for the sector. At the end of the quarter, the sector is anticipated to witness 4% earnings growth on the back of a 4.3% revenue hike.MedTech Faces Political TumultThe political gridlock over the pullback of the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare has been making headlines in the MedTech space since long. Amid such political conundrum at the Capitol Hill, market watchers will keep a tab on the MedTech space.The fraternity worries whether the final ‘Trump-care plan’ will include the ‘MedTech tax repeal’ in its agenda. Meanwhile, the old template of the plan, which promised to eradicate the infamous 2.3% medical device tax and the Cadillac tax (40% excise tax on high-cost healthcare plans) was not a bad deal.Amid such a hullabaloo, the question that emerges is how medical technology players stand to gain or lose this earnings season. Let’s take a look at four major medical technology bigwigs that are expected to release earnings results on Aug 2:Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report)This Dublin, OH-based global player in the healthcare services and products space is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, before the bell.The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.53 per share in the last reported quarter, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.46 and increased 7% on a year-over-year basis. The stock has delivered positive earnings surprises in the past four quarters, at an average of 4.05%.Cardinal Health is banking on acquisitions, strategic buyouts, joint ventures and supply agreements to drive growth. Furthermore, growth in new and existing customer count is likely to boost earnings. Management at Cardinal Health is bullish about significant cash generation in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, the company’s Cordis business is expected to generate accretive returns in the quarter (read more: Can Cardinal Health Pull a Surprise in Q4 Earnings?).Our model does not conclusively predict a beat for the company, given the combination of a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because, as per our model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 to beat earnings. Simultaneously, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Cardinal Health, Inc.

355,HOLX,"Hologic Inc. (HOLX  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 financial results on Aug 2, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.7%. Notably, Hologic’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past four quarters, with an average beat of 5.79%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayHologic witnessed a lackluster performance at its Diagnostics segment in the last reported quarter on poor Cytology and perinatal sales. Particularly, longer cervical cancer screening guidelines intervals are playing spoilsport here. With the issue still to factor into the company’s performance, we expect this segment to continue to perform dull in the upcoming quarter.We are also worried about the fact that Hologic’s blood screening divestiture is expected to impede the company’s growth momentum in the days ahead. We expect this to get reflected through the company’s financial performance in the yet-to-be-reported quarter itself.Hologic had to face several challenges owing to unfavorable foreign currency impact that has been affecting the company’s overall performance over the past few quarters. In 2017, foreign exchange headwind is expected to result in reduction of over $20 million.Escalating operating expenses and intense competition, particularly in the tomosynthesis market, continue to be concerns for Hologic. For quite some time now, the company witnessed several challenges such as restricted capital spending environment, economic uncertainties in Europe, slower sales cycles and increasing pricing pressure. We expect these problems to linger in the upcoming quarters as well.The company should get significant synergy benefits in the third quarter from the integration of Cynosure, Inc., a medical aesthetics systems and technologies company, which Hologic acquired in Mar 2017.  To mention, the U.S. FDA has recently granted an expanded clearance for Cynosure’s non-invasive body contouring product, Sculpture, to treat the back and inner and outer thighs.Coming to product launches, in the third quarter, the company received European CE mark for its new Panther Fusion system and Panther Fusion assays for flu and respiratory testing. Also, the company announced the U.S. FDA approval of itsGenius 3D Mammography exam. These along with several other product launches should also boost the upcoming quarterly results.Overall, for third-quarter fiscal 2017, Hologic expects revenues of $790–$805 million (as compared to the prior guidance of $675–$685 million). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is $798.9 million, within the company’s expectations.Adjusted EPS is projected at 48 cents–50 cents (beyond the high end of the previous 48 cents–46 cents range). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter adjusted EPS is pegged at 49 cents, within the company’s guidance.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Hologic is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  Hologic has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

356,HOLX,"Hologic, Inc. (HOLX  -  Free Report) recently announced the receipt of Health Canada approval for the new Panther Fusion system and Panther Fusion assays for respiratory virus infections.The Panther Fusion respiratory assays include the Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV, Panther Fusion Paraflu and Panther Fusion AdV/hMPV/RV tests. Further, these PCR (polymerase chain reaction)-based assays offer a highly-advanced approach to syndromic testing via the ability to run one, two or all three assays from a single patient’s specimen, based on the patient’s requirements.According to the company, these new assays, when combined with the Aptima transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) assays, enable the Panther Fusion system — as the only instrument — to combine TMA, real-time TMA and real-time PCR with full sample to result automation.Notably, the Panther Fusion module is an in-lab upgrade to the original Panther instrument. Apart from the Panther platform’s existing benefits, this new system adds flexibility of PCR to the proven performance of TMA, used by the Panther system.Further, as a result of this new system, certain additional benefits like increased flexibility, enhanced time and cost efficiency will also be obtained by laboratories.Per the company, regulatory approval was also obtained for three new assays for flu and respiratory infections. This extended the variety of diagnostic tests, capable of being run on the Hologic system.Market ProspectsPer CISION, the molecular diagnostics market is projected to reach $10.12 billion at a CAGR of 9.1% from 2016 to 2021. Considering this huge market potential, we believe, the company’s latest development is quite strategic.Hologic is consistently trying to expand its Diagnostic segment, which generated 35.4% of total revenues in the last reported quarter, despite facing a year-over-year decline of 5.5%. Under this segment, Molecular Diagnostics revenues increased 6.1% (4.4% at constant exchange rate).Stock Performance SolidOver the past three months, Hologic has outperformed its industry. The stock has gained 6.4% against the 12.7% decline of the industry. Recent Regulatory Approvals at a GlanceRecently, Hologic announced the receipt of medical device license, issued by Health Canada, to distribute Cynosure’s non-invasive body contouring product, SculpSure, for treating the back, inner and outer thighs, and submental area.Moreover, the company announced that the FDA has granted premarket approval (PMA) for the ThinPrep Integrated Imager, which will make automated imaging of Pap tests broadly available to laboratories and cytologists in the United States in April.The company's Clarity HD high-resolution 3D imaging and Intelligent 2D imaging technology have also received PMA approval from the U.S. FDA and are now available on the 3Dimensions breast tomosynthesis system.Again, in January, Hologic announced that FDA has granted PMA approval for the Aptima HBV Quant Assay for quantitation of hepatitis B viral load on the fully-automated Panther system.Its Cynosure division also announced the launch of TempSure Envi in the same month. This is an FDA-cleared advanced radiofrequency device that minimizes facial fine lines and wrinkles, tightens skin through soft tissue coagulation, and improves the appearance of cellulite.We believe this recent spree of regulatory approvals for the company’s array of products is going to boost the share price further.Zacks Rank and Key PicksHologic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report), Amedisys, Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report) and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report). While Illumina and Amedisys sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Walgreens Boots carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

358,HOLX,"Hologic, Inc. (HOLX  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 financial results on Feb 8 after the closing bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.04%. Notably, Hologic’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the past four quarters with an average beat of 3.69%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystPer the company’s Jan 8 release of its preliminary revenue performance for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, it is expected to report total revenues of $791 million, up 8% year over year and up 7% at constant exchange rate or CER. This preliminary prediction edges past the company’s guided range of $775-$790 million for the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same period is pegged at $785 million, below the company’s preliminary number.Hologic, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Hologic, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Hologic, Inc. Quote Within Diagnostics, the company expects to report revenues of $285 million, down 12.3% from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $274 million remains 15.7% down from the year-ago number.This year-over-year decline can be attributed to the estimated loss to be incurred from the divested blood screening franchise. Also, the company witnessed a dull sales performance from cytology and perinatal products in the recent past. Despite international growth, the fourth-quarter cytology revenue numbers declined primarily on dismal sales performance in the United States.However, Hologic is expected to see a stellar performance within Molecular Diagnostics, a major subsegment of Diagnostics.  In the United States, the company is expected to gain from an increasing market share and utilization of fully automated Panther system along with market expansion by conforming to the testing guidelines. Earlier, Hologic stated that it had shipped 1,300 Panthers to diagnostics customers with about 800 in the United States by 2017-end. The company noted that it actually shipped slightly more Panther systems in the period than it did a year ago. This in turn illustrates the company’s sturdy competitive edge in the molecular diagnostics space.Notably, Hologic has recently received an FDA approval to market the AptimaHerpes Simplex Virus 1 & 2 molecular assay on the Panther system. The company believes that this nod will draw more customers apart from broadening the Panther women health menu.Last quarter, Molecular Diagnostics results were robust on an internationally, markingthe sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. This upside wascourtesy of benefits of a new leadership, healthy Panther placements and multiple product introductions. These developments should further boost Molecular Diagnostics revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Molecular Diagnostics revenues of $151 million reflects an increase of 7.9% from the year-ago quarter.Here are a few other factors that might influence Hologic’s fourth-quarter results:Hologic is hopeful of sustaining a solid earnings trend in 2018 on the back of gains from the GYN Surgical segment. Strong global sales of MyoSure have been driving the top line at this segment. Given the huge market potential of MyoSure, we expect the company to maintain a bullish trend. In this regard, we must note that the U.S. launch of MyoSure MANUAL device has helped widening the company’s gynecologic solutionsportfolio.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $115 million for GYN Surgical revenues for the first quarter fiscal 2018 remains in line with the prior-year tally. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for MyoSure revenues of $53 million represents a rise of 9.7% from the year-ago period.For first-quarter, adjusted EPS is projected at 48-50 cents, reflecting an annualized decline of (3.8)-(7.7)%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric in the same period is pegged at 49 cents, within the guided range.On the flip side, Hologic had faced challenges related to an unfavorable foreign currency movement over the past few quarters. Escalating operating expenses and intense competition, particularly in the tomosynthesis market, continue to raise a concern.What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hologic is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  Hologic has an Earnings ESP of -0.10%.

This is a multiplex assay that runs on the new Panther Fusion system and detects Adenovirus, human Metapneumovirus and Rhinovirus.Per the company, the initial set of modular assays for respiratory viruses is completed with this FDA nod. The latest Panther Fusion assays offer a new-age approach to syndromic respiratory testing with the prolific ability to run one, two or all three assays from a single patient specimen. This assay complements the other two FDA-approved assays namely, the Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV and the Panther Fusion Paraflu variety.The Panther Fusion module is an in-lab upgrade to the original Panther instrument. Apart from the Panther platform’s existing benefits, this new system adds flexibility of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to the proven performance of transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), used by the Panther system.Market ProspectsPer CISION, the molecular diagnostics market is projected to reach a worth of $10.12 billion at a CAGR of 9.1% from 2016 till 2021.

362,HOLX,"The U.S. Medical Product industry has lately been a highly profitable investment space, courtesy of an ageing populace, changing market dynamics, robotic surgeries, big-data applications, upbeat consumer sentiment, abolition of medical-device taxes, R&D innovations and higher consolidation.Various reports claim that it is the largest Medical Device market in the world, raking in with over more than $180 billion in revenues.In view of these trends, the Medical-Products industry has returned 3.7% year to date, in stark contrast to the S&P 500’s loss of 0.3%. Meanwhile, the first-quarter earnings season has also taken center stage, with already 267 members of the elite S&P 500 index having reported financial numbers so far.Per the latest Earnings Preview, performances of these index participants indicate a 25.1% increase in total earnings on 10% higher revenues. The beat ratio has been impressive as well, with 76.8% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 73.8%, outperforming on the top line. The Medical sector(one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance.

Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2%. Notably, Hologic’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past four quarters, the average beat being 4.2%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystSimilar to last quarter, Hologic is expected to see a stellar performance by its Molecular Diagnostics business. In the United States, the company is expected to gain from increasing market share and utilization of fully automated Panther system along with market expansion by conforming to testing guidelines. Notably, Hologic recently received FDA approval to market the AptimaHerpes Simplex Virus 1 & 2 molecular assay on the Panther system. The company believes this approval will draw customers apart from broadening the Panther women health menu.Internationally, Molecular Diagnostics results were strong in the last-reported quarter, courtesy of benefits of a new leadership, healthy Panther placements and multiple product introductions, including viral load assays. Meanwhile, we are upbeat about the company’s receipt of European CE Mark for its new Panther Fusion system and Panther Fusion assays for flu and respiratory testing in June. The company also received CE Mark for Aptima Combo 2 Assay for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the same month. These developments should boost Molecular Diagnostics revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Hologic, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Hologic, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Hologic, Inc. Quote The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Molecular Diagnostics revenues of $146 million reflects an increase of 8.9% from the year-ago quarter and 1.4% sequentially.Here are the other factors that might influence Hologic’s fourth-quarter results:Hologic is hopeful about sustaining a solid earnings trend in 2017 on the back of gains from the GYN Surgical segment. Strong global sales of MyoSure have been driving the top line at this segment. Given the huge market potential of Myosure, we expect the company to maintain the bullish trend. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GYN Surgical revenues of $107 million reflects an increase of 4.9% from the year-ago quarter. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for MyoSure revenues of $51 million reflects an increase of 19.7% from the year-ago quarter.The company is also positioned to rake in significant benefits in the fourth quarter from the integration of Cynosure, a medical aesthetics systems and technologies company, which was acquired by Hologic in March 2017.  The. FDA recently granted an expanded clearance for Cynosure’s non-invasive body contouring product, SculpSure, to treat the submental area. This approval marked SculpSure’s sixth cleared body treatment area.For fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, Hologic expects revenues of $785-$800 million, representing annualized growth of 8-10.1%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues of $793 million is within the projected range and reflects an increase of 9.1% from the year-ago quarter.Adjusted EPS is projected at 48-50 cents, showing an annualized decline of 7.2-3.4%. However, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter adjusted EPS of 49 cents reflects a decline of 5.8% from the year-ago quarter.On the flip side, Hologic’s blood screening divestiture is expected to impede the company’s growth momentum. We expect this to get reflected in the company’s financial performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Hologic also had to face challenges related to unfavorable foreign currency over the past few quarters. Escalating operating expenses and intense competition, particularly in the tomosynthesis market, continue to concern.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hologic is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

365,HOLX,"A survey report by Gallup Analytics last month revealed that U.S. adults cited healthcare, the wider industry of medical devices, as the second major problem faced by the country under the new presidential administration. Given the current lack of clarity, let’s concentrate on some powerful long-term tailwinds of the medical device industry like emerging market expansion, mergers & acquisitions (M&A), positive demographic trends and new product innovation. These have been driving the sector’s impressive performance despite severe socio-economic and political instability.Let’s elaborate some of the major long-term drivers of the MedTech sector.Emerging Market OpeningsIt has been seen that even considering the dull performance of the U.S. medical device market (that still holds the leading position with almost one-third of the world market share) on rising regulatory and legislative uncertainty, global growth has been strong. In 2016, this industry grew 5%, a pace last seen before the financial crisis.And when along with the health policy debacle in the United States we also consider the worsening economic condition in Europe, we can conclude that this encouraging global growth comes mainly from the emerging markets like China, India, Latin America and others.Going by a recent BCG report, the share of emerging markets, which is currently less than a quarter of global MedTech revenues, is likely to increase to nearly one-third of revenues by 2022. The MedTech market in China, currently the second largest in the world, is projected to grow about 13% annually from 2015 through 2022. India’s MedTech market, the fifth largest in the world, is currently demonstrating 17% annual growth. If this continues, India may give good competition to Japan and Germany by 2022.Among other emerging geographical regions, Latin America, even in the face of general economic stagnation, holds enormous potential. Per a January 2017 report by MedTech Intelligence, the Central and South American nations significantly increased per capita spending on healthcare between 2008 and 2014.Given the huge potential in these regions, long back, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) had set up manufacturing and R&D centers in Brazil, China and India. The company’s medical device segment of emerging markets is growing three to four times faster than the developed markets.Abbott Labs ABT continues to lead the emerging market investment trend with about 50% of sales from this region. In recent quarters, sales in key emerging markets were up in double digits, driven by strength in BRIC as well as strong growth in several countries throughout Latin America, including Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Argentina.At Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report), in the last-reported first quarter of fiscal 2017, businesses in China, Latin America, and Southeast Asia showed sustained strength, growing in double digits. Overall, Medtronic remains confident about its long-term outlook on emerging markets. The company is focused on developing new public and private partnerships as well as executing channel optimization strategies.Boston Scientific’s BSX emerging markets business registered 14% organic growth in second-quarter 2017, reflecting a significant increase from 8% growth in 2013. Business in China was once again remarkable (up 20% year over year). The company is currently looking forward to much better performance ahead in China, banking on the recent approval of SYNERGY in China.Major M&As Following the company’s colossal $25 billion consolidation with St. Jude Medical in January, Abbott recently closed its $5.3-billion acquisition of Alere. With the successful wrap up of this transaction, the combined company anticipates to emerge as a lead player in the $7-billion point-of-care diagnostic space.Another path-breaking mega consolidation is on its way, between medical device major Becton, Dickinson and Co. BDX and medical, surgical, diagnostic and patient care devices provider C. R. Bard Inc. BCR, for $24 billion. After the completion of the deal (expected in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017), Becton, Dickinson promises to create a third business segment – BD Interventional.In August, Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGAA FMS signed a $2 billion deal to acquire NxStage Medical (NXTM  -  Free Report). The takeover is expected to boost revenues at the Care Coordination segment Fresenius Medical Care.Johnson & Johnson’s medical device arm, in a move to expand internationally, recently agreed to acquire Germany-based Surgical Process Institute, a specialist for the standardization and digitalization of surgical workflows in the operating theatre.This apart, Boston Scientific’s acquisition of Switzerland-based Symetis SA in May 2017 should fortify its structural heart business in Europe. Also, the company’s recently-closed $300-million deal to acquire Campbell, CA-based Apama Medical should fortify the company’s position in the Electrophysiology market.Among other notable bids, worth mentioning is Integra LifeSciences’ recent acquisition of Codman Neurosurgery business from Johnson & Johnson for $1.045 billion. This apart, in September, Cooper entered into an agreement with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries to acquire the global rights and business of Teva’s PARAGARD Intrauterine Device (IUD) in a $1.1-billion cash transaction.Divestments Medical device majors continue to offload their non-core business lines, specifically to focus on the main segments and to divest assets that are similar to the ones acquired through mergers. These divestures have been mandated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and other international anti-trust regulators. This restricts chances of monopoly in the market.In order to focus on a portfolio that delivers on global strategic priorities, Medtronic decided to divest part of its PMR (patient monitoring and recovery) division within the MITG (Minimally Invasive Therapies Group) business to Cardinal Health for a deal value of $6.1 billion.Following the announcement of its two major buyouts, Abbott divested its eyecare business, Abbott Medical Optics AMO, to Johnson & Johnson for about $4.33 billion to streamline its newly added business lines.A marketer of aesthetic treatment systems, Cynosure, recently sold itself to Hologic, Inc. HOLX. Notably, Hologic acquired all outstanding Cynosure shares for approximately $1.65 billion.To sharpen its strategic focus on core businesses, Ecolab (ECL) recently decided to sell its Equipment Care business to Audax Private Equity, a Boston, MA-based private equity firm. Also Wright Medical’s (WMGI) recent divestiture of its large joints (hip/knee) business to CorinOrthopaedics is an example of the focus that the former puts on its core businesses.In another development, in its bid to reduce and refine its portfolio and repay long-term debts, Community Health Systems, Inc. CYH divested Rockwood Health System and the associated assets to MultiCare Health System.Key Picks from the SpaceAmong the medical product stocks, Terumo Corporation (TRUMY  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), looks attractive. Abbott, Neogen Corporation (NEOG  -  Free Report) and ResMed Inc. (RMD  -  Free Report) are also well poised with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).In the medical instrument space, we are positive on Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report) and Olympus Corporation (OCPNY  -  Free Report), both carrying a Zacks Rank #1, among others. Also, we are optimistic about Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO), Steris Plc (STE  -  Free Report) and Mesa Laboratories, Inc. (MLAB), all with a Zacks Rank #2.The Weak LinksWe advise investors to stay away from companies that offer little growth/opportunity for the near term. These include companies for which estimate revision trends reflect a bearish sentiment.Stocks that do not look inspiring are NuVasive, Inc. (NUVA  -  Free Report), Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. CSII, Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) and Meridian Bioscience, Inc. (VIVO  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Nxstage Medical, Inc. (NXTM  -  Free Report) and Dextera Surgical Inc. DXTR hold a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

Revenues in the segment totaled $363.5 million, up 3.2% year over year. Per management, the upside can be attributed to growth in licensed software. Moreover, for the full year, System Sales revenues grew 7% and margins increased 6% from 2016.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is pinned at $338 million, up 5.6% year over year.Other Factors at PlayEHR ProspectsCerner’s Electronic Health Record (EHR) platform has majorly triggered growth. Lately, the company witnessed a slew of developments in its EHR platform. The Cerner Millenium EHR has been chosen to be implemented through the new Cerner IntegratedBehavioral Health deployment model by Texas-based The Menninger Clinic.Cerner was also selected by the Illinois Rural Community Care Organization (“IRCCO”) to implement Cerner HealtheIntent, across its accountable care organizations. Notably, the HealtheIntent played a significant role in driving Cerner’s earnings in the last reported quarter. The company ended the year with 144 HealtheIntent clients. Resultantly, population health bookings grew 42% and revenues rose 20%.Furthermore, in the last reported quarter, the company witnessed record bookings growth of more than 50%, which can be attributed to the latest EHR deals, with 22% of the bookings coming from outside core Millennium installed base.Support, Maintenance & ServiceIn the last reported quarter, this segment accounted for a whopping 70.2% of total revenues. Revenues in the segment came in at $922 million, up 4.7% on a year-over-year basis and in line with management’s expectations.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the segment is pegged at $967 million, reflecting a 5.3% rise year over year.Guidance SolidCerner expects first-quarter 2018 revenues between $1.315 billion and $1.365 billion.

Full-year adjusted earnings per share are estimated in the range of $2.57-$2.73.New business bookings in first-quarter 2018 are expected in the range of $1.250-$1.450 billion.Declining Margins & High DebtIn the last reported quarter, operating margin came in at 20.5%, which contracted 280 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis. The downside was caused by a 9% year-over-year surge in operating expenses. The rise was driven by personnel expenses related to revenue-generating associates and non-cash items.Additionally, long-term debt amounted to $527 million at the end of the quarter.Our quantitative model does not conclusively show a beat for Cerner this earnings season.

Moreover, feature to provide higher throughput of up to 335 Panther Fusion tests in eight hours, or up to 500 Fusion and Aptima tests are also incorporated.In the United States, the Panther Fusion is available as a full system, the testing capabilities of which can be extended by attaching the Panther Fusion module to existing Panther systems. Apart from the Panther Fusion Flu A/B/RSV assay, two additional respiratory panels, the Panther Fusion Paraflu assay and the Panther Fusion AdV/hMPV/RV (adenovirus/human metapneumovirus/rhinovirus) assay are presently under FDA review. According to the company, these three Panther Fusion respiratory assays will offer a modular approach to testing via the ability to run one, two or all three assays from a single patient specimen. The Panther Fusion assays also use ready-to-use reagents offering up to 60-day on-board stability. The Panther Fusion system cuts down hands-on time for laboratories as it provides random and continuous access with rapid turnaround time. The Panther Fusion system is the only instrument that combines TMA (transcription-mediated amplification), real-time TMA and real-time PCR with full sample-to-result automation.Hologic is consistently trying to expand its Diagnostic segment.

371,HOLX,"More than a has gone by since the last earnings report for Hologic, Inc. (HOLX  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 11.1% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsHologic Inc.  reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.50, down 1.9% year over year. However, adjusted EPS beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and remained at the upper-end of the company’s guidance of $0.48–$0.50.Strong top-line growth led to better-than-expected EPS increase in the reported quarter.On a reported basis, the company recorded net income of $59.5 million or $0.21 per share, both reflecting a year-over-year decline of 29.8% and 32.3%, respectively.Revenues in DetailRevenues grossed $806.1 million in the quarter, up 12.4% year over year. The top line also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $799 million and the company’s own estimation of $790–$805 million. At constant exchange rate (CER), revenue growth was 13.1%.Solid growth at Hologic’s molecular diagnostics and GYN Surgical business segments drove this upside in the top line.Geographically, revenues in the U.S. grew 9.5% year over year to $618.5 million. Excluding blood screening and medical aesthetics, the U.S. revenue rose 1.3%. On the other hand, international revenues were up 23% (up 26.5% at CER) to $187.6 million, banking on increased revenues of Breast Health and GYN Surgical products. Excluding blood screening and medical aesthetics, international revenues increased 6.8% or 10.5% at constant currency.Segments in DetailRevenues at the Diagnostics segment (35.2% of total revenue) declined 8.3% year over year (down 7.4% at CER) to $284.1 million in the second quarter. Under this segment, molecular diagnostics revenues of $144.1 million increased 9.3% (10.3% at CER). In the U.S., this was primarily driven by an increasing market share and utilization of fully automated Panther system, plus market expansion by conforming to testing guidelines.  Internationally, results were strong from acquiring benefits of new leadership, healthy Panther placements and multiple new-product introductions, including viral load assays.Cytology and perinatal revenues of $121 million also showed a decline of 1% (up 0.2% at CER).Revenues at the Breast Health segment (35.1%) inched up 0.4% (up 0.9% at CER) to $283.7 million.

Adjusted gross margin also decreased 260 bps to 63.1% due to product and geographic revenues mix, divestiture of blood screening business and a full quarter of revenues from low-margin Cynosure products.Hologic’s adjusted operating expenses amounted to $276 million, up 19.9% year over year. Adjusted operating margin contracted a massive 480 bps to 29%.Financial UpdateHologic exited the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $588.4 million, considerably below $1.13 billion reported at the end of the second quarter.

The company currently expects revenues in the range of $3.04–$3.05 billion from the earlier band of $3.05–$3.08 billion.

372,HOLX,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Hologic, Inc. (HOLX  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Hologic has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.61, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.93. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Hologic’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 19.25 over the past five years. Moreover, the current level stands well below the highs for the stock, suggesting that it could be a great entry point.Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Medical sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 20.01. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should also point out that Hologic has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 16.95, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Hologic stock in the near term too.P/CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price/cash flow metric. This ratio doesn’t take amortization and depreciation into account, so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business. This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are (a) generally less prone to manipulation by the company’s management, and (b) are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies.The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company’s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors. However, it is not commonly used for cross-industry comparison, as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry.In this case, Hologic’s P/CF ratio of 7.00 is much lower than the Zacks Medical Instruments industry average of 20.68, which indicates that the stock is quite undervalued in this respect.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Hologic currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Hologic a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Hologic is just 1.72, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 2.47. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 10.42, which is far better than the industry average of 19.55. Clearly, HOLX is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Hologic might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of A. This gives HOLX a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been quite encouraging. The current quarter has seen seven estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower, while the full year estimate has seen eight up and three down in the same time period.This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has inched higher by 0.03% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has risen 3.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Hologic, Inc. Price and Consensus  Hologic, Inc. Price and Consensus | Hologic, Inc. QuoteHowever, this somewhat bullish trend has likely not yet been reflected in the stock, as we have just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates expectations of in-line performance in the near term. Nonetheless, the bullish analyst sentiment indicates that the stock’s prospects in the near term look good.Bottom LineHologic is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish Zacks Industry Rank (among Bottom 35% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. Nevertheless, over the past year, the industry has outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for the broader industry factors to improve further, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

374,HOLX,"Hologic, Inc. (HOLX  -  Free Report) has moved a step forward within its core Breast Health business with another new product added to its kitty. The company has announced to have commercially launched the Brevera breast biopsy system with CorLumina imaging technology in the United States.Per the company, this real-time breast biopsy and verification system enhances workflow and patient experience, streamlining the entire biopsy process. Notably, the Brevera system claims to be world’s first and only breast biopsy solution, combining tissue acquisition, real-time imaging, sample verification and advanced post-biopsy handling into one integrated system. Designed for 2D and 3D breast biopsy, this technical method increases biopsy accuracy with real-time imaging, thus helping to perform fast and efficient procedures in a cost saving manner.Per Hologic, this new advancement is a major breakthrough by the radiologists, who were hitherto conducting stereotactic breast biopsy procedures to diagnose breast cancer. This conventional practice is time-consuming as well as uncomfortable for patients. Whereas with the Brevera system, image tissue samples can be obtained right in the procedure room within a few seconds only. Good news is that this highly sophisticated technology will potentially save up to 10 minutes per patient, cutting the procedure time almost by 25%.Hologic also claims the Brevera system’s proprietary CorLumina imaging technology to help improve workflow across multiple departments within a health system. It also features PACS integration for advanced image sharing and transfer of patient records.Significantly, within its breast health segment, Hologic has reshaped its R&D strategy toward continuous innovation around its leadership position in 3D mammography. Besides the latest Brevera routine, there is Affirm prone biopsy system.Management is hopeful that Brevera will begin to boost growth in 2017 and add more meaningful contribution in 2018. Also in June, Hologic had announced that the FDA labeled its Genius 3D Mammography exam as better than the standard 2D mammography for routine breast cancer screening of women with dense breasts.While Hologic is pretty confident about the strong adoption of its Brevera breast biopsy system in the market, we look forward to the company’s consistent efforts to flourish in the field of women’s health. In this regard, it is important to mention about the immense growth opportunities the healthcare market holds at present.Per the data provided by Markets and Markets, the breast imaging market is expected to reach $4.14 billion by 2021 at a CAGR of 8.5% from 2016. However, more searches reveal the global breast biopsy market to advance at a CAGR of 10.70% during the period 2017-2021 (per Research and Markets data, published in Business Wire).Over the last three months, the company’s share price has underperformed the broader industry.

376,HOLX,"Hologic Inc. (HOLX  -  Free Report) has been on a healthy growth trajectory of late. The company’s progress in the domestic and international markets, a strong pipeline of products as well as huge future prospects of the GYN Surgical and Molecular Diagnostics segments make it an attractive pick at the moment. Therefore this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock boasts solid prospects to drive its shares higher in the near term.The stock has a market cap of $11.01 billion. The company’s expected growth rate for 2018 is 11.6%.The company has an average positive earnings surprise of 6.3% for the last four quarters.

In the past couple of months, 12 analysts moved north with no southbound estimates witnessed. Earnings estimates have been raised around 6.1% to $2.25 per share over the same time frame.Let’s find out whether the recent favorable trend is a sustainable one.Hologic’s first-quarter fiscal 2018 performance was quite promising, primarily on the strength of Molecular Diagnostics. Headquartered in Bedford, MA, the company’s global growth was driven by an increasing market share and utilization of fully automated Panther system along with a continued solid uptake of Aptima women's health products. Notably, Aptima women’s health assays are dominant in the testing labs for detecting chlamydia, gonorrhea, HPV (Human papillomavirus) and trichomonas.Hologic, Inc. Price Hologic, Inc. Price | Hologic, Inc. Quote However, performance within the GYN Surgical space was disappointing in the reported quarter, majorly due to external factors. Moreover, four extra selling days in the prior-year period left a significantly adverse effect on the year-over-year comparison. Situation also grew tougher in the quarter under review as the company registered a windfall gain in the year-ago quarter from the recall of a competitive product.Accordingly, Hologic has underperformed the broader industry over the last three months.

379,HOLX,"We are in the thick of the fourth-quarter earnings season, with 251 S&P 500 members having reported their numbers. The current earnings season has seen an above-average proportion of positive surprises, a favorable revision trend for the present and upcoming quarter along with a strong revenue momentum.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the companies that have reported so far are up 16% year over year on 10.5% higher revenues. Of the total, 80.5% beat earnings and 78.1% surpassed revenue estimates. With 92 S&P 500 members lined up to release their quarterly results this week, we are decidedly bullish on the equity market, which is gradually demonstrating a sequential improvement.MedTech Earnings So FarMedical, one of the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to stand out this quarter. The sector benefits from favorable consumer behavior, growing prevalence of minimally-invasive surgeries, demand for liquid biopsy tests, use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.This is evident from the results of MedTech heavyweights like Laboratory Corporation Of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) or LabCorp and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report). The companies ended the fourth quarter on a solid note with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.An upbeat FY18 guidance also instills confidence. In this regard, LabCorp’s adjusted EPS guidance for 2018 is in the range of $11.30-$11.70. Further, Becton, Dickinson and Company expects adjusted earnings per share in the band of $10.85-$11.00, up from the previous $10.55-$10.65.For the fourth quarter, the expected earnings growth rate for the sector is 6.6% on 5.7% revenue growth.CAH or HOLX: Which Will See Stronger Earnings?Let’s take a look at two major MedTech stocks Cardinal Health (CAH  -  Free Report) and Hologic, Inc. (HOLX  -  Free Report) slated to release their quarterly reports on Feb 8:Cardinal Health is scheduled to release results before the market opens. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues is pegged at $34.66 billion, up 4.6% year over year. With a diverse product portfolio, Cardinal Health is one of the largest distributors of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.14, down 14.9% year over year. The company faces the risk of losing considerable business in case of loss of a major customer, which will severely impair the bottom line. In fact, Cardinal Health announced the loss of a large mail-order customer, Prime Therapeutics. This dented revenues at the company’s Specialty and Pharmaceutical Distribution segment in the last quarter.Cardinal Health, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Cardinal Health, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Cardinal Health, Inc. QuoteMoreover, our quantitative model does not conclusively show a beat for Cardinal Health. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. Cardinal Health has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of -0.70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

The Diagnostics segment is expected to record revenues of $285 million, down 12.3% from the year-ago quarter. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $279 million shows a 14.2% decline year over year. This can be blamed on the estimated loss from the divested blood screening franchise. Also, the company has been seeing weak sales of cytology and perinatal products of late.On the bright side, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $787.7 million, up 7.3% year over year. The company is expected to see stellar performance by Molecular Diagnostics, a major sub-segment of Diagnostics. In the United States, the company is expected to gain from an expanding market and utilization of fully automated Panther system.Hologic, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Hologic, Inc.

381,HOLX,"Hologic, Inc. (HOLX  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 financial results on May 2 after the closing bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 12.24%. Notably, Hologic’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the past four quarters with an average beat of 6.26%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystWithin Diagnostics, Hologic once again expects a stellar performance banking on molecular diagnostics.In the United States, the company is likely to gain from an increasing market share as well as utilization of fully automated Panther system along with market expansion by conforming to the testing guidelines.Global growth within molecular diagnostics can be attributed to the Panther system, Hologic’s fully automated molecular diagnostics instrument and also owing to a frequent utilization of Aptima women’s health assays. Notably, Aptima assays have gained a huge customer base in testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea, HPV (human papillomavirus) and trichomonas. We are also hopeful about Hologic’s expanded market for sexually transmitted disease testing.Hologic, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Hologic, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Hologic, Inc. Quote Further, we are upbeat about Diagnostics business earning a regulatory clearance for several new products in the United States over the last six quarters. These include the first three respiratory assays on new Fusion platform and three viral load tests for HIV (for human immunodeficiency virus), hepatitis C and hepatitis B. This steady pace of domestic assay innovation strengthens the company’s position to consolidate molecular testing on the Panther system. In January, the company again announced the PMA approval for the Aptima HBV Quant Assay for quantitation of hepatitis B viral load on the fully automated Panther system.All the above developments are anticipated to contribute significantly to the company’s topline in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $155 million for Molecular Diagnostics revenues reflects an increase of 9.2% from the year-ago quarter.Other few factors likely to influence Hologic’s results in the fiscal second quarter are as follows:Hologic is optimistic about sustaining a solid earnings trend in 2018 courtesy of gains from the Breast Health segment. Sales from the same have improved on the basis of an established clinical superiority of the segmental products over the last three quarters. The company has witnessed a consistent rise in market share within Breast Health on the back of direct-to-consumer initiativesand insurance coverage.Additionally, the company’s adoption of new mammography systems, 3Dimensions and 3D Performance, encourages us. These new products have already started to leverage the company’s Genius brand and also lured customers to upgrade their existing 2D systems. The company is building a broader portfolio of Breast Health products and services around the core of Genius systems so that it can play an instrumental role in the Breast Health continuum of care. Noteworthy in this regard is the recent PMA approval from the FDA for Clarity HD high-resolution 3D imaging and Intelligent 2D imaging technology. These products are now available in the 3Dimensions breast tomosynthesis system.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $293 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 remains 4.3% ahead of the prior-year tally.On the flip side, Hologic confronted challenges related to unfavorable foreign currency movement over the past few quarters. Escalating operating expenses and an intense competition, particularly in the tomosynthesis market, continue to raise a concern.What Our Model SuggestsPer the proven Zacks model, a company with a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has higher chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.Hologic has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of +0.94%, which raises confidence about a positive surprise. Together, the combination suggests that the company is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Conversely, we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to also surpass estimates this time around:Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.86% and a Zacks Rank #2.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.52% and a Zacks Rank of 2.Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.13% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player.

382,HOLX,"Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc.’s (PACB  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 results, expected to release on Apr 26, are assumed to show steady growth in the Product revenue wing —  the core business.While this may majorly drive growth, declining revenues in all other segments might mar the company’s prospects in the first quarter.In the last reported quarter, the company reported a loss of 18 cents per share, down 14.2% year over year, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Revenues came in at $24.9 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22 million, down 3.1% on year-over-year basis.Notably, for the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 19 cents per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 26.9%.

This upside was driven by an increased utilization of the company’s growing installed base of sequel systems, also known as the PacBio Sequel system.However, instrument revenues dipped 29.8% to $9.2 million, on year-over-year basis.Other Factors at PlayPacBio Sequel System Drives GrowthPer management, Sequel-generated revenues grew more than eight-fold in the fourth quarter, representing a whopping 80% of fourth-quarter revenues. Additionally, BGI China ordered 10 Sequel Systems, making it one of the primary growth drivers of Pacific Biosciences.Since the past year, a number of studies have been using or planning to use the PacBio whole-genome sequencing with a goal to increase cure rates of genetic diseases. These studies include Stanford University School of Medicine; the European Solve-RD Consortium, performing a 500-individual rare disease study; and Novogene, which has announced plans to sequence 1,000 Chinese genomes.The platform has also witnessed a series of developments lately. The flagship PacBio Sequel is currently being used by the Alabama-based HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, to support the goal of dramatically increasing the diagnostic success rate in challenging pediatric clinical cases. Moreover, Beijing-based Annoroad Gene Technology has recently placed a purchase order of 10 PacBio Sequel Systems, which is expected to increase Annoroad’s large-scale genomic service capabilities across various fields.View MixedFor the first quarter of 2018, revenues are expected to be slightly lower than the reported count in fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 due to seasonality. Banking on a better-than-expected fourth-quarter show, Pacific Biosciences expects its 2018 revenues to grow 20% from the year-ago figure, translating to approximately $112 million in total revenues.Shrinking Service Revenues & MarginsIn the last reported quarter, revenues in the Service and Other segment fell 18.3% on a year-over-year basis to almost $21.8 million.

384,HOLX,"athenahealth Inc. (ATHN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 27, after the market closes. The company’s strong product portfolio, solid network expansion strategies and unique business model are key tailwinds at the moment.Last quarter, athenahealth posted adjusted earnings of $1.11 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 64 cents. Further, earnings increased a whopping 79% on a year-over-year basis. The company posted revenues of $329 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $323 million. Revenues increased 14.2% year over year.For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $318.5 million, reflecting a rise of 11.6% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 73 cents, indicating an increase of 128.1% year over year.athenahealth, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  athenahealth, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | athenahealth, Inc. QuoteWe expect athenahealth to witness steady growth in Business Services sales — one of the major revenue components. While this is projected to drive first-quarter 2018 earnings, an expected improvement in Implementation and Other segment will also help the company generate impressive results.Considering these, the question lingering in investors’ minds is whether athenahealth will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. Let’s delve into other factors which are likely to impact the company’s first-quarter 2018 results.Business Services in FocusBusiness Services contributed 97.7% of net revenues in the last quarter. For the upcoming quarterly result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Business Services is pegged at $312 million, reflecting a rise of 12.2% year over year.Applications like athenaClinicals, athenaClinicals-Streamlined, athenaInsight, athenaCommunicator, athenaOne, athenaCollector for Hospital and Health Systems and the brand promise of ‘Unbreak Healthcare’ comes under athenahealth’s business services segment.The segment has been fortifying the company’s market position in terms of exclusiveness of services in the respective markets.athenahealth’s unique business model makes it a strong niche provider of revenue cycle management (RCM) services to small physician practices. Meanwhile, per a research report by Markets And Markets, the global revenue cycle management market is projected to reach $7.09 billion by 2020, at a CAGR of 11.8%.The upcoming results are likely to indicate strong growth in the Business Services unit.Other Factors at PlayImplementation and OthersImplementation and Others contributed 2.4% of net revenues in the last quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Implementation and Others is pegged at $7.3 million, reflecting a rise of 2.8% year over year.The segment includes Electronic Health Record (EHR) and Electronic Medical Record implementations.Of late, athenahealth has been hogging the limelight on its cloud-based big data network — athenaNet. Recently, the company launched a machine-learning model to automate faxes.Developments like these in the Implementation and Others are likely to drive athenahealth, which are likely to be reflected in first-quarter 2018 results.Strong Product Portfolioathenahealth’s portfolio comprises a wide array of products that include electronic health records, revenue cycle management, medical billing, patient engagement, care coordination, population health management and Epocrates. By the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, athenahealth launched its first machine learning model to automate faxes. The company piloted services like authorization management, which has been planned to expand the company’s client base throughout 2018.athenaInsight, an online news hub that reports on U.S. healthcare activities and trends of healthcare providers and ‘de-identified patients’ has also been a major contributor.In 2017, athenahealth rapidly expanded its patient record sharing capabilities with CommonWell and Carequality.The upcoming quarterly results will reflect benefits from the company’s strong product portfolio.Aggressive RivalryOn the flipside, athenahealth’s EHR solution faces significant competition from the likes of Allscripts Healthcare Solutions and others.Competitors such as Cerner offer long-standing seamless products integrating inpatient and ambulatory-care systems.This might dampen the company’s prospects, which will reflect on first-quarter 2018 results.What Our Model PredictsOur quantitative model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for athenahealth this quarter.This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.

385,HOLX,"Only a handful of S&P 500 players have released their numbers so far this earnings season. We expect the first quarter to see strong revenues as reflected by the solid upward trend in estimate revisions.Meanwhile, three back-to-back events in the quarter have rattled the global economy. The first was the U.S.-China trade war chaos, then came the tech backlash stemming from Facebook’s (FB) data fiasco, and finally, the chemical attack in Syria paving ways for fresh troubles between America and Russia.Furthermore, apprehensions related to further rate hikes by the Fed continue to do the rounds.Is Medical Device a Safe Haven?It is said that the stock market runs on sentiments and any unforeseen event in a particular sector has a ripple effect on others. Going against this notion, the Medical-Device sector within the broader Medical universe has proven to be a refuge for investors. Shrugging off the ongoing tensions, the sector has returned 2% year to date, significantly higher than the S&P 500’s return of 1.1%.This is because, Medical-Device companies have been riding high on R&D innovation, increasing consolidation, focus on emerging market and tax abolition.In fact, our latest Earnings Preview gives an encouraging picture with the broader Medical space expected to register year-over-year earnings growth of 7.8% on revenue growth of 6.3%.So, it would rather be interesting to see how the Medical-Device companies are placed ahead of the reporting cycle and what are the major factors shaping up the releases.Growth DriversGoing by a CISION report, the United States is the largest Medical-Device market in the world, raking in more than $180 billion in revenues. It has been a very profitable investment space of late.Considering the ageing population, changing market dynamics toward Artificial Intelligence (AI) & big-data applications, upbeat consumer sentiment and increased business investments, the Medical-Device sector appears to be in pink of health. Here are the latest headlines from the space:Taxes Abolished!A bipartisan two-year suspension of a ‘Medical Device’ tax, which imposed a 2.3% excise tax on MedTech manufacturers, has been a temporary relief. It will be again put into effect on Jan 1, 2020.The repeal is expected to boost hiring and investment among the 9,000 America-based Medical-Device manufacturers, instilling investor optimism in them.The ratification of the tax-repeal amendment has encouraged massive investments in the sector.Digital Revolution Takes MedTech by StormThe latest trend of robotic surgeries, Big-data analytics, bio printing, 3D printing, electronic health records (EHR), predictive analytics, real-time alerting and revenue cycle management services in the U.S. MedTech space have been gaining prominence.Various reports suggest that the strategic application of AI in every sphere of healthcare can provide an impetus to productivity. Evidently, companies that adopted AI technologies have witnessed a 50% reduction in healthcare costs and have also experienced improved patient outcome of more than 50%.This along with a rise in minimally-invasive surgeries, higher demand for liquid biopsy tests and use of IT for quick and improved patient care, and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model have been driving profits of Medical-Device companies of late.Buyout RushLately, health insurers have been looking to collaborate with pharmacy benefit managers in the MedTech space to streamline costs in the drug supply chain.Buoyed by continued capital inflow, strategic M&A policies by key Medical-Device players have expanded customer base, moderated leverage and enhanced cash flow. This has also alleviated pricing pressure and competition in the MedTech space.In this regard, the latest buyout announcement of Express Scripts (ESRX) by Cigna, which follows just three months of drug chain and pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp’s (CVS) announcement of plans to acquire the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna, is important. Becton, Dickinson and Company’s (BDX) takeover of C. R. Bard is also worth a mention.Zacks Methodology to the RescueGiven the existence of a number of players in the Medical-Device industry, finding the right stocks that have the potential to beat earnings banking on the above factors might quite an intimidating task.Our proprietary Zacks methodology, however, makes it fairly simple for you.One can narrow down choices by focusing specifically on the ‘medical instruments’ and ‘medical product’ stocks (specialized chunks under the Medical-Device subcategory), that sport the desirable combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement. It provides the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.Going by this criterion, we hereby present four stocks that are poised to beat estimates this quarter.Our PicksEdwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Irvine, CA, Edwards Lifesciences deals in products and technologies aimed at treating advanced cardiovascular diseases, especially structural heart disease in critically ill patients.The company’s strong pipeline of products and solid performance delivered in the TAVR market bolster our confidence in the stock. Although Edwards Lifesciences’ higher operating expenses might have made investors apprehensive, it is a respite as the funds were used for adopting advanced initiatives to drive overall sales.Edwards Lifesciences will report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, after the market closes.We believe the company is set to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +1.36%.Hologic, Inc. (HOLX  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Bedford, MA, Hologic develops, manufactures, and supplies diagnostics, medical imaging systems and surgical products which cater to the healthcare needs of women. The company is focused on mammography systems for breast examination and osteoporosis assessment.The company will release results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 on May 2, after the market closes.  Hologic’s Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.94% raise possibilities of a beat this quarter.Meanwhile, you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Kalamazoo, MI, Stryker is one of the world’s largest Medical-Device companies operating in the orthopedic market.Mako is Stryker’s robotic-arm Assisted surgery platform which provides a predictable surgical experience when performing joint replacement surgery.Recently, Stryker launched the robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty application for use with the Mako System. Notably, this is the first and only robotic technology which can be used for total knee, hip and partial knee replacement procedures. Notably, Mako Total Knee utilizes both Stryker’s robotic platform and Triathlon Total Knee System, guided through CT-based 3D modeling of bone anatomy. The system also allows for intra-operative planning and assists in bone resectioning procedures.Stryker will report first quarter of 2018 results on Apr 26, after market close.  We believe Stryker is poised to trump the Zacks Consensus Estimate as it has the encouraging combination of a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +0.16%.Teleflex Incorporated (TFX  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Wayne, PA, Teleflex develops, manufactures, and supplies single-use medical devices for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications worldwide.The company’s strong focus on High Flow Nasal Cannula Therapy (HFNCT) is likely to lend it a competitive edge in the niche space.Solid growth in the preloaded anti-microbial and anti-thrombogenic VPS PICCs platform is likely to strengthen the vascular platform. In the surgical segment, new products like EFx and Ae05 fortify the company’s foothold. Finally, the company’s flagship LMA unique product strengthens its Anasthesia product line.The company is expected to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3.We expect an earnings beat for this stock which has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.71%.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this year, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.
