0,DUK,"Several of the largest sector and industry ETFs have been mauled by the bear recently.Alerian MLP (AMLP) sits 45% below its 52-week high, putting it firmly in bear market territory. It invests in energy-focused master limited partnerships, typically midstream, pipeline companies.IShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) is trading 34% off its old high.Then there's Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU), a defensively oriented exchange traded fund.Think of it as your bear pepper spray for tough markets. It's worth considering an overweight to utility companies, especially since the broad-market ETF such as SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) that you may already own only has a 3% stake in the sector.XLU has gained 5.7% year to date through Feb. 17 vs. a 5.4% loss for SPY.So far in 2016, AMLP stumbled 18% and IBB tumbled 21%.Meanwhile, XLU hit a new 52-week high of 47 last week as the broad market was sinking. It has a Relative Strength Rating of 85, which means it is outgunning 85% of the stocks and ETFs in the IBD database.That momentum helped it earn a place on the elite IBD Leaderboard, becoming the first ETF to do so.Leaderboard holds stocks with stellar technical and fundamental factors, which offer investors the most potential for the biggest gains. Only three other stocks made that list Thursday -- AT&T (T), Ross Stores (ROST) and Reynolds American (RAI).XLU led these peers with a 2% gain on the stock market today. Along the way, it reclaimed a 46.24 buy point and formed a new handle area with a 47.10 entry. Shares are in a buy range.The $7.62 billion ETF last broke out of a base, on Oct. 24, 2014. Investors who jumped on that opportunity pocketed a 12% gain if they sold when XLU peaked at 49.78 three months later.Keep in mind that while breakouts from sound bases often lead to substantial gains, breakouts can fail. So among wise investors' sell rules are those that will help them cut any losses short.XLU offers broad exposure to 29 high-yielding utility companies in the S&P 500. As such, it has a large- and midcap skew.Top holdings include NextEra Energy (NEE), Duke Energy (DUK) and Southern Co. (SO)The utilities sector is one of the steadiest segments of the market.""This fund has been less volatile than the broader market because of the sector's generally stable cash flows and lower sensitivity to economic cycles,"" Robert Goldsborough, a Morningstar analyst, wrote in a recent report.However, the sector could get hurt if the Fed stays on track with its proposed four interest-rate hikes this year.""Higher rates generally make fixed-income instruments more attractive on a relative basis and make bond-like equities, such as utilities companies, less attractive,"" Goldsborough said.XLU has a 0.14% expense ratio and a 3.5% yield.It's the top-performing utility ETF year to date.

1,DUK,"James ""Buck"" Duke made his first fortune in tobacco, changing the way Americans used it. He made his second fortune in electrical generation, bringing light and power to many parts of the Carolinas for the first time.His entrepreneurial brilliance was matched only by the generosity of his philanthropy later in life.Duke (1856-1925) came from a line of subsistence farmers in rural North Carolina, near Durham.His father, Washington, who went by Wash, started a tobacco processing business that bought, cured and sold the leaf to retailers.Wash's insight, which would help make his son one of the nation's wealthiest men, was that the money was not in growing tobacco, but in buying, aging, curing and preparing it for retail.After a six-month course of studies at Eastman Business College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., 18-year-old Buck quickly became the brains and heart of his father's business.The young man excelled in devising ways to cut expenses and increase profit — even traveling at night in order to avoid hotel bills.He also had an eye for talent.He hired Edward Small, a salesman who set a lasting trend when he acquired permission to use the image and endorsement of Madame Rhea, a famous French actress touring in Atlanta in 1879.New LookThe resulting ad, depicting a beautiful woman (at that time shockingly) promoting cigarettes, caused a sensation when it appeared in the Atlanta Constitution and on billboards all over town.Local sales skyrocketed.Duke was a visionary in his belief that cigarettes — still an exotic product with a relatively small market in 1870s America — would be the next big thing in tobacco.That butted up against what biographer John Winkler, in ""Tobacco Tycoon,"" called ""the popular attitude ... that only sissies and dudes would smoke cigarettes.""On a personal level, Duke detested what were termed paper cigarettes, preferring to chew tobacco.""He thought that cigarettes were kind of trashy ... the fast food of tobacco,"" said Stanford professor Robert Proctor, who has written on the history of cigarette smoking.Americans largely agreed, and smoked only 238 million cigarettes in 1879. But by 1910, thanks in no small part to Duke's efforts, they would smoke 8.6 billion of them.Duke's big break — and the cigarette's — came through Virginian inventor James Bonsack, who in 1881 patented a machine that could roll 200 cigarettes per minute.Duke got the inside track on this innovation (and a discount on royalties for using it) by helping Bonsack work out its kinks.By 1884, the machine had been perfected, and Duke put two of them to work for W. Duke, Sons & Co. of Durham 10 hours a day.Together, they produced a quarter-million cigarettes daily for just 30 cents per thousand — 50 times the volume of a skilled roller by hand and at less than half the old manufacturing cost.This abundance of product permitted Buck to start selling into New York, where he set up a second factory with four more of Bonsack's machines.Duke found a residence in Manhattan and began calling on local tobacconists. They dropped their resistance to his products after the Duke brand's celebrity-studded advertising campaign had customers requesting them by name.It helped that the firm gave away paraphernalia — clocks, folding chairs — with company brand logos to dealers who made sufficiently large orders.By 1887, the Duke brands, including Cameo and Crosscut, were gobbling up the market share of the Big Four cigarette outfits of the day. They responded by copying him — automating production and adopting Duke's modern marketing techniques. None could keep up, especially because Duke was so willing to accept a much lower short-term profit to gain that market share.They finally surrendered, agreeing in January 1890 to pool their assets and form the American Tobacco Co., a trust with $25 million (worth $670 million today) market capitalization and with Duke as president.Over 20 years, Duke would oversee the company's 1,200% growth.One reason for the boom was Duke's negotiating a contract with Bonsack for today's equivalent of $34 million in royalties in exchange for exclusive use of his cigarette rolling machine. No other company could use it from 1891 to 1895, giving American a critical competitive advantage in a rocketing market just as cigarette smoking was catching on in earnest.Having conquered cigarettes, Duke employed similar tactics in conquering the chew, snuff and British tobacco markets.In Britain, his competitors surrendered after he promised new retailers they could keep all profits from the sale of his products the first four years. American even got into the retail business, controlling 500 stores by the time the firm was broken up.The GripBy the turn of the century, Duke's trust controlled 93% of the U.S. cigarette market, 80% of the snuff market and 62% of the chew market, Winkler records. By 1906, it had acquired at least 250 companies and exercised a near monopoly over the price of the tobacco crop.Some Kentucky tobacco farmers reacted with a violent campaign of sabotage and reprisals known as the Black Patch Tobacco Wars. In their opening salvo, they torched two of American's tobacco warehouses in Princeton, Ky., and they continued such raids on occasion until the company was broken up.James Buchanan Duke was born in rural North Carolina, where tobacco was a cash crop for many small farmers. His mother died before his second birthday.His father, Wash, was drafted into the Confederate army in 1863 and returned nearly penniless to find that his farm equipment and animals had been plundered in the chaos of the Civil War.The one thing untouched by looters was a storage barn filled with harvested tobacco leaves. With this, he began the tobacco processing business that would become W. Duke, Sons & Co.Wash built a small factory for the task on his property, and by 1872 was processing 60 tons a year. That was only the beginning of Buck's big plans.In 1911, when the Supreme Court ruled that American Tobacco was a monopoly and ordered it broken up, Duke responded like a practical businessman. He drafted the plan by which American would become four companies, each with the assets it needed to compete with all the others in all tobacco markets.Energetic ShiftDuke would thereafter merely remain a large shareholder and give up his management role.He turned his attention to investments he had made the previous decade in hydroelectric power.His dams would modernize the Carolinas and double his wealth.Having incorporated Southern Power Co. (later Duke Power, then Duke Energy (DUK) in 1905, he began scouting and buying land and water rights.Before building dams, he would invest in rural businesses (especially cotton mills) to which he hoped to sell electricity, then make a handy profit after they had been electrified and production increased. By 1913, Southern was providing residential service as well.In 1924, the year before he died of pneumonia, Duke created the Duke Endowment, giving it $107 million in all (worth $1.5 billion now). Today it has grown to $3.4 billion, having spent nearly the same amount on its program areas since inception.Gene Cochrane, the endowment's president, says the endowment is unique for its specific focus on funding institutions.""Other philanthropists of his day tended to choose social causes to support,"" he told IBD. ""He chose organizations. It's a different way of doing philanthropy, and it's given us a great deal more focus than some other foundations have.""The Duke Endowment supports nonprofit hospitals in the Carolinas and institutions for orphan children. It also supports rural churches and retired ministers.""My old daddy always said that if he amounted to anything in life it was due to the Methodist circuit riders who frequently visited his home,"" Duke said, ""and whose preaching and counsel brought out the best that was in him.""The endowment supports Duke University, named in honor of the late Washington Duke at the time the endowment was created.

2,DUK,"ARLINGTON, Va. — Despite oil near $30 a barrel, the Navy is focused on cutting back fuel consumption to give itself a ""tactical and strategic edge"" and is on track to have more than 300 ships in service by the end of the decade, according to a top official.At the Surface Navy Association's National Symposium on Thursday, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said the Navy is on track to boost its fleet to over 300 ships by the end of the decade but still doesn't like comparisons between the fleet now vs. World War I, as technology and the need for ships are changing.""Yes we have fewer ships than we had in World War I, but we also have fewer telegraphs,"" Mabus said.Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) is the nation's largest military shipbuilder. Huntington Ingalls shares closed up 1.7% in the stock market today, after jumping over its 50-day line on Wednesday. The Coast Guard plans to acquire two new icebreakers from the defense contractor.Mabus also touted the use of solar and hybrid power in the armed forces and said that, since 2009, the Navy has reduced oil consumption by 15%, and the Marine Corps has cut oil consumption by 60%.""We have become way more efficient in the way we use it,"" he said. ""We don't have to refuel as much, which gives us a tactical and strategic edge.""Last week, Duke Energy (DUK) said it would build a 24-megawatt solar project for the Navy in Indiana. SunPower (SPWR) has already built a solar power system for the Navy in California.Duke shares rose 0.9%. SunPower shares closed up 0.4%.Meanwhile at sea, ships are using blends of marine diesel and bio-fuels to cut back on crude oil consumption. The Navy started a program for using drop-in biofuels in aircraft and ships in 2012, including hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) liquids, and it has awarded contracts with Emerald Biofuels, Fulcrum BioEnergy and Red Rock Biofuels to build biorefineries to produce greener fuel.Some commercial airlines are also proponents of alternative fuel sources. Last year, United Continental (UAL) invested in U.S.-based alternative fuels developer Fulcrum.Mabus said the Navy has contracts overseas with companies who get their source of oil from places that aren't in America's best interest. Instead, Mabus is focused on getting contracts for biofuels with companies in friendly countries and in the U.S.Iran, a major oil producer that will come back onto the world market as sanctions are expected to lift soon, seized two American patrol boats in the Persian Gulf earlier this week. The sailors were released, and Mabus said Thursday that the crew appeared to be in ""pretty good shape"" and that more will be known after the sailors are debriefed.Despite somewhat warmer relations between the U.S. and Iran, Tehran is still at odds with U.S. allies, including Saudi Arabia, the de facto head of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.Biofuels and alternative energy are still expensive, especially with oil near $30 a barrel. Still, later this month the Navy will launch the Great Green Fleet in San Diego to highlight the importance of alternative energy and reducing the reliance on fossil fuels.

43,DUK,"It's been a tough year so far for utility stocks.

44,DUK,"Utility stocks have maintained a leadership position in the market as investors have shunned growth stocks in favor of more defensive names. It's not exactly a new story, but it shows no signs of ending.Selling pressure has been muted in natural gas distributor AGL Resources (GAS) as the stock holds near highs. The price of natural gas has been in freefall for a few months now, but investors are gravitating toward yield, and AGL has it.Not only is the U.S. awash in oil, it's also producing a lot of natural gas. In January, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said that gas output from the Marcellus Shale formation could advance to 16.55 billion cubic feet a day in February, up 21% from a year ago.Earlier this week, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 4% to 51 cents a share. The dividend is payable on March 1 to shareholders of record as of Feb. 13. On an annualized basis, the new dividend is $2.04 a share, giving it a yield of around 3.6%.In December 2010, AGL announced plans to acquire Nicor for $2.4 billion. The deal closed about one year later, giving AGL a big presence in northern Illinois and making it one of the largest gas-only distributors in the U.S., with about 4.5 million customers.In November, AGL reported third-quarter profit of 22 cents a share, up 5% from a year ago but well below views. Sales rose 3% to $589 million.Q4 earnings, due later this month, are seen rising 24% to 84 cents a share.In September, Dominion Resources (D) entered into a joint venture with three other firms — Duke Energy (DUK), Piedmont Natural Gas (PNY) and AGL — to build a $4.5 billion-$5 billion natural gas pipeline serving North Carolina and Virginia.Another thing that AGL has going for it is rising mutual fund sponsorship. Fund ownership has increased for eight straight quarters, from 512 funds to 669.

102,DUK,"After re-emerging from bankruptcy in October 2012 as a smaller and leaner company, Dynegy is powering up again.The Houston-based independent power producer increased its capacity by around 50% in early December. That's when it acquired 4,000 additional megawatts of power through five coal-fired power plants in Illinois, bringing its total to more than 13,000 megawatts of power in six states.And it's looking to buy more. Still, what it owns today is a fraction of what it owned in its heyday, before Enron imploded in 2001 and caused credit to dry up and the industry to spiral downwards.Dynegy (DYN) logged nearly $1.5 billion in revenue in 2013, down from $42 billion in 2001.The company had previously owned power plants in about a dozen states and several foreign countries. It also ran gas-processing plants, pipelines, a utility and an energy-trading business.Dynegy stumbled from ""ill-timed strategic decisions and cratering power prices,"" Morningstar analyst Andrew Bischof said in a note.A Power ShiftIn 2011, the board hired Robert Flexon to lead restructuring efforts and then named him CEO. He previously worked as chief finance officer at utility operator UGI and NRG Energy (NRG), a much larger rival.Dynegy now provides wholesale power and capacity to utilities, cooperatives, municipalities and large industrial customers.The company owns nine coal plants in Illinois, including the five acquired in December from power company Ameren Corp. (AEE), which wanted out of the deregulated state of Illinois to focus more on its regulated businesses. But it was the kind of business Dynegy liked.""We felt we were in a position to operate them more effectively and efficiently since we have similar facilities also located in Illinois,"" said Katy Sullivan, a spokeswoman for Dynegy.Those acquired coal plants are broken out in financial reports as Illinois Power Holdings, or IPH.In California, Dynegy still has a natural-gas fired plant in Monterey County, Calif., and a small fuel-oil plant in Oakland. It recently retired an older natural gas-fired plant in Morro Bay, but is exploring renewable energy opportunities at the site. In the Northeast, it has three small natural gas fired plants — in upstate New York, Bangor, Me., and Reading, Pa.""Management has done a great job in fleet (plant) performance,"" Bischof said in a phone interview.In the first quarter, a key financial metric in Dynegy's industry, adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) jumped to $152 million from $43 million a year earlier. The gain was driven by improved spark spreads (a metric for estimating profitability) in the natural gas segment, higher energy prices for coal and the new IPH segment, with its five coal plants.Management kept adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2014 at $300-$350 million, even though executives have said they expect to exceed that forecast.Resources For RevenueThe company is currently in a ""sweet spot,"" Bischof said. Natural gas prices have risen to around $4, making cheaper coal ""more competitive."" Meanwhile, tougher environmental regulations have caused coal-plant closures. As coal capacity tightens, power prices rise.Dynegy gets paid for the electricity its plants generate and also for their capacity, or their ability to produce power when needed.Power companies are paid via regional transmission organizations that manage supply and demand. In Illinois, the company's dominant market, Dynegy is mostly paid by a system operator known as MISO.A year ago, the auction clearing price for capacity in the 2013-14 planning year was 3 cents per kilowatt per month, but this year in the annual MISO auction in mid-April the price spiked to 50 cents for the 2014-15 planning year. Planning years for MISO run June to May.The price jump ""serves as a signal that markets are tightening,"" Sullivan said. ""So we can enter into agreements with utilities or large industrial customers for higher prices.""Readying For Price HikesEven before the recent auction, in anticipation of higher prices, Dynegy had been entering into bilateral transactions as high as $2 to $2.50 per kilowatt per month for planning years from 2015 to 2019, she says.The transmission organization PJM Interconnection completed an auction last week that also resulted in sharply higher prices, increasing revenue potential for power companies in its covered region. Dynegy has a small portion of its assets under PJM's domain (one plant in northern Illinois and one near Reading, Pa.) but is interested in exporting some energy and capacity from MISO to PJM.Its IPH segment recently secured 240 megawatts of transmission into PJM, effective for the 2017/2018 planning year.Meanwhile, Dynegy is actively looking to gain more power via additional acquisitions. Since its hands are full managing plants in Illinois, they'll likely be in or near other areas where Dynegy operates.""There is a handful available or expected to be available over the next several months and we will evaluate those opportunities as they come to market,"" Sullivan said.In a note on May 8, UBS analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith said there's a ""50% deal probability"" with Duke Energy (DUK) and various co-owned Duke assets.Deal With Duke?Duke, the largest electric power holding company in the U.S., said in mid-February that it intended to exit its volatile Midwest commercial generation business, which includes ownership interest in 13 power plants. Eleven are in Ohio, one is in Illinois and one is in Pennsylvania.Dumoulin-Smith also sees potential candidates among many diversified utilities as they seek to reduce their exposure to commodity swings, as Ameren did with its Illinois coal plants.The five coal plants now in Dynegy's hands have necessary environmental controls, Sullivan says. But Dynegy is spending $250 million to finish a scrubber project at one to curb release of the pollutant sulfur dioxide, a regulated emission.The prior owner had already spent $250 million on the project, which is expected to be completed in 2019.""Regulations change and become stricter. To meet future compliance we have to make that investment,"" Sullivan said.Top executives were unavailable for comment. CEO Flexon said in a May 8 conference call that Dynegy is actively looking to make more acquisitions, but said he didn't expect a deal to close this year. The UBS analyst expects a deal to close in the first quarter of 2015, whether with Duke or another party.

119,DUK,"Investors in income stocks typically hold for the long term. They're less interested in the daily or weekly ups and downs of a stock than whether it can deliver modest, but dependable, dividend increases year after year.So whether a stock is setting up in a base or not is of less interest that it would be to a growth investor hoping to catch the next rally.But on the theory it's good to get off to a good start with a stock, there are numerous stocks breaking out that are on IBD's dividend leaders list that are setting up in bases.Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG) is in the late stages of forming a cup base. It's New Jersey's largest provider of electric and gas service with 2.2 million electric and 1.8 million gas customers.It also owns a feet of power plants with more than 13,000 megawatts of generating capacity in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions.The company pays a regular quarterly dividend of 39 cents a share, which works out to an annualized yield of 3.7%. Earnings have not grown much in the past few years. The five-year annualized growth rate is a negative 2%.Duke Energy (DUK) serves 7.3 million customers in the Southeast and Midwest. It announced Thursday it's selling its international business, which consists of generating capacity in South and Central America.The stock has made a strong upward move the past two weeks and might be forming the right side of a base. The stock pays an 82.5-cent quarterly dividend, which works out to a 4.2% annualized yield.Another utility, Great Plains Energy (GXP) might be forming the right side of a base. It pays a 26.25-cent dividend, which equates to a 3.6% dividend yield.

120,DUK,"General Electric (GE) caught some investors by surprise with its announcement that the ""GE of the future"" will include renewable energy, in addition to power and aviation.XThe decision was a reversal from November 2017, when reports arose that a post-restructuring GE would focus on power, aviation and health — its three biggest industrial segments in terms of revenue and profit.Morningstar equity analyst Joshua Aguilar considers the decision last month to keep renewable energy instead of health to be ""a bit of a pivot,"" but one that actually makes sense.He noted renewables are poised to compete with fossil fuels subsidy-free from a levelized cost of electricity standpoint, and have a lower environmental impact to boot.""When wind is cheaper (unsubsidized) and better for the environment, it's a bit of no-brainer,"" he said. ""Renewables are becoming really attractive.""Aviation, power and renewables also share the underlying turbine technology, creating business synergies.Shares rose 1.6% to 14.17 in today's stock market action, retaking their 50-day average.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Top rival wind-turbine producers include Denmark's Vestas and Siemens (SIEGY) Gamesa.According to GE, its renewable energy segment is seeing ""strong revenue and orders growth from repowering projects, new product introductions and digital capability.""In 2017, the unit generated $10.3 billion in revenue and turned a $0.7 billion profit. Orders grew 1% to $10 billion, while backlog increased 15% to $15 billion.Duke Energy (DUK), the largest U.S. electric utility, has expanded into renewables with investments of almost $6 billion in 60 solar installations and 20 wind farms.Many of those projects harness GE's technology.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:If General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?How GE Could Become The Apple Of The Industrial InternetDow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisSiemens, Alibaba Team Up On Industrial Internet Of Things For China

SPY fell to its 200-day moving average.On the Dow, Nike and Boeing held slim gains after rising 3% each intraday. They were the only two advancers. Athletic shoe giant Nike reported quarterly results late Thursday that topped views and offered a bullish outlook. But DowDuPont (DWDP), 3M (MMM) and Pfizer (PFE) lost more than 3% apiece.Big-cap techs showed continued weakness: Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) each fell 2% or more. Apple extended its slide for a sixth straight session and is now 10% off its high.Banks, semiconductor ad technology led the downside among sector funds. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) tumbled 3% to take out its 50-day moving average. Dow component Intel fell 2.7%, while graphics chip designer Nvidia (NVDA) slid nearly 4% and rolled back below its 50-day line for the second time this week. Micron Technology (MU), which reported earnings late Thursday, was down nearly 8%.Investors flocked to a safe haven Thursday as technology and most other sectors got routed amid heightened trade war fears.Most equity ETFs saw losses. But Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) held on for a 0.4% gain and even managed to close above its 50-day moving average. The defensive ETF has been testing that support line the past week. When the market is in confirmed uptrend, a rebound off the 50-day can set up a potential buy opportunity. But when the uptrend is under pressure, all buys are at greater risk than usual.Also note that since late January, the 50-day line has been below the 200-day line. That's a bearish sign. However, the big tech sell-off begs the question: Is sector rotation occurring? Utilities and other defensive sectors tend to outperform when high-growth areas like tech underperform.XLU may also be shaping the bottom of a base as it continues to consolidate near the 50-day. The ETF is currently 13% off its 52-week high.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Duke Energy (DUK) rose 1.1%, Sempra Energy (SRE) 0.7%, Edison International (EIX) 1.8% and Southern Co. (SO) 0.6%.An alert issued by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI Thursday laid out in more detail what the Russians have been targeting, and how they are going about it.""Since at least March 2016, Russian government cyber actors ... targeted government entities and multiple U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy, nuclear, commercial facilities, water, aviation, and critical manufacturing sectors,"" the alert said.The techniques being employed include sending spear-phishing emails from compromised legitimate accounts, host-based exploitation and the targeting of industrial control system infrastructure.Russian operatives are also using the hacks for credentials gathering and open-source and network reconnaissance.While the alert did not disclose how successful the attacks were, it said hackers ""targeted small commercial facilities' networks where they staged malware, conducted spear phishing, and gained remote access into energy sector networks."" They also tried to hide their activities by creating new accounts on the staging targets to perform cleanup operations.While information theft was one of the goals, a key prize would have been gaining control of systems used by infrastructure. They could then launch attacks that could leave millions without water and power.An even more worrying prospect would be hackers gaining control of a nuclear power plant. A sudden shutdown can trigger safety systems designed to disperse excess heat and prevent a meltdown, though safety systems themselves may be vulnerable to attack. However, the operating systems used at such plants are usually decades-old legacy controls that cannot be exploited by hackers.The Department of Homeland Security previously said cyberattacks on critical infrastructure are ""one of the most serious national security challenges we must confront.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:As Trump Sanctions Putin's Russia, Will Dems Revert To Their Fallback Position — Appeasement?

134,DUK,"Two midcap growth funds are among those in buy range after breaking out Wednesday to new 52-week highs.The two ETFs were little changed Thursday as the major stock index ETFs were narrowly mixed just before noon. PowerShares QQQ (QQQ) was up a fraction at 144.09, while SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) was down less than 1% and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) was off 0.2%. Commodity gold and utility ETFs were leading sectors higher, while building materials and industrials lagged.XSPDR Gold Shares (GLD) was testing resistance at its 50-day moving average,  which it hasn't been above since June 12.Of the two midcap growth funds in buy range, iShares S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth (IJK) cleared a 200.33 buy point of a flat base. It also remains in striking distance at about 2% above a recent bounce off the 50-day moving average. The ETF advanced nearly 3% from a prior flat-base breakout in May to the start of the most recent pattern.IJK offers market-cap weighted exposure to midsize companies in the S&P MidCap 400 Index. Top sectors as of July 17 were technology, 20%, industrials 19%, consumer cyclical 15% and financial services 13%, according to Morningstar Inc.Packaging Corp. of America (PKG), Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Duke Realty (DUK) were among the top portfolio holdings. Of the three, Domino's leads with a 33% rally this year, followed by Packaging Corp.'s 31% return. Duke Realty is up 8%.The fund, which will mark its 17th anniversary on Monday, has returned nearly 11% this year, in line with the S&P 500. It's outperformed the benchmark index for the past three, 10 and 15 years. IJK carries a 0.25% expense ratio.First Trust Dorsey Wright Focus 5 (FV) climbed past a 25.59 flat-base buy point intraday Wednesday before closing pennies shy of the entry. Like the Nasdaq composite, the ETF extended its win streak to nine trading days.FV is up 3% from a recent pullback to the 50-day line. The fund has also advanced 3% from its prior flat-base breakout. A previous breakout in December produced a 5% gain.The $2.5 billion fund selects five ETFs from a universe of First Trust sector and industry ETFs, based on relative price momentum. The components are equally weighted. The relative strength analysis is performed twice a month.The five ETFs as of July 18 included First Trust Dow Jones Internet (FDN), First Trust Nasdaq-100 Tech Sector (QTEC) and First Trust Nasdaq Bank (FTXO).The fund's 10% YTD return slightly lags the S&P 500. Its three-year average annual return of 9.5% is roughly in line with the benchmark index's performance. FV's expense ratio is 0.89%.Wednesday's ETF picks, which featured Apple (AAPL) as their top holding, added to their gains but remain in a buy zone. SPDR S&P 500 Growth (SPYG) is 1% above a 120.97 flat-base buy point; PowerShares DWA Momentum (PDP) is also 1% above a 57.65 flat-base entry.RELATED:Don't Miss 2 Top Growth Plays As Apple Goes For 9th Straight Win2 Tech-Heavy Funds Beating The Market Are Near Buy Point3 ETFs To Seize Momentum Among Cyclical Stocks In New Trump Era

138,DUK,"The top large-cap, small-cap and midcap ETFs of 2016 focus on dividend payers, giving them a value skew that paid off big in a year when investors grew wary of expensive names amid tepid earnings growth.Here is a look at the winning trio:Click Here To See The Best And Worst ETFs Of 2016Oppenheimer Ultra Dividend Revenue (RDIV), the top-performing large-cap ETF of 2016, selects the 60 highest-yielding stocks from the S&P 500 and S&P 400. It then ranks or weights them by top-line revenue rather than the traditional market capitalization.Revenue weighting offers diversified exposure to the market unlike some smart-beta or alternatively weighted strategies, according to Oppenheimer. And it is less likely to be full of trendy, overpriced stocks than a traditional, market-cap-weighted strategy, the firm's analysts say.Additionally, revenue, unlike earnings, is less susceptible to manipulation and, unlike dividends, is less vulnerable to shifts in management decisions, in Oppenheimer's view.The fund rebalances on a quarterly basis.In 2016, RDIV jumped 28.3% vs. a 12.0% gain for large-cap peer SPDR S&P 500 (SPY).Assets under management: $337.2 millionInception date: Sept. 30, 2013Expense ratio: 0.39%Yield: 3.27%Number of holdings: 60Assets in top 10 holdings: 49.72%Top holdings: Phillip Morris (PM), Verizon (VZ), Duke Energy (DUK)ProShares Russell 2000 Dividend Growers (SMDV), the top-performing small-cap ETF of 2016, invests in Russell 2000 companies that have grown dividends for at least 10 consecutive years.That's a tough bar for most small companies, and gives the ETF an extremely concentrated portfolio.Companies that grow dividends have historically outperformed those that do not, according to ProShares. Additionally, the typically strong fundamentals and stable earnings of dividend growers help them to deliver strong returns with lower volatility.The fund employs a 30% cap on any individual sector weighting to reduce risk, and rebalances four times a year. Stocks are equal weighted.In 2016, SMDV vaulted 35.7% vs. a 21.6% gain for iShares Russell 2000 (IWM).AUM: $349.2 millionInception date: Feb. 3, 2015Expense ratio: 0.40%Yield: 1.40%Number of holdings: 60Assets in top 10 holdings: 19.49%Holdings include: GATX Corp (GATX), Cass Information Systems (CASS), York Water Co.

139,DUK,"Stocks fell broadly after the Federal Reserve confirmed a widely anticipated decision to boost interest rates by a quarter point, its second over the past year. The major indexes rallied, then sank hard after the announcement, yet action remained volatile.The fed funds rate, now at a target range of 0.5%-0.75%, is still well below the 5.25% level seen exactly six years ago.The Fed noted in a release that the labor market ""has continued to strengthen"" and economic activity expanded ""at a moderate pace since mid-year,"" but the U.S. central bank also wrote that inflation, while rising, ""is still below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective.""Meanwhile, IBD reported that the Fed may be on pace to increase interest rates an additional three times in 2017.""This time last year the Fed turned out to be wildly off mark in what they were predicting,"" Luke Bartholomew, an investment manager at $405 billion Aberdeen Asset Management, told IBD. ""But this year there are reasons for thinking the Fed's guidance is more realistic. The economy is in a more advanced stage of recovery and market pricing reflects this. We can expect rates to slowly climb through next year and beyond.""The Nasdaq composite, fresh from Tuesday's 0.9% rally, fell 0.5% in the stock market today. The Nasdaq-100, a big winner on Tuesday as it rallied 1.3%, retreated from a mild gain to lose 0.3%.The S&P 500 slid 0.8% and the Dow Jones industrials 0.6%. The NYSE composite lost 1.2% as gold mining, oil field services, ship transport and utility stocks got hammered following the raise in the cost of money. Duke Energy (DUK) fell 2.3% and Consolidated Edison (ED) dropped 2.8%. The latter is trying to find buying support at the 50-day moving average.Verizon (VZ), which also borrows much debt to finance its investments in new infrastructure, dropped 1.4% to 51.63. It's in the middle of a new base-building phase after a January breakout past a 47.33 buy point led to a gain of as much as 20%.Small-cap stocks got beaten up the most following the Fed news. The Russell 2000 fell nearly 1% to hit session lows. Volume was still lower at 2:30 p.m. ET compared with the same time Tuesday, but expected to rise by day's end following the Fed move.Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) looked poised to triple in price from its breakout while Tesla Motors (TSLA) advanced further after reclaiming its 50-day moving average, closing above the midterm support line for the first time since late August.Nvidia barreled as much as 6% higher to 97.11, posting an all-time high, before finishing the session at 96.45. Tesla shares edged 0.3% higher to 198.69.Apple (AAPL) also showed resilience following a string of gains lately; shares added nearly 0.5% to 115.75, up 4.8% past an old 110.33 buy point, before fading to a breakeven close at 115.19. The megacap tech, with a market value of $614 billion, is forming a new base now that would qualify as a base-on-base pattern, given that the Sept. 14 breakout past 110.33 did not achieve a minimum 20% advance.Nvidia broke out of an 11-week cup with handle at 33.16 in mid-March. The initial volume was below average, but then ran 40% above its 50-day average turnover on March 18 as shares jumped 3% to 33.81. At that point, the stock was still in buying range.Since then, the emerging leader in chip technology for video graphics, self-driving cars and machine learning has shown incredible strength throughout a choppy 2016, pulling back to actually touch its 50-day moving average only twice during the run and falling near the 50-day line a couple of other times.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia, which is expanding its presence in increasingly hot tech and consumer markets, was one of several chip stocks moving on analyst actions Wednesday.At the breakout, Nvidia's profit increases were actually on the mild side, yet as a big-cap name the growth was acceptable. Earnings per share rose 34%, 14%, 13% and 18% in the four quarters through the fiscal third quarter ended in October 2015. Sales had risen 9%, 4%, 5% and 6% vs. year-ago levels over the same time frame.However, this year has witnessed growth acceleration.The Santa Clara, Calif., firm's earnings jumped 21% in the quarter ended in January, just ahead of that breakout, as revenue climbed 12%, the biggest increase in five quarters.Since then, earnings per share have grown even faster, picking up 39%, 56% and 104% in the quarters ended April, July and October, as revenue sped up 13%, 24% and 54%. These numbers underline Nvidia's 99 Composite Rating and 96 EPS Rating, according to IBD Stock Checkup.In the fiscal third quarter ended in October, net margin leapt nearly 800 basis points, from 19.5% in the year-ago period to 28.4%, a multiyear record.Nvidia pays a cash dividend of 14 cents a share, equal to an annualized yield of 0.6%.Rob Lutts, CIO of Cabot Wealth Management, notes that ""Nvidia has unlocked the key to ultra-fast computing"" and that the company's largest target markets are transportation, internet, deep learning and video games. Lutts also told IBD that he compares investing in Nvidia shares to ""buying shares of Intel in 1982.""Apple, meanwhile, qualifies as a dividend play with a 2% yield. However, with Apple Watch sales said to be strong according to CEO Tim Cook, outstanding double-digit growth in its services revenue, and the small possibility that Apple will post an EPS increase in the December quarter, it's hard not to view the company as a future large-cap growth play as well.Wall Street sees fiscal 2017 profit rising 8% to $9.01 a share and FY 2018 profit up 12% to $10.05 a share.Apple is creeping closer to a potential 118.79 buy point of a base-on-base pattern.Tesla has long been suffering in a slump, but the correction may eventually set up a new base that puts the stock in a position to break out to 52-week highs. The decline after a failed breakout in July 2015 shows classic action in which investors are getting both shaken out and worn out of the stock. But it could be months before a proper buy area emerges.The electric car and SUV leader still shows sign of heavy institutional selling pressure due to its weak 22 RS Rating (out of a maximum 99) and 0.8 up/down volume ratio, also seen in IBD Stock Checkup. But the Accumulation/Distribution Rating of C- is just a notch below the neutral C reading.A potential buy point for now may be at 236.73, 10 cents above the Aug. 1 high within a multimonth consolidation.RELATED:The Bottoming Base Pattern, Part I: Why It Helps Investors Make MoneyThe Bottoming Base Pattern, Part II: How Apple Formed One In 2009The Case for A Trump Era New Secular Bull MarketWhich Techs Beside Apple May Be Preparing To Break Out?

Right now, the chart action of utility funds is signaling the need for some immediate attention too.""Defensive sectors like utilities and telecom did pretty well earlier this year, but of late, investors have been warming up to higher growth sectors, technology in particular,"" said Neena Mishra, director of ETF research for Zacks Investment Research. She thinks stretched valuations in defensive sectors may be driving investors toward others that don't look too pricey too.Utility Select Sector SPDR (XLU) lost hundreds of millions in net outflow in each month of the third quarter, though it has grown assets this year to $7.31 billion.This bellwether exchange traded fund offers exposure to 28 electric and gas utilities as well as diversified power companies in the S&P 500. Its top holdings include NextEra Energy (NEE), Duke Energy (DUK) and Southern Co. (SO). It yields 3.27%.XLU vaulted 15.5% in the first quarter amid investors' quest for safety and income. By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad U.S. market, trudged up 1.4% in the same period.Now this utility ETF sits 10% below the early July high of 53.02 after losing support at key levels of short-term and long-term support over the past six trading sessions. Treasury yields jumped Tuesday on growing expectations of a Federal Reserve rate hike later this year. That makes dividend-paying utilities relatively less attractive.Ari Wald, a senior technical analyst at Oppenheimer & Co., believes utilities could continue to be at risk. If the S&P continues its long-term advance, more cyclical sectors are likely to be rewarded.His firm downgraded the utility sector to underweight in August.IBD'S TAKE: Gold and rate-sensitive equity sectors have come under pressure as the outlook for the next Federal Reserve rate hike remains murky.Despite XLU's recent woes, or perhaps because of it, Wald thinks it has become tactically attractive. He finds the ETF is increasingly oversold and due for a bounce.""A rally back above the ETF's 200-day moving average at $48.50 would be an encouraging start,"" Wald told IBD on Monday. On the stock market today, XLU fell a further 2.1% to 47.29 -- its lowest level since April.Sector rotations are the hallmark of a healthy bull market, Wald added, because ""no sector becomes so extended to the upside or the downside to derail the market's broader advance.""Mishra sees another reason that utilities could be in favor again. She expects more volatility in the coming weeks as the presidential election approaches and the earnings season picks up pace. With the markets pricing in a Clinton victory, a tighter race and potential Trump win could trigger a broad market sell-off.""In such a scenario, I wouldn't be surprised to see some money moving back into defensive sectors until there is better visibility for the market,"" Mishra said.But she's not expecting a utilities rally like the one earlier this year, and she's bearish on the sector in the longer term.The Fed's latest signals have upped the odds of a hike in interest rates in December, she pointed out. Yield-bearing equity sectors, such as utilities and REITs, sell off when rates are rising.RELATED:Gold ETF Tumbles To Its Lowest Level Since Brexit Vote

Now additional applications in infrastructure, health, marketing, restaurants and entertainment are on the horizon.Utility giant Duke Energy (DUK) last year also conducted tests of AeroVironment's drones to see how they might be used for plant upkeep. And AeroVironment, in an earnings call in June, said it was ""under contract"" with a large U.S. railroad company.Drones could also be used to create Wi-Fi hot spots, and AeroVironment has developed technology that enables encrypted communication, said Steve Gitlin, the company's vice president of marketing strategy, communications and investor relations. The data that drones collect also could make marketing more sophisticated, he told IBD.While Amazon's (AMZN) efforts to develop drones for package delivery are well known by now, restaurants and health care providers see the technology's potential as well.A Domino's Pizza (DPZ) international franchisee recently used a drone to show how pizza could be delivered via the aerial devices. Drones also could eventually be used to deliver medicine and medical supplies, such as defibrillators, to areas that are difficult to access. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) burritos, delivered by drones from Alphabet (GOOGL)? That's actually happening.Farming has been one of the biggest markets for drones, and now companies that provide agricultural services are seeing new opportunities outside farms.GreenSight Agronomics uses drones to gather data on the agricultural health of upper-end properties. CEO James Peverill hopes the company's technology will enable owners of golf courses and similar acreage to more precisely target pesticides vs. more scorched-earth spraying tactics.""These are chemicals that are being applied in kind of a broad sense,"" he said in an interview, ""when in many cases the real problem is fairly localized.""Less utilitarian applications have been suggested as well.

144,DUK,"There's a way to eat spaghetti with less mess and it involves a spoon, or if you're from the old country, an artful twirl with the fork. Choosing the right ETF for your portfolio is a similarly underappreciated art.That's more true now than ever. Out of 1,923 exchange traded products listed on U.S. exchanges on the stock market today, roughly 160 have launched in 2016 so far.Some new funds are truly helpful, thoughtfully executed ideas — such as the international counterpart to Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG). Other newfangled products betray a wild-eyed grab for attention and profits, offering up yet another novel asset class that investors never asked for and probably will never need.The mushrooming number of products has consequences for the investing public, says Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research for Morningstar.""The asset-management industry has blasted its spaghetti cannon, with investors playing the role of the wall,"" he wrote over the summer. Extending the metaphor further, Johnson noted that ""many investors have displayed a nonstick coating,"" batting away the likes of Sprott Buzz Social Media Insights (BUZ) and Global X Millennials Thematic (MILN). But, he cautioned, ""that won't keep the industry from firing volley after volley, trying to get something to stick.""Investors in ETFs are looking for ways to sift through the bewildering array of choices. So IBD reached out to the big-money pros for whom investing in funds is the cornerstone of daily business. We asked them how they go about choosing an ETF for client portfolios, both what they look for and what they look to avoid.Click Here To See A List Of Top Performing ETFs In 2016 Their ideas may help you become successful investors too. How a fund performs is important, of course, but evaluating funds for performance can be nuanced in the ETF context, as a money manager we interviewed said.Astor's Bryan Novak recommends scrutinizing both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of an ETF to make sure it matches your investment objective. Bill Roach of Globalt outlines his routine for filtering the masses of ETF choices down to a more manageable list.Todd Rosenbluth, the funds guru at S&P Global, highlights an often-overlooked, but critical, aspect of ETF selection.Here's what they have to say:Bryan Novak is senior managing director at Astor Investment Management, a $1.8 billion registered investment advisor that provides investment solutions using proprietary macroeconomic analysis. Astor has been utilizing ETFs for almost two decades to manage client portfolios across multiple asset classes. The firm's investing philosophy centers on the belief that economic fundamentals matter and its objective is to protect client assets from wealth-destroying events by providing the right allocation strategy.The proliferation of exchange traded funds has made these investment vehicles the ultimate asset-allocation tool, for individual investors and institutions alike. ETFs offer the ability to achieve exposure with one click to a variety of asset classes and risk exposures — broad U.S. equity, specific industrial sectors, large and small caps, international, fixed income, and much more.

145,DUK,"ETFs offer several advantages: They trade throughout the day like stocks and offer relative tax efficiency vs. the mutual fund. These advantages make the decision to use ETFs fairly easy. The question then becomes which ones to select for your portfolio. This part of the process takes some thought.Following the example of institutional investors, retail investors can become more educated and empowered when choosing ETFs to achieve a first-class portfolio to pursue their goals.Over time, we've watched the ETF space expand, making many more choices and varieties of these investment vehicles available. While having more choice is good, it also necessitates having a due diligence process to find the right ETFs to efficiently address portfolio objectives. For retail investors, doing a few key assessments can help turn their portfolios from average to top notch.The first consideration is asset allocation or exposure. This process determines where investors want or need exposure, based on their time horizon and risk tolerance. How much equity vs. fixed income? Are they selling some stock holdings for tax purposes, but want to maintain market exposure? Once those questions are answered, the next step is selecting the right ETFs to do the job.At Astor, we break this process up into two segments — qualitative and quantitative. In the qualitative part of the process, we examine the characteristics of the ETFs to make sure they match our investment objective. A few questions to ask are:These questions may require some digging, but are worth looking into.The next round of due diligence focuses on the quantitative, or number crunching. Many of the answers to these questions can be found in the ETF prospectus or on common investment-research sites such as Morningstar.By answering these questions, investors can make ""score cards"" as they analyze exchange traded funds. This will enable them to screen ETFs like the pros do and maximize the effectiveness of their portfolio.Bill Roach is president of Globalt Investments, a $1.8 billion registered investment advisor that integrates quantitative, fundamental and technical analysis to construct portfolios. The firm's flagship innovatETF strategies, which launched in early 2003, seek to reduce the impact of market volatility and minimize downside risk:At Globalt, we've been building portfolios of exchange traded funds since 2002, so we have seen the ETF space grow both in terms of assets and the number of funds. Contrary to some, we believe that ETFs are very much still in their early innings and that there is still more innovation to come as the industry matures and the marketplace better understands these products. That being said, not all innovations will be right for us or for our clients.Before we arrive at the portfolio construction phase, there are several steps we take as a team, all stemming from our conviction that asset allocation is the key to long-term performance and best addresses the fiduciary responsibility for managing client assets. Our disciplined investment process identifies outperforming asset classes and only then do we begin the process of investing in ETFs, rather than trying to select the best-performing active manager or funds.Looking at the ETF industry as a whole, it can at first seem like there is an overwhelming amount of choice. However, since we have a very clear understanding of what we're looking to accomplish with each exposure, we are able to dramatically shrink the universe of funds from the approximately 1,900 currently on the market to a much smaller number.We constantly monitor the asset allocation and ETF selection in each of our portfolios. Each ETF holding is an expression of our preference for the asset class, sub-asset class and our specific view regarding what is attractive in that space, driven by our quantitative model and our analysis of qualitative considerations. When our view changes and we wish to change how we express that view through ETF selection, we screen for the available options in that space.We focus on passive funds, meaning a fund must be a rules-based approach with no manager discretion, and eliminate those that do not meet our cost, size and liquidity requirements.For example, many funds being brought to market in recent months seek to ""slice and dice"" different sectors into highly niche sub-sector exposures, introducing concentrations that do not fit with our approach. Hundreds of other ETFs are thinly traded and may only have a few million dollars in assets, which allows us to remove them from consideration given the importance we place on liquidity and tight trading spreads.Once we've taken these initial steps, we then analyze the remaining funds in terms of their rules-based methodology, looking at factors like stock selection, portfolio construction and rebalancing process. From there, we look at the actual resulting portfolio holdings over time, focusing on things like individual position size, sector weights and other portfolio factor characteristics, as well as the performance of a specific fund vs. the benchmark against which we intend to use it.Performance is just one of the things we look at. We do not look at it in the same way that we would evaluate an active manager, where we would be looking for persistent alpha. We are looking to understand if, and under what circumstances, it outperforms or underperforms. For instance, if we take a position in an ETF to hedge exposure to equities, we would not want an ETF that does not behave consistently with its benchmark during equity bear markets. Additionally, an ETF with excessive tracking error would not be considered as it would not consistently provide the desired exposure.In particular, we seek to understand rolling returns, drawdowns and other historical data. As long-term investors, it is important for us to be able to understand how an ETF may respond to a variety of different market scenarios, an understanding that is difficult to achieve with many newer products. Once we've done all that, we select the fund that we believe will be the best fit for expressing our investment view.Todd Rosenbluth is director of ETF and mutual fund research for S&P Global Market Intelligence, a leading provider of financial and industry data, research, news and analytics to investment professionals, government agencies, corporations and universities worldwide. The New York City firm specializes in holdings-based ETF research. ""Past performance is not indicative of future results"" is a phrase long disclosed by asset managers to clients. Investors again have been reminded of this in 2016, with many utilities and consumer-staples ETFs ranking as top U.S. equity performers year to date through July, only to decline in value in August amid concerns that bond yields could move higher as the Federal Reserve contemplates raising rates. S&P Global thinks many investors tend to look for the largest, cheapest or best-performing ETFs without focusing on what holdings are inside. Investors need to understand the holdings inside their exchange traded fund as well as the cost structure, since these factors will be drivers of performance moving forward.As is done with a potential individual stock investment, valuation and risk assessments should be undertaken using an ETF's holdings to ensure that the securities inside are appealing in the current environment. While our research incorporates the full holdings, with many investors focusing on market-cap-weighted ETFs, a review of the top 10 positions can give great insight.For example, 60% of the assets for Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) are spread across its top 10 holdings. According to S&P Global Market Intelligence's qualitative research, five of these 10 are overvalued, including Duke Energy (DUK) and Southern Company (SO), compared to just two that are undervalued; the other three are fairly valued. Meanwhile, six have below-average earnings and dividend records, which is a key risk consideration.Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP) is similarly concentrated in its top 10 holdings, but our research is more favorable on this ETF. Six of these stocks are undervalued to us, including Procter & Gamble (PG) and Wal-Mart (WMT), with just one of its major holdings considered overvalued. In addition, none of the top 10 constituents has a below-average earnings and dividend record.We think XLP is a better investment given prevailing market conditions.Investors also should consider the costs they will incur buying and selling these ETFs. Both XLU and XLP cost 14 basis points annually to hold (or $14 in annual fees for every $10,000 invested). While this is relatively cheap compared to active mutual fund alternatives, this is higher than comparable market-cap weighted ETFs from Vanguard and Fidelity.However, the bid-ask spread, which is the difference between the price to buy and to sell the ETF, for both XLU and XLP is just $0.01. This is much narrower than its peer offerings, offsetting the higher holding costs.While trading costs will matter less for longer-term investors, these sector equity ETFs incur significant volume and as such the costs will matter more to more tactical investors.As the ETF universe continues to expand with similar-sounding smart-beta products focused on single or multiple factors, such as low volatility and quality, investors should look inside the funds because the sector exposures will be different, impacting performance.RELATED:3 ETF Pros On Profiting With Funds And Managing RisksThe Best Places To Invest Among Tough Global MarketsUsing ETF Options To Harvest Income And Manage Risk

148,DUK,"Shares of U.S. utility stocks such as Consolidated Edison (ED), Dominion (D), Duke Energy (DUK) and others are climbing as investors seek safe havens in the wake of Britain's decision last week to pull out of the European Union.Utilities were already strong as their steady dividend payments were attractive, with interest rates remaining low. The Dow Jones Utility Average had climbed 18% from the start of the year to Thursday's close, just before the results of the Brexit referendum started to come in.And while they are heavily regulated, they are also classic defensive stocks with steady, domestic demand that changes little during economic swings.Dow utilities surged 1.6% to a new intraday high Monday.Consolidated Edison, a New York-based utility with $12.1 billion in annual sales, provides electricity and natural gas to 3.4 million customers in three states. It has an 83 IBD Composite Rating, meaning its stock has outperformed 83% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth in recent quarters.Shares rose 1.7% in the stock market today, entering profit-taking territory after breaking out of a base in January.Dominion, based in Richmond, Va., provides utility services to 5 million customers in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Midwest.It's been forming a flat base with a 75.60 buy point for about two months. Its stock has closed higher in 10 of the last 12 trading sessions and rose 1.05% to 74.95 on Monday.Duke Energy, the largest company in IBD's Utility-Diversified group by sales, rose above an elongated 10.5-month cup-with-handle base with an 81.49 buy point on June 10, closing at 81.59. It's continued to rise Monday with a 1.9% gain.Among others in the group, PG&E (PCG), which has about $17 billion annual revenue and boasts an 82 IBD Composite Rating, edged up 0.8%. Dover, Del.-based Chesapeake Utilities (CPK), which has been consolidating for a little more than three months, climbed 2.6% after jumping 8.2% Friday.

151,DUK,"The stock market today showed resilience following big gains on Tuesday and Wednesday as the major indexes gave little back in early-afternoon trading Wednesday. Meanwhile, utility stocks rebounded fiercely, a good sign that U.S. interest rates aren't likely to rise swiftly amid the dull economic recovery.However, a few leading utility names, including Pinnacle West Capital (PNW), Duke Energy (DUK) and Consolidated Edison (ED), are showing some deep fissures in their latest rallies. Further sell-offs could raise the odds that some of these stocks threaten to do a round-trip of their year-to-date gains.The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 were roughly break-even, while the Dow Jones industrial average, a price-weighted index, eased 0.1%. Volume was running uniformly lower on both exchanges vs. the same time on Wednesday.The Dow utility average, which got smacked with a 0.4% decline on Wednesday as the Nasdaq and the 500 posted solid gains, rallied 0.9%. Yet the defensive index is still down more than 2% in the second quarter so far.While numerous top-rated electric and gas utilities tracked by IBD's Income Investor feature have shown mild pullbacks, others have undercut their 50-day moving averages and are failing to rebound quickly. Stocks that show healthy action tend to ride on the north side of this support line, not the south side.Pinnacle West Capital rallied more than 1% to 72.74, but volume was running more than 30% below its 50-day average. The stock, nevertheless, has done a good job of recouping much of its more than 5% losses during a May 17-18 sell-off. That decline sent the Phoenix-based power producer sharply below its 50-day line near 73; the 50-day line has been rising sharply since late January.On Feb. 1, Pinnacle West raced past a 67.12 flat-base buy point in heavy trading. That breakout ignited what has become a 13% gain in just two months -- a remarkable rally for a utility stock. Pinnacle boasts a three-year Earnings Stability Factor of 3 on a scale of zero (steady) to 99 (wild) from IBD.Duke Energy rallied 1% to 77.79, still below its 50-day moving average. The Charlotte, N.C., firm inked its second deal in 2016 to convert methane gas captured from swine waste into electricity. Consolidated Edison of New York gained 1% to 72.62 in very slow turnover. Trade has been choppy ever since the stock first undercut its 50-day line in heavy trading on April 20.Notice how on April 21, Edison tumbled another 3% as volume ballooned 90% higher than its 50-day average of 2 million shares. Elsewhere, online streaming giant Netflix (NFLX) continued to rebound, rising more than 2% to 102.60 in volume running more than 50% above its usual pace. Watch to see if the former huge market winner can cross back above the key 200-day moving average. Such action would be bullish for the large-cap name, which currently has a $44 billion market cap and 428 million shares outstanding.Netflix's revenue climbed 21%, 26% and 23% vs. year-ago levels from 2013 to 2015. IBD Stock Checkup shows that Netflix's Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B+ now indicates net accumulation of shares by mutual funds, banks, insurers and the like. Netflix was highlighted by IBD earlier this week after showing more signs it could finish a new base pattern.

154,DUK,"Five exchange traded funds in utilities stocks made new highs last week or are near new highs, as the sector emerges as a tempting alternative during the stock market's slump.With some of these ETFs in buy areas on their charts, investors have opportunities to invest in one of the few areas showing solid price action.Utility stocks weakened in April, as bond yields spiked. That was an unwelcome development for utilities because higher rates increase capital costs for an industry that constantly has to spend on plants and equipment. Also, higher bond yields can make utilities' dividends less attractive by comparison.But as Treasury yields started falling, utility ETFs reacted with gains in the past two weeks.The profit outlook for utilities is relatively favorable. The sector's combined profit is expected to drop 2% for the first quarter but rise about 4% for the full year, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. By both measures, earnings will be well above the S&P's total but below better-performing sectors such as consumer discretionary and health care.The sector's most popular ETF is Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU), which trades an average of more than 17 million shares a day. It has climbed back above its 50-day moving average and is near a new high. IShares U.S. Utilities (IDU) has traced a similar chart.Thinly traded PowerShares DWA Utilities Momentum (PUI) broke out of a flat base Wednesday and is in buy range from a 25.63 entry. The fund, which is diversified among various types of utility companies, is based on an index that emphasizes utility stocks showing relative strength, which helps explain its move to new highs.Some of DWA Utilities' top components hit new highs in the past week, including DTE Energy (DTE), WEC Energy (WEC) and American Water Works (AWK). Also, Westar Energy (WR) made a new closing high.Vanguard Utilities (VPU) touched a new high Thursday after finding support around the 50-day moving average. Investors can use that support to purchase shares. But ideally, investors would use the March breakout past a 102.68 buy point to buy the bulk of shares and use the pullback to add a smaller amount.Vanguard Utilities and Fidelity MSCI Utilities (FUTY) are both based on the same index: The MSCI U.S. Investable Market Utilities 25/50 Index.The index is more heavily weighted on Duke Energy (DUK), NextEra Energy (NEE) and Southern Co. (SO), with each representing 6% to 7% of the total fund. In fact, Utilities Select Sector SPDR and iShares U.S. Utilities (based on the Dow Jones U.S. Utilities Index) also have the same companies as top components. NextEra broke out Wednesday but is back below the 119.47 buy point.                   The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

156,DUK,"For a few exchange traded funds at crucial points on their charts, some major earnings announcements this week hold the potential for pivotal moves.Funds in health care, utilities, consumer and solar energy are poised to climb past ceilings. With major pieces of those ETFs releasing quarterly reports, significant moves could loom.To be sure, because ETFs are pools of stocks, the performance of a single component has a limited impact on the whole fund. Yet a blowout report or big disappointment can change the course of a sector ETF. For example, Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) gapped down 2% on April 22 -- the fund’s largest percentage move since March 1 -- after Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL), two of the fund’s top five holdings, slid on weak quarterly results.The Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) ETF finds itself in a critical spot as it tries to regain its footing after dropping below its 50-day moving average. Its success in rising from that key level rests partly on how three companies will fare with their latest reports.Duke Energy (DUK), the ETF’s second-largest holding at more than 8% of the whole fund, is reporting Q1 results Tuesday before the open. Analysts expect a profit of $1.14 a share as the Charlotte, N.C.-based utility continues an uneven profit performance.On Wednesday, Dominion Resources (D) releases its earnings at 10 a.m. ET. The consensus estimate is 94 cents a share. Exelon (EXC) comes out with results Friday at 11 a.m. ET, and Wall Street is expecting a profit of 68 cents a share. Dominion and Exelon account for 7% and 5.4% of the fund, respectively.A lot of the top companies in the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) ETF have already reported, but two big ones are on deck this week.Pfizer (PFE) reports Tuesday and Merck (MRK) on Thursday before the open. The drugmakers are the second- and third-largest components of the ETF, which is nearing a key level. Shares are approaching the December peak at 73.16. A move above that level would be bullish.Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR’s (XLY) second-largest component, Home Depot (HD), will announce May 17. Disney (DIS) releases its results after the close on May 10. Both heavyweights account for about 7% of the ETF and are among its top three holdings. The ETF is climbing toward new highs as it makes a steady advance.Guggenheim Solar’s (TAN) largest component, SolarCity (SCTY), releases first-quarter earnings after the market’s close May 9. The solar panel installer accounts for more than 7% of the ETF. The fund’s chart is testing resistance around 25, a level that it must conquer if it’s to continue a recovery from a deep decline.
"
157,DUK,"For more than a century, Dawson Singletary’s family has grown tobacco, peanuts and cotton on a 530-acre farm amid the coastal flatlands of North Carolina. Now he’s making money from a different crop: solar panels.Singletary has leased 34 acres of his Bladen County farm to Strata Solar for a 7-megawatt array, part of a growing wave of solar deals that are transforming U.S. farmland and boosting income for farmers.Farmland has become fertile territory for clean energy, as solar and wind developers in North America, Europe and Asia seek more flat, treeless expanses to build. That’s also been a boon for struggling U.S. family farms that must contend with foundering commodity prices.“There is not a single crop that we could have grown on that land that would generate the income that we get from the solar farm,” said Singletary, 65.The rise in solar comes as the value of crops in the Southeast -- with the exception of tobacco -- has dropped. Cotton prices have fallen 71% in the past five years. Soybeans are down 33% and peanuts have slipped 16%.Solar companies, meanwhile, are paying top dollar, offering annual rents of $300 to $700 an acre, according to the NC Sustainable Energy Association. That’s more than triple the average rent for crop and pasture land in the state, which ranges from $27 to $102 an acre, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.“Solar developers want to find the cheapest land near substations where they can connect,” said Brion Fitzpatrick, director of project development for Inman Solar of Atlanta. “That’s often farmland.”Developers have installed solar panels on about 7,000 acres of North Carolina pasture and cropland since 2013, adding almost a gigawatt of generating capacity, according to the NC Sustainable Energy Association. Georgia has added 200 megawatts on fields and cleared forests over the same period, much of it farmland, according to the Southface Energy Institute of Atlanta.The number of megawatts that developers can generate per acre of farmland varies, based on weather patterns, size of the panels and contours of the land. On Singletary’s farm, Strata Solar installed 21,600 panels, each 6 feet by 3 feet. Combined, they can power as many as 5,000 local homes.Farmers typically lease a portion of their land, signing 15- to 20-year contracts with developers who install the panels and sell the power to local utilities. In rare cases, farmers have leased their entire property to solar companies.Singletary signed a 15-year lease in 2013, with two 10-year extension options, and Chapel Hill, N.C.-based Strata sells the power to Duke Energy (DUK). He declined to disclose financial terms.Government incentives have played a key role in the spread of solar farms built on real farms. North Carolina granted developers tax credits equal to 35% of their projects’ costs though a program that expired at the end of 2015, helping make the state the third-biggest U.S. solar market. In Georgia, the Public Service Commission passed a bill in 2013 requiring the state’s largest utility, Southern Co.’s (SO) Georgia Power, to buy 525 megawatts of solar by 2016. Both policies sent companies scouring for open space to build.Solar panels have buoyed tax bases in impoverished rural counties, says Tim Echols, a member of the Georgia Public Service Commission. They also let farmers diversify their income with revenue that’s not subject to markets or unpredictable weather patterns.“Solar and wind farms have become a new stable income stream for farmers -- and they don’t fluctuate with commodity prices,” said Andy Olsen, who promotes clean energy projects in rural areas for the Chicago-based Environmental Law & Policy Center.Not everyone is happy to see solar panels or wind turbines becoming more common on farmland. In the U.K., lawmakers have pushed to limit large clean energy projects on farms, saying they blight the landscape and squeeze out local food production. Similar criticism has surfaced in the U.S., where local officials have pushed for zoning changes to restrict solar developments to industrial properties.“I get a lot of complaints from neighbors” said Tim Sheppard, who don’t like the looks of the 1-megawatt solar system that takes up 5 acres of his 135-acre cattle farm in Brasstown, N.C.Despite the recent flurry of building in North Carolina, solar panels cover less than 1/10th of 1% of all farmland in the state, says Maggie Clark, director of government affairs for the NC Sustainable Energy Association.Singletary, the Bladen County farmer, said the solar panels will let him retire without selling his family land: “It gives me a way to keep the farm. I’d like to pass it to my grandchildren someday.”RELATED:‘Bedrock’ Utility Market To Double U.S. Solar Installations In 2016 Farmland’s Record Values Fall As Crop Surpluses Grow

163,DUK,"Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) announced that its subsidiary — Duke Energy Renewables — has finalized the acquisition of the Shoreham Solar Commons project from Invenergy. Located in Brookhaven, NY, the facility is one of the largest solar projects in New York and has a capacity to generate 24.9 megawatts (MW) of solar power.With this buyout, Duke Energy’s renewables business has set foot in New York, thereby expanding its footprint across 14 states of America. The facility came online on Jul 1, in sync with the company’s expectation to commence the project by second-quarter 2018. Duke Energy is selling the power generated from this facility to the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) under a 20-year purchase power agreement (PPA).Benefits of the Project The Shoreham Solar Commons project is anticipated to generate annual tax revenues in the $0.7-$0.9 million range. Annually, the energy produced by this facility is expected to displace 29,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions and create nearly 1 million MW-hours (MWh) of clean energy over its lifetime.Moreover, the fact that this solar facility has been constructed on the grounds of a former golf course will eliminate the use of pesticides and fertilizers on the property. This, in turn, will protect Long Island's fresh water aquifer.Increasing Demand for Solar EnergyScientists are increasingly growing conscious about fossil fuel-fired energy generation and its consequences. According to them, greenhouse gases are causing global climate change and subsequent environmental hazards. As a result, renewable energies are increasingly gaining traction across the globe. A key area in the renewable space is solar energy.Now coming to the U.S. renewables industry, per the latest U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) report electricity generation from solar resources in the United States reached 77 million MWh in 2017. With this, solar energy surpassed annual generation from biomass resources for the first time, making it the third-most prevalent renewable electricity source in the nation, after hydro and wind. Going ahead, solar power generation is anticipated to increase 19.9% to 0.928 quadrillion Btu in 2018 and 18% to 1.095 quadrillion Btu in 2019. Such developments and projections surely reflect growth prospects for solar energy generation in the United States. This, in turn, should prompt companies like Duke Energy that are expanding their solar assets.What’s Ahead for Duke Energy?Realizing the expanding market for green energy, the company has invested more than $5 billion since 2007. Duke Energy intends to invest $11 billion to generate energy through renewables and natural gas as it moves to a low-carbon future. By retiring coal plants and adopting more natural gas and renewables, the company has already reduced its carbon emissions by nearly 30 % since 2005. In fact, the company has set a new goal to reduce its carbon emissions by 40% from the 2005 level by 2030. On completion of the Shoreham Solar Commons project’s acquisition, we believe that the company will move a step forward toward achieving this goal.As far as the solar market’s expansion in New York is concerned, one can conclude that the city is making a rapid progress in adopting solar energy as a desired option for its citizens’ electricity generation. In February 2018, New York’s governor announced that solar power therein increased more than 1,000% from December 2011 to December 2017, leveraging more than $2.8 billion in private investment into New York's growing clean energy economy. Notably, such huge investment came as part of the Governor's mandate that half of all electricity consumed by New Yorkers should come from renewable energy sources by 2030.Considering the fact, that the Governor is aiming to make New York as one of the national leaders in clean energy growth, there is an immense opportunity of solar power installation in New York. In this line, we expect Duke Energy to make more investments in the city’s solar facilities, in days ahead.Price MovementIn a year’s time, Duke Energy has lost 4.4% compared with the industry’s 0.9% decline. The underperformance may have been caused by the potential volatility in market prices of fuel, electricity and other renewable energy commodities that the company is facing.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderDuke Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the same industry are NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG  -  Free Report), Ameren Corporation (AEE  -  Free Report) and Avangrid, Inc. (AGR  -  Free Report).

164,DUK,"PG&E Corporation’s (PCG  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), sought approval from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) for four energy storage projects. The projects will have a combined capacity of 567 megawatts (MW).If approved, the first one of this storage is expected to come online by end of 2019 and the rest will be operational by 2020.Importance of Battery StorageThe trend of storing energy is gradually finding recognition. Energy storage helps to increase the resilience of the grid and enable companies to cater to higher demand during lower production of electricity. Excess energy produced from renewable sources are generally stored in the battery and are used during high demand, which lessens the production of electricity from fossil fuel.  Unlike the fossil fuel, alternate energy sources are dependent on weather conditions that make storage of energy essential. Battery storage lowers emission as it cuts dependence on fossil fuel-based production.Increasing Usage of Battery Storage in Utility SpacePer the release by U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), at the end of 2017, 708 MW of power capacity which represents 867 MWh of energy capacity of large-scale, battery storage capacity was in utilization. The number of large-scale batteries, based on lithium-ion chemistries, is 80%. PG&E’s three third-party owned projects are also lithium-ion battery projects.Utilities are shifting to renewables through the replacement of coal by natural gas and clean energy, realizing the need of emission less environment. Large utilities like NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report), Duke Energy (DUK  -  Free Report) and National Grid plc (NGG  -  Free Report) investing in battery storage projects. We expect more battery storage units to be installed across the United States, considering higher production of electricity from renewable sources.Zacks Rank & Price MovementPG&E carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

165,DUK,"Duke Energy Corp. (DUK  -  Free Report) will pass on an amount of $142 million in annual tax savings to the electric bills of its Indiana-based customers, if the proposed settlement with consumer groups is approved by Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — amended in late 2017 — came into effect on Jan 1, 2018 and has clearly led to this entire bill reduction.Details of Tax SavingsThe company’s customers, particularly residing in Indiana, would save approximately $142 million in annual tax on their electric bills. The company is expected to reach an agreement to impart the tax savings to its consumers via a slashed electric rate over the next two years. The new Federal Tax Laws will lower the overall customer’s electricity bill.After considering the effect of lower tax rate, reduction in base rate and refunds of accumulated deferred taxes, the company will witness an average rate reduction of 5.6% by 2020 with most savings beginning in 2018. The actual amount of tax saving will tend to vary according to the different customer class. An average residential customer with consumption of 1,000 kilowatt hours (KWh) of electricity per month will save approximately $7.33 on the monthly electric bill from the downward revision in electricity rates.Benefits of the Tax ReformThe latest tax reform has resulted in lower accrued tax expenses for the utilities and lately, various companies are passing on this benefit to their customers, decreasing utility rates and bills. Duke Energy is also no exception on this front and has probably curbed its electricity charges to reward its customers with tax savings.Also, in recent times, we witnessed some other utilities having directed the federal tax savings to reduce bills for customers. These are Avangrid, Inc. (AGR  -  Free Report), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report) and WGL Holdings Inc .Notably, this rate reduction is in line with the company’s earlier-made recommendation on the fourth-quarter earnings call. It made clear about using lower tax rates to curtail utility rates for customers in the near-term as well as aid in offsetting the future rate increases.Price MovementIn the last three months, shares of Duke Energy have outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has moved 2.3% up compared with the broader industry’s increase of 0.4%.Zacks RankDuke Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

170,DUK,"Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) announced that its unit Duke Energy Carolinas continues to support solar energy production for its customers. In excess of 5,000 of the company's South Carolina customers have already installed solar panels on their homes and businesses, reaching a legislative goal for customer-owned solar capacity.Courtesy of Duke Energy Carolinas’ support, and willingness and initiatives of customers, the company is expected to achieve its goal of 40 megawatts (MW) of private ""rooftop"" solar well ahead of 2020. Duke Energy Progress, the utility serving the northeastern part of the state, is well on its way to meet 13 MW of private solar goal.Growth of Solar in South CarolinaDevelopment of residential solar in South Carolina was supported by strategic programs like the net metering incentive and rebate offerings. In addition to the net metering incentive, the company also provided in excess of $50 million in rebates as an extra incentive for customers who wanted to install solar panels across South Carolina.Owing to friendly legislation passed in the state, a new report by Southern Alliance Clean Energy (SACE) suggests the South Carolina solar market to expand much rapidly in the coming years. South Carolina registered 318 watts of solar per utility customer in 2017 and the report expects solar per utility customer to grow 170% to 856 watts by 2021.Looking AheadPer a latest release from the U.S. Energy information administration (EIA), non-hydropower renewables provided slightly less than 10% of electricity generation in 2017 and are expected to provide more than 10% in 2018 and nearly 11% in 2019. The report indicates that production from solar energy is going to increase further from the current levels.Utilities are investing in renewable projects and lowering their carbon footprints. Xcel Energy (XEL  -  Free Report) already achieved a 40% carbon-free generation portfolio and by 2022, its wind capacity alone will reach 40%, totaling a 61 percent carbon-free mix.Duke Energy aims to invest $25 billion within 2017-2026 to create a smarter, greener energy grid that will be more reliable and resilient even during severe weather conditions.At present, 40% of Duke Energy’s electricity produces no greenhouse gas emissions and the objective of the company is to own, or have under contract, 8,000 MW of wind, solar and biomass capacity by 2020. This will further lower carbon footprint of the company.Price MovementIn the past six months, shares of Duke Energy have gained 2.0%, outperforming its industry’s growth of 1.4%Zacks Rank and Key PicksDuke Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the same industry are Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. (AQN  -  Free Report) and Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (BEP  -  Free Report).

171,DUK,"Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) recently announced that the board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 93 cents per share on its common stock. This would mark a quarterly increase of 3.75 cents or 4.2%.Per the company, the dividend will be payable on Sep 17, 2018 to stockholders on record as of Aug 17. The estimated annual yield on the dividend is 4.3%.Regular Distribution HikesDuke Energy has been raising its cash dividend per share every year and this is the 92nd consecutive year, in which the company has continued with the same trend. In July 2017, Duke Energy announced a quarterly cash dividend increase of 4.1% on its common stock.Duke Energy has a stable dividend payment history. As of Mar 31, 2018, the company had cash and cash equivalent worth $421 million compared with  $358 million as of Dec 31, 2017. The company has maintained its record of increasing its quarterly dividend rate every year since January 2007 on the basis of its growing financial strength.In the first quarter of 2018, Duke Energy paid dividend worth $599 million to its shareholders, almost in line with the payment in the year-ago quarter. It continues to target annual growth in dividend, while being consistent with its long-term 4%–6% earnings growth rate. Through 2022, the company is focused to maintain its long-term dividend payout ratio in the range of 70%–75% of its adjusted earnings per share.Factors Supporting Regular Dividend HikeDuke Energy has been making capital investments in its infrastructure and expansion projects across its service territories. Per its long-term plans, the company aims to spend $30 billion for electric utilities and infrastructure, and also reduce its capital expenditures by approximately $1 billion for the 2018–2022 period. These investments are expected to drive the company’s earnings base growth in the combined electric and gas businesses by approximately 6% over the next five years.The company’s additional generation projects, such as dual-fuel capabilities, and combined heat and power facilities to increase the flexibility of its system, are likely to boost its performance in the time ahead.Notably, we believe that such planned investments along with significant growth initiatives will enable the company duly achieve its long-term investment targets and in turn improve its shareholder value through such regular dividend hikes.Price MovementDuke Energy has lost 1.9% in the last 12 months against the industry’s growth of 1%. The underperformance may have been caused by the potential volatility in market prices of fuel, electricity and other renewable energy commodities that the company faces.Zacks Rank & Key PicksDuke Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few top-ranked stocks in the same industry include NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG  -  Free Report), Ameren Corporation (AEE  -  Free Report) and Avangrid, Inc. (AGR  -  Free Report).

172,DUK,"Designed to provide broad exposure to the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market, the VictoryShares US EQ Income Enhanced Volatility Wtd ETF (CDC  -  Free Report) is a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 07/01/2014.The fund is sponsored by Victory Capital. It has amassed assets over $702.24 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueLarge cap companies typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.Value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios. They also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Considering long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets; however, they are more likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.35%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.01%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Utilities sector--about 24.70% of the portfolio. Financials and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Duke Energy Corp. (DUK  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.56% of total assets, followed by Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY  -  Free Report) and Xcel Energy Inc.

The CEMP U.S. Large Cap High Dividend 100 Long/Cash Volatility Weighted Index is an unmanaged index and generally consists of the common stock of the 100 highest dividend yielding stocks of the CEMP U.S. 18 Large Cap 500 Volatility Weighted Index.The ETF has added roughly 0.83% so far this year and was up about 9.40% in the last one year (as of 06/28/2018).

173,DUK,"The Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report) recently urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to extend the timeline of its long-delayed Constitution pipeline, per Reuters. The project was approved by the regulatory board in December 2014 but the construction process has been facing resistance from the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) since April 2016.The pipeline runs from Pennsylvania to New York and can addresses natural gas demand in more than 3 billion homes. The pipeline’s construction faced a blow from the New York environmental regulators who turned down the company’s request for a water quality permit, due to which Williams wants to push the timeline to December 2020. The company has already challenged the environmental regulators’ denial, which awaits another ruling from the FERC.Originally, the pipeline was scheduled to come online in December 2016. Following the water permit denial, the regulatory board agreed to push the date to December 2018. As the permit is yet to come, the company does not expect the project to be finished within the given time. Williams has already withdrawn and resubmitted the pipeline’s application twice so far. After receiving the required permits, the company expects to take around 10 months to a year for the completion of the project.The 125-mile pipeline (201 kilometers) is designed to ship 0.65 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of natural gas extracted from the U.S. shales. Apart from providing clean energy, the pipeline is also expected to generate many jobs for the localities. With the project being delayed, the cost is increasing, which is a high concern for the company. In 2013, the cost of the project was estimated at around $683 million, which has now gone up to about $875 million.Apart from Williams, energy companies like Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) and WGL Holdings, Inc.  also own stakes in the pipeline.Price Performance and Zacks RankTulsa, OK-based Williams has lost 6.8% in the past year compared with 10.9% fall of the industry it belongs to.

174,DUK,"Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report) is among the few stocks that are displaying mixed sentiments. While we remain concerned of the company’s cost-overrun issues and elevated leverage, its commitment toward healthy dividend payouts, along with the recent divestment initiatives provide a ray of hope.Notably, the shares of this utility stock have declined around 14% in a year vis-à-vis the stocks in this industry that have collectively lost 9.4%.Let’s delve deeper to find out the pros and cons of the stock.Major DeterrentsHigh Debt Raises Red Flag: Per the company’s last reported numbers, long-term debt came in at $44.4 billion, representing a debt-to-capital ratio of more than 63%. Apart from a rise in immediate finance costs, the high debt level will also require significant cash flow for repayments.Ballooning Cost of Construction Projects: Southern Company is bearing the brunt of continued delays and cost overruns in two of its large construction projects — Vogtle and Kemper — that have weighed on Southern Company's fortunes.Though Southern Company won Georgia PSC's nod for the construction of the Vogtle plant, the project is bankrolled with more than $8 billion in federal loans and loan guarantees. This is likely to hurt the utility's already weak financials. On the other hand, the Kemper Project has also been facing continuous criticism owing to its poor execution, escalating costs and multiple delays. The price tag of the project that had been estimated at $3 billion in 2010 has exceeded $7.5 billion. Moreover, with the suspension of all coal gasification operations, the Kemper project will now run as natural gas facility.Can Divestment Strides Keep Hurdles at Bay?Last month, Southern Company inked a $6.5 billion deal to divest stakes in several of its Florida assets to U.S.-based wholesale electricity supplier, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report). It also signed another agreement to jettison one third stake in its solar portfolio to Global Atlantic Financial Group Ltd., a retirement, life and reinsurance company.Grappling with financial challenges, Southern Company is currently heading toward the retrenchment road. The deal seems to be a prudent decision. Apart from bolstering financials to some extent, the deal will help in streamlining its portfolio. The deal will also help raise cash to repay debts and pay for the new reactors of the Vogtle Project. With limited cash flow and large amounts of investment to make, the deal would surely provide some relief to the company.Investments in Natural Gas Also a PositiveWhile Southern Company is mainly focused on power generation and electricity distribution, serving the attractive Southeast market with a wide customer base, its foray into natural gas also bodes well.The buyout of energy services holding company, AGL Resources Inc., in 2016 has helped Southern Company significantly increase its customer base, while diversifying business by adding gas-distribution assets. Focusing on natural gas is likely to help the utility gain significant operational and commercial synergies in the long run. The company aims to invest around $6 billion in its state-regulated gas portfolio through 2022.That’s Not AllWith their regulated business models and stability in earnings, utilities are among the most consistent dividend stocks in the market. Southern Company’s attractive dividend yield of 5.4% is much higher than the industry's average of 3.7% and also ahead of notable peers like Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) and Dominion Energy, Inc. (D  -  Free Report). In April, the company announced a 3.4% hike in its quarterly dividend. Notably, the hike marked the 282nd consecutive quarter of uninterrupted dividend payment by the utility.To ConcludeSouthern Company’s failed attempt to open the way for clean coal project along with construction of expensive nuclear reactors amid high debts dampen investors’ confidence, as is evident from its share performance. However, we believe that the company’s overall business is still strong and is likely to get buoyed up by its recent investments in natural gas. Thus, we think that its strategic strides, steady business model and attractive dividend payouts still hold promise for long-term growth.Southern Company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has a long-term EPS growth rate of 4.50%.

176,DUK,"OGE Energy Corp’s. (OGE  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Oklahoma Gas & Electric Company (OG&E), recently signed an agreement with Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC) and other regulatory parties to review rates for its Oklahoma customers. If approved, the new rates will take effect from Jul 1, 2018.Alongside the agreement, the company also reaffirmed its 2018 earnings guidance. It continues to expect the net income in the range of $380-$410 million or $1.90-$2.05 per share.Benefits of the AgreementThe agreement aims at the recovery of $400 million investment that OGE Energy made in its Mustang Energy Center.Under the terms of the agreement, the utility provider will cut down its rates by approximately $64 million. This in turn will reduce an average Oklahoma resident’s electricity bill by $4.44 per month.Rationale Behind the Rate ReformRate reduction is nothing new in the Utility space. In the United States, government regulations dominate the Utility sector. Therefore, the utility providers frequently file for rate changes with the states’ utility commission, to keep their revenue requirement competitive in tandem with changing market conditions.We believe that, this time, the latest tax reform has triggered this rate reduction. Of late, we have witnessed the latest tax reduction resulting in lower accrued tax expenses for the utilities and various companies passing on this benefit to the customers by reducing utility rates and bills. In this regard, OGE Energy is no exception as is evident from the latest rate review settlement for its Oklahoma customers. This rate review is preceded by the fuel cost reduction that the company implemented in March 2018. Such rate reviews tend to attract customers for the utility providers.In recent times, we have witnessed some other utilities, directing the federal tax savings to reduce electricity bills for the customers. Notably, utility providers, including the likes of Duke Energy (DUK  -  Free Report), NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report) and AVANGRID (AGR  -  Free Report), have expressed intention to pass on tax savings benefits to customers.Looking AheadOGE Energy plans on filing a rate review to the Oklahoma Commission, later this year, for two of its environmental projects, based in Oklahoma. These projects include the installation of dry scrubbers at its Sooner Power Plant and the conversion of two of the three coal-fired units to natural gas units at its Muskogee plant. Both these plants are on course to meet the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regional Haze Rule requirements.Management expects Mustang Energy Center to aid the company in further reducing OG&E's carbon footprint, enhancing grid reliability and offering an improved ability to support renewable energy resources, such as wind and solar. If approved by OCC, the latest settlement agreement will facilitate reducing the expanding costs in connection to the aforementioned environmental projects.Price MovementOGE Energy’s stock has gained 8% in the last one year compared to the industry’s decline of 2.9%. The outperformance may have been led by its systematic investment in base distribution and generation projects.Zacks Rank    OGE Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

178,DUK,"Dominion Energy, Inc.’s (D  -  Free Report) Atlantic Coast Pipeline recently hit a regulatory roadblock, as a few environmental groups filed a petition with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to halt the natural gas pipeline’s construction.Environmental Safety is the Heart of the MatterThree environmental groups namely Sierra Club, the Defenders of Wildlife and the Virginia Wilderness Committee are the ones to oppose. They want construction work of the pipeline in West Virginia — which was authorized by FERC last month — to be stalled due to violation of the Endangered Species Act. The opponents claim that the federal appeals court refuted a required permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and allowed construction to proceed anyway. The environmental groups allege that the pipeline’s developer did not have a valid Incidental Take Statement, as the federal agency did not set specific limits on damage that can be done to endangered species during construction and operation of the pipeline.While the owners of the pipeline project deny that the court rulings debunk the Fish and Wildlife Service's approval, the environmentalists demand the construction to be suspended until a revised Incidental Take Statement is issued.The Mega $5 Billion Natural Gas Pipeline ProjectMaking good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending, President Trump signed an executive order in January 2017 to accelerate the environment review process and approvals for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. While the FERC greenlighted the pipeline project last November, it has been facing opposition on environmental, health and safety concerns.The project is a joint venture between Dominion Energy, Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report), Piedmont Natural Gas Company and Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report), with Dominion Resources being the majority stakeholder and chief operator of the pipeline.The 600-mile Atlantic Coast Pipeline would transport gas from Marcellus and Utica shales to West Virginia, Virginia and eastern North Carolina. Evolving technologies like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing or fracking have led to a boom in natural gas production in the Marcellus and Utica shale fields in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. The pipeline would transport around 1.5 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas per day to North Carolina and Virginia. Increasing pollution from coal-fired plants has sparked off new environmental regulations and a radical shift toward clean burning fuels like natural gas. As such, Dominion Energy, banking on booming demand for natural gas, has started to rev up its natural gas distribution infrastructure by investing in new pipelines and expanding the existing ones.The Atlantic Coast Pipeline project will not only contribute to lower greenhouse gas and other emissions, but also lead to creation of jobs as well as revenues for state and local governments throughout North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia.Zacks Rank and A Key PickDominion Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Dominion Energy Inc.

179,DUK,"Exelon Corporation (EXC  -  Free Report) announced that its subsidiary, Constellation, along with United Renewable Energy LLC have completed a 1.8 megawatt (MW) solar generation project located at Hunter Farms, in Jakin, GA.This solar project will consist of 5,305 photovoltaic panels fitted in a tracking solar array and operate under a 30-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), with Constellation selling all energy and environmental attributes to Georgia Power.Constellation is focused on expanding its renewable energy generation in Georgia. It presently owns and operates nearly 17.8 MW solar projects in Georgia. Last year, the company along with United Renewable Energy completed a 1 MW solar project in Georgia, and its entire production had been sold to Georgia Power under a 30-year PPA.Rising Importance of RenewablesDespite efforts from the new administration to safeguard interest of the coal-fired unit, it is quite clear that demand for coal as an energy source is on the decline, and the void will be filled up by natural gas and renewable sources.The latest report from U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) indicates that energy consumption from renewable sources will increase 3.8% to 11.431 quadrillion Btu in 2018 and 2.9% to 11.766 quadrillion Btu in 2019. Per the EIA report, production from solar power will also increase 19.9% to 0.928 quadrillion Btu in 2018 and 18% to 1.095 quadrillion Btu in 2019.Focus on Storage FacilitiesUtility space in the United States is evolving and its emphasis on renewable generation is quite evident. Since the renewable sources like solar and wind were not able to produce electricity 24x7 like the conventional fossil or nuclear power plants, it has become essential to develop battery storage facilities.Battery storage facilities store power produced from renewable sources and supply them to the grid when there is high demand. Battery storage will increase reliability of the entire power distribution operation and lower dependence on fossil-fuel generation.Exelon has also invested in the new energy storage technology through Volta Energy Technologies. In addition, other large utilities like American Electric Power (AEP  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy (DUK  -  Free Report) have also invested to develop energy storage facilities.Per an EIA release, the United States had 742 MWh of energy in operational large-scale battery capacity at the end of 2017.  Given the increasing production from renewables and decreasing cost to install storage facilities, we expect more such facilities to come up in the United States.  Price MovementIn a year’s time, Exelon has returned 10.8% against its industry’s decline of 9.6%.Zacks Rank & Key PickExelon currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the same space is NRG Energy Inc. (NRG  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NRG Energy delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 507.93% in the last four quarters.

181,DUK,"Xcel Energy (XEL  -  Free Report) made an appeal to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (“PUC”) for approval for the retirement of two coal power plants in Pueblo, which have a combined capacity of 660 megawatts (“MW”). Projecting higher demand in Denver metro-area in the coming years, Xcel Energy is planning to generate power from natural gas and wind as well as solar projects. The operations will be jointly owned by the the company and a third party.Xcel Energy plans to purchase 707 MW of solar power and 1,100 MW of wind power from third-party owners, subject to the approval of PUC. Xcel Energy intends to shut down coal units and replace them with clean generating sources, which will involve an expenditure of $2.5 billion, which will enable customer to save $215 million.Motive of the ProposalXcel Energy generates electricity through coal, natural gas, nuclear, other renewable, solar and wind energy sources. The company is planning to lower emission and is on track to reduce carbon emissions by 60 % by 2026 from 2005 levels.The company expects to generate nearly 55% of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2026. Moreover, for emergency purpose the company also proposed to have three large scale battery projects to save powers on the grid. Two of these battery projects will be located in Pueblo.Renewable Energy Replacing Fossil Fuel Over the last few years, dependency on fossil fuel is gradually declining. The U.S. coal industry has faced stringent environmental regulations. The need for an emission-less environment is pushing the industry toward renewable energy. Coal is the primary source of greenhouse gas emissions and thus Utilities are shifting to renewables and other clean sources to generate electricity.Per Energy Information Administration, wind generation will account for 6.4% and 6.9% of total utility-scale electricity generation in the United States in 2018 and 2019, respectively, up from 6.3% in 2017. Solar electricity generation was 211 gigawatt-hour/day (GWh/d) in 2017, which is likely to increase to 246 GWh/d in 2018 and 294 GWh/d in 2019.Price MovementIn the last three months, shares of Xcel Energy have lost 1.3%, narrower than the industry’s decline of 2.4%.Zacks Rank & Other Stock to ConsiderXcel Energy has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

182,DUK,"Avista Corporation (AVA  -  Free Report) announced that it is seeking proposals or tender offer from the developers of the renewable energy projects, who owns or operates or can build up to an average of 50 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy via single or multiple proposal with a minimum net annual output of average 5 MW of electricity. Avista will consider proposals that include storage associated with the generation assets.To avoid complexities of building the facility, the company has come up with a Request for Proposal (RFP). The parties eligible for a tender offer to the company via RFP should own an existing facility, propose to develop or should possess rights to construct facilities for generation of renewable energy.Avista’s Take on Renewables & Capex PlanThe company is intending to increase the energy output more from the renewable source. It is looking forward to opportunities for acquisition or addition of more renewable energy resources to its existing capacity in order to offset market purchases and fossil fuel energy generation. The company is planning to generate electricity at lower cost in the long term, thereby reducing the heavy dependence on fossil fuel to some extent.As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had total capacity of 1,875 MW with an electricity generation mix of 55.5% from renewable (Hydro-49%, Wind-4.5% and Biomass-2%).The company is expected to incur a capital expenditure of around $1,237 million over the 2018-2020 period on generation, transmission and distribution system to preserve and enhance the reliability of the services provided to its customers and to replace the aging infrastructure.Importance of RenewableRenewable Energy source has been gaining momentum globally. Wind and solar power have been two of the fastest growing sources of electricity generation on the international front over the past decade. In 2017, global installed wind capacity grew by nearly 11%, thus bringing the global total to 540 GW. Projections by the International Energy Agency indicate that renewable energy will continue to grow more rapidly than fossil fuels over the next two decades.In 2018, per U.S. Energy Information Administration report, 9 GW of new solar and wind assets will be added, thus underscoring the rising significance of renewable sources in the United States.Price MovementIn the past year, shares of Avista have outperformed the Zacks Utility industry. The stock has rallied 21.2% versus the industry’s decline of 9.6%.  Stocks to ConsiderAvista currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks from the same industry include Ameren Corporation (AEE  -  Free Report), Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) and IDACORP, Inc. (IDA  -  Free Report), each with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Ameren Corporation came up with a positive earnings surprise of 6.90% in the first quarter of 2018. Over the past 60 days, the consensus estimate for current-year earnings has gone up from $3.02 per share to $3.04.Duke Energy Corporation delivered a positive earnings surprise of 11.30% in the first quarter of 2018. Over the past 60 days, the consensus mark for full-year bottom line has been revised upward from $4.70 to $4.71 per share.IDACORP, Inc. pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 1.41% in first-quarter 2018. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has been moved north from $4.18 to $4.19 per share.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

183,DUK,"Ormat Technologies, Inc. (ORA  -  Free Report) announced that its subsidiary, Viridity Energy Solutions, Inc. will start the construction of two 20 megawatt (MW)/20MWh utility scale, in-front-of-the-meter battery energy storage systems (“BESS”) located in Plumsted Township and Alpha, NJ.The BESS will assist in balancing energy demand in the electricity grid and is expected to generate revenues in the range of $7-$8 million in 2019. The revenues will be based on spot price, which generally varies from period to period.Details of the ProjectViridity Energy Solutions will utilize Dynapower Company’s inverters and LG Chem’s modules for the two 20MW/20MWh BESSs. In addition, Viridity’s VPower™ software will provide the visualization, optimization, economic value stacking and automated control of the BESS, which in turn will result in better performance of the electric grid.Importance of the Storage ProjectOur general conception is that electricity needs to be consumed as and when it is produced. However, development of the utility-scale battery storage projects has changed that concept as it helps in the storage of electricity. Batteries store electricity at times of oversupply when market prices are low and release it later when there is a shortage during high prices at peak hours or when there is a scarcity in supply from other sources of electricity generation.Plus, the increasing generation of electricity from renewable sources like solar, wind and water also increases the need and importance of battery storage projects. Renewable sources like sun rays are not available 24x7 to satisfy our demand for electricity, so these batteries help to store the energy to be used later when sun rays are not available.  Future of Energy Storage Per U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) release, more than 700 MW of battery storage units have already been installed in the United States.Large utilities like NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report), Duke Energy (DUK  -  Free Report) and National Grid plc (NGG  -  Free Report) have started to invest in battery storage projects. We expect more battery storage units to be installed across the United States, given the increasing production of electricity from renewable sources.The research report from IHS indicates the global energy storage market to expand at a very fast pace, with total installation surging from 6 gigawatts (GW) in 2017 to more than 40 GW by 2022.Price MovementIn a month’s time, shares of Ormat Technologies have outperformed its industry.

185,DUK,"Duke Energy’s (DUK  -  Free Report) subsidiary Duke Energy Progress recently proposed to increase electricity rates for customers residing in North Carolina. If approved by the North Carolina Utilities Commission, residential customers will have to pay an additional $5.22 a month for availing services.Details of the Rate HikePer the terms of the proposal, the company aims to hike electric rates by 4.7% in the first four years and an additional 1.3% thereafter. As a result, the annualized bill for a residential customer will increase from the current rate of $10.8.27 per month to $113.49. This hike will also include an increase in the basic customer charge from $11.13 to $14.00 per month.The average net rate increase for the first four years will be 6.2% for residential customers, 5.1 % for the small general service group, 3.1 % for medium general service group and 3.6% for large general service group. After the fourth year, the rates are expected to change to 7.3% for the residential customer group, 6.1 % for the small general service group, 4.7 % for medium general service group and 5.6% for large general service group.Our ViewThe current rate request filing by the company is in sync with its aim of investing in and generating cleaner electricity by responsibly managing coal ash and improving energy reliability. This, in turn is likely to increase value for customers and shareholders for a smarter energy future.Usually, utility providers like Duke Energy files for rate increase to recover costs of investment and thereby extend operations and provide better services. The tax reform implemented by the U.S. government last December, set the stage for this utility’s increased rate base. Notably, lower tax rate and elimination of bonus depreciation resulting in lower deferred taxes increases the rate base. As a result, the company expects to witness higher rate base growth for the same level of capital it earlier used to spend, thereby resulting in substantial earnings growth.Notably, the company’s robust five-year capital plan and current plans of investing about $30 billion in electric utilities and infrastructural growth projects over the 2018-2022 time frame supports this notion. Webelieve such rate base increase, which in turn leads to notable earnings growth, will allow the company to duly achieve its long-term investment targets.Price MovementDuke Energy has lost 7.9% in the last 12 months, compared with the broader industry’s decline of 5.6%. The underperformance may have been caused by the potential volatility in market prices of fuel, electricity and other renewable energy commodities that could further create operational risks for the company.   Zacks Rank & Key PicksDuke Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the same industry include CenterPoint Energy (CNP  -  Free Report), NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report) and Entergy Corporation (ETR  -  Free Report), all of them carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

187,DUK,"The coal industry is faced with numerous challenges from domestic and international markets. In the U.S., strong competition from natural gas, stringent regulations and additional impetus to solar and wind power generation through the extension of tax credits are steadily luring away utility operators from the commodity.Moreover, coal-producing countries like Australia and Indonesia — along with, importantly, a stronger greenback — are making the export market fiercely competitive for U.S. coal players.Also, in line with the policy laid down by the Paris Agreement, leading energy companies operating in Europe have announced that they will not invest in any new coal fired power plants post 2020. This will certainly dampen the prospects of coal in European countries.Even without the Clean Power Plan, utilities like NextEra Energy (NEE), Dominion Energy (D  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy Corp. (DUK  -  Free Report) were already investing hugely to create a green energy generation portfolio and have enhanced their focus on electricity from clean fuel sources.The Clean Power Plan has been repealed by President Trump. Despite that, new investments are being directed toward natural gas and renewable-based power production due to the clean-burning nature of natural gas and tax credits provided to produce more solar and wind power.Failing to cope with the continuous fall in demand and declining prices of coal, some coal miners have filed for bankruptcy. In response to the anti-carbon drive, utility operators are shutting down coal-based power plants and directing fresh investments toward constructing natural gas facilities and adding more renewables. U.S. coal production touched its lowest levels in 2016, at 739 million short tons (MMst) since 1978.Here are some of the severe headwinds that the coal industry is up against:Natural Gas Substituting Coal: A major substitute for coal in energy generation is natural gas, another fossil fuel. Coal is being dumped in favor of natural gas, which due to extensive exploration and production, and a shale gas boom in onshore United States, is witnessing significantly lower prices than in the past.Natural gas is an attractive choice for new generating plants because of its relative fuel efficiency, low emissions, quick construction timelines and low capital costs. This trend is encouraging power generating utilities to not only convert their existing plants to gas-fired ones but to build new units.A recent U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) release projected that coal production in the United States will drop 3% year over year to 751 million short tons (MMst). The decline is attributable to a 4% drop in domestic consumption of coal and an expected 9% drop in coal exports. Coal production is expected to remain flat in 2019.The EIA release showed that natural gas contributed 32% to total energy generation in 2017. Its share is expected to go up to 33% in 2018 and further increase 100 basis points to 34% in 2019. On the other hand, the share of coal is expected to drop from 30% in 2017 to 28% in 2019.In addition to power generation, natural gas is being utilized in new projects in the fertilizer and chemical sectors.Environmental Legislation: Coal has been losing importance as a fuel source over the last few years, particularly in the United States compared with other sources that are less harmful to the environment. Concerns over the emission of greenhouse gases and global climate change have resulted in the formulation of new legislations and policies which emphasize the use of environment-friendly fuel sources, particularly in the power sector.This has considerably slowed down the expansion of coal-fired capacity in the power sector, with utility companies now building new natural gas-fired plants and resorting to alternative sources of energy generation like wind, solar and hydro power.The Trump administration is trying to ease regulations that are hurting the coal industry. Will the United States be able to work in isolation ignoring the emission agreements directed at benefiting everyone? The answer to this question actually holds the key to the coal industry’s prospects.Duke Energy will invest $11 billion to generate cleaner energy through renewables and natural gas as it moves to a low-carbon future. By retiring coal plants and bringing on more natural gas and renewables, the company has already reduced its carbon emissions by nearly 30% since 2005.American Electric Power Company (AEP  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, has announced its plan to add 8 GW of solar and wind power generation capacity in its portfolio by 2030 and lower its emission levels by 60% from 2000 levels by 2030. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Majority of the power plants retired over the last decade in the United States were based on fossil fuels and among them a major chunk used coal to produce electricity. So, the ongoing reduction in usage of coal will hurt its long-term prospects.Competition from Alternative Energy Sources: Apart from natural gas, the coal industry has been losing a major share of its electric generation demand to renewable sources of energy. Usage of alternate energy is on the rise, with more utility-scale solar projects being commissioned across the country.The EIA report reveals that consumption of power produced from renewable sources is rising. Per the report, the 2014 to 2017 time period, renewable sources accounted for more than 50% of the total utility scale power plant added in the United States. Out of the 32 GW new plants planned to be added in 2018, nearly 36% will come from renewable sources. The rising popularity of the alternate energy source is undeniable and may hurt the prospects of coal.Rising Competition: Besides competition from renewables and natural gas, U.S. coal producers are also affected by rising export from Indonesia and Australia. International players enjoy the benefit of low mining and transportation costs, consequently making the coal cheaper than their American peers. Per the EIA release, coal exports – that touched 97.0 million tons in 2017 – will drop to 88.1 million tons in 2018 and further decline to 84.6 million tons in 2019.Bankers Retreat: Capital-intensive coal projects are gradually losing favor among primary funders like banks and financial institutions. Banks are distancing themselves from coal projects and are rather getting involved in natural gas-based power projects.To ConcludeEven though President Trump has taken steps to boost the prospects of the coal industry, it will be an uphill task for the new administration to repair the damage already caused. Over the past year, new jobs were added in the coal industry, but questions remain on the sustainability of this revision over the long run.To overcome difficulties and remain viable, coal producers are idling coal mines, lowering headcount, delaying capital expenditure plans and even resorting to selling mines. Despite these initiatives, coal producers are bracing themselves for an extended down-cycle, as demand for coal might improve marginally in near term but its share in fuel mix is likely to down over the long term.Billions of dollars have already been invested to produce electricity from clean energy sources and more projects are being lined up for approvals, so at this juncture going backward to dirty coal might not be a smart choice for our planet. Carbon emissions are a serious threat to the future of the planet, according to a vast majority of climate scientists.

On a bright note, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 13.49%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayLast September and October, Sempra Energy entered into membership interest purchase agreements with financial institutions to form tax equity limited liability companies that include a wind power generation project located in Huron County, MI, and a solar power generation project near Fresno, CA. The company expects to gain cash proceeds of $270-$300 million in the period from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the second quarter of 2018. We believe part of this cash will boost the upcoming quarterly results.However, the Aliso Canyon gas leak event led to an estimated loss of $841 million at the end of the third quarter, wider than the prior-quarter loss. These costs may rise considerably, which in turn will adversely the company’s quarterly earnings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sempra Energy’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.13 billion, displaying an 8.9% annual gain.

194,DUK,"U.S. economy has been on a rally since Donald Trump’s election victory. Trump’s tax reform was recently signed into law, increasing optimism among investors around a faster pace in economic growth and on the prospective passing of other policies of the President.However, with better-than-expected job growth, investors are betting on faster rate rises and inflation, causing havoc in the markets. In such a situation, investors generally flock to traditional defensive investments. However, these investments failed to protect investors in the most recent downturn.Market CorrectionPer data released by the Labor Department, wages grew 2.9% year over year in January compared with 2.6% in the prior month, the highest pace since April 2009. This introduced fears among investors of rising rates and inflation making a comeback.Moving on to interest rates, the Fed is widely expected to hike interest rates multiple times this year to tame inflation. Given this, markets are betting on the Fed to hike rates more than three times suggested earlier. Per the CME Fed Watch tool, there is a 71.9% chance of a 25 basis point rate hike in March (read: 6 Ways to Build a Rate-Proof Portfolio With ETFs). As a result, the S&P 500 entered correction territory, as it declined more than 10% from the record high set in January. This spooked investors and weighed on their risk appetite, which in turn made investors reallocate their portfolios.Defensive Funds in DetailLow-volatility ETFs are the go-to investment vehicles during times of high market uncertainty. These investments fared well in 2017, as high political uncertainty and geopolitical risks brought low volatility plays in favor.Low-volatility ETFs generally include utilities and staples stocks, and try to expose investors to high dividend yields. These funds invest in stocks that are viewed as “bond like” by investors for their steady business. Although this strategy is known to protect investors during uncertain times, the reason it did not work out in the recent selloff is that rising rate expectations were behind it. For instance, PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio (SPLV  -  Free Report) has lost 5.8% so far in February.High dividend funds are known to be negatively correlated to rising rates. It is a good play to combat market uncertainty. However, with bond yields at record highs and the 10-year yield touching 2.81%, the appeal of bond-like equities declined. For instance, WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund (DGRW  -  Free Report) has lost 6.3% so far in February.As a result, it is no surprise that defensive funds failed to be in positive territory during the sell-off caused by fears over rising rates. As the Fed keeps on raising rates, these so called defensive investments might not be able to protect investors from the wrath of the correction. For instance, Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU  -  Free Report) has lost 4.7% so far in February while Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund has lost 5.6% in the period.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to the discussed sectors.PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio (SPLV  -  Free Report)This fund is a popular ETF targeting large-cap U.S. companies with low volatility.It has AUM of $7.1 billion and charges a fee of 25 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposures to Financials, Utilities and Industrials with 20.9%, 19.7% and 19.2% allocation, respectively. The fund’s top three holdings are Honeywell International Inc (HON  -  Free Report), Berkshire Hathaway BRKB and Coca-Cola Co (KO  -  Free Report) with 1.3% allocation each. The fund has returned 11.2% in a year but has lost 3.3% year to date. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold), with a Medium risk outlook.WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund (DGRW  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to large, established U.S. companies providing high dividends by applying quality screens. It has AUM of $2.0 billion and charges a fee of 28 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposures to Information Technology, Industrials and Health Care with 20.2%, 18.7% and 17.5% allocation, respectively.The fund’s top three holdings are Exxon Mobil XOM, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) with 5.0%, 4.6% and 4.1% allocation, respectively. The fund has returned 22.0% in a year but has lost 1.3% year to date. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3, with a Medium risk outlook.Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to staples stocks and has AUM of $8.0 billion and charges a low fee of 13 basis points a year.The fund’s top three holdings are Procter & Gamble PG, Coca-Cola Co and PepsiCo Inc (PEP  -  Free Report) with 11.6%, 9.5% and 8.9% allocation, respectively.  The fund has returned 3.9% in a year but has lost 4.6% year to date.

198,DUK,"California Water Service (CWT  -  Free Report) submitted a filing with the California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”) to lower the water rates charged to its customers. Through this rate decrease, the company aims to pass on the benefits derived from the federal tax laws, and CPUC-authorized capital equity and debt-financing costs.If approved by the commission, the new rates will become effective Jul 1, 2018 and lower annual revenues of the company by $18 million. The rate drop in a way will offset the rate increases approved earlier by the commission, to recoup water-production costs and infrastructure improvement expenditures.Rate Drop — A Welcome Break for ConsumersWe are all accustomed to rate hikes after a certain time interval, as the regulated companies need to increase rates to recoup the capital expenditure and other expenses incurred, for providing better-quality services.Rate drop on the other hand is a welcome change, as the company is trying to pass on the benefit of lower costs to its consumers. California Water Service received approval from the CPUC to lower financing costs for the period of Jan 1, 2018 through Dec 31, 2020 and the implementation of the new act also lowered its tax burden, which was the primary reason behind the filing.Utilities to Pass on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act BenefitsThe implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has lowered the corporate tax level from 35% to 21%. The latest tax reform has resulted in lower accrued tax expenses for the utilities and lately, various companies are passing on this benefit to their customers by reducing utility rates and bills.To pass on the benefits, Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) decided to lower its electric and natural gas bill by $38 million annually.Price MovementIn a year’s time, shares of California Water Service have outperformed its industry.

199,DUK,"Duke Energy Corp.’s (DUK  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Piedmont Natural Gas, recently announced that it has received the regulatory nod for altering its natural gas rates from the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC). As a result, the average residential customer of Duke Energy in North Carolina will witness a $1 decline in their monthly bill. The changes will be effective from Jun 1, 2018.Details of the Rate ChangeIn May 2018, Piedmont Natural Gas proposed to change two separate components of its natural gas billing rate — the Integrity Management Rider (IMR) and the benchmark commodity cost. The proposal was submitted to the NCUC. Notably, the IMR rate change proposal offered a decrease of $0.44 per dekatherm for residential customers and $0.26 per dekatherm for small and medium general-service customers. On the flip side, an increase from $2.50 per dekatherm to $2.75 per dekatherm was proposed for the benchmark commodity cost of natural gas.Cumulatively, these rate changes will reduce a North Carolinian residential customer’s billing rate by $0.19 per dekatherm. In fact, this new rate change marked the fourth decrease in natural gas rates for the company’s North Carolina customers in 2018.Per management, including the latest rate reform, the company’s average residential customer's monthly bill has decreased by approximately $6.Rationale Behind the Rate ReformRate reduction is nothing new in the Utility space. In the United States, government regulations dominate the Utility sector. Therefore, the utility providers frequently file for rate changes with the states’ utility commission to keep their revenue requirement competitive, in tandem with changing market conditions.We believe, this time the latest tax reform has triggered this rate reduction. Of late, we have witnessed that the latest tax reduction resulted in lower accrued tax expenses for the utilities and various companies are passing on this benefit to the customers by reducing utility rates and bills. In this regard, Duke Energy is no exception. The company has also followed the same path and have reduced its electricity as well as natural gas rates, which in turn, has allowed it to reward the customers with tax savings.In fact, this latest rate reduction is in line with the company’s earlier-made recommendation. On fourth-quarter 2017 earnings call, Duke Energy stated that the lower tax rates should be applied to reduce utility rates for the customers in the near term and aid in offsetting rate increases in the future.In recent times, we have witnessed some other utilities directing the federal tax savings to reduce bills for the customers. Notably, utility providers including the likes of NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report), AVANGRID (AGR  -  Free Report) and WGL Holdings , have expressed intention to pass on tax savings benefits to customers.Price MovementIn a year’s time, Duke Energy has lost 10.1% compared with the broader industry’s decline of 5.4%. The underperformance may have been caused by the potential volatility in market prices of fuel, electricity and other renewable energy commodities that could further create operational risks for the company.Zacks Rank Duke Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

207,DUK,"Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) recently announced that its subsidiary Duke Energy Carolinas (“DEC”) is set to sell five hydroelectric plants to Northbrook Energy. These small plants are located in the Western Carolinas region and have a cumulative hydroelectricity generation capacity of 18.7 megawatt.The deal, struck through a competitive bidding process, is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2019. While the financial terms of the deal were kept under wraps, its closure is subject to approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and other state regulatory authorities.Details of the DealThese Green/Broad River Basin and Nantahala area–based hydro stations are serving Duke Energy’s customers for a long time in Carolina. However, the company has been incurring higher operations and maintenance cost for these plants.Per the terms, DEC is going to purchase hydroelectricity generated by these plants for next five years from Northbrook Energy. Therefore, customers will continue to receive electricity from Duke Energy at a lower rate, since Duke Energy will no longer have to bear the cost of operation after the closure of the deal.  Shareholders may also enjoy the benefits from this long-term cost-saving initiative undertaken by the company in the form of increased dividend payouts and stock repurchases.Will This Deal Benefit Duke Energy?Hydro, being the first technology used to generate electricity, has been the largest source of renewable electricity in the United States. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), hydro generated more than 7% energy in 2017 and is expected to serve more than 35 million U.S. homes in average by 2050.It goes without saying that hydroelectricity has immense prospects in the Unites States. Evidently, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Hydropower Vision analysis finds that U.S. hydropower can rise from 101 GW of capacity in 2015 to nearly 150 GW by 2050.Therefore, to make most of the growing opportunities of hydropower, utilities are also shifting to renewables from coal. Duke Energy, being no exception, has also been expanding its renewable asset base. In sync with the afore-mentioned strategy and to meet customers’ power demand at lower rates, the company agreed to sell the plants. This decision will maintain the environmental balance and will lower the company’s cost of operations.Price MovementShares of Duke Energy have lost 7.7% in the last 12 months, against the Zacks Electric Power industry’s rise of 2.1%. The downside may have been caused by the significant environmental compliance cost that the company bears.Zacks Rank & Key PicksDuke Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same industry include Ameren Corp. (AEE  -  Free Report), Alliant Energy Corp. (LNT  -  Free Report) and WEC Energy Group, Inc. (WEC  -  Free Report), all of which carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Ameren’s expected EPS growth for three to five years is pegged at 6.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS moved up 0.7% in the last 30 days.Alliant Energy’s expected EPS growth for three to five years is pegged at 5.6%.

208,DUK,"The Williams Companies, Inc.’s (WMB  -  Free Report) Constitution Pipeline project recently suffered a major setback when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) refused to rescind New York’s denial of a water permit to the project. The ruling has come as a blow to pipeline developers’ endeavors to transport additional natural gas to New England, which relies heavily on pipeline imports from Canada and overseas.Williams Companies applied for the water permit in August 2013. However, the company withdrew and resubmitted the application twice, which led to the resetting of the one-year deadline by New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). In 2016, the DEC announced its decision not to grant the water permit to Williams Companies.Interestingly, the project had received FERC’s approval in early 2016. However, the DEC denied issuing a water quality permit to the pipeline claiming that the owners of the project and the FERC did not analyze the environmental impacts of the project adequately and the pipeline will possibly impact over 250 streams adversely.The pipeline company filed a petition in October 2017 requesting the FERC to repeal DEC’s decision. The company claimed that New York DEC failed to act on the application within the stipulated time frame. The petition filed by the company stated, “The Clean Water Act specifies that if a state agency fails or refuses to act on a request for certification under Section 401 within a reasonable period of time, which shall not exceed one year, after receipt of such request, the certification requirements shall be waived.”However, the FERC maintained that DEC acted within the necessary time frame, given the constant withdrawal of applications by the company which had deferred the decision.Notably, FERC had revoked New York Department of Environmental Conservation’s (DEC) denial of water quality certification to Millennium Pipeline in September 2017. Williams Companies had been hoping for a similar outcome for Constitution Pipeline, however FERC’s latest verdict crushed the hopes of the company to make its pipeline come online by 2019. Nevertheless, the company is planning to seek a rehearing.Notably, the project has also drawn severe censure from various activists and environmental groups as they are of the opinion that the project will have implications on public health and environment.Constitution Pipeline project is jointly owned by William Companies, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) , WGL Holdings, Inc.  and Piedmont Natural Gas Company which was acquired by Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) last year. The $750-million project runs from Pennsylvania to Schoharie County and has the capacity to transport 650,000 dekatherms of gas each day.Oklahoma-based Williams Companies presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1(Strong Buy) Rank stocks here. Over a year, Williams Companies’ stock has outperformed the industry  it belongs to. During the aforesaid period, Williams Companies’ shares have rallied more than 16.2% against the 1.5% gain of the broader industry.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

209,DUK,"Even though the northern part of the United States usually experiences extreme climatic conditions during winter, this year has been especially harsh owing to a snowy nor'easter ""bomb cyclone."" The cyclone hit the coasts of Florida and Southeast United States on Jan 3, and South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Delaware and New Jersey the next day.The bitter cold wave enveloped the entire East Coast as well as the MidWest of the United States, causing heavy snowfall in the East Coast from Maine to North Carolina (as per Reuters), resulting in wide-spread power cuts. Extensive outages were reported in these regions, which might have led the broader Utility sector’s performance to dip. Evidently, the Utility sector dropped 1.4% since the beginning of 2018.Impact on the EconomyBomb cyclone spurred heating oil and natural gas demand in turn raising their price. Per The New York Times report, the cost of residential heating oil at the end of December 2017 surged 13% to $2.92 a gallon, compared with the same period in 2016.Being the major residential and commercial heating fuel in the Northeast and most widely used by power plants, U.S. natural gas demand also remained near record highs last week. Consequently, U.S. spot natural gas and power prices on Jan 4 rose to their highest in years in several regions (as per Reuters).The catastrophic back-to-back hurricanes and wildfires in 2017 in the United States have already led to a damage of $306 billion. The extreme winter storm and the cold waves, expected to continue for a while per the National Weather service, along with other catastrophes that usually take place each year, are likely to result in similar if not more damage.Impact on UtilitiesThe severe storm followed by heavy snowfall and high winds initially caused electricity outages in almost 80,000 homes and businesses on the U.S. Atlantic coast. Power outages have also hit thousands of customers in Florida and the Southeast.Per a North American Electric Reliability Council report, plants in the Southern part of the United States suffered outages, as they weren't designed to operate at such low temperatures. Meanwhile, outages at coal-fired facilities and problems delivering natural gas to plants in the 13-state region that includes Pennsylvania and New Jersey have also affected the system adversely.Although the storm dented electric utility services at varied parts of the nation, none of the major utilities reported any notable damages in their generation fleet or power generating system, thanks to their advanced infrastructural development. In fact, utilities in the Southeast have restored service to some customers who were hit by the storm overnight.However natural gas pipeline constraints in the Northeast have been posing challenges to the grid operator. Currently, natural gas accounts for about one-third of U.S. power generation, roughly on par with coal. However, there is significant opposition to new pipeline construction in the densely populated Northeast, which sits just above the major natural gas-producing region in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia.This becomes an issue during cold snaps, when residences that rely on natural gas for home heating, compete for supplies with power plants. Therefore, utility service providers in this region are expected to suffer a big blow from this storm.3 Utilities to WatchDuring the bomb cyclone, utility providers in the nation tried their best to restore the system. However, depending on the extent of the damage as well as severity of weather conditions prevalent in the outage sites, complete restoration was not possible. This may have led the below mentioned utilities to suffer in the equity market immediately following the devastating storm.Duke Energy Corp. (DUK  -  Free Report): This company is primarily engaged in electric power production and retail distribution of power. It carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Thousands of Duke Energy customers in North and South Carolina suffered power cuts over the week (according to the utility’s online outage tracker). The company appealed to customers to lower their energy use citing extreme cold temperatures that can put pressure on their electricity system.The company’s share price dropped 3.4% on a year-to-date basis, underperforming the broader sector’s decline of 1.4%.Eversource Energy (ES  -  Free Report): This company transmits and delivers electricity and natural gas. It also carries a Zacks Rank #3.High population creates problem for new pipeline construction for natural gas in New England, wherein natural gas accounted for half of the region’s electric power in 2016. National Fuel warned that it expects outages in New England that could take multiple days to restore. With Eversource being the largest energy provider in the region, the storm has affected its share price.The company’s share price dropped 2.2% on a year-to-date basis, underperforming the broader sector’s decline of 1.4%.Entergy Corp. (ETR  -  Free Report): This company is primarily engaged in electric power production and retail distribution of power. It carries a Zacks Rank #3.The only nuclear plant in Massachusetts was shut because of the failure of a line that connects the reactor to the power grid. Entergy Corp, which operates the Pilgrim Station, has not yet said when the station will restart.The company’s share price dropped 1.6% on a year-to-date basis, underperforming the broader sector’s decline of 1.4%.To Sum UpIn general, extreme weather conditions provide an impetus to utility services demand which in turn raise utility bills. Therefore, utility providers should have gained in the United States, following the terrific snowy storm. However, the share price performance of the stocks shows a different picture.Nevertheless, the increased utility bills that consumers have already paid, relative to the peak demand at the time of this storm, can be expected to get reflected in the improved Q1 results for these utilities as well as others. Further, once weather conditions starts to improve from the second half of January, as expected by weather reports, these utilities will be able to restore the outages full-fledged, post which their share price may take a positive rebound. In fact, each of them carrying a Zacks Rank #3 is a further indication that these stocks are worth adding in your watchlist.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

215,DUK,"Perennial demand for electricity and utility services has made the Utility Sector a safe haven for investors. Consistent demand enables a smooth flow of cash to utility operators. They in turn use this cash to reward shareholders by paying stable dividends.In fact, for income investors, this sector has always been a lucrative one with utility stocks generating strong dividend yields. As we near the end of 2017, it seems to be a good time for investors to review the prospects of utility stocks and accordingly reshuffle their portfolios.Rising Prices Boost Growth ProspectsIn a recent release, the U.S. Energy Information Administration predicted that the annual average U.S. residential electricity price will increase 3.4% in 2017 and 3.2% in 2018. This will surely benefit electric utility operators. Electricity prices are also projected to increase in commercial and industrial sector. Undoubtedly, such price increases will boost earnings of the utilities and enhance dividend payouts.Regular Dividends: A Major PositiveA major positive for utility stocks has been their regular dividend payout strategy. Even during times of recession, households and communities still need power, water, heat and telecommunications. This was evident during the economic crisis of 2008-2009, when utilities continued to pay dividends uninterruptedly.We have a long list of companies that are sharing profits consistently with shareholders. Notable among them are CenterPoint Energy (CNP  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy Corp. (DUK  -  Free Report), which have raised dividend rates annually for more than 10 years now.Trump Administration: A Boon Stringent regulations implemented by President Obama prompted utilities to take steps to lower emission levels. Although for environmental protection Clean Power Plan was an apt decision, it was putting pressures on utilities.  President Trump’s repeal of these stipulations on economic growth grounds are expected to give a new lease of life to utilities that produce a major part of their electricity from coal. After all, Coal still accounts for nearly 30% of the electricity produced in the United States.Trump’s promises to deregulate the sector and remove environmental hurdles will be beneficial for utilities. Fewer regulations will help to lower operating costs and increase the lives of power production facilities.Key BetsUtility operators are currently undergoing a transition as the primary fuel source, coal, is gradually being replaced by natural gas and other alternative energy resources like solar power as is evident from increased usage of clean energy to produce electricity.May be realizing that fact that our ultimate future lies in renewable resources, large utilities like NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy continue to take initiatives to produce electricity from natural gas and alternative sources, even when Trump is against the Clean Power Plan.With only a month or so remaining before we step into 2018, let’s take a look at the utility stocks which continued with their dividend payout strategy amidst this transition.With the help of our Zacks Stock Screener, we have narrowed down our search to the following utility stocks each of which has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a dividend yield of more than 3%.

216,DUK,"Duke Energy Corp. (DUK  -  Free Report), an electric and natural gas utility based in Charlotte, NC, is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company saw a negative earnings surprise of 1.89%. However, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.94%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayBeing a premier utility service provider, Duke Energy continues to invest in electric and gas infrastructure, along with retail and wholesale customer growth. Management believes that in 2017 the company will perform favorably in the electric business driven by base rate increases in Duke Energy Progress South Carolina and the generation base rate adjustment mechanism in Florida.Meanwhile, Duke Energy maintains its commitment to reduce its operations and maintenance costs. Hence, we expect the company’s second-quarter results to reflect these scores.On the flip side, the company's service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal temperatures during the quarter. This will result in lower household expenditure on heating and, in turn, might adversely impact revenues for the energy provider.For the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects a decrease of 5.14% year over year, while the consensus for revenues is $5.54 billion, implying 1.05% year-over-year growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Duke Energy this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Duke Energy has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.01. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP FilterZacks Rank: Duke Energy carries a Zacks Rank #2, which when combined with an ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Duke Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Duke Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Duke Energy Corporation QuoteStocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the Utility space worth considering on the basis of our model which shows that they have the right combination to pull off a beat:NiSource, Inc. (NI  -  Free Report) will report second-quarter results on Aug 2. The company has an Earnings ESP of +10.00% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Pattern Energy Group, Inc. (PEGI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +23.08% and a Zacks Rank #2.

The company is slated to release second-quarter results on Aug 3.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

218,DUK,"Electric services provider, Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report), recently revealed its plans of constructing three solar facilities in Northern Kentucky. These solar units will incorporate 31500 solar panels and generate over 6.8 megawatts (MW) of electricity. Notably, these stations will directly serve the customers of Kentucky.Details of the ProjectOut of the three units, Walton Solar Power Plants 1 & 2, will be built in Kenton County. The site will have 19,000 solar panels installed and the capability of generating more than 4 MW of electricity.The third one – Crittenden Solar Power Plant – will be located in Grant County and will incorporate 12,500 panels. This plant will produce more than 2.7 MW of electricity.The company has laid down plans of completing a major part of the construction by the end of 2017. On being operational, these plants will be able to offer electricity to almost 1,300 average-sized homes.Duke Energy’s Take on the ProjectWith increasing demand for electricity in Kentucky, Duke Energy aims at making most of the opportunity by setting up more solar power plants in the state. Moreover, cost of building solar projects is cheaper than before, making it more cost-competitive compared with other sources of power generation. Being an experienced solar power supplier, Duke Energy enjoys a competitive edge over peers in reaching out to more customers. The company already serves 850,000 customers in the Ohio/Kentucky region.The three solar power plants set to be constructed in Northern Kentucky will complement Duke Energy Kentucky's existing power generation fleet in Kentucky, which incorporates a 650 MW coal-fired plant and a 500-MW gas-fired facility.Our ViewThe solar energy market in the U.S has evolved greatly in past few years. Since 2008, solar installations in the country have grown seventeen-fold from 1.2 gigawatts (GW) to an estimated 30 GW today.Duke Energy is a premier utility service provider offering efficient power and energy services across various states in the U.S. and other international areas. We appreciate the company’s efforts of expanding its scale of operations, pursuing additional generation projects and introducing solar projects to meet growing demands for renewable energy in the dynamic environment.In pursuit of green energy, the company has invested more than $5 billion since 2007. As of Mar 2017, Duke Energy Renewables owns and operates about 2,894 MW of renewable energy out of which 583 MW is solar.Despite President Trump’s withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris agreement and the strong steps taken by his administration to abolish the Clean Power plan, utilities are still inclined toward adopting renewable as source of energy. This is because, although Trump is currently aiming to revive the coal industry, no one can deny the fact that renewable energy is the future.Notably, 2,044 MW of solar PV were installed in the U.S., in first-quarter 2017 to reach 44.7 GW of total installed capacity, enough to power 8.7 million American homes. Moreover, the industry is forecasted to nearly triple over the next five years, surpassing 100 GW nationwide, according to the U.S. Energy Department.Naturally, other utilities like Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report) and Westar Energy, Inc.  are also expanding base in solar power production to triumph in the long run, which can pose stiff competition to Duke Energy.Price MovementDuke Energy has outperformed the Zacks categorized Utility- Electric Power industry in the last 12 months. The company’s shares gained 2.7% compared with the industry’s increase of 0.5%.Duke Energy’s strong focus on core domestic regulated and highly-contracted renewable business has augured well for its stable financial position and streamlined portfolio, which can primarily be attributed for this outperformance.Zacks RankDuke Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Investors can also consider another top-ranked stock, Atlantica Yield PLC  which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Atlantica Yield reported an earnings surprise of 36.84% in the last quarter.

220,DUK,"Alliant Energy Corporation (LNT  -  Free Report) is currently focused on investing and adding more natural gas and renewable assets to its generation portfolio over the span of the next ten years. Further, the company has plans of upgrading some of its coal facilities for lowering carbon emissions. However, the cost of its current backlog of projects and future capital investments may rise due to delay, further hampering operation and increasing costs. Additionally, extensive environmental regulations at both federal and state levels remain headwinds.Alliant Energy is currently targeting a long-term annual earnings growth of 6%. Alliant Energy is well positioned to achieve its earnings growth target, thanks to for strong economic development in its service areas and ongoing investment in its regulated natural gas and renewable energy assets.Primarily to meet stringent emission standards utilities are focusing on alternate and renewable source and lowering dependence on coal-fired production. Utilities like PNM Resources (PNM  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) have invested heavily and increased their dependency on green energy generation portfolio.Alliant Energy is no stranger to this strategy and has been consistently investing in renewable as well as natural gas based electricity generation, while gradually lowering coal-based generation assets. The contribution from coal-based generation units in its production mix is expected to drop from 44% in 2005 to 22% in 2024. However, Alliant Energy is subject to extensive environmental regulations both at federal and state levels.

221,DUK,"Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) recently approved the construction of The Southern Company’s (SO  -  Free Report) controversial Vogtle project. The news came as a respite for the company’s project which has been receiving much censure owing to its ballooning costs. The Vogtle nuclear reactors have been grappling with cost overruns and scheduling delays since the commencement of the construction. Bankruptcy of Westinghouse — the major construction contractor of the two nuclear reactors of the plant — aggravated the costs further and led to more delays. Since then a cloud of uncertainty has been hovering over the beleaguered plant.A couple of weeks ago, Georgia’s regulatory staff were of the opinion that the overtly expensive project should be called off unless Southern company and its subsidiary Georgia Power — which is the chief owner of the project with 45.7% stake — bear the costs. While Georgia Power wanted the customers to bear the additional costs of the project, the regulatory staff believed that such inflated cost would be a burden on customers. However, the latest verdict has allowed the company to pass on the additional cost of the project to the ratepayers.The Vogtle expansion will result in the construction of a third and fourth reactor along with the two existing reactors. The nuclear reactors are now expected to come online in 2021 and 2022.  The construction of the two new Vogtle reactors is expected to cost more than $25 billion. On a positive note, Toshiba recently paid the entire guaranteed amount of $3.68 billion which it had promised for the expansion of the project. Southern Company also received around $10-billion federal loan guarantee for Vogtle Project, emphasizing the government’s faith in the future of nuclear energy in the nation.The verdict underscores the fact that such nuclear energy projects are important in promoting economic growth and strengthening the energy and national security of The United States.With the decision to continue with the project, Vogtle plant in Georgia remains the only nuclear project which is under construction in the United States. In August, South Carolina Electric & Gas — subsidiary of SCANA Corporation (SCG  -  Free Report) — terminated the construction of $18-billion VC Summer nuclear project in South Carolina. Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) also announced the abandonment of Lee III Nuclear Generating Station in South Carolina.However, the decision to continue with the project may increase the credit risk of the company. The project which has been missing milestone dates and suffering from poor productivity rates is likely to suffer from the ballooning costs, which may hurt the already weak financials of the company.Headquartered in Georgia, Southern Company is one of the largest generators of electricity in the United States.The buyout of energy services holding company AGL Resources, Inc. has helped Southern Company to significantly increase the customer base, while diversifying its business by adding gas distribution assets.Southern Company (The) Price   Southern Company (The) Price | Southern Company (The) QuoteSouthern Company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Another top-ranked player in the energy space is Northern Oil and Gas, Inc.

The move is expected to lower carbon emission and reduce usage of coal and water by nearly 50%.The shutdown of the coal fired units was per agreement, under the Revised State Implementation Plan (Revised SIP) and reduction of output by nearly 836 megawatt (MW). The company aims to replenish the loss of production through additional generation from renewable energy, existing nuclear power and natural gas.Emissions & Utilities Per a U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) release, the overall emission of carbon dioxide declined 1.7% in 2016 and 0.8% in 2017, courtesy of the initiatives undertaken by the utilities. However, EIA carbon dioxide emission is to rise 1.8% in 2018, due to higher coal usage.The coal friendly move from the new U.S. administration and likely hike in natural gas prices are going to increase usage of coal in utilities thereby increasing the emission levels.However, utilities like NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report),  Dominion Resources  (D  -  Free Report) and  Duke Energy Corporation  (DUK  -  Free Report) have already invested  and plan to spend more  to create green energy generation portfolio. Even without Clean Power Plan, utilities are focusing on investment in renewable energy and natural gas-based generation.  The utilities are also closing old coal fired production units paving way for further decline in emission.PNM Resources’ Long-Term GoalsManagement expects 2018 and 2019 earnings in the range of $1.70-$1.80 and $2.00-$2.16, respectively. The company aims to invest nearly $2.7 billion during 2018-2022 period, which will strengthen infrastructure and renewable generation.The company is targeting a long-term dividend payout ratio in the range of 50-60% and is aiming for an average annual earnings growth of 6% in 2017 to 2021 period.Price Movement                                                  PNM Resources has outperformed the industry in the last six months. The company’s shares have gained 24.8% compared with the industry’s rally of 7.0%.The outperformance can be attributed to the company’s impressive results and strong cash generating ability.Zacks RankPNM Resources currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

223,DUK,"Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) will take a final call regarding The Southern Company’s (SO  -  Free Report) Vogtle project on Dec 21. Initially, the hearing was scheduled for February 2018 but the PSC decided to prepone the judgment date due to changes in the tax code that could affect the company’s returns.The pending package of tax changes in Congress is set to cut federal corporate tax rates to as low as 20% effective Jan 1, 2018 which can affect how much Southern Company can recover from ratepayers in connection with the Vogtle plant expansion project.The Vogtle nuclear reactors have been grappling with cost overruns and scheduling delays since the commencement of the construction. Bankruptcy of Westinghouse — the major construction contractor of the two nuclear reactors of the plant — aggravated the costs further and led to more delays. Since then a cloud of uncertainty has been hovering over the beleaguered plant. The project is already running three years behind schedule and is over budget by more than $10 billion which is likely to go up to $20 billion by 2022.The Vogtle project has been receiving censure owing to its ballooning costs. Georgia’s regulatory staff want to call off the project unless Southern Company and Georgia Power bear part of the ballooning cost. Georgia Power is of the belief that customers should bear the additional cost of the project. This is in sharp contrast with the views of the regulatory staff who believe that such inflated cost would be a burden on customers. They believe that once the project is completed ratepayers are likely to bear higher costs with reduced benefits and hence want to pull the plug on the project.On a positive note, Toshiba recently paid the entire guaranteed amount of $3.68 billion which it had promised for the expansion of the project. Southern Company also received around $10-billion federal loan guarantee for Vogtle Project, emphasizing the government’s faith in the future of nuclear energy in the nation.Georgia Power, subsidiary of Southern Company, is the chief owner of the project with a 45.7% interest. The other co-owners include Oglethorpe Power, MEAG Power and Dalton Utilities. As of now, Vogtle plant in Georgia is the only nuclear project which is under construction in the United States. In August, South Carolina Electric & Gas — subsidiary of SCANA Corporation (SCG  -  Free Report) — terminated the construction of $18-billion VC Summer nuclear project in South Carolina. Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) also announced the abandonment of Lee III Nuclear Generating Station in South Carolina.Southern Company believes that the plant will make the United States nuclear competitive, helping the nation catch up with the likes of Russia and China. If the project gets scrapped, it will be a huge blow to the nuclear industry of America.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderSouthern Company is one of the largest and best-managed electric utility holding companies in the United States.

224,DUK,"Duke Energy Company’s (DUK  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Duke Energy Florida, recently completed its solar power plant in the Suwannee County of Florida. With a capacity to generate 8.8 megawatts (MW) of solar power, this latest plant adds on to the 4MW solar power (as of December 2016) that this subsidiary has been providing to the Sunshine State.Build on an area of 70 acres, with 44,000 solar panels, this facility commenced its operations last month.Duke Energy Florida’s Solar TargetUnder a recent settlement agreement, Florida Public Service Commission has provided Duke Energy an approval to add up to 700 MW of cost-effective solar power over the next four years. This in turn is projected to expedite the company's previous 10-year solar installation plan.In line with its solar expansion target, the company currently plans to begin construction of its sixth Florida solar power plant in Hamilton County in 2018. The plant, with 300,000 solar panels to be installed in it, will have a capacity to generate 74.9 MW of solar energy.Built on nearly 550 acres of land, the electricity generated from this facility will be able to light up more than 20,000 homes at peak production.Our ViewThe solar industry in the United States is developing rapidly. Since 2008, solar installations in the country recorded 17-fold growth from 1.2 gigawatts (GW) to 30 GW. On the other hand, since 2010, the average cost of solar PV panels has declined more than 60% and the cost of a solar electric system has dropped by about 50%. This has made solar power all the more affordable.Duke Energy is a premier utility service provider offering efficient power and energy services across various states in the United States and other international areas. We appreciate the company’s efforts of expanding its scale of operations, pursuing additional generation projects and introducing solar projects to meet growing demands for renewable energy in the dynamic environment.Realizing the expanding market for green energy, the company has invested more than $5 billion since 2007. Duke Energy aims to invest $11 billion to generate energy through renewables and natural gas as it moves to a low-carbon future. By retiring coal plants and bringing on more natural gas and renewables, the company has already reduced its carbon emissions by nearly 30 % since 2005. It has set a new goal to reduce its carbon emissions by 40% from the 2005 level by 2030. We believe the latest solar plant completion is a step of the company toward achieving this goal.In September 2017, Duke Energy Florida’s service was impacted by Hurricane Irma, which caused significant damage, resulting in approximately 1.3 million customers experiencing outages. The company estimated total storm restoration costs, including capital, of approximately $500 million; which may also increase based on additional information.Considering the fact that Florida is one of only four U.S. states with utility-scale electricity generation from solar thermal technologies and second to Texas in net electricity generation, Duke Energy has ample scope to expand its solar base in the state and recover these costs incurred by its subsidiary in Florida.In this same line, other utilities like NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report) and Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report) are also expected to expand their base in solar power production to triumph in the long run, which can pose stiff competition to Duke Energy.Price PerformanceDuke Energy’s stock has returned 12.7% over a year, outperforming the 10.8% rally of the industry it belongs to. This may have been driven by the company’s notable efforts to expand its renewable asset base and new natural gas generation.  Zacks Rank & Key PickDuke Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the same space is Consolidated Edison Inc. (ED  -  Free Report). The company currently carries a zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Consolidated Edison posted an average positive earnings surprise of 0.06% in the trailing four quarters.

225,DUK,"FirstEnergy Corp. (FE  -  Free Report) and its subsidiaries are on the verge of completing a rebuilding and modernizing project worth $26 million in Portage and Trumbull counties, OH.The project involves replacing the existing 69-kilovolt (kV) line with newer sets of poles and wires that will strengthen existing electric substations and enhance service reliability for Ohio Edison customers.Details of UpgradeUpgrade of the existing transmission line will result in addition of new switching devices that can be remotely monitored and controlled. Notably, addition of these to the line will allow grid operators to respond to power outages, faster and efficiently. Further, equipment will be used to enhance the line's capacity for meeting the growing electric demand. Notably, all of this is anticipated to be energized by the end of this year.Once completed, the upgraded lines will utilize smart technologies to help reduce the frequency and duration of power outages.Outcome Expected?Notably, the ongoing reliability venture is part of FirstEnergy’s ambitious “Energizing the Future”project that was initiated by the company to reinforce the power grid along with reducing the frequency and duration of customer outages. Toward this, the company plans to invest nearly $1 billion in 2017 and $4.2-$5.8 billion over 2017-2021, under the initiative.On conclusion of the ongoing reliability operations, the outcome is expected to benefit Ohio Edison customers and help strengthen the company’s existing grid. Further, it will increase the company’s flexibility to meet the rising demand for electricity.Recently, the company's Ohio utilities proposed a $450 million investment plan for redesigning and modernization plan with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (“PUCO”) for reducing thefrequency and duration of power outages at Ohio Edison, Cleveland Electric Illuminating and Toledo Edison divisions. (Read more: FirstEnergy Corp Proposes $450M Modernization Investment)FirstEnergy’s Consistency with ModernizationIt is not new for FirstEnergy to carry out improvement measures to enhance reliability in its service territories. In fact, the company has been enhancing and upgrading transmission lines, since 2014. Further, it has been introducing smarter technology into the grid, and outfitted substations with newer equipment and enhanced systems.These efforts have aided the company to serve customers in a better way. Notably, such reliability improvements across the company's transmission system have aided the company to perform well in last few quarters. Such performance has aided the company to has earn a positive surprise of 4.67% in three of the last four quarters.Considering that transmission lines and grid systems are susceptible to damages due to uncertain weather conditions, other utilities like American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP  -  Free Report), Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report) have been undertaking investments toward transmission and distribution operations to ensure reliability of services and provide better electricity services to customers.Price MovementShares of FirstEnergy have returned 13.7% outperforming the industry’s growth of 4.9% in the last six months.This can be attributed to the company's focus on continuous upgrading of transmission lines and modernizing efforts in its distribution network, through solid investments.

Moreover, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being a positive 5.30%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.The AES Corporation Price and EPS Surprise The AES Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The AES Corporation QuoteWhy a Likely Positive SurpriseOur proven model conclusively shows that AES Corp. is likely to beat earnings this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Impressively, the company has these attributes, as mentioned below:Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of +4.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: AES Corp. currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which along with a positive Earnings ESP indicates at possible earnings beat.Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayLower corporate tax rate arising from the latest U.S. tax reform, along with the favorable impact of deferred tax remeasurement, are expected to benefit AES Corp.’s first-quarter results.In March 2018, the company completed the sale of its entire equity interest in its Philippines businesses for $1.05 billion in proceeds, which it plans to use to retire its long-term debt due 2024 and 2025 along with some parent debt outstanding. We expect the effect of this debt reduction to get reflected in the company’s first-quarter results, in the form of lower interest expenses, which in turn, is likely to boost its bottom line.The acquisition of sPower was a key growth driver for the company in 2017.

228,DUK,"In a bid to proceed with its transition to gas and renewables generation, TransAlta Corporation (TAC  -  Free Report) recently announced a few strategic initiatives.Details of the Transition StrategyUnder the initiative, the company has signed a letter of intent with Tidewater Midstream and Infrastructure Ltd. for building a 120 kilometer natural gas pipeline from Tidewater's Brazeau River Complex to TransAlta's generating units at Sundance and Keephills. The pipeline with an investment worth $150 million will have an initial capacity to supply gas of 130 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) by 2020. It may be expanded to supply up to 340 MMcf/d, which represents approximately 50% of TransAlta's gas requirements at full capacity. Per the terms, TransAlta may invest up to 50% in this pipeline. This natural gas pipeline project is anticipated to aid in the company’s initiative to offer low-cost clean energy.Additionally, TransAlta has expedited the conversion of its Sundance Units 3 to 6 and Keephills Units 1 and 2 from coal-fired generation to gas-fired generation and now expects to complete the procedure in the 2021–2022 timeframe, a year earlier than previously planned.As announced earlier, TransAlta intends to retire Sundance Unit 1 and temporarily mothball the operations of Sundance Unit 2, from Jan 1, 2018 and Units 3 and 5, from Apr 1, 2018. Unit 4 will be temporarily mothballed from Apr 1, 2019. The mothballed plants are anticipated to begin operations starting 2020, when the demand for electricity is expected to rise and market fundamentals are likely to support the excess generation of electricity.Notably, TransAlta believes that, once operational, at least two pipelines supplying natural gas will reduce operational risks. Management expects mothballing these units during 2018– 2019, will allow the remaining units to operate at strong utilization capacity, thereby providing competitive cost structures.  Notably, once these coal fired units are converted to gas, they are anticipated to remain operational through to 2031 to 2039.Our ViewA comprehensive study by the Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (“NREL”) shows that renewables will contribute more than 80% of total electricity generation in the United States by 2050, compared with the present level of 30%. To this end, governments and businesses globally are making concerted efforts to speed up the process of clean energy generation.With rapid expansion of the renewable energy market, this transition initiative adopted by TransAlta appears to be a profitable decision as providing clean energy at low costs will bolster its shares in the booming alternative energy market. Further, as laid down by the Government of Canada, the rules regarding the conversion is expected to extend the life of the company's gas conversion units by five to 10 years that will mainly depend on lower carbon dioxide emissions, subject to finalization.Being the largest producer of wind power in Canada, TransAlta already enjoys a solid position in the nation’s renewable market. With this conversion to gas generating units, surely it will gain more in this market.  Realizing the growth prospects of renewable energy, other Utilities like MDU Resources Group, Inc. (MDU  -  Free Report), NiSource Inc. (NI  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) are undertaking steps to expand further in the clean energy market.Price MovementShares of TransAlta underperformed the industry in the last three months. The company’s shares have lost 2.7%, wider than the industry’s decline of 0.3%.Such underperformance can be attributed to the company’s high operating expenses that have hurt performance in previous quarters.Zacks Rank               TransAlta (TAC  -  Free Report) currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (hold).

229,DUK,"Electric utility firm The Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report) recently entered into a new agreement with Japan’s Toshiba Corporation. Per the deal, Toshiba will pay the remaining guaranteed payments worth $3.2 billion by Dec 15, 2017, for the development of two nuclear reactors at its $25-billion worth Vogtle plant in Georgia. Southern Company’s Georgia unit owns more than 46% stake in the Vogtle plant and is due to receive $1.47 billion.Westinghouse was the major construction contractor and designer of the two nuclear reactors at Vogtle. However, Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy in late March because the company’s corporate parent, Toshiba suffered huge losses due to the contractor’s projects in Georgia and South California. Therefore, Westinghouse exited Vogtle project as part of the bankruptcy proceedings. Since then, a cloud of uncertainty has been hovering over the beleaguered plant.In June, Toshiba clinched a deal with Southern Company to provide a financial assistance of $3.68 billion for the project. Toshiba was supposed to make the payments in installments between October 2017 and January 2021. Till date, Vogtle co-owners namely Georgia Power, Oglethorpe Power, MEAG Power and Dalton Utilities have received $455 million of the guaranteed payments. The latest positive development comes as a brief respite from the various controversies and challenges surrounding the project.The Vogtle nuclear reactors have been grappling with cost overruns and scheduling delays since the commencement of the construction. The bankruptcy of Westinghouse has aggravated the costs and delayed the project further. The project is already running three years behind schedule and is over budget by more than $10 billion and is likely to go up by $20 billion by 2022. Few days back, Georgia’s regulatory staff raised questions about the increasing costs of the project and wanted to call it off unless Southern Company and Georgia Power bore part of the ballooning cost.Georgia Power filed a recommendation with the Public Service Commission (PSC) on Aug 31 to carry out the construction of two nuclear reactors at Vogtle units 3 and 4.  The PSC is soon to complete the review process and take a final call regarding the expansion of the Vogtle project in February 2018. The latest development will help the project to gain momentum as it is under review.As of now, Vogtle plant in Georgia is the only nuclear project which is under construction in the United States. In August, South Carolina Electric & Gas — subsidiary of SCANA Corporation (SCG  -  Free Report) — terminated the construction of $18-billion VC Summer nuclear project in South Carolina. Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) also pulled the plug on Lee III Nuclear Generating Station in South Carolina. Southern Company believes that the plant will make the United States nuclear competitive, helping the nation catch up with the likes of Russia and China.

230,DUK,"FirstEnergy Corp. (FE  -  Free Report) and subsidiaries recently completed inspection operations and maintenance services of its equipments, in a bid to ensure operational reliability in its service territory, before winter arrives next month in the United States.Currently the company operates in six states — Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Maryland and West Virginia — wherein FirstEnergy undertook these maintenance initiatives.Details of the Maintenance WorkMaintenance work was carried out by FirstEnergy’s subsidiaries — Ohio Edison (OE), Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company (CEI), Toledo Edison (TE), Penelec (PN), Met-Ed (ME), Penn Power (PP), West Penn Power (WP), Jersey Central Power & Light (JCP&L), Monongahela Power Company (MP) and The Potomac Edison Company (PE).The company’s operations included the inspection of heating equipment for substation components. Additional inspection was carried out for batteries as well as motors of these equipments. An equipment survey was carried out to check overheating and malfunctioning in case the heaters get cranked up for higher usage.Company bucket trucks and other vehicles are also checked to ensure safe operation during the winter, while a thorough tree trimming across the year has been FirstEnergy’s custom for maintaining proper clearances around electrical systems. This in turn offers protection against tree-related outages.Notably, the company conducted helicopter patrols to lookout for damaged wire, broken cross arms, failed insulators and other hardware problems across the transmission lines located in its entire service area.FirstEnergy’s Reliability Measures - Not NewTo enhance service reliability, it has been a common practice for FirstEnergy to conduct maintenance work like the aforementioned one, each year before the winter season arrives. In fact, since 2014, FirstEnergy has been focusing on modernization efforts to upgrade or replace existing power lines, incorporate new, smart technology into the grid and substations upgrades; to serve customers more efficiently.This led to the company’s ambitious “Energizing the Future” plan for upgrading and expanding regulated transmission capabilities. FirstEnergy plans to invest nearly $1 billion in 2017 and $4.2-$5.8 billion over 2017-2021, under the initiative.Our ViewColder weather conditions increase the demand for electricity. However, heavy snow and winds can cause damage to wires and substations as well as transmission lines, thereby causing disruptions in electricity supply. Therefore, conducting inspections and maintenance of equipment before the onset of winter helps to minimize infrastructural damage and ensures better service.Following this strategy, FirstEnergy is conducting maintenance work across its service territory. Additionally, FirstEnergy has plans to transform itself into a complete regulated utility by mid-2018. The aforementioned efforts and investments to prepare for winters in its regulated operations are anticipated to aid this transformation.In line with this, we may expect other utilities like NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report), American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) to undertake similar steps to carry out maintenance and reliability operations.Price MovementShares of FirstEnergy have returned 7.2% outperforming the industry’s rise of 4.0% in the last three months.This was been driven by the company’s strong focus on upgrading its transmission lines and moderninzing its distribution network, through solid investments.Zacks RankFirstEnergy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

235,DUK,"Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) an electric and natural gas utility based in Charlotte, NC, is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 3, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 0.98%. However, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one of the past four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 1.21%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayAt the onset of the third quarter, Duke Energy announced a 4.1% hike in its quarterly cash dividend on common stock to 89 cents per share. The dividend payment was scheduled for Sep 18, 2017, to stockholders on record as of Aug 18, 2017.This indicates that the company has been generating robust cash flow from various operations and the soon-to-be-reported quarter is poised to reflect that.On the flip side, Hurricane Irma led to catastrophic losses in Florida last month. The storm damaged the grid system of electricity providers like Duke Energy, which has extensive service territories in the region. This in turn led to disruption in distribution network and widespread outages.Duke Energy reported that its electrical system suffered significant damages in Hardee and Highlands County. The company took several initiatives to address these issues and initiated repair work which included rebuilding this system.Moreover, Duke Energy in September waived off late payment charges and estimated bills for 1.8 million Florida customers to restore power in the state.These must have increased the third-quarter expenses of Duke Energy, which we believe will weigh down on its bottom line.For the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects a decline of 7.8% year over year, whereas sales are anticipated to drop 1.1% to $6.75 billion.Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not show that Duke Energy will beat earnings this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Duke Energy lacks these attributes, as mentioned below:Zacks ESP: Duke Energy has an Earnings ESP of -0.91%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $1.53, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.55.

Notably, the company expects to invest $62 million through 2020 under this project, with an aim to improve infrastructure and distribution lines across the service area.Details of the LTIIP ProjectsNotably, LTIIP projects will involve building new substations as well as distribution lines near Jackson Center and New Castle, with investments worth $3.1 million and $2.6 million respectively. Another line will be constructed between Pymatuning Central and Jamestown for an investment worth $1.2 million. Once the substations are connected, these are anticipated to ensure redundancy across Penn Power’s service area along with providing additional options for routing power on the local system. It will also reduce the frequency and length of power outages.Additionally, an investment of $0.6 million is anticipated toward replacement of an underground conductor in Sewickley, to improve system reliability. Remote-controlled switches worth $0.5 million will be installed to enable faster power restoration.Our ViewPenn Power currently serves approximately 160,000 customers across its service area.

Upgrading and modernizing the existing infrastructure base is of utmost importance to ensure steady and uninterrupted supply of electricity and power for the customers. Consequently, other utilities like NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report), American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) are also currently undertaking steps to strengthen their existing infrastructure while replacing older ones.

237,DUK,"Energy infrastructure provider The Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report) is hopeful of its Constitution Pipeline project to begin service by 2019, subject to necessary regulatory approvals.  The pipeline company requested the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to repeal New York's denial of a water permit which was necessary to move ahead with the project.  The company applied for the water permit in August 2013. The state however failed to act on the permit request within the one year of the statutory deadline. In 2016, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) denied the water permit to Williams Companies. The company believes such delays lead to a waiver of the federal Clean Water Act's Section 401 water quality certification requirement.The petition filed by the company states, “The Clean Water Act specifies that if a state agency fails or refuses to act on a request for certification under Section 401 within a reasonable period of time, which shall not exceed one year, after receipt of such request, the certification requirements shall be waived.”The project is jointly owned by William Companies, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) , WGL Holdings, Inc.  and Piedmont Natural Gas Company which was acquired by Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) last year. The 121-mile natural gas pipeline, which runs from Pennsylvania to Schoharie County was to transport natural gas from the Marcellus shale to customers in the North East.The $750-million project has the capacity to transport 650,000 dekatherms of gas per day. The pipeline which has received President Trump’s support aims to address the problems of transportation infrastructure in the Northeast region and speed up shipments from the prolific Marcellus and Utica basins.The project was expected to become operational in 2015, but got delayed due to lengthy review process, pushing the in-service date to late 2016. The project received the FERC’s approval in early 2016. However, the DEC denied to issue a water quality permit to the pipeline due to its possibility of impacting the ecology and climate adversely.  The DEC claimed that the owners of the project and the FERC did not analyze the environmental impacts of the project properly and that the pipeline can possibly impact over 250 streams adversely.If FERC agrees to the company’s request to retract the water permit denial, William Companies will seek a Clean Water Act Section 404 permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. If it secures all the necessary approvals, the pipeline is likely to come online by the first half of 2019.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

238,DUK,"Electric utility firm The Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report) is set to offload two natural gas distribution units to Folsom-based energy services company South Jersey Industries (SJI  -  Free Report) for $1.7 billion in an all-cash transaction.The units to be divested include Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas. These units are owned by Pivotal Utility Holdings, Inc. which is a subsidiary of Southern Company Gas. Southern Company Gas which was formerly called AGL Resources is a subsidiary of the Southern Company and is headquartered in Atlanta. Elizabethtown Gas, set up in 1855, serves more than 277,000 residential, business and industrial natural gas customers in New Jersey. Founded in 1863, Elkton Gas serve 6,000 residential and commercial customers in the greater Elkton area.The deal needs to be approved by the state regulators in New Jersey and Maryland. It also requires limited approvals from Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Federal Communications Commission. Additionally, the deal is also conditioned upon the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. Subject to these regulatory approvals and satisfactory closing conditions, the deal is expected to get completed by the third quarter of 2018.The deal is in sync with Southern Company’s strategy to drive growth and streamline its asset portfolio. The transaction will enable the company to shore up its weak financials. The utility's long-term debt at the end of the second quarter totaled to around $44 billion, which represents a debt-to-capitalization ratio of more than 60%. The company’s high leverage along with the cost overrun issues related to the construction of two key projects — Vogtle and Kemper — weighed on its balance sheet and earnings. The proceeds from the sale are likely to provide the company some financial flexibility and tap growth opportunities, thereby adding to shareholders value.The deal will enable South Jersey Industries to become the second largest natural gas provider in the state, catering to over 675,000 customers. The company expects the deal to be accretive to earnings by 2020.Zacks Rank Southern Company is one of the largest generators of electricity in the nation along with the likes of Exelon Corporation (EXC  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) among others.

239,DUK,"The AES Corporation (AES  -  Free Report) made an announcement regarding its operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, following the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria.AES Corp has aided and provided assistance to its employees and local communities in Puerto Rico that were critically impacted due to the devastating nature of the hurricanes.Impact of the HurricanesBoth the hurricanes caused significant disruptions to the AES Corp’s Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands operations. Notably, three of the company’s Puerto Rico power plants sustained damages. Its Puerto Rico’s 24 megawatt (MW) solar plant and one of the two units of its 524 MW coal-fired plant were impacted massively. Despite the damages, other unit is still able to generate electricity, while the damaged one is being reviewed.Details of the UpdateAES Corp has provided an update and reaffirmed 2017 guidance for all metrics. The company expects adjusted EPS to be in the lower half of the $1.00 to $1.10 range. An adverse impact of 3 cents to 5 cents is expected on the 2017 adjusted EPS guidance, primarily stemming from the sustained damages to aforementioned power plants and other business interruptions.How Have Utilities Been Impacted?According to BBC News, analysts had initially estimated that the United States will bear an economic cost of $300 billion from hurricane Irma alone. Meanwhile, hurricane Maria has been placed among the top 10 most intense Atlantic hurricanes on record, consequently hitting the company’s business in Puerto Rico quite hard.Toward this, utility operators like Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report) the operations of which have been impacted due to the hurricanes have started undertaking several restoration steps to normalize operations.We expect impact of the hurricanes to show in third-quarter earnings of most utilities in the broader sector as it has severely affected the infrastructure of the state; nevertheless, investment toward restoration of service areas and infrastructure are likely to hurt the sector a little less than as previously anticipated.Price MovementShares of AES Corp have gained 3.6%, compared to the industry’s increase of 5.4% in the last three months.Weakness in overseas operation is adversely impacting the prospects of the company and cost of adherence to stringent environmental regulations can hurt margins.Zacks Rank & Key PickAES Corp currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Ameren has the right combination of both the elements.Zacks ESP: Ameren has an Earnings ESP of +1.45%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter..Ameren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Ameren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Ameren Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: Ameren has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. The company’s positive rank combined with +1.45% ESP increases the possibility of a positive earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2018 earnings is pegged at 58 cents per share, reflecting 38% growth from the year-ago reported quarter.Ameren expects its first-quarter earnings to gain from an increase in Missouri electric service rates, return to normal weather, and absence of scheduled Callaway refueling and maintenance outage. All these factors are likely to have a combined benefit of 28 cents on Ameren Missouri’s earnings compared with first-quarter 2017.  In addition, refinancing of debts at favorable terms will also boost its earnings by 4 cents in the quarter.However, other operation and maintenance expenses at Ameren Missouri will likely have an adverse impact of 14 cents on earnings compared with first-quarter 2017.Other Stocks to ConsiderIn addition to Ameren, investors can also consider some companies from the industry, as our model shows that they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter:Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) will report first-quarter 2018 results on May 10.

242,DUK,"American Water Works Company (AWK  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results, after the market closes on May 2. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.55%.Why is a Positive Surprise Likely?A stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for an earnings beat. Per our model, American Water is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses these components.Zacks ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is +2.44%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 56 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 55 cents.American Water Works Price and EPS Surprise American Water Works Price and EPS Surprise | American Water Works QuoteYou can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: American Water Works currently has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the possibility of a beat when combined with a positive Earnings ESP.However, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision momentum.Factors to ConsiderAmerican Water Works continues to benefit from its geographical diversity which reduces the weather and regulatory risks of earnings. The company will gain from new water rates, approved by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, effective Jan 1, 2018, and will increase annual revenues by $62 million.Through infrastructure investments and acquisitions, American Water Works will continue to strengthen customer base and expand its service area. The acquisition of Village of Fisher’s water and wastewater systems in the first quarter added 850 customers to its existing customer base. It is expected to boost the company’s earnings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues and earnings per share is pegged at $787 million and 55 cents, reflecting year-over-year growth of 4.1% and 5.8%, respectively.Other Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are a few other companies from the Zacks Utilities Sector that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.PPL Corporation (PPL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.63% and a Zacks Rank #3.

243,DUK,"PG&E Corporation (PCG  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3, before the opening bell.The company reported a negative earnings surprise of 8.70% in the last reported quarter. However, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 11.76%.Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Price and EPS Surprise Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Price and EPS Surprise | Pacific Gas & Electric Co. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayPG&E incurred costs of $219 million in 2017 for service restoration and repairs to its facilities due to widespread wildfires that ravaged major parts of Northern California in October. These costs are likely to weigh on the company’s first-quarter 2018 results, if the company’s requests for cost recovery are not approved.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PG&E’s first-quarter earnings of $1.03 per share reflects a year-over-year decline of 2.8%. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $4.23 billion, reflecting a 0.8% year-over-year decrease.The company anticipates reducing revenue requirement by $500 million in 2018 stemming from the lower corporate tax rate. This is expected to effectively impact its results from this year. To that end, we may expect its first-quarter results to reflect a partial impact of the reduced revenue requirement.Warmer-than-normal winter in PG&E’s service territory is expected to reduce electricity demand which in turn is likely to hurt the company’s quarterly revenues.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that PG&E is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But this is not the case here as you will see below. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP:  PG&E has an Earnings ESP of -1.86%, representing the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate of $1.01 per share and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.03 per share.Zacks Rank: PG&E has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP.

244,DUK,"American Water Works Company (AWK  -  Free Report) announced that its subsidiary, Pennsylvania American Water has received directive from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) to pass on the tax savings benefits resulting from the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) to customers.The new act became effective Jan 1, 2018 and lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. This move will lead to reduction of about $47 million annually in the federal income tax that Pennsylvania American Water will pay to the government.Quality Service at Low PricesThe tax-cut savings will allow the residential customers of Pennsylvania American Water to enjoy safe and reliable services at a very competitive price.For water customers who typically use 5,000 gallons per month, the savings will be $5.27 or $63.24 per year, while wastewater customers, who typically use 5,000 gallons per month, will encounter savings of $6.58, or $78.96 per year.Tax Cuts — A Blessing for CustomersUtilities in some states are directed by the utility commission for implementing tax cuts to lower customers’ bills. Utilities are passing on the benefits to their customer base either through reduction in existing utility service rates or by adjusting their planned rate increases.Passing on tax savings does not look significant when we consider a single user or a single utility, however, it is significant when we consider the nation as a whole. Decisions have already been taken to pass on more than billions of dollars in tax savings to customers and we expect this amount to increase further.Recently, Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) decided to pass on $142 million in tax savings to lower utility bills of Indiana-based customers if the proposed settlement is approved by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.Another utility, NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report) has decided to use tax savings of nearly $1.3 billion to recoup the storm-recovery expenses, without increasing its users’ bills in Florida.Price MovementAmerican Water Works’ shares have returned 11.5% in the past year, outperforming the 1.7% growth of the  industry it belongs to.Zacks Rank and A Stock to ConsiderCurrently, American Water Works has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the same space is Global Water Resources Inc. (GWRS  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Global Water Resources’ long-term EPS growth is expected to be 15% and its 2018 Consensus Estimate has moved up 21.4% to 17 cents in the past 60 days.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

The new 12-inch steel pipeline will be connected with the 750-mile transmission pipeline system which serves the Riverton and Casper areas. Subject to WPSC’s approval, $54 million will be spent for the construction purpose. The pipelines are expected to commence operation from late 2019.Black Hills supplies natural gas and electric to nearly 1.2 million customers in eight states. These pipelines will increase the reliability of services for nearly 57,000 customers of Casper Division in central Wyoming. Along with the existing facilities, the pipeline will be able to cater to the rising demand.The company has regulated as well as non-regulated business and files with utility commissions to recoup the regulated investments made to strengthen existing operations. If the commission approves the construction of the pipelines, the company will make the investments and is likely to file another rate case to recover the expenditures.Incidentally, the company has already filed rate review requests for Arkansas, Colorado and Wyoming in late 2017. The company received approval to hike rates in Colorado and is waiting for the results of the two other cases.Tax Reforms BenefitsBlack Hills benefited from the tax reforms, effective Jan 1, 2018. Like other utility operators, the company wanted to pass the tax reform benefits to its customers through bill reduction. Black Hills received the required approval from the utility commissions to pass on the tax benefits in four states.Recently, Duke Energy Corp (DUK  -  Free Report) announced to pass on $142-million annual tax savings to the electric bills of its Indiana-based customers.Our ViewRegulated utility companies need to invest consistently to upgrade and modernize existing infrastructures. Providing better service to the customers is very essential for these companies. Investment improves reliability of existing infrastructure and helps meet the rising demand.Black Hills also invests to provide uninterrupted utility services. Spending for expansion and maintenance of existing assets are common in utility sector. The company plans to invest nearly $2.3 billion over the next five years. Recently, FirstEnergy Corp’s (FE  -  Free Report) subsidiaries completed the inspection of transmission lines and are likely to invest $1-$1.2 billion annually through 2021 for maintenance purpose.

246,DUK,"FirstEnergy Corporation’s(FE  -  Free Report) subsidiary Jersey Central Power & Light (JCP&L) has taken a step toward trimming trees as part of its $34 million vegetation management program for 2017.The subsidiary’s forestry contractors will undertake tree trimming activities in more than 50 municipalities during the month of September to prevent tree-related power outage. The above program is anticipated to promote enhanced service reliability by helping guard against growing vegetation. Over 2,500 circuit miles of tree trimming has been undertaken and another 1,100 miles is currently underway.The Vegetation ProgramIn the electric utility industry, growing vegetation is a leading cause of power outages.  As such JCP&L’s tree-care maintenance program helps to keep vegetation away from power lines and other electric equipment.Although the vegetation management work is an expensive maintenance cost, it is essential for utility providers to take steps for providing safe and reliable service to customers. As such, the company’s tree management program since 2003, has helped to reduce tree-related outages in New Jersey service by nearly 24%.JCP&L currently serves approximately 1.1 million customers in central and northern New Jersey. JCP&L’s tree-care maintenance program is testament to FirstEnergy’s focus in providing the customers reliable and outage free power services. Toward this, the company has plans to invest nearly $600 million transmission projects through 2018.Going forward, we expect such initiatives to aid the company to retain existing customers’ while adding more customers as it continues to take steps for enhancing the quality of services.FirstEnergy’s Step toward Customer RetentionUtility is a regulated, yet highly competitive market. Upgrading and modernizing the existing infrastructure is important for giving better service to the customers. Consequently, apart from FirstEnergy other utility firms like NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report), American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) are also strengthening infrastructure to provide better-quality services to customer base.We believe that FirstEnergy’s regulated growth strategies along with its step toward enhancing service reliability through the tree trimming program will aid the company to position itself as a successful utility operator for sustained customer service-oriented growth.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

247,DUK,"The fate of electric utility firm The Southern Company’s (SO  -  Free Report) Kemper Project continues to remain uncertain as the company and the Public Utilities Staff failed to reach a settlement regarding the rate issue. Concurrently, Mississippi Public Service Commission (MPSC) scheduled the hearings for the project to commence from Dec 4.Notably, few days back Southern Company requested the Public Service Commission to reassess the service agreement of the Kemper plant as the company managed to reach an accord with all other parties but the Public Utilities Staff. Looking BackMississippi Power, subsidiary of Southern Company and in charge of the Kemper Project, has spent years in the construction of the project based on clean coal gasification technology. The Kemper plant had been central to ex-President Obama’s Climate Plan and was designed to reduce up to 65% of carbon dioxide emissions. Notably, the project also received the support of President Trump.However, the project has been facing continuous criticism owing to its poor execution, cost overruns and multiple delays. The plant is already three years behind schedule and is over $4 billion beyond the stipulated budget. The overall cost of the plant was estimated to be around $3 billion in 2010. However, with several delays adding to the project’s cost, the current price tag of the plant has ballooned over $7.3 billion. In the past 18 months, the company has announced 10 delays due to project management problems. The project found it difficult to get its two gasifiers to operate consistently. Mississippi Power has been unable to make the project economically viable in the face of volatile natural gas prices.Mississippi regulators, who do not wish ratepayers to incur additional costs, ordered the company not to increase the rates for Mississippi Power customers. In fact, they want the company to lower the rates, if feasible. MPSC have been encouraging rate reductions to eliminate ratepayers risk for gasifiers’ assets. In June, MPSC issued an ultimatum ordering Southern Company to redesign plans and run the Kemper Project solely on natural gas.  This left the management in a dilemma in regard to its investment costs retrievement.Thereafter, the company suspended all coal gasification operations at its Kemper plant. Since the company could no longer retrieve the project’s massive costs from ratepayers, management was of the opinion that the move would enable it to lower additional costs required for the further development and improvement of gasification units.What Lies Ahead? The company believes that it has complied with all the requirements of Public Service Commission including the operation of the plant solely as a natural gas facility. Southern Company has also decided against rate increase for customers.  The company now thus wants the MPSC to re-evaluate the settlement agreement.Mississippi Power announced plans to keep the rates unchanged; however the Public Utilities Staff are demanding a reduction in rates. If the agreement doesn’t get reconsidered, both the parties are set to explain their positions on the rate case in the hearing that starts from Dec 4. The final decision on which is expected by January. If Mississippi Power fails to get a favorable judgment, the company which is already grappling with weak financials, is likely to suffer additional losses.Zacks RankSouthern Company is one of the largest generators of electricity in the nation along with the likes of Exelon Corporation (EXC  -  Free Report), RWE AG (RWEOY  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report). Over the year, shares of Southern Company have lost more than 4% against roughly 5.2% gain recorded by the industry.However, the company managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 0.86%.

248,DUK,"NiSource, Inc (NI  -  Free Report) announced its finance subsidiary, NiSource Finance Corp., has completed the sale of $750-million aggregate principal amount of 3.950% Notes due 2048.NiSource Finance, will utilize the proceeds from this offering to finance the capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. The balance proceeds could be used to repay short-term borrowings.NiSource’s Capital Expenditure PlanNiSource previously announced plans to make planned utility infrastructure investments of about $1.6-$1.7 billion in 2017 and has identified long-term infrastructure investments worth $30 billion, with over 90% of it allocated to regulated pipes and wires.In addition to the above actions, the company is also taking commendable steps to reduce the greenhouse gas emission to keep up with peers like Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report), Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report), NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG  -  Free Report) etc. All of these companies are striving to bring down their carbon footprint.According to the projected figures, its coal usage is expected to drop to 42% of its generation mix by 2023, from the current level of 78%. The company will do the same by retrofitting emission control equipment in its existing coal plants, retiring old plants and replacing the coal fired units by renewable sources.Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) continues to execute its seven-year, $845 million gas infrastructure modernization program to further improve system reliability and safety. NIPSCO is also working to execute its seven-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to its electric transmission and distribution system designed to further improve system safety and reliability.Rising Debt LevelNiSource’s long-term debt was $6,777.4 million for the period ended Jun 30, 2017, compared to $6,058.2 million for the period ended Dec 31, 2016.The rise in long-term debt level is a matter of concern as it can lead to rise in interest expense and can erode the company’s profit margin. This newly issued debt will increase interest expenditure by approximately $30 million.Interestingly, during the second quarter the company was able to successfully refinance about $1 billion of near-term maturity debt with lower-rate debt. This would help in saving a good amount on interest expense in the next few years. NiSource also expects that its strategic investments will allow the company to deliver its targeted earnings and dividend growth of 5-7% through 2020.Price MovementIn the last six months, shares of NiSource have gained 15.3% outperforming the Zacks categorized industry's gain of 5.1%.This outperformance could be attributed to NiSource’s consistent investment to strengthen existing infrastructure and focus on clean energy.Zacks RankNiSource carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

These notes will pay interest semi-annually, at the rate of 1.50% per annum, and will mature on Sep 15, 2020. These notes can be converted to equity at a 25% premium according to the closing price of $42.29 per common unit on Sep 6, 2017.Purpose of the OfferingThe capital accumulated from this offering will be utilized to fund the company’s expansion plans in the current year. The partnership is aiming to use a portion of the proceeds from this offering to acquire renewable assets either from NextEra Energy Resources or third parties. The partnership might utilize the proceeds to fund the initial cost of the capped call transaction and use the balance proceeds for general partnership purposes.The partnership has already received offers to buy the following assets from NextEra Energy Resources — 25.9% interest in Desert Sunlight 250 and Desert Sunlight 300 at Riverside County, CA; Brady Wind I and Brady Wind II at Stark and Hettinger counties, ND and Javelina I at Webb County, TX. However, the partnership is under no obligation to buy these assets.Expansion of Renewable PortfolioNextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report) formed NextEra Energy Partners to own, manage and acquire contracted clean energy projects with stable and long-term cash flows.The partnership evaluates and adds high-quality renewable assets to its portfolio. During the second quarter, it completed the acquisition of 250 megawatts (MW) Golden West Wind project from NextEra Energy Resources for approximately $238 million.Why Renewable Energy?With global warming on the rise, it is important to plan energy consumption carefully. It is important to note that non-renewable energy sources are limited and will be exhausted in the near future. Therefore, major energy providers like NextEra Energy, Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report), Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report) and others are gradually switching to low or no-emission energy resources, such as solar, wind, hydro etc., which are available abundantly.According to U.S. Energy Information Administration, in 2016, approximately 10% of total energy consumption in the United States was from renewable energy sources. We expect contribution from the renewable sources to the total generation mix to rise due to lower cost of power production from renewable sources and government’s initiatives to provide more impetus to renewable generation projects.Price MovementUnits of NextEra Energy Partners have returned 49%, outperforming the industry’s increase of 14.6% in the last one year.This outperformance could be attributed to the company’s growing renewable portfolio which has boosted its performance.Zacks RankNextEra Energy Partners carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Such initiatives are expected to enable the company achieve $50 million of incremental annual benefits in 2017 and to reach its annual savings target by 2020.Further, to curb carbon emission, AES Corp.’s generation mix includes a large portion of gas and renewables. In this line, AES Corp. is on track with its 1,384 MW Southland Repowering Project in California and has completed the $2 billion non-recourse financing for the project this June. The project is expected to initiate following this financing, in line with management’s expectation.AES Corp. has a 1,320 MW OPGC 2 project in India, which is making steady progress on construction. The project is expected to come online by the end of 2018.These projects are expected to be a key contributor to the company’s earnings and cash flow growth through 2020.On the flip side, the company’s results  has been reflecting lower margins owing to deferred fuel cost following the rate case of IPL in 2016, as well as lower regulated ESP rates at DPL.This might have lead the company to underperform its broader market. Evidently, AES Corp.’s share price has lost 13.9% in the last one year, against its broader industry's gain of 4.8%. The company also faces tough competition from its peers like Ameren Corporation (AEE  -  Free Report), CenterPoint Energy, Inc.

252,DUK,"FirstEnergy Corp.'s (FE  -  Free Report) Ohio utilities recently proposed a redesigning and modernization plan with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) for reducing the frequency and duration of power outages.The initiative targets to invest $450 million investment in three years, to create a stronger distribution system for its customers at Ohio Edison, Cleveland Electric Illuminating and Toledo Edison subsidiaries.Details of the ProposalThe project will encompass circuit ties, reconductoring, reclosers and data acquisition systems. These will prevent power outages, create multiple paths for better power flow to customers and increase distribution line's ability to withstand adverse weather conditions. Additionally, these are projected to restore power faster at times of outages. The proposed projects will also redesign the distribution lines across the company’s services areas in Ohio.Notably, FirstEnergy anticipates the project to reduce outages by approximately 30% or more, on average. It is also projected to speed up restoration time for power lines by approximately 25%.Estimated cost of this project will constitute about 2% of the typical residential customer's monthly bill.FirstEnergy’s Modernization DriveFirstEnergy has been taking steps to upgrade and replace its existing power lines, whenever necessary, since 2014. Further, it has incorporated new, smart technology into the grid and made substations upgrades; to serve customers more efficiently. In line with this, the company has made an investment plan worth almost $1 billion in 2017 and $4.2-$5.8 billion over 2017-2021, under its ambitious “Energizing the Future” initiative. Notably this initiative aims at upgrading and expanding its regulated transmission capabilities.For ensuring better reliable services, the company recently conducted maintenance work across its service areas. Toward this, its subsidiaries concluded inspection and maintenance services in all six states where it operates in the month of November. (Read more: FirstEnergy Completes Maintenance Work Ahead of Winter)Currently, FirstEnergy serves approximately 1 million customers in northeast and north central Ohio. Surely, the modernization drive across FirstEnergy’s Ohio service area is anticipated to improve the quality of services availed by its customers.Considering the fact that transmission lines and grid systems are susceptible to damages, at times due to uncertain weather conditions, we may expect other utilities like NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report), American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) to carry out similar modernization and redesigning initiatives to ensure maintenance and reliability of their services.Price MovementShares of FirstEnergy have returned 14.6% outperforming the industry’s growth of 4.6% in the last six months.This has been driven by the company’s continued focus on upgrading transmission lines and modernizing efforts in its distribution network, through solid investments.

253,DUK,"Canadian Solar Inc.’s (CSIQ  -  Free Report) wholly owned subsidiary, Recurrent Energy closed the sale of 99% stake in the partnership that owns the Class B membership interest in the 92 megawatt-peaks (MWp) (71 MWac) IS-42 solar project to Falck Renewables S.p.A.Details of the SaleFalck Renewables indirectly acquired the stake in the solar project through its wholly-owned subsidiary Falck Renewables IS 42 LLC. The transaction was done in an all-cash outlay of approximately $43 million.Located in North Carolina, the project started operating commercially at the end of September 2017. Currently, the solar plant provides electricity to Progress Energy, a subsidiary of Duke Energy Corp. (DUK  -  Free Report).While Recurrent Energy is providing asset management services to the project, DEPCOM Power acted as the operations and maintenance contractor, besides offering engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) services to the project.According to Dr. Shawn Qu, chairman and chief executive officer of Canadian Solar, the IS-42 is Recurrent Energy's first solar project in the North Carolina, which has allowed the company to expand its footprint in the United States.Canadian Solar’s Prospect in United StatesIn the United States, Canadian Solar’s portfolio stands at 900 MW of operating plants at the end of September 2017. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), solar consumption in the country is expected to surge 108.2% to 0.887 quadrillion British thermal unit in 2018 from the 2015 levels.Moreover, the EIA observes that even if the Trump administration abolishes the Clean Power Plan, the renewable space will continue to grow in the United States albeit at a slower rate. In fact, EIA projects U.S. renewable generation capacity to grow by an average of 1.9% per year between 2017 and 2050.Additionally, the EIA expects utility-scale solar capacity to increase to 31 GW at the end of 2018 compared with 22 GW in 2016. All these developments indicate better growth prospects for Canadian Solar in the United States.Canadian Solar’s International ProjectsAlternative energy sources have been the primary target of utility service providers due to rising concerns regarding the consumption of fossil fuel and the subsequent carbon emission. To make most of the situation, each day more utilities are shifting their focus to generation of alternative energy, in particular solar energy.Per a report from GTM Research, the global solar market will hit 85 GW in 2017, nearly doubling the installed capacity of 2014. As a result, solar companies like Canadian Solar have started enhancing its overseas base, in other parts of the globe, apart from America.While the latest deal with Falck Renewables is one such instance, in the same line of strategy, Canadian Solar secured three solar power projects during Mexico’s third Long-term Auction for renewables held on Nov 15. Totaling 367 megawatt-peaks (MWp), these power projects will be developed and build in the Mexican cities of Aguascalientes, Hermosillo and Obregón.Likewise, in October, the company announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary has entered into a joint venture (JV) with a few subsidiaries of Menora Mivtachim Holdings Ltd. — one of Israel's five largest insurance and finance groups. The JV aims to invest in the development, financing, construction and ownership of solar power projects in Israel.Price MovementCanadian Solar has underperformed the industry in a year. The stock has rallied 34.5% compared with the industry’s gain of 43.4%. This lackluster performance might have been due to the market dislocation that the company is already experiencing with no improvement expected in near term.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCanadian Solar carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the solar space include SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (SEDG  -  Free Report) and SunPower Corporation (SPWR  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

254,DUK,"Georgia’s regulatory staff has raised questions regarding The Southern Company’s (SO  -  Free Report) Vogtle Project.They are of the opinion that the project is getting overtly expensive and should be called off unless Southern Company and Georgia Power bear part of the ballooning cost. Georgia Power is of the belief that customers should bear the additional cost of the project. This is in sharp contrast with the views of the regulatory staff who believe that such inflated cost would be a burden on customers. They believe that once the project is completed ratepayers are likely to bear higher costs with reduced benefits and hence want to pull the plug on the project.If the project gets scrapped, it will be a huge blow to the nuclear industry of America. In August, South Carolina Electric & Gas — subsidiary of SCANA Corporation (SCG  -  Free Report) — terminated the construction of $18-billion VC Summer nuclear project in South Carolina. Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) also announced the abandonment of Lee III Nuclear Generating Station in South Carolina.The Vogtle nuclear reactors have been grappling with cost overruns and scheduling delays since the commencement of the construction. The bankruptcy of Westinghouse — the major construction contractor of the two nuclear reactors of the plant — aggravated the costs further and led to more delays. Since then a cloud of uncertainty has been hovering over the beleaguered plant. The project is already running three years behind schedule and is over budget by more than $10 billion and is likely to go up to $20 billion by 2022.Georgia Power filed a recommendation with the Public Service Commission (PSC) on Aug 31 to pursue the construction of two nuclear reactors at Vogtle units 3 and 4.  The PSC is soon to complete the review process and take a final call regarding the expansion of the Vogtle project in February 2018.Moody’s Investors Service, believes that the company’s decision to continue with the project will increase the credit risk. The rating agency believes that the project which has been missing milestone dates and suffering from poor productivity rates is likely to suffer from more delays and ballooning costs. The decision, which is likely to hurt the financials of the company, may also affect its negotiations over the acquisition of South Carolina's state-owned electric utility, Santee Cooper.Southern Company is one of the largest generators of electricity in the nation.

255,DUK,"The third-quarter earnings season has crossed the half way mark. Total earnings for the 327 S&P members that have already released results are up 7.8% year over year on 6.5% higher revenues, with 74.9% beating earnings and 65.7% topping revenue estimates.Combining the results of the 372 S&P 500 members with the index’s members yet to report, we expect total third-quarter earnings to be up 5.6% year over year on 5.5% higher revenues.Amid this backdrop, let us focus on Zacks Utilities sector this earnings season. Earnings from the utility space were expected to drop 3.8% on 1.1% lower revenues as of November 1. Notably, 10 out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline. Read more details in the weekly Earnings Outlook.Notably, capital intensive utilities were impacted by increased interest rates in March and June, this year. In addition, the utilities operating in Texas and Florida were severely hurt by the hurricanes (Harvey and Irma).With the rising interest rates, the stable, regular dividend payer utilities will face strong competition from bonds as these provide higher returns, consequently making them a more attractive option for investors.Therefore, to maintain their performance level, these utilities are resorting to cost savings initiatives, modernizing transmission and distribution lines, upgrading infrastructure and focusing more on renewable energy to generate electricity with lower emission.  Let us take a sneak peek at the four utility stocks scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 3.Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) witnessed a negative earnings surprise of 0.98% in the previous quarter.Last month, Hurricane Irma led to catastrophic losses in Florida. As a result, Duke Energy’s electrical system suffered significant damages in Hardee and Highlands County. The company took several initiatives to address these issues and initiated repair work, which included rebuilding this system. These must have increased the third-quarter expenses of Duke Energy, which we believe might weigh down on its bottom-line.For the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects a decline of 7.8% year over year. The same for sales are anticipated to drop 1.1% to $6.75 billion.According to our proven model, stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) have higher chances of beating estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Our proven model does not show that Duke Energy is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of -0.78% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.55, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56. Moreover, it carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). (Read more: Will Irma's Impact Dent Duke Energy Q3 Earnings?).As it is we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Duke Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Duke Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Duke Energy Corporation QuoteAmeren Corporation (AEE  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14.49% in the last quarter.In soon-to-be reported quarter, Ameren’s earnings are expected to be affected by a non-cash estimated charge of 6 cents per share, primarily at the parent company. Again, owing to the change in timing of interim period revenue recognition in Ameren Illinois, the bottom line will decrease by approximately 23 cents per share.In this regard, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ameren’s third-quarter earnings reflects 9.9% decline.Our proven model does not show that Ameren is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.31. Moreover, it carries a Zacks Rank #4. (Read more: Is Ameren Likely to Disappoint This Earnings Season?).Ameren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Ameren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Ameren Corporation QuoteCenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report) pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 38.10% in the second quarter.In the third quarter, Hurricane Harvey has severely hit the city of Houston, TX – which is the primary service region of CenterPoint. Though the company didn’t announce any significant damage caused to its power plants, it is expected that the effect of the storm might weigh down on its profitability in the quarter.On the brighter note, the unemployment rate in CenterPoint Energy’s service territories is better than the national average. An improving economy is likely to boost future utility demand in the state, thereby improving the company’s performance.For the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents for third-quarter earnings projects a decline of 1%. Meanwhile, the same for revenues of $2.02 billion hints at an improvement of almost 6.7% on a year-over-year basis.Our proven model does not show that CenterPoint Energy is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of -0.25% and carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

QuotePinnacle West Capital Corporation (PNW  -  Free Report) pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 28.45% in the previous quarter.In August, Arizona Corporation Commission approved the company’s first rate review agreement in five years. This decision is likely to act as a strong catalyst for the company’s growth, since it will boost Pinnacle West’s Arizona Public Service unit’s revenues by an estimated 3.3%. Notably the new rates, effective from Aug 19, will increase the residential bill by approximately 4.5% or about $6 per month. We may expect the rate increase to get reflected in improved revenues of APS in the to-be-reported quarter.Meanwhile, the company projects to witness extended outages at its Four Corners power plant, in the second half of this year for the installation of pollution control equipment. This is expected to push up its operating and maintenance cost for third and fourth quarters of 2017, which in turn may dent the bottom line for coming quarters.Our proven model does not show that Pinnacle West is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of -0.07% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.  (Read more: What’s in the Cards for Pinnacle West in Q3 Earnings?).Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Pinnacle West Capital Corporation QuoteZacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

256,DUK,"Electric services provider, Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report), has laid down a request for rate increase with the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC). If the requested new rates are approved by the NCUC, it will come in to effect spring 2018.Other DetailsThis recent filing would reflect an overall 2.5% increase annually, as Duke Energy Carolinas' last rate adjustment request in North Carolina was way back in 2013. Once approved by the state regulators, revenues are expected to increase by $647 million, for an overall average rate increase across customer groups by 13.6%. The average rate increase will be 16.7% for residential and 10.9% rate increase for commercial and industrial customers.Reason for Filing- Duke Energy’s TakeThe current rate request filing by the company is in sync with its aim of modernizing power plants, generating cleaner electricity, by responsibly managing coal ash and improving reliability. This, in turn is likely to increase value for customers and shareholders for a smarter energy future.Energy saving initiatives such as implementation of modern technologies at its facilities to expand scale of operations is likely to bode well, going forward. Notably, the company’s robust five-year capital plan and current plans of investing about $37 billion in growth projects over the 2017-2021 time frame support this notion.Our ViewThe solar energy market in the United States has evolved massively in the past few years. In fact, Duke Energy Carolinas has retired half of its older, less-efficient coal plants which lack state-of-the-art emission controls and had them replaced with cleaner, natural gas-fueled plants. The utility has also supported the sustainable growth of solar energy, helping move North Carolina to second in the nation for overall solar power.We appreciate the company’s efforts of expanding its scale of operations, pursuing additional generation projects and introducing newer renewable projects to meet growing demands for renewable energy in the dynamic environment.Another company that is currently diversifying its generation portfolio with emphasis on renewable sources is Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report). This utility is currently planning to invest about $4.2 billion in renewables over the next five years. The company expects to bring 3,400 megawatts of renewable generation online by 2020.Price MovementDuke Energy has outperformed industry in the last 12 months. The company’s shares gained 13.2% compared with the industry’s increase of 11.2%.Duke Energy’s focus on core domestic regulated assets and highly-contracted renewable business are going to drive performance over the long term.Zacks RankDuke Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

257,DUK,"Energy infrastructure provider The Williams Companies, Inc.’s (WMB  -  Free Report) Constitution Pipeline project recently suffered a major setback when the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals reiterated New York Department of Environmental Conservation’s (DEC) decision to stall the pipeline. The court’s ruling came as a blow to pipeline developers’ endeavors to transport additional natural gas to New England, which relies heavily on pipeline imports from Canada and overseas.The project is jointly owned by William Companies, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), WGL Holdings, Inc.  and Piedmont Natural Gas Company which was acquired by Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) last year. The 121 mile natural gas pipeline, which runs from Pennsylvania to Schoharie County, had been planned to transport natural gas from the Marcellus shale to customers in the North East. The $750 million project has the capacity to transport 650,000 dekatherms of gas each day. The pipeline aimed to address the problems of transportation infrastructure in the Northeast region and speed up shipments from the prolific Marcellus and Utica basins.The project was expected to become operational in 2015, but got delayed due to lengthy review process, pushing the in-service date to late 2016. The project received the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) approval in early 2016. However, DEC had rejected water quality permit to the pipeline in 2016 owing to its possibility of impacting the ecology and climate adversely.  DEC claimed that the owners of the project and the FERC did not analyze the environmental impacts of the project properly and that the pipeline will possibly impact over 250 streams.Concurrently, the pipeline owners filed a lawsuit challenging DEC’s decision. FERC granted the developers additional two years for a thorough review and completion. The $750 million pipeline project had also drawn much censure from various activists and environmental groups as they were of the opinion that the project will have negative impact on public health and environment.Nevertheless, the owners of the pipeline still were optimistic about their five-year project that received President Trump’s support and challenged DEC’s decision. However, the court dismissed the lawsuit.The decision reverses FERC’s approval received by the project. Also the company has been directed to reassess the environmental impacts of the pipeline.Oklahoma-based Williams Companies presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

259,DUK,"With the Q3 earnings season kicking off, Utility companies are preparing to release their numbers in the next couple of weeks. Notably, the Zacks Utility sector gained 3% in the third quarter.Factors Boosting the UtilitiesA major factor which boosts the utility sector is that there exists no substitute for the energy-related services rendered by the utilities. The endless demand for electricity and utility services will never cease to exist, thereby conferring a consistent flow of revenue to these companies. Thus utilities are considered as a safe haven.Utilities generate more or less stable earnings unless any sudden event impacts their operations adversely. This regulated nature of operations provide them stability and in turn they reward their shareholders with steady dividend rates.Moreover, the predominant domestic focus shields utilities from foreign currency translation issues. Also the major utility providers make frequent modernizations of their grid system and distribution networks to offer seamless flow of electricity to customers. In fact, it is these modernization initiatives that saved the grid systems from getting severely damaged from the widespread hurricane rampage that hit the coastal U.S. in the last couple of months.Further, stringent emission regulations implemented by Obama prompted utilities to take steps to lower emission levels. Although it is a favorable development from the environmental point of view, utilities had to make huge investments to ease the transition to renewables.However, President Trump’s recent initiative to repeal the Clean Power Plan on economic growth grounds is expected to give a temporary breather to utilities that produce major part of their electricity from coal.On the other hand, realizing the need for clean energy a number of major utility providers like NextEra Energy and Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) have already taken initiatives to produce electricity from natural gas and alternative sources. Considering the fact that renewable energy is the ultimate future of energy resources, these initiatives will boost the growth of alternative-energy utilities, in the long run.We believe, over time, a constructive utility-rate environment and increase in electricity production from natural gas and renewable sources will enable utilities to efficiently serve a larger customer base.Earnings Expectations for UtilitiesPer our Earnings Trend, as of Oct 11, Q3 earnings for the Utility sector is expected to be down 2.9%, while sales for the same is estimated to be up by 1.5%. Operations of major utilities like NextEra, Duke Energy and American Electric Power Corporation (AEP  -  Free Report) that have extensive business in the hurricane-affected states of Texas and Florida were affected adversely. Although a minor section of their grid system got damaged severely, they were compelled to stall electricity distribution. These outages are expected to weigh on their Q3 earnings, which in turn may have dragged down this sector’s overall earnings expectation for the quarter.Nevertheless, going ahead, in 2017, this sector is expected to exhibit an earnings improvement of 2.1% and sales growth of 4.4%. This indicates an improvement in the results of these stocks ahead of Q3.How to Identify Potential Winners Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist. One way to do it is by picking stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement.

260,DUK,"FirstEnergy Corporation’s (FE  -  Free Report) subsidiary Metropolitan Edison Company (Met-Ed) announced that it has successfully completed the upgradation of project equipment worth $3 million at a substation in Reading, PA. The equipment upgrade will enable the company to efficiently meet the increasing electrical demands of 2,500 customers in the Glenside area of the city going forward.Details of UpgradesPer the details, the upgradation primarily included the replacement of an old transformer and other equipment built back in 1940. The project upgradation was designed keeping in view the local electric system's capacity without expanding the substation's area or constructing additional power lines.Additionally, novel circuit breakers and relay devices that have been introduced following the revamp will protect equipment by interrupting the flow of electricity against tree-related outages and lightning strikes. Going ahead, the company's dispatchers will monitor conditions at the substation closely to help reduce the duration of outages, a feature that was absent during the time the substation was originally built.Other ProjectsFirstEnergy’s modernization drive has been boosting the company’s service reliability and leading to higher customer retention. To improve the service reliability for its customers in the Penelec and Met-Ed service territories, the company has planned to invest nearly $600 million in transmission projects through 2018. Previously, the company announcedto rebuild and modernize an electric transmission line to enhance service reliability in the Western Pennsylvania region. (Read more: FirstEnergy to Rebuild Transmission Line in Pennsylvania)Additionally, FirstEnergy’s ambitious “Energizing the Future” plan is also aimed at upgrading and expanding its regulated transmission capabilities. Under this initiative, the company is poised to invest nearly $1 billion in 2017 and $4.2-$5.8 billion over the 2017-2021 time period.Our ViewFirstEnergy’s Met-Ed unit currently serves approximately 560,000 customers in 15 Pennsylvania counties. The aforementioned upgradation project is a testament of the company’s focus to meet the growing electrical demands in the Glenside area of Reading.We believe that FirstEnergy’s step toward enhancing service reliability through electrical upgradation and renewing work will aid the company to position itself as a competitive utility operator for sustained customer service-oriented growth. Toward this, we anticipate the company and its subsidiaries alike to deliver safe and reliable electric services along with meeting the growing electrical needs of customers over the times to come.Utility is a regulated, yet highly competitive market. Upgrading and modernizing the existing infrastructure is important for giving better service to the customers. Consequently, apart from FirstEnergy other utility firms like NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report), American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) are also taking steps to strengthen existing and replacing old infrastructure to provide better-quality services to customers.Price MovementShares of FirstEnergy have returned 8.3%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 5.2% in the last three months.FirstEnergy’s broadening regulated structure and growing transmission lines are supporting its performance. In addition the initiatives like Energizing the Future will support and further strengthen its operation resulting in better earnings.Zacks RankFirstEnergy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.5 Trades Could Profit """"Big-League"""" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>

261,DUK,"Edison International (EIX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings results on May 1, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 18.28%. Moreover, it has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 12.35%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderIn December 2017, South California Edison (SCE), a subsidiary of Edison International, secured wildfire insurance worth $300 million for 2018 and requested the California Public Utility Commission (“CPUC”) to approve recovery of the associated premium worth approximately $121 million. Per the company, this insurance cost might drag its 2018 earnings per share by 29 cents, until the CPUC addresses this request. Moreover, Edison International expects to incur additional insurance costs during the current year, in excess of what the company had requested in its general rate case (GRC).Consequently, these additional costs are expected to partially weigh on Edison International’s earnings in the quarter to be reported. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter earnings reflects an 18.2% decline year over year.On the flip side, moderate or worse drought conditions extended across southern California at the onset of the first quarter while the state as a whole witnessed a dry winter with temperatures dropping below normal levels. This, in turn, is anticipated to increase household consumption of electricity and thereby boost Edison International’s first-quarter revenues.However, considering the impact of the latest tax reform, which reduced the corporate tax rate substantially, the company has lately updated its GRC that requested a 2018 revenue requirement of $5.5 billion. This reflects a $106 million decrease from the 2017 revenue requirement.Therefore, the positive impact of high electricity demand on the company’s top line might get neutralized by the aforementioned revenue requirement reductions. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Edison International’s first-quarter revenues of $2.46 billion represents a drop of 0.2%.Edison International Price and EPS Surprise Edison International Price and EPS Surprise | Edison International QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Edison International is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

264,DUK,"Duke Energy Corp. (DUK  -  Free Report) will offer a notable $38 million in annual tax savings on electric and natural gas bills for its customers in Ohio and Kentucky, beginning from April and May 2018. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that came into effect on Jan 1, 2018, clearly led to this entire bill reduction.Details of Projected Tax SavingsIn particular, Duke Energy’s customers, residing in Ohio, would save approximately $20 million in annual tax on their electric bills. Beyond this tax saving proposition, the company’s Ohio-based unit has also proposed state regulators for lowering natural gas bills by about $3 million, commencing from May.Duke Energy also proposed tax savings for Kentucky-based customers as the state regulators reviewed its proposal, recommending an allocation of around $15 million of tax act benefits.Our ViewThe latest tax reform has resulted in lower accrued tax expenses for the utilities and lately, various companies are passing on this benefit to the customers by reducing utility rates and bills. Being no exception, Duke Energy has also followed the same path and must have reduced its electricity as well as natural gas rates, which in turn has allowed it to reward the customers with tax savings.Notably, this rate reduction is in line with the company’s earlier-made recommendation, during the fourth-quarter earnings call, of using the lower tax rates to reduce utility rates for the customers in the near-term as well as aid in offsetting future rate increases.We have witnessed some other utilities in the recent past, directing the federal tax savings to reduce bills for the customers. Notably, utilities, including the likes of NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report), AVANGRID (AGR  -  Free Report) and WGL Holdings , have expressed intention to pass on tax savings benefits to customers.Moreover, the recent tax reform will enable Duke Energy to increase the utility rate base, which occurs due to low tax rates and the elimination of bonus depreciation, resulting in lower deferred taxes, which in turn increases rate base. As a result, the company is projected to witness a higher rate base growth along with an increase in the company's earnings growth.Price MovementDuke Energy has edged down 5.9% in the last 12 months compared with the broader industry’s decline of 47.3%. The underperformance may have been caused by the potential volatility in market prices of fuel, electricity and other renewable energy commodities that could further create operational risks for the company.Zacks Rank & Key PicksDuke Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

265,DUK,"Electric utility firm Southern Company’s (SO  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Georgia Power, recently announced plans to move ahead with the construction of its much talked about Vogtle Plant in Georgia after completing the full-scale schedule and cost-to-complete analysis of the project.  On Aug 31, Georgia Power filed a recommendation with the Public Service Commission (PSC) to pursue the construction of two nuclear reactors at Vogtle units 3 and 4.  The PSC is soon to complete the review process and take a final call regarding the expansion of the Vogtle project.The Vogtle nuclear reactors have been grappling with cost overruns and scheduling delays since the commencement of the construction. Further, the bankruptcy of Westinghouse, the major construction contractor of the two nuclear reactors of the plant, aggravated the costs further and led to more delays. Since then a cloud of uncertainty is hovering over the beleaguered plant. The project is already running three years behind schedule and is over budget by more than $10 billion. In June, Westinghouse’s parent company Toshiba Corporation agreed to provide a financial assistance of $3.68 billion for the development of two nuclear reactors. Also the owners of the project have already been granted $8.3 billion loan guarantees by the Department of Energy.Meanwhile, Georgia Power had been assessing the various feasible alternatives including the completion of one or both the reactors, termination of the project or switching to a different power source.Southern Company believes that the plant will make the United States nuclear competitive, helping the nation catch up with the likes of Russia and China. Many nuclear proponents have also supported the company’s commitment toward nuclear power with zero emissions, finding it more reliable than solar and wind energy. With the decision to continue with the project, Vogtle plant in Georgia will be the only project which is under construction in the United States.Last month, South Carolina Electric & Gas — subsidiary of SCANA Corporation (SCG  -  Free Report) — terminated the construction of $18 billion VC Summer nuclear project in South Carolina. On Aug 25, Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) announced the abandonment of Lee III Nuclear Generating Station in South Carolina.However, the rating agency, Moody’s Investors Service, believes that the company’s decision to continue with the project will increase the credit risk. Moody’s believes that the project which has been missing milestone dates and suffering from poor productivity rates is likely to suffer from more delays and ballooning costs. The decision which is likely to hurt the financials of the company, may also affect its negotiations over the acquisition of South Carolina's state-owned electric utility, Santee Cooper.Zacks Rank and Key Pick Southern Company is one of the largest and best-managed electric utility holding companies in the United States. The firm dominates the power business across the southeastern region. Southern Company has lost 2.5% of its value year to date against 9.3% growth of its industry.However, the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 0.86% in the trailing four quarters.Southern Company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Atlantica Yield plc  is one of the better-ranked players in the energy space sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

267,DUK,"With Hurricane Harvey’s devastation still fresh in our minds, another catastrophic tropical storm — Hurricane Irma — hit the shores of Southern U.S., this time affecting the city of Florida in its wake. Although Irma hit the coast of Florida as a Category 4 Hurricane on Sep 10, it has now been downgraded to a tropical storm. However, the damages inflicted by the storm are colossal.As far as the Utilities are concerned, more than 6.2 million Floridians were affected by blackouts, as the companies cut power on grounds of safety. Works pertaining to power restoration have already been initiated by the utility providers but the pace of the same remains a laggard owing to torrential rainfall and subsequent flooding. This in turn is likely to impact few utilities, particularly those supplying power in areas of heavy rainfall like Jacksonville.Economic Impact of Harvey & IrmaAccording to BBC News, analysts initially estimated that the United States will bear an economic cost of $300 billion from Irma alone. However, post hitting Florida, the storm lost intensity driving down loss estimates.Currently, credit rating firm Moody's analysts estimate that Harvey and Irma will lead to around $150-$200 billion loss in the United States and an additional $20-$30 billion economic expenses owing to disruption services. This in turn, forced the firm to downgrade the nation’s Q3 forecast for gross domestic product by half a point to 2.5%.Nevertheless, the fourth quarter is likely to witness improved growth, provided rebuilding efforts are successful.How Have Utilities Been Impacted?There is no denial of the fact that if Irma impacts the whole economy, the Utility sector will be unable to escape its wrath, at least in the near term. Notably, none of the major utilities in Texas, following Harvey, suffered any significant damage in their generation fleet or power generating system, thanks to advanced infrastructural development.   This time, we notice that utilities that have started vigorous restoration in the Irma affected areas have witnessed a positive movement in their share price. However, some utilities suffered mildly due to damaged grid systems as customers continue to face power outages. Nevertheless, the overall sector is expected to not to suffer much following such hurricanes, in the long term. This is due to the sector’s significant investments toward improving the grid system and transmission and distribution lines, in recent years. In particular, many overhead transmission lines have been changed to undergrounds so they don’t come in the path of such storms.Here we have discussed a handful of primary utility providers in Florida and have tried to ascertain whether they have successfully managed following Irma’s rampage in the state.GainerNextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report): NextEra Energy is engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electric energy. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Notably, by Sep 12, Florida Power & Light Co. (FPL), a subsidiary of NextEra Energy had restored power to 2.3 million customers, which was 40% of those affected across Florida. The company announced that customers on the state's east coast can expect power to be restored by about Sept 17. Moreover, its system upgrades have allowed FPL to automatically reroute power and address about 1.5 million outages.Shares of this company inched up 0.6% following Irma’s havoc.LosersDuke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report): Duke Energy is a diversified energy company with a wide portfolio of domestic and international, natural gas and electric and regulated and unregulated businesses which supply, deliver and process energy. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Notably, by Sep 12, the company restored power to only 0.4 million consumers, out of the approximately 1 million customers. It also reported that its electrical system has suffered significant damage in Hardee and Highlands County, as a result of which power restoration will take time.Shares of this company dipped 0.5% following Irma.Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report): Southern Company’s operations include wholesale electricity generation and natural gas services, retail energy services and natural gas storage operations. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.The company’s CEO and chairman Thomas Fanning has expressed concerns regarding power restoration in Florida as heavy wind and rainfall have destroyed the state's infrastructure. He revealed that it will take weeks for restoration. In Georgia, almost 1 million of the company’s customers faced power outage.Shares of this company dropped 1.3% post Irma.Valuation Signals More Upside in UtilitiesA valuation analysis of the Utility sector reveals that the stocks are not that expensive at this point, thereby giving room for further upside, in future. The sector currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 10.8, which is much lower than the high end of 11.6 during the period. Additionally, the reading compares favorably with the market at large, as the current EV/EBITDA for the S&P 500 is at 10.9. The sector’s favorable positioning compared to the overall market certainly signals more upside as well.Irma is expected to hamper the third quarter earnings of the sector as the storm has severely affected the infrastructure of the state. Nevertheless, positive valuation metrics hint at strong growth prospects for the utilities in the future, once the effect of Irma wears out.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

268,DUK,"Hurricane Irma, which is now a Category 4 storm, is making its way toward the Sunshine State Florida and the Southeast United States after wrecking Caribbean Islands. The storm, one of the strongest Atlantic Ocean hurricanes ever recorded, is expected to hit the United States this weekend.Hurricane Irma might lose some of its intensity when it hits Florida but will still have enough strength to cause major damages. The administration and the utilities are preparing themselves to deal with these extreme weather conditions.Lessons Learned from Hurricane WilmaFlorida is no stranger to devastating hurricanes and extreme weather. Hurricane Wilma hit Florida in October 2005 and resulted in mass scale power outages. Overall damages were valued in excess of $20 billion. People were without power for weeks as thousands of wooden power poles were uprooted by the storm.The utilities operating in the region have learned a difficult lesson from Wilma and worked to strengthen the infrastructure to counter natural calamities in the future. Utilities like Duke Energy Corp. and NextEra Energy have invested billions of dollars to strengthen their operations.Florida Public Service Commission, post the Wilma devastation, had directed utilities to fortify infrastructure and provide power to customers during natural disasters.Utilities Showed Resilience Against Hurricane HarveyAccording to Electric Reliability Council of Texas’ report, none of the major utilities in this area have suffered any notable damages in their generation fleet or power generating system, thanks to the advanced infrastructural development.Florida Utilities Ready to Face IrmaAs Irma might cause massive damages to the utility infrastructure, Utility workers, who worked tirelessly to keep the utility service running in Texas after Hurricane Harvey, are gradually moving toward Florida.Stocks to Bet onDuke Energy (DUK  -  Free Report): Duke Energy has regulated utility operation in Florida and has invested more than $5 billion since 2004 to strengthen its power delivery system in the Southeast.  The company has been preparing for the storm by strengthening its distribution lines, vegetation management and automation of the grid.Duke Energy has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereDuke Energy's shares have lost 0.1% over the last three days versus 0.3% gain of the industry it belongs to.NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report): NextEra Energy provides retail and wholesale electricity services to approximately 4.9 million customers in eastern and southern Florida through its subsidiary Florida Power & Light Company (FPL). It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The company is ready to shut down its four nuclear reactors as a precautionary measure as the storm approaches. The spokesperson of FPL said that the company has nearly 15,000 crew members to help in restoration of power in Florida. Since 2006, FPL has invested nearly $3 billion to strengthen its electricity transmission and distribution capabilities in the state.NextEra shares lost have 0.5% over the last three days versus 0.3% gain of the industry it belongs to.Our TakeAs the old saying goes, “Nature Always has the Last Laugh.” However, through the technological advancements we now have the ability to correctly predict the intensity of the storm and where it is going to hit. This gives us the chance to prepare well ahead of time.  Every storm is unique and destruction caused by Hurricane Harvey is a stark reminder what nature can do to us.Florida has seen ample investment in solar energy from Duke Energy, NextEra Energy and Tampa Electric. The solar panels are built to survive in harsh conditions, but will they be able to survive in Hurricane Irma’s 150+ mph strong winds?Hurricanes likes these are a big threat to Florida’s plan of adding more green energy in its system. It could put to test the investments made in Florida electricity infrastructure over the last decade. We need to wait and see whether the power infrastructure is capable of holding its ground during Irma’s onslaught and the impact of Hurricane Jose, a Category 3 storm currently following the path of Irma.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone! It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

271,DUK,"Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report) announced that it has filed a stipulation with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to invest in clean energy in rural Colorado. The filed stipulation is a broad collaboration between Xcel Energy and 14 other diverse groups.According to the filing, Xcel Energy seeks permission from CPUC to invest approximately $2.5 billion in rural Colorado, to increase its clean energy portfolio. The company has vouched that the approval will not increase customers’ bill.The Colorado Energy PlanXcel Energy stated that their aim is to provide low-cost power and increase the use of cleaner energy in its service area. If approved, the proposal will increase the company’s renewable energy portfolio to 55% by 2026. It will also be very effective in enabling customers to save money and reduce carbon emission by almost 60% by 2026 as compared with 2005 level. As of now, Xcel Energy has lowered its emission level by 30% from 2005 levels and is on track to lower it by 45% through 2021. This proposal may also add up to 1,000 megawatts (MW) of wind, 700 MW of solar and 700 MW of natural gas and storage to the company’s portfolio on completion.The company has also asked the commission to consider the early retirement of two 660 MW of coal generation units in southern Colorado. Xcel Energy is currently diversifying its generation portfolio with emphasis on renewable sources. To this end, it is planning to invest about $4.2 billion in wind assets over the next three years.Focus on Green Energy by Utility Service ProvidersXcel Energy is not the only company undertaking additional measures to reduce carbon emission by reducing coal usage and increasing use of renewable energy, even when President Trump is actively promoting the usage of coal, to revive the industry.NextEra Energy's (NEE  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Florida Power & Light Company (FPL), has bought out existing contracts with two independent coal-fired power plants with the goal of shutting down both plants, thereby saving hundreds of millions of dollars for customers and reducing green house gas emission.Another utility giant who is investing heavily in clean power is Duke Energy (DUK  -  Free Report). The company’s five-year plan includes investment of $3.3 billion in highly-efficient natural gas-fired combined-cycle plants. The company has brought down emission level by almost 30% compared to the 2005, by retiring coal plants and bringing on more natural gas and renewable.With clean energy as the ultimate future, such initiatives adopted by utilities like Xcel Energy will surely help them to capture increased shares in the renewable energy market, which boasts a multi-billion dollar opportunity.Price MovementShares of Xcel Energy have returned 20.1% in the last one year outperforming the industry’s growth of 7.8% in the same time period.Xcel Energy’s disciplined investments in infrastructure projects and focus on renewable expansion might have led to this outperformance.Zacks Ranks and Other Stock to ConsiderXcel Energy currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

272,DUK,"Dominion Energy (D  -  Free Report) announced that it will jointly develop another solar project for the University of Virginia (UVA), with a capacity to generate 15 megawatt (MW) green energy. The UVA Puller Solar facility will be constructed in a 120-acre area in Middlesex County.The solar project will be developed by Coronal Energy, and constructed and owned by Dominion Energy. The entire power produced from this solar project will be purchased by UVA under a 25-year power-purchase agreement.This project will be Dominion Energy’s second solar project for the UVA. Last year in December, Dominion entered into an agreement with the university to develop UVA Hollyfield Solar project, a 17 MW solar project. UVA will purchase the entire produce from the project under a similar 25-year power-purchase agreement.Dominion Energy’s solar projects will help UVA to achieve its target of reducing 25% greenhouse gas emission by 2025 from 2009 levels. The two new solar projects will provide 32 MW of clean energy and take care of 21% of the UVA’s electricity demand.Dominion to Add 500 MW Solar in VirginiaDominion Energy plans to add 500 MW of solar energy in Virginia and is well on its way to achieve its target. The new solar additions will increase its solar power generation capacity to nearly 421 MW in Virginia. The company aims to invest more than $800 million in the state by 2020.Earlier this month, the company acquired a 10 MW solar unit in Clarke County, VA, from the project's developer, an affiliate of Chicago-based Hecate Energy, LLC. The company also declared its intention to acquire another 20 MW solar farm, presently under construction in Northampton County, VA, from the same company, in the third quarter of 2017 (read more: Dominion Acquires Unit in Virginia, Set to Add 500 MW Solar).U.S. Solar IndustryThe current projections provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) indicate a steady growth of solar generation in the country.In 2016, the total utility-scale solar electricity generating capacity in the U.S. was 21 gigawatts (GW). Moving ahead, EIA expects solar capacity additions during the year to reach 29 GW and 32 GW by the end of 2017 and 2018, respectively.The extension of Solar Investment Tax Credit till 2021 will help in developing more utility scale solar projects in the U.S. despite the new administration’s decision to support coal industry and relax emission regulation.Given the positive forecasts from EIA, we expect utilities like Duke Energy (DUK  -  Free Report), which at present operates nearly 400 MW of solar assets, to keep on expanding their renewable portfolio.Price MovementShares of Dominion Energy have returned 1.8% in last six months compared with the industry’s gain of 5.9%.Even though Dominion Energy underperformed the industry, expansion of its electric transmission, natural gas facilities and midstream assets are strong positives.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderDominion Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the same space are Atlantica Yield PLC  and RWE AG (RWEOY  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Atlantica Yield is expected to report second-quarter results on Aug 10, 2017.

273,DUK,"FirstEnergy Corporation (FE  -  Free Report) announced that the agreement for the sale of competitive natural gas and hydroelectric generation assets to LS Power Equity Partners III, LP has been revised by both companies. Per the revised agreement, FirstEnergy’s subsidiaries, Allegheny Energy Supply Company, LLC, and Allegheny Generating Company, will sell 1,615 megawatts (MW) of assets located in Pennsylvania and Virginia to a subsidiary of LS Power Equity Partners III, LP for $825 million.According to the previous agreement that was signed in January 2017, FirstEnergy agreed to sell assets with 1,572 MW capacity for $925 million.Terms of the AgreementThe power stations which will be the part of the transaction are Springdale Generating Facility Units 1-5 (Springdale Township, PA), Chambersburg Generating Facility Units 12-13 (Guildford Township, PA), Gans Generating Facility Units 8-9 (Hunlock Creek, PA) and Hunlock Creek (Hunlock Creek, PA).Apart from these four facilities, the deal also includes a part of Allegheny Generating Company's ownership interest in the Bath County Hydro station and the indirect interest of Allegheny Energy Supply in a joint venture with Buchanan Generating Facility (Oakwood, VA).The agreement also states that all the 20 employees working at these power stations will retain their jobs with the new owner.Moving Away From Competitive GenerationThis step is a part of FirstEnergy’s earlier mentioned strategy to reduce merchant fleet generation so as to cushion itself from market volatilities. With the sale of these assets, the company will move a step closer toward its strategy of operating as a fully regulated utility company and exit from commodity-exposed generation.Once the entire transition is complete, the company’s owned or generating capacity will be approximately 15,337 MW from nuclear, coal, gas, hydro, wind and solar facilities. The company is aiming to transform into a regulated company by mid 2018.Growing Amid Steep CompetitionFirstEnergy’s modernization drive has given rise to its ambitious plan “Energizing the Future”. As a part of this plan, the company wants to upgrade and expand its regulated transmission capabilities. Under this initiative, the company is poised to invest nearly $1 billion in 2017 and $4.2-$5.8 billion over the 2017-2021 time period.The company revealed plans of investing over $600 million in transmission projects through 2018 in the company's Pennsylvania Electric Company (Penelec) and Metropolitan Edison (Met-Ed) service areas.

274,DUK,"We issued an updated research report on Entergy Corporation (ETR  -  Free Report) on Aug 29. Of late, Entergy is gradually shifting from being a hybrid to a pure-play utility.The company began this process by closing Vermont Yankee power plant in 2014. Going forward, it plans to shut down its Palisades power plant in October 2018 and its Pilgrim plant in May 2019. In April 2020 and 2021, the company plans to close Indian Point Units 2 and 3. The company aims to increase investments toward the modernization of grid buoyed by rising customer demand and favorable regulatory support.Of the recently made investments, in April 2017, the company signed a purchase and sale agreement with a subsidiary of Calpine Corporation. Per the deal, Calpine will construct the plant, which will consist of two natural gas-fired combustion turbine units with a total nominal capacity of approximately 360 MW. Once completed in 2021, Entergy will purchase the plant for $261 million.To diminish the risk and volatility in the EWC business, the company is gradually reducing its EWC footprint. In line with this, the EWC earned 10.2% less net income in second-quarter 2017 for the company compared to the prior-year quarter’s level.On the flip side, higher nuclear labor costs are hampering the company’s operational growth, which in turn is escalating its nuclear generation expense. Moreover, Entergy recently witnessed lower generation from its nuclear plants, primarily due to an increase in outage days and lower fuel expense which resulted from impairments.This might have lead the company to underperform its broader market. Evidently, Entergy’s share price has gained 2.8% in the last one year, compared to its broader industry's gain of 8%.The company also faces tough competition from its peers like Ameren Corporation (AEE  -  Free Report), CenterPoint Energy, Inc.

275,DUK,"Electric utility firm The Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report), together with other co-owners of the Vogtle Project, recently requested for additional federal loan guarantees, extending the $8.3 million loan guarantees already issued for the project. Georgia Power, subsidiary of Southern Company, is the chief owner of the project with a 45.7% interest. The other co-owners include Oglethorpe Power, MEAG Power and Dalton Utilities.Oglethorpe Power Corporation — second-largest stakeholder of the Vogtle project with a 30% interest — recently sought additional loan guarantee of $1.6 billion from the Department of Energy (DOE) to complete the construction of two nuclear reactors at its Vogtle power plant. The company already has a $3 billion loan guarantee from DOE out of which it has drawn $1.7 billion till now. The owners of the project have already been granted an $8.3 billion loan guarantees by the DOE comprising a loan guarantee of $6.5 billion to Georgia Power and Oglethorpe Power in 2014 and an additional support of $1.8 billion in 2015.Westinghouse was the major construction contractor and designer of the two nuclear reactors at Vogtle power plant. However, Westinghouse had filed for bankruptcy in March, raising concerns over the nuclear industry. Nevertheless, in June, Westinghouse’s parent company Toshiba Corporation had agreed to provide a financial assistance of $3.68 billion for the development of two nuclear reactors. The Vogtle nuclear reactors have been grappling with cost overruns and scheduling delays since the commencement of construction. The project is already running three years behind schedule and is over budget by more than $10 billion.A cloud of uncertainty is hovering over the beleaguered plant.
