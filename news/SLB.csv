1,SLB,"Are two heads really better than one? Does a cat have nine lives? And when it comes to finding CAN SLIM quality growth stocks, can a pair of bases by the same stock produce a superb breakout?People might disagree on the first two questions. But as for the third, the answer is an indisputable yes.The base-on-base pattern, which strings together two or more separate bases, appears frequently on the stock market landscape. Why?Sometimes a stock is ready to break out to new highs and does so, but the rally does not achieve a 20% gain because the greater market is taking a break or even going into a correction.When the market is shaky, stocks have a tougher time going higher. Most stocks follow the market's direction.So when the stock you have bought correctly and researched thoroughly did not produce the 20% profit that you had hoped for, despair not. Watch for a new base to develop on top of the earlier one. The new base's low can slip into the prior base, but ideally not by much.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSchlumberger (SLB), one of the largest drilling and well-development firms in the vast oil and gas industry, created a pair of saucer bases before breaking out and achieving a 25% rally in 2014.In the week ended Sept. 6, the Houston-based firm moved past an 85.12 entry on a superlong saucer with handle. The base was as long as an airport runway. (See it in its entirety on a weekly or monthly historical chart, as best seen in Marketsmith, IBD's advanced charting and stock screening service.)Schlumberger's fundamentals were heating up. In the second quarter of 2013, earnings per share rose 14%. Not amazing, but the company showed a long record of steady growth. It also marked the highest increase in four quarters. The stock rose for seven weeks in a row, up 11.5% to a 52-week high of 94.91 (1). Meanwhile, the S&P 500 staged four distinct pullbacks of 5% to 7% from May 2013 to February 2014. The declines were light, but they were enough to spark a new price correction in Schlumberger.The decline pushed Schlumberger all the way back to its previous 85.12 entry (2). In this situation, it's smart to exit the stock even with a tiny gain. A determined investor can always buy shares again.The time to buy arrived several months later. The stock molded another saucer pattern that could also be seen as a flat base. The base's decline was a miserly 10.5%. Schlumberger's March 24-25 breakout past a new 93.94 handle entry came in big volume. Notice in the above weekly chart that turnover that week heated up vs. the prior week, a good sign that the institutions were heavily buying shares.On July 1, Schlumberger hit a high of 118.76, up 26% and ripe for a great sell.Have there been any recent base-on-base breakouts that have made investors money? Sure. Check out Winnebago Industries (WGO), one of two big winners from IBD's Building-Mobile/Manufacturing & RV industry group. In June 2017, Winnebago didn't roll ahead by much after it cleared an oddly shaped three-month cup base with a 35 buy point. The week ended Dec. 23, 2016, in which shares reached as high as 39.30, looked like an outlier on the weekly chart.In about six weeks' worth of time, the small-cap company rose just 6% from the 35 proper entry.But in August, Winnebago formed a solid new five-week flat base that sat atop the deeper, wide and loose first base. Notice how tightly Winnebago traded as it fell no more than 10.9% from head to toe and found buyers during a multiweek test of the 10-week moving average. Volume was as dry as sun-baked dirt during the three down weeks within the base.In the week ended Sept. 8, Winnebago shifted the stock into higher gear, coasting past a 37.30 buy point (a dime above the base's high of 37.20) during a five-week win streak. Volume ballooned sharply above average in four of those five weeks.In the IBD Weekly print newspaper for the week of Sept. 4, 2017, the stock showed a 93 Composite Rating, a 94 EPS, 91 RS, A for SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on equity) and B for Accumulation/Distribution. Winnebago's Building sector ranked No. 5 out of 33 sectors in IBD's stock research tables. (You can check these ratings for any stock in IBD's database by going to IBD Stock Checkup.)By Dec. 20, Winnebago hit as high as 58.65, up 57%.(Editor's Note: A version of this column was first published in the Aug. 6, 2014, edition of IBD.

2,SLB,"EOG Resources (EOG) weathered a massive oil price drop a few years ago thanks to smart investments across multiple basins, first-mover advantage and loads of data.Now, the shale exploration and production company is one of the top performers in its sector as oil prices rebound.Ninety percent of EOG's production comes from its U.S. shale operations. But EOG has spread its resources throughout the Bakken Shale basin in the north-central U.S. and southern Canada, as well as the Eagle Ford and Permian basins in the Texas and New Mexico area. That diversity has been one key to EOG's success.""They have attractive portions across multiple basins,"" said Brian Youngberg, analyst at Edward Jones. ""Some of the other premier players, like Pioneer Natural (PXD), are more focused geographically. But EOG has a handful of positions they got into early, at a low cost.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEOG produced the equivalent of 609,000 barrels of oil a day last year on average for a total of 222 million barrels. It has an estimated 2.527 billion barrels of oil equivalent in proved reserves. EOG grew in both categories during 2017 after a downturn the previous two years.The company is part of IBD's Oil & Gas-U. S. Exploration and Production group, which also features top names like Diamondback Energy (FANG) and Parsley Energy (PE). The company has a 95 Composite Rating from IBD. That means it is outperforming 95% of all stocks in key fundamental and technical criteria.A recent IBD Stock of the Day, EOG is building a base on base with a 128.13 buy point.Managing data is key for tech companies in Silicon Valley to take advantage of trends. EOG brought the power of data to the shale fields, earning it the nickname the ""Apple of Oil"" by analysts.Dave Meats, a senior analyst at Morningstar, says EOG's larger size gives it access to more data than smaller players in the space. EOG has access to its own data on previously drilled wells. It also has data on wells drilled by other companies where it has a small stake.EOG used analytical data from thousands of wells. They find everything from the optimal length to drill during each fracking stage, to which rock type is more productive.""The company does have a technical edge,"" Meats said. ""Not so much (in that) it can do things other companies can't, but that it can lead the way in achieving technical benefits before some of its peers.""Last year, EOG said it had developed 20 mobile apps of its own over two years that allow workers to stay connected day and night. It also has collected data from 5,000 horizontal wells in almost every major unconventional play in the U.S.Further, proprietary data is helping the company cut costs. Meats said the company isn't reliant on expensive analytics packages from Schlumberger (SLB) and other service providers.On top of that, data helped EOG take advantage of being one of the first movers into newer, fringe areas in a potential shale play. It analyzed the success and failure of other wells in the area.""They were kind of early on the Eagle Ford and Bakken,"" Youngberg said. ""They just saw things years ago under the leadership they had and were able to build big positions.""With acreage in some of the most prolific basins in the U.S., the company's broad geographic offerings give it the ability to be more flexible with spending if issues arise.""Some companies are very nimble like EOG. They will move capital here or there a little bit if it makes sense to,"" Youngberg said.Companies that shifted their assets to exclusively focus on the Permian now see production backing up, bottlenecked by limited pipeline capacity that likely will remain constrained through 2019. But both Youngberg and Meats don't expect the Permian bottleneck to affect EOG.When times are tough, company management isn't afraid to make the tough call to put the brakes on spending, analysts say.""They pulled back spending more than others did at a time when oil prices fell back,"" Youngberg said. ""They are willing to go defense when they have to, when oil falls, then switch back into offense pretty quickly.""Unlike its peers, EOG reduced production during the downturn three years ago, when other companies tried to keep production flat or grow slightly.Over the past year, Wall Street's appetite for increases in production at all costs has slowed. Now investors are looking for companies to focus on returning cash to shareholders rather than drilling to keep production up.In its first-quarter report, the company reiterated its 2018 oil production growth target of 16%-20%. It also backed its forecast for a full-year exploration-and-development budget of $5.4 billion-$5.8 billion, after raising it by $1 billion the previous quarter.The company plans to increase its dividend growth rate. And it has small overseas operations in Canada, China, the U.K., Trinidad and Tobago. But EOG is unlikely to commit a lot of capital to any mergers or acquisitions. Instead, management is focused on boosting organic operations.EOG's second-quarter earnings are seen soaring 1,400% to $1.20 per share, up from eight cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Revenue is seen rising 45.8% to $3.79 billion.The company isn't immune to all headwinds, however. Meats says he's bearish on long-term oil prices despite supply constraints out of Libya, Venezuela and Iran currently boosting crude futures.He only expects a supply crunch in the short term and believes oil prices will stay around $55 per barrel in the long term.""EOG is a high-quality company with good asset quality,"" Meats said. ""But I think like every other shale company, the potential for lower oil prices weighs on validation.""Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Energy Stocks And Industry NewsWhy The Next Oil Bonanza Could Be Deep Under Water

3,SLB,"Energy ministers from around the world and executives from Schlumberger (SLB), BP (BP), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and others will be attending CERAWeek by IHS Markit in Houston March 5 to 9.X The industry's top players face a changing landscape, with the U.S. poised to become the world's top oil producer, perhaps as soon as this year, electric vehicle technology threatening demand, and OPEC looking to wind down its effort to prop up crude prices.Here are five things to watch:Last year, OPEC and non-OPEC members like Russia agreed to extend their production deal to remove 1.8 million barrels per day from the global markets until the end of 2018.Compliance with the deal is at record highs, but Russia has been pushing for an exit strategy from the agreement likely to be decided at the next OPEC meeting this summer.Still, analysts believe that a longer-term deal could be in the works for the two to keep a hold of a majority of the oil market in the face of rising U.S. production.While U.S. shale producers and OPEC are largely seen as rivals on global energy markets, OPEC is looking at forging relationships in the U.S., with OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo scheduled to speak Monday at a dinner Monday night with top shale executives, as he did last year.The role of the shale sector on the world stage is also in question. While Saudi Arabia has stepped back from its traditional role as swing producer, it's not clear that shale can step in to take over.U.S. producers face their own limitations, said Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, such as an inability to work collectively, steep output decline rates of shale wells, and labor shortages.Some U.S. firms recently have taken a measured tone on future drilling activity. EOG Resources (EOG) said that it will take drilling slowly, and Diamondback Energy (FANG) said it wasn't a ""drill, baby, drill"" company, while Parsley Energy (PE) said it was expecting a ""steady activity pace.""The industry is divided about future oil supplies and demand. BP projected a drop in oil demand by 2040, but its U.S. rival Exxon Mobil (XOM) and OPEC don't agree, Flynn said.""It's going to be interesting to see all these energy minds and find out where they come in on which side of the equation. This is the biggest question facing the oil in some time.""Flynn said BP is making assumptions that there will be some breakthroughs in electric car battery technology, infrastructure and other improvements. ""I think there are going to be a lot of challenges because oil is going to still be very price competitive over the years.""General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra is scheduled to speak Wednesday and will likely discuss the future of hybrid and electric cars.The International Energy Agency will release its 2018 oil report Monday and give an analysis on global oil demand.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!CEO Amin Nasser is scheduled to speak Tuesday as Saudi Arabia prepares for an IPO of the state-run oil giant.

7,SLB,"Halliburton (HAL) reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and revenue growth on Monday, with international market revenue growth surprisingly outpacing U.S. growth, as rising crude prices spur strong demand for the oilfield services giant. Shares moved past a buy point.X Halliburton has always had a stronger focus on the U.S. than internationally, but the no. 2 oilfield services provider said it saw Q4 international revenue increase 11% sequentially to $2.5 billion on increased activity in Latin America and in the eastern hemisphere.  North America revenue rose 7% to $3.4 billion.""Their international revenues grew faster,"" Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg said. ""That shows that yes they are focused on delivering in the core sale operations but their long term focus of improving the international business continues to bear fruit.""Halliburton is still seeing pricing pressure internationally and expects pricing concession to last until the middle of this year.Despite an increasing focus on international operations, North American shale is Halliburton's core business and accounts for over half of its revenue.""North American unconventional activity should be very busy,"" CEO Jeff Miller said during the company's conference call.Shares jumped 6.4% to 56.40 on the stock market today, above a 53.79 buy point from a cup-with-handle base going back nearly a year. Volume was more than double average trade.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Earnings soared to 53 cents per share from 4 cents a year ago. Revenue was up 48% to $5.94 billion. Analysts polled by Zacks were expecting EPS of 46 cents on revenue of $5.567 billion.Completion and production revenue rose 8% sequentially to $3.8 billion with drilling and exploration revenue up 12% to $2.1 billion.Halliburton saw an increase in frac sand pricing at the end of the year but expects costs to go down as it turns to local sand for some customers in the Permian basin.""I am optimistic about what I see in 2018. Commodity prices are supportive of increasing activity in North America and I am encouraged by the increase in tender activity and the positive discussions we are having with our international customers,""Miller said in the earnings release.Halliburton is seeing more wear and tear on equipment than it did in 2014 as exploration and production companies drill more stages with longer laterals.""If activity remains relativity strong, we will see increased investment in equipment in the latter part of this year or 2019 at the latest as long as prices don't pull back significantly,"" Youngberg said.On Friday, Schlumberger (SLB), the world's largest oilfield services company, beat Q4 forecasts and said it expects oil companies to start spending more.Citing third-party surveys, Schlumberger expects a 15%-20% increase in North American investments in 2018 and a 5% increase in international spending, the first growth in four years.Baker Hughes (BHGE) results are scheduled for Wednesday.Schlumberger shares rose 4.4% to 79.79 as they cleared their own cup-with-handle base.

8,SLB,"Schlumberger (SLB), the world's largest oilfield services company, beat fourth-quarter forecasts Friday and expects oil companies to start spending more, while a top oil watchdog predicted U.S. oil output could surge past Saudi Arabia and Russia this year.X The bullish signals in spending and production follow the Q3 reporting season three months ago, when shale producers emphasized spending discipline over production growth.But since then, oil prices hit three-year highs as shale producers have been cutting expenses, with many of them suddenly flush with cash after tax cuts.Citing third-party surveys, Schlumberger expects a 15%-20% increase in North American investments in 2018 and a 5% increase in international spending, the first growth in four years.Those years saw lower spending due to the slump in crude. That, plus output curbs from OPEC and its allies, has translated to a tighter market, easing the supply glut that had weighed on prices.""This means the oil market is now in balance and the previous oversupply discount is gradually being replaced by a market tightness premium, which makes us increasingly positive on the global outlook for our business,"" Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard said in a statement.International markets are especially important to Schlumberger where management said it has four to five times the earnings power than in North American land operations.Shares closed up 0.1% at 76.43 on the stock market today after falling as much as 3% as U.S. crude prices dropped 0.9% to $63.37 a barrel.  Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg said while Schlumberger's outlook comments were generally positive, markets may have been disappointed by lack of a dividend increase.Halliburton (HAL), which is scheduled to report Q4 results Monday and is more exposed to North America, rose 1.3% and Baker Hughes (BHGE), on tap for Wednesday, closed flat. Oil and gas equipment company National Oilwell Varco (NOV) rallied to close up 0.2%. National Oilwell said 2017 results should come in at or above prior expectations.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Schlumberger's adjusted earnings jumped 78% to 48 cents per share while revenue climbed 15% to $8.179 billion. Revenue from North America rose 59% to $2.81 billion during the quarter. Analysts were expecting EPS of 44 cents on revenue of $8.12 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.But Schlumberger took $2.7 billion in charges, with nearly $1 billion related to investments in Venezuela.The company also said it is exiting the marine and land seismic acquisition market, booked a $938 million charge on a Venezuelan investment, and signed a memorandum of understanding with Occidental Petroleum (OXY) for a five-year service project in New Mexico's Delaware basin for 700 wells.Also in a monthly report out Friday, the International Energy Agency raised its outlook for growth in U.S. oil production by 240,000 barrels a day to 1.35 million barrels, enough to top Saudi Arabia and Russia.""Relentless growth should see the U.S. hit historic highs above 10 million barrels a day (in production), overtaking Saudi Arabia and rivaling Russia during the course of 2018 — provided OPEC and non-OPEC restraints remain in place,"" the IEA said.In its own monthly report out Thursday, OPEC said U.S. shale producers lowered break-even costs between 2015 and 2017 but now service companies are raising rig and labor costs so break-even prices are rising.Despite increased costs, OPEC cited a JPMorgan report that found U.S. shale exploration and production companies could achieve ""decent rates of return"" at $60 per barrel even if costs rose by another 15%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalDividend Hikes, Largest IPO Ever Lead 5 Oil Stories To Watch This Year

9,SLB,"Workday (WDAY), Halliburton (HAL), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and RSP Permian (RSPP) just finished handles to their cup bases. And they are all first-stage bases. Halliburton blasted past its buy point Monday, while Workday edged past its entry point in low volume.X First- and second-stage bases are more likely to succeed and rise sharply than late-stage bases. Mutual funds and other big institutions are more apt to want to add to holdings for stocks in early-stage bases, while cashing in profits on late-stage bases after a long run.With the S&P 500 index rising for 14 of the last 15 months — the S&P 500's sole loss a drop of less than one point in March 2017 — many recent breakouts have tended to be third-, fourth-, fifth- or even sixth-stage bases.So investors should take a look when first-stage bases like Workday develop. Halliburton, Pioneer Natural Resources and RSP Permian are all oil plays coming out of long consolidations, with Halliburton reporting strong earnings Monday morning. One note of caution: The relative strength line — which tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index — is not in great shape for any of these stocks. (The RS line is the blue line in the charts below.)Workday's cup-with-handle base started in late November. The stock sold off sharply at the end of that month and early December, especially after the software maker reported earnings that easily beat views, but had details that disappointed investors. Shares began recovering but didn't retake their 50-day line until Jan. 4. With its new handle, Workday is now less than 1% below a 114.98 buy point.Workday's RS line is well off its late November peak, and really hasn't made much progress since early June.Workday rose 1% to 115.30 on the stock market today, moving past the buy point. But trading volume was well below normal, while the relatively small price move means that the RS line was unable to rise above even the very short-term peak around the handle.IBD'S TAKE: So early-stage bases are preferable. Learn more about how to count bases to profit in long, bull markets.Halliburton is in a cup-with-handle base going all the way back to January 2017. The buy point is 53.79.Oil companies struggled in 2017, especially oilfield services firms like Halliburton that saw their customers slashing spending. But with crude prices at a three-year high, the energy sector has rebounded.Halliburton earnings topped Q4 views early Monday. Shares  surged 6.4% to 56.40 on the stock market today, blasting above that 53.79 entry into buy range in heavy volume.That follows rival Schlumberger (SLB), which topped earnings views Friday and predicted rising industry spending this year. Schlumberger cleared its own cup-with-handle base on Monday, soaring 4.4%.Thanks to the strong price move, Halliburton's RS line moved above its recent handle peak in a breakout. The RS line is at a multi-month high, but well off its January 2017 peak.Pioneer Natural Resources has an 11-month cup-with-handle base with a 187.64 buy point. Shares closed Friday at 183.17. A breakout could see the RS line clear short- or mid-term highs, providing some confirmation.Pioneer Natural Resources advanced 1.7% to 186.30 on Monday, closing in on that entry.RSP Permian's base goes back a year with a 42.85 entry. The stock ended last week at 41.32.RSP Permian shares jumped 3.5% to 42.76 on Monday, closing at session highs and just pennies below the entry point.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: These 11 Stocks Could Break Out SoonWhy These 3 Winners Are Triggering This Sell Signal, But Not These TwoIs This Hot Chip Name Ready To Break Out From Early-Stage Base?Bullish Chart Patterns: Do You Know The Basics Of A Cup With Handle?Why This Government Shutdown May Hurt Economy, Stocks More Than UsualIf General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE Stock?

13,SLB,"So far this year, cyclical industries such as oil suppliers, fertilizer, transport and steelmakers are leading IBD's 197 industry stock groups. That reflects confidence in the U.S. and global economy as well as benefits from the Trump tax cuts. The corporate tax cuts are likely to benefit energy and other old-economy sectors more than tech giants that can more easily avoid taxes.X While 2018 has barely gotten started, most of these groups have been top performers over the past several weeks. Investors need to be watching for sector rotations so they are always focusing on the leading groups and stocks.Many of the stocks in these groups are either extended from breakouts (FedEx (FDX), U.S. Steel (X)) or still recovering from long downtrends (Schlumberger (SLB)). But a few, including steelmaker Nucor (NUE) and Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile (SQM), are in or near buy range.S&P 500 futures rose 0.25% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 climbed 0.3%. Dow futures advanced 0.2%.The Chemicals-Agriculture group has soared 13% so far in 2018. This includes fertilizer makers such as CF Industries (CF).But Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile, which makes specialty fertilizers, is also now seen as a lithium play. Sociedad Química y Minera has a 63.90 buy point, closing Wednesday at 61.81. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is lagging somewhat after a strong three-month uptrend to late September.Mining giant Rio Tinto (RIO) reportedly has dropped out of the bidding for a 32% SQM stake owned by Nutrien (NTR), Bloomberg reported late Wednesday, citing sources. Fertilizer giant Nutrien, formed from the merger of Potash Corp. and Agrium, agreed to sell the SQM holdings to win regulatory approval.Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG) is now viewed as an indirect legal marijuana play.This group is up 8.7% this year. Group giants include Schlumberger and Halliburton (HAL). Crude oil prices have risen to three-year highs above $63 a barrel in the U.S. But oil services stocks were slower to rebound than many shale producers as customers remained reluctant to step up spending. Both Schlumberger  and Halliburton on working on the right side of long, deep consolidations.This related energy group has climbed 8% in 2018. Notable members include Baker Hughes, a General Electric Co. (BHGE).This small group, dominated by FedEx and UPS (UPS), has rallied 8% as well. FedEx and UPS stocks are extended.Steelmakers have climbed 7.9% this year. Steel stocks were among the big immediate winners after President Trump's election, but then made little headway for most of 2017 before moving higher in Q4. U.S. Steel and Steel Dynamics (STLD) are extended, but Nucor is just in range from a 66.10 entry in a consolidation going back nearly 10 months. Nucor's relative strength line, though improving, is still well off its December 2016 peak.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Stocks Shrug Off Bearish HeadlinesRobot Surgeon Breaks Out; Two Top Financials Hit New HighsThese Five Top Stocks Hit Buys; Why This One Stands OutThe Most Powerful Rocket Since Apollo Program Is About To Be TestedThis Amazon Partner And Cisco Rival May Ring In New Breakout

14,SLB,"U.S. stock indexes advanced in midday action Monday, but volume eased from the previous session's hot pace. Even so, a number of secondary indicators are looking encouraging to the bulls.X The Nasdaq spurted 1.5% higher, while the S&P 500 popped 1.2%.The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.4%. The small-cap Russell 2000 was barely up 0.1%. That's a troubling sign because in previous market rebounds, small caps participate in the rally. This time, they aren't, at least not yet.If the bulls hope to bring the correction to a quick end, they may have found some optimism in a few technical indicators.The put-call volume ratio closed at 1.26 Friday, above the 1.15 reading that often points to a short-term bottom. The last time the put-call ratio hit either 1.15 or higher was Aug. 17 (at 1.18). The Nasdaq took a few days to get started but rallied 20.6% from there.The percentage of stocks below their 200-day moving average dropped to 40%; it was 67% a few weeks ago. Also, the yield curve shows no signs of inversion. As of Friday, the 10-year yield was 78 basis points above the 2-year yield.When the 2-year yield surpasses the 10-year yield, it's often a sign that a recession is ahead. No such fears are in the data now.Improvement also has been seen in the percentage of advisors who are bullish, a contrary indicator. The most recent reading was 54.4%, the lowest since Sept. 26's 54.3% reading. A 17.6% rally in the Nasdaq followed the Sept. 26 reading.Some indicators are negative. The number of new lows has dwarfed new highs every day this month. Bulls like to see an abundance of new highs, which is missing from this market after steep declines in many shares.Breakouts have dried up recently and the Accumulation/Distribution Ratings have sunk to the C area. Many new rallies do best when they emerge following a worst-possible E rating. This isn't too surprising because the E grade suggests the weak holders have been shaken out.On Monday, MarketSmith's pattern-recognition technology wasn't identifying many breakouts.Salon chain Regis (RGS), which owns Supercuts, broke out of a flat pattern. The small-cap Regis cleared a 16.78 buy point. The stock rose 8% in heavy volume. Regis is thinly traded and market risk remains high. Analysts expect Regis to increase earnings 106% in fiscal 2018 ending in June.Business software provider Workiva (WK) broke out in average volume. The thinly traded stock edged above a 23.80 buy point. Workiva is thinly traded and has lost money every year since 2011.Among widely held blue chips, Apple (AAPL) advanced almost 3% as it inched above its 200-day moving average. Cisco Systems (CSCO) gapped up 2% in heavy volume. The stock is holding above its 50-day line.In the S&P 500, oilfield services provider Schlumberger (SLB) gapped up 3%, trying to end a six-session losing streak. The stock is 18% off its high.Innovator IBD Fund (FFTY) rose 0.7% as it padded a small cushion above its 200-day line. The exchange-traded fund reflects the action of the IBD 50, which is usually comprised of the best stocks in fundamentals and technicals but now includes some with damaged charts.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, gold miners, specialty steel and oil explorers showed the best gains midday Monday. The weakest performers were specialty retail, property real estate investment trusts and fiber optics.Meanwhile, in Washington, President Trump unveiled an infrastructure package. The cement, concrete and building aggregates industry group barely moved up and remains 11% off its high.RELATED:How Long Will The Correction Last?Why You Should Buy Something On A Follow-Through Day5 Military Stocks That Stand Out

16,SLB,"Taking a loss is an inevitable part of investing in stocks but not particularly enjoyable. After all, you don't enter a swing trade with the goal of losing money. It's easy to hesitate when it comes to selling. What if the stock comes right back after I sell? What if I just need to be patient? All sorts of questions can cause doubt and hesitation.But if you can train yourself to shrug off the discomfort, you will come out further ahead over time. Taking losses when they are small is a key factor of being a successful swing trader. It makes room for new stocks that could provide your portfolio new growth or protects your portfolio from small losses turning into big losses.Take Halliburton (HAL). The stock joined IBD's SwingTrader on Jan. 22, breaking out of a short handle from a yearlong cup with handle (1). Halliburton had many things going for it. It had just reported earnings that beat analyst estimates on the top and bottom line; oil industry groups were showing strength and the oil minister of Saudi Arabia was expressing interest in continuing a deal with Russia to reduce exports; and finally, the market continued its strong move and rallied as the government shutdown ended. We also had extra confidence in the sector coming off a successful trade in Diamondback Energy (FANG) that was good for 7.8% in 13 days.Despite the marks in its favor, Halliburton did not remain as a current trade for long. The price action gave an early warning signal on Jan. 23 after its gain of 2.6% withered to under 1% by the close (2). Large-cap group mates Schlumberger (SLB) and McDermott (MDR) also struggled on the day suggesting group weakness.Price action worsened over the next two days turning what was a 4% profit from our entry into a flat trade. Haliburton closed near its lows for the day for three days in a row and closed a hair below its 5-day moving average line. By Jan. 26, the market started to show weak action and Halliburton exited SwingTrader (3). With a half-hour left in the trading session, Halliburton was nearly 1% below its 5-day moving average line. We make our decisions around that time to give subscribers a chance to act before the close and in this case, we missed a quarter-percent rally that followed. That didn't amount to much as the stock dropped a few percentage points over the next couple of days (4).The trade showed a loss just under 0.2%. Hesitation would have only made the problem worse as the stock dropped over 5% the following week. As it stood, January's losing trades lost only 1% on average. Meanwhile, the gains averaged 5.5% for the month. And there were three times more winners than losers. Rather than bemoaning the losses, think of yourself as getting protection from further losses and one step closer to getting that next gain.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Swing Trading Strategies And LessonsCutting Losses Quickly Is Key To Long-Term Stock ProfitsKeeping Losses Small Is Critical To Portfolio Progress

That said, money managers and strategists still see plenty of investment opportunities in 2018.And some seem to already be at hand. Scarcely three days into the new year and the Dow has charged ahead 1.4%, in the process topping 25,000 for the first time ever.But some of the best gains for the full year may come in overseas stock markets and in value equities both in the U.S. and abroad. (Click here for a timeline and detailed chart of 2017's remarkable stock market.)That rotation of big portfolios into more foreign stocks is expected to take place despite economic uncertainty due to the U.K.'s Brexit and escalating tensions with Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping, not to mention North Korea's nuclear threats.Two big reasons are the prospect of faster economic growth abroad and cheaper valuations for many foreign equities. GDP growth will likely continue strong in both China and Europe, where European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi says monetary stimulus will continue until at least September.Special Report: 2018 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2017 Stock Market ReviewThe U.S. economy looks positive too. Investors are heartened by incoming Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, and they're jazzed by a drum roll of moves by President Trump, including tax reform, opening the way for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, throttling back on federal regulations and withdrawing from the Paris climate accord.But with many stocks up sharply from a year ago, investment strategists and fund managers expect more modest stock price gains in 2018. The S&P 500's 2017 return was more than double the big-cap bogey's 8.50% average annual gain over the past 10 years. The Nasdaq composite index shot up 29.64% and the Dow Jones industrials gained 25.08%.Align Technology (ALGN), part of the Nasdaq and a member of the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks, jumped 131% in 2017. The company is known for its computer-assisted design approach to straightening teeth.Banking giant JPMorgan Chase (JPM), a key cog in the Dow, rose 24% in 2017. IBD Markets Editor Juan Carlos Arancibia analyzes 2017's top-performing stocks in a separate article.Against this backdrop, money pros say some of the best opportunities lie in non-U.S. stocks. And in both the U.S. and abroad, they see good potential in value-oriented stocks, including cyclical stocks whose performance swings up and down with economic conditions.""Stocks will be better than bonds once again in 2018,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist for broker and financial advisor Ameriprise Financial (AMP). ""And we like international markets better than domestic. That includes developed markets in the eurozone but not the U.K., and it includes Japan.""Joy cites three reasons why foreign stocks may shine. ""Economic growth relative to potential growth appears to be stronger in those international markets than in the U.S. even though the U.S. is doing well,"" he said. ""And central banks in those (foreign) geographies will be more accommodative than in the U.S., where the Federal Reserve as everyone knows is raising interest rates.""The third reason: Valuations. U.S. stocks as a group have grown expensive, Joy says. Other markets are more attractively valued. So there's more upside potential than in U.S. stocks overall.But Joy added, ""We do think U.S. stocks will go higher."" Ameriprise currently forecasts that the S&P 500 will hit 2865 in 2018, up 7% from its 2673.61 level at year-end 2017.Joseph Davis, Vanguard's global chief economist and head of its investment strategy group, says Vanguard expects the lowest returns for U.S. equities in roughly a decade. His group expects 4% to 6% annual gains for U.S. stocks in the next five years.Ameriprise forecasts 3.0% U.S. GDP growth in excess of inflation in 2018. Before Congress passed tax reform, Ameriprise was predicting 2.4%. China's pace should remain around 6.5%. The eurozone's economy should grow around 2.2% vs. 2.1% in 2017.As for interest rates Ameriprise, among others, expects the Fed to continue raising rates. That ""will be a lid on earnings multiples for U.S. corporations and may bring some (multiples) down,"" Joy said. Research firm Action Economics sees the fed funds rate around 2.12% by the end of 2018, up from its 1.25% to 1.50% band since June 2017.U.S. tax reform is a wild card. ""It should add incrementally to earnings growth and economic growth,"" Joy said. ""It should provide a little tailwind to stocks.""U.S. joblessness should drop to 3.6% by the end of 2018, the lowest rate since 1969, Ameriprise says. The unemployment rate was 4.1% in November 2017.David Polak, equity investment specialist at Capital Group, the parent of American Funds, sees investment opportunities in several geographic markets. Asia and the U.S. remain leading sites of technology innovators, he says.Manufacturers of logic chips are one group of innovators. Industry consolidation has left four key players, including Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and California-based Intel (INTC). Fifteen years ago, there were 25.""Taiwan Semi and Intel are dominant,"" Polak said. ""Consolidation has left the space more disciplined, which should lead to more visibility of earnings and more pricing power.""Another Asia stock he likes is Japan's Murata Manufacturing. ""Their ceramic capacitors are crucial components for smartphones, but relatively inexpensive, so manufacturers can stuff phones with them without impacting their margins much,"" he said.Since the capacitors are used in Apple iPhones as well as Samsung Galaxy and other Android phones, ""It's a way to invest in the growth element without having to bet on which phone will do better,"" Polak said.In gaming, he likes the way Japan's Nintendo (NTDOY) has diversified its addressable market. ""They took their intellectual property away from just hardware,"" Polak said. ""You used to have to play their games only on their hardware. Now it's available on multiple devices.""Then there's Tencent (TCEHY), China's leading provider of messaging and mobile gaming services. Tencent also owns the popular WeChat app.For Polak, a key Tencent trait is its leadership in China's mobile payments services, enabling consumers to use smartphones to pay bills and make online purchases.Peter Bourbeau, co-manager of $9.3 billion ClearBridge Large Cap Growth (SBLYX) sees opportunities among U.S. stocks but says it's time to switch from FAANG stocks because their price run-ups have left less room to rise. The ClearBridge fund is on track to becoming a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner after outperforming the S&P 500 in 2017 as well as in the trailing three, five and 10 years.Schlumberger (SLB) should benefit from a bottoming among energy stocks, Bourbeau says. Oil and gas service companies have regained pricing power, he adds.""SLB currently generates incremental margins of 60%-plus (the highest in its history) and is benefiting from its OneStim U.S. joint venture with Weatherford International (WFT) for pressure pumping,"" he said. ""SLB is the only global service company that is using its balance sheet to invest alongside its customers.""Among health care stocks, Bourbeau likes Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN). He calls it ""a leader in ultrarare genetic disease treatments. The company recently cleared the decks with new management and a refocused research and development profile. Alexion also received additional approvals for its lead compound Soliris for (treating other maladies)."" Solaris also was being tested for new ways of being administered.Within the financial services stock group, he likes Visa (V). ""Visa is making very good progress on its recent acquisition of Visa Europe with synergies and client engagement,"" he said. ""Although incremental margins are extremely strong, Visa continues to innovate within its core debit/credit portfolio as well as (creating) new ways to integrate with merchants and cardholders.""What about some of the big stocks that padded his mutual fund's recent gains? FAANG stock Amazon (AMZN), up 56% in 2017, was among his top holdings as of Sept. 30. So was Microsoft (MSFT), which rose 38% for the year.""Amazon continues to execute its plan of disrupting adjacent verticals and margin-rich opportunities,"" Bourbeau said. ""It continues to focus on marketplace, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Prime. The company has a huge opportunity outside the U.S. and will focus on countries like India, which is more hospitable to Western technology companies. We still see a large opportunity in AWS as we are in early stages of a generational shift to how technology is created and consumed.""Regarding Microsoft, Bourbeau said, ""We expect more of the same strong growth trends for Microsoft as the software maker helps its clients move workloads to the cloud. Its Azure cloud business is at a $20 billion run rate (in sales for 2018) and growing double digits. The company continues to focus on partnerships with service providers and competing technology, a departure from the strategy of previous management.""Celgene (CELG), another top holding, is an inexpensive stock, he said, adding that Celgene has a strategy for coping with the patent expiration of its flagship product, the cancer drug Revlimid, in the middle of the next decade. ""The biotechnology company should have 19 late-stage clinical readouts in 2019,"" he said. ""Cash continues to build and we expect some business development opportunities or acquisitions to further bolster its clinical pipeline.""MORE IBD COVERAGE FOR YOU:2018 Stock Market Forecasts: Read The Predictions For Top Stocks And IndustriesHow Tax Reform Impacts Your Tax Bracket And RateYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeAI In Business: This Is What The Future HoldsBefore You Buy Bitcoin, Read This

26,SLB,"U.S. crude production climbed to yet another record high ahead of a key meeting between OPEC and top nonmembers, potentially muddying expectations that they will extend an agreement to curb oil output.X Domestic production climbed to 9.682 million barrels per day last week from 9.658 million bpd in the prior week, according to the Energy Information Administration.Crude stockpiles fell by 3.4 million barrels, while gasoline stockpiles rose by 3.6 million barrels. Analysts polled by S&P Global Platts expect a drop of 3 million barrels in U.S. oil inventories, with a 1.1 million-barrel increase in gasoline supplies.The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said late Tuesday that U.S. stockpiles rose by 1.8 million barrels with gasoline stockpiles down 1.5 million barrels.U.S. crude futures dipped 1.2% to $57.30 a barrel, their third straight decline, though they have surged in recent months on hopes OPEC will continue trimming output and on signs the global supply glut is finally easing. London-based Brent retreated 0.3% to $63.11.But continued gains in the price of crude could encourage more production from U.S. shale companies, who have recently indicated they will focus more on cash-flow discipline vs. output growth.Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares were up 0.7% on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) climbed 0.6%, BP (BP) lost 0.5%, and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) dipped 0.3%.IBD'S TAKE: OPEC and top nonmembers are widely expected to extend their current output-cut deal, but there are still a few wild cards left. Here are five things to watch at Thursday's meeting. Six minsters from OEPC and nonmembers are meeting in Vienna Wednesday to discuss recommendations, and U.S. shale production will be a major topic at OPEC's full meeting Thursday.Andy Hall, an oil trader who closed his hedge fund earlier this year, will speak to the cartel about U.S. shale, according to Bloomberg. A representative from Citigroup (C) and a Schlumberger (SLB) consultant are also scheduled to speak.The group is expected to extend its pact to remove 1.8 million barrels from the market daily until the end of 2018. The current deal is expires in March.But analysts question Russia's commitment to extend the deal over worries extending the cut would just drive U.S. production higher.RELATED: Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalFive Reasons Why Oil Prices Are The Highest Since Mid-2015

27,SLB,"OPEC and top nonmembers are widely expected to extend their current output-cut deal at a biannual meeting Thursday, but there are still a few wild cards left as the current deal is set to expire in March.X Hopes are running high, so any failure to prolong the agreement to remove 1.8 million barrels of oil per day from the market could send oil prices tumbling.""I think they learned their lesson to not disappoint the market,"" said Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group.While there is broad agreement on the need for an extension, the are other factors to consider. Here are five things to watch.Russia is ready to announce an extension on Thursday, but officials want the size of the cuts tied to the strength of the oil market, Bloomberg reported.While the general consensus seems that the current deal will be extended, Venezuela, which has been rocked by soaring inflation, has pushed for even deeper cuts.""If prices were weaker they would talk about deeper cuts,"" Flynn said. ""But I don't think they are going to need to talk about deeper cuts at this point.""Brent and U.S. crude prices have surged roughly 40% since June and are now hovering around $63 and $57 a barrel, respectively.In October, Venezuela said it was inviting 10 to 12 countries in South America and Africa to join the deal but didn't give details. And Uzbekistan could attend the meeting as an observer, Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said earlier this month.Compliance will also likely be a major topic.Last month, the International Energy Agency said compliance was at 86%, higher than in the past. But the unstable Kurdish region of Iraq is one of the least compliant regions. Iraq is the second largest OPEC oil producer.""But if you look at Iran, Iraq, Nigeria and Libya, even though their production has gone up, it hasn't gone up nearly as much as some people thought it would,"" Flynn said.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.The ""linchpin"" for production deal is Russia's relationship with Saudi Arabia, said Omar Al-Ubaydli, an affiliated senior research fellow at George Mason University, adding that the Kremlin has sought to forge better ties with Riyadh.Saudi Arabia also relies on high oil prices to fund its government and needs stronger, stable oil prices to get a strong initial public offering for state-run oil giant Saudi Aramco next year.""However both Russia and Saudi Arabia have an unpredictable policy in the Middle East at present so the accord is fragile,"" Al-Ubaydli warned.Russia and Saudi Arabia have supported opposite sides of proxy wars in Syria and Yemen, while tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia are growing. Elsewhere, tensions between Qatar, which restored full diplomatic relations with Iran earlier this year, and Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries are at a peak. Sources told Reuters there has been no official contact between the GCC and Qatar.""As bad as things are between Iran and Saudi Arabia right now, they have an amazing way of separating their oil politics from normal day to day politics,"" Flynn noted. ""When it comes to oil production they have a common goal of getting prices higher.""Three years after OPEC sparked a price crash to force surging shale producers out of the market, U.S. oil output has recently set record highs, keeping the resilient U.S. energy sector high on OPEC's agenda.Andy Hall, an oil trader who closed his hedge fund earlier this year, will speak to the cartel about U.S. shale, according to Bloomberg. A representative from Citigroup (C) and a Schlumberger (SLB) consultant are also scheduled to speak.The U.S. is set to boost oil and gas production to unprecedented levels by 2025, the IEA said in a report earlier this year month. But OPEC will take back some market power in the long term.OPEC needs to start thinking about an orderly exit strategy as global oil demand rises, Flynn said.""Global demand is soaring with a strong economy in the U.S. and Europe, and near record (crude) imports in China,"" he said.But OPEC must navigate uncertainty on that front as well. The IEA cut its demand growth outlook for this year and 2018 by 100,000 barrels per day, to 1.5 million bpd in 2017 and 1.3 million bpd next year, in its monthly oil report.RELATED: Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalU.S. Crude Production Hits New High For Third Straight WeekU.S. To Become Oil And Gas Hyperpower, But OPEC Still Looms: IEAFive Reasons Why Oil Prices Are The Highest Since Mid-2015

29,SLB,"Oilfield service providers Baker Hughes (BHGE), Schlumberger (SLB) and Halliburton (HAL) led a surge in energy-sector stocks Monday as crude prices jumped to the highest levels in more than two years.XWest Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, rallied 3.1% to settle at $57.35, the highest since July 2015.Baker Hughes, which merged earlier this year with GE's (GE) oil and gas unit, also said Monday it will buy back up to $3 billion of its common units, adding that its strong balance sheet positions it well to invest in growth.""Today's announcement represents an important step in our plan to optimize BHGE's capital structure,"" said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lorenzo Simonelli.The news followed BP's (BP) announcement last week that it would resume buybacks, and Royal Dutch Shell's (RDSA) strong quarterly report that raised hopes for more shareholder returns. After years of conserving cash amid historically low prices, oil companies are raising expectations among investors that capital deployment is starting to return to normal.Shares of Baker Hughes spiked 8.8% to 33.92 on the stock market today. Schlumberger jumped 5.5%, retaking its 50-day moving average, and Halliburton rose 4.3%.Those gains outpaced BP's 2.1% advance and Shell's 2.2% gain, with Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) seeing increases of 0.7% and 1.8%, respectively. Meanwhile, bellwether shale producers like EOG Resources (EOG) and Continental Resources (CLR) were up 2.35% and 3.7%, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: Watch for new technologies and efficiencies from the top U.S. oil producers as they try to get around price hikes from service providers Halliburton and Schlumberger.Analysts at RBC Capital Markets said Monday that Baker Hughes has strong cash flow capability and could even increase its dividend and buy back more stock in the future.""The merger of Baker Hughes and GE Oil & Gas has created a new heavyweight in the oilfield services sector,"" RBC's Kurt Hallead and David Lu wrote. ""We believe most investors will view BHGE as an energy conglomerate given its exposure throughout the value chain.""Until today, oilfield service stocks largely sat out the energy rally since the start of September.

31,SLB,"Halliburton (HAL) topped third-quarter estimates Monday as strong pricing trends in the U.S. oil patch helped power through a recent slowdown in drilling activity.The oilfield service provider's earnings per share from continuing operations shot up to 42 cents from 3 cents a year ago, topping forecasts for 38 cents. Revenue jumped 42% to $5.44 billion, above analysts' estimates for $5.32 billion. North American revenue, which by far makes up the bulk of the top line, soared 91% to $3.16 billion.""Our North American business is hitting on all cylinders and our international business proved resilient in a challenging environment,"" said CEO Jeff Miller in a statement.Completion and production revenue jumped 62.5% to $3.54 billion, while drilling and evaluation revenue rose 15% to $1.91 billion.Shares fell 2.5% to 42.24 on the stock market today. Rival Schlumberger (SLB), which matched forecasts on Friday, slid 2% on Monday. Baker Hughes (BHGE), which missed earnings views Friday, tumbled 5.4% Monday.The results come as the number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. has shifted lower in recent months, while domestic crude production has shown signs of stalling.But Halliburton said while the average U.S. rig count grew 6% in Q3 vs. Q2, its North American revenue rose by 14% sequentially due primarily to ""increased utilization and pricing throughout the United States land sector.""Still, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes signaled investment from U.S. oil and gas companies will cool off as they turn their focus more to cash flow vs. expanding production growth.""In North America land (operations) where companies added capex, production growth is falling short of expectations,"" said Chairman and CEO Paul Kibsgaard during a conference call with analysts. ""This has led to moderating investment appetite.""Baker Hughes offered a similar warning and said the overall oil and gas environment will remain challenged for the rest of the year.""We have seen some improvement in activity, but we have not seen meaningful increases in customer capital commitments,"" CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said in an earnings statement.

32,SLB,"Oilfield service providers Schlumberger (SLB) and Baker Hughes (BHGE) warned Friday that their customers have turned cautious with their capital budgets, signaling more cooling ahead in oil production.XWhile U.S. crude prices have regained the $50-per-barrel threshold, they remain volatile and historically low. The number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. also has been falling, while domestic production has stalled.Now the outlook for capital expenditures is dimming, as exploration and production companies focus more on financial returns and operating within their cash flows vs. expanding production, Schlumberger said.""In North America land (operations) where companies added capex, production growth is falling short of expectations,"" said Chairman and CEO Paul Kibsgaard during a conference call with analysts. ""This has led to moderating investment appetite.""Baker Hughes offered a similar warning and said the overall oil and gas environment will remain challenged for the rest of the year.""We have seen some improvement in activity, but we have not seen meaningful increases in customer capital commitments,"" CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said in an earnings statement.

Baker Hughes erased early losses and closed up 0.3% to 33.26. Halliburton, which reports Monday, edged up 1.2%.IBD'S TAKE: By learning to use call options, investors can significantly reduce risk and capitalize on basing stocks that are making breakaway gains caused by earnings reports.Schlumberger's cautious forecast followed a big gains in Q3. EPS jumped 68% to 42 cents, matching views, as revenue climbed 12.7% to $7.9 billion, also in line with forecasts.North America revenue climbed 18% as spare hydraulic fracturing capacity was redeployed and revenue from North America land operations jumped 23% sequentially despite rig counts only rising 12%. Schlumberger has doubled the number of frack crews in North American in the past six months and has almost all of its capacity deployed.Meanwhile, the outlook overseas is brightening. Kibsgaard said there are ""small, encouraging"" signs of activity growth in Asia so far this quarter and that Russia, the North Sea and Middle East will lead activity growth going into 2018. But Latin American and African markets will remain flat.Schlumberger is still facing pricing pressure in new contracts but the ""downward trend of pricing is slowing significantly,"" and Kibsgaard doesn't think pricing is an issue in the international markets.And while it seems likely OPEC will extend its current production cut, oil stockpiles are near their five-year average, so an extension might not be needed, he added.Baker Hughes, in its first report that incorporated results from its merger with General Electric's (GE) oil and gas unit in early July. earned 5 cents a share on revenue of $5.38 billion, missing estimates for EPS of 12 cents on revenue of $5.5 billion.RELATED:Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

36,SLB,"Baker Hughes (BHGE) is reportedly looking to resume takeover talks with Subsea 7, a U.K.-based company that offers construction and engineering services to the offshore energy industry, after the talks broke down earlier.XNegotiations between Baker Hughes, which was formed by the merger of GE's (GE) oil and gas business with Baker Hughes, and Subsea 7 had collapsed over price but could resume, sources told The Wall Street Journal. Subsea 7 said it would not comment on speculation or rumors, but its shares rose on the news, Reuters added.Baker Hughes, officially known as Baker Hughes, a GE Company, is 62.5% owned by GE, with Baker Hughes shareholders owning the rest.Morningstar analyst Preston Caldwell called the prospective merger odd, noting Subsea 7 has long been a partner with rival Schlumberger (SLB) and would presumably end that relationship if a deal is realized.A combined Baker Hughes-Subsea company also would still have gaps in subsea equipment, he added, warning that those holes should be filled before entering the engineering, procurement, and construction business.BHGE closed down 1.7% at 34.39 on the stock market today. GE gave up 1.2% to 23.07, pegging a fresh 52-week low as Wall Street analysts warn that the industrial giant is fundamentally challenged and its prized dividend could be at risk.Rival oilfield-service providers Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger rose 1.1% and fell 0.9%, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: Earnings season is getting underway in earnest. Here's a list of Dow stocks in or near buy points ahead of third-quarter results, including one of GE's industrial peers. The oilfield services industry is consolidating amid the need for greater scale to grow and as oil prices have crashed since 2014.Helix Energy Solutions (HLX) and Dover (DOV) are also said to be exploring strategic sales of all or part of their businesses.Meanwhile, analysts are said to be in wait-and-see mode as to whether Baker Hughes can deliver hoped-for synergies from the merger with GE, and compete effectively with Halliburton and Schlumberger.Amid a slew of executive and board changes this month, GE announced Oct. 2 that Lorenzo Simonelli, president and CEO of BHGE, would succeed Immelt as chairman of BHGE.RELATED:Why GE Stock May Get Worse Instead Of Better As Leadership Turns OverDow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisDow Leads Slim Gains; Oil Giant Breaks Out To Buy Point As Crude Soars

37,SLB,"For the past two years, shale exploration and production companies have focused on growing the flow of oil, but now the focus may be shifting toward the flow of cash.XConcho Resources (CXO), Apache (APA), EOG Resources (EOG) and a slew of other U.S. shale producers report third-quarter results this week. While U.S. crude prices have climbed to $54 a barrel they have struggled to stay above $50 ever since prices collapsed in 2014, and producers' spending vs. cash flow will likely be a key metric for investors.The outlook for capital expenditures is dimming, as companies focus more on financial returns and operating within their cash flows vs. expanding production, oilfield service provider Schlumberger (SLB) said earlier this month.""In North America land (operations) where companies added capex, production growth is falling short of expectations,"" CEO Paul Kibsgaard said on the earnings call with analysts. ""This has led to moderating investment appetite.""Early reports from shale companies echoed this sense of caution. On Friday, Cabot Oil & Gas (COG) reported Q3 results that fell short of Wall Street estimates and reaffirmed its total 2017 program spending forecast of $845 million.""We remain committed to delivering positive free cash flow in 2017 and beyond, while continuing to focus on improving our corporate returns and increasing our return of capital to shareholders through prudent capital allocation,"" Chairman and CEO Dan Dinges said in a statement.Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, said he will be looking for a focus on wellhead profitability in the shale earnings reports and expects companies to be less aggressive about production.""Before it was a rush to raise production now it's a rush to produce profitability,"" he said.

Higher expected costs were also a concern as it drops fares to compete with ultra-low-cost carriers.Morgan Stanley (MS) topped Q3 estimates, helped by its strong, stable wealth-management business. Rival investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS) also beat, but some analysts raised concerns that its results were helped by its more volatile and capital intensive lines of business.

40,SLB,"Call it the industrials revolution. After dominating the sector fund universe for much of this year, techs and biotechs are being dethroned by energy and other industrials.XRising oil futures boosted energy stocks and funds in September, though prices have slipped this month.The accompanying table shows the top sector ETFs for the past month handily outperforming the S&P 500. But nearly all have lagged the benchmark index by a wide margin over the long haul. Only one, Global X Lithium & Battery Tech (LIT), produced an average annual return that beat the S&P 500 over the past three years.Eleven of the 13 funds shown are oil and gas plays. SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Equipment & Services (XES) led with a 20.2% gain for the past month through Oct. 3, according to Morningstar Direct. It retook its 50-day moving average Sept. 12 after spending most of the prior seven months below the support line. Shares are 34% off their 52-week high.The $334.2 million fund, launched in June 2006, aims to provide exposure to small-, mid- and big-cap companies. It tracks the S&P Oil & Gas Equipment & Services Select Industry Index. Top holdings as of Oct. 5 included Fairmount Santrol Holdings (FMSA), Ensco (ESV) and Transocean (RIG). The top five names represented 19% of assets.Up next is iShares U.S. Oil Equipment & Services (IEZ), with a 15.4% one-month return. Its price action looks similar to XES. The 11-year-old fund, which tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Oil Equipment & Services Index, has gathered $196.4 million.IBD'S TAKE: On the hunt for ETF ideas that may be worth a closer look?

The portfolio contained 34 stocks; the top five holdings accounted for 43% of assets.

U.S. crude rose 1.8% to close at $48.75 a barrel, the highest in about eight weeks.While prices have rallied in the last week, their persistent weakness this year has prompted shale companies to slow down their activity. The number of oil rigs fell last week, oilfield services giants Schlumberger (SLB) and Halliburton (HAL) see more cooling, and on Monday, Anadarko Petroleum (APC) said it would cut its 2017 capital spending outlook by $300 million, becoming the first U.S. producer to do so.""The current market conditions require lower capital intensity given the volatility of margins realized in this operating environment,"" CEO Al Walker said in a statementExxon Mobil (XOM) rose 0.1% to 80.37 on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) was up 0.7%. BP (BP) dipped 0.2% and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) gained 0.3%.Oil prices got a boost Monday at a meeting of the joint OPEC-Non-OPEC Ministerial Monitoring Committee in St. Petersburg, Russia, as Nigeria agreed to cap production once it hits a sustainable 1.8 million barrels per day.Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih also said the kingdom would cap crude exports at 6.6 million barrels per day next month, down from just under 7 million early last month and 1 million less than a year ago.RELATED:How OPEC's Failure To Lift Prices May Be A Success In Another Way

45,SLB,"Halliburton (HAL) sees U.S. exploration and production companies ""tapping the brakes"" and U.S. rig counts plateauing, as oil prices remain stuck below $50 a barrel despite OPEC's efforts to boost them.On Friday, rival oilfield-service provider Schlumberger (SLB) noted that producers operated beyond cash flow and predicted ""at current oil prices, industry will be a bit more constrained than what we've seen in 2016.""Also Friday, Baker Hughes reported that the U.S. oil rig count dipped by one last week, following a drop last month. Domestic crude output has had some hiccups in recent weeks too.The signs of slowing follow OPEC's chronic inability to keep oil prices higher as efforts to curb production are undercut by fears that U.S. firms will seize on the rally to ramp up their own output. But a speed bump in the U.S. may give OPEC some relief in its struggle against global oversupply.OPEC is still trying to lift prices and said Monday that Nigeria would participate in production curbs and Saudi Arabia agreed to cut exports while demanding higher compliance rates from current participants. U.S. oil prices jumped 1.3% to settle at $46.34 per barrel.New Halliburton CEO Jeff Miller tried to put the cooling trend in perspective, saying it's like U.S. companies are slowing down from 80 mph to 70 mph, not headed for a full stop.But the company also saw its first drop in the average amount of sand used per well last quarter. Miller said that while it was just one data point, he would be watching it as the company looks to see how it can deliver sand at a lower cost.""I sense it's more around design,"" he told analysts on a conference call. ""Our clients are dead set on lower costs per barrel.""Producers had been using more sand to squeeze out more oil per well, but in February Continental Resources (CLR) said it planned to use less sand as prices increase and more companies likely followed suit.Halliburton shares reversed early gains and closed down 4.2% at 42.51 on the stock market today. Schlumberger lost 0.2% after dipping 0.7% Friday, when it reported Q2 numbers.Halliburton's Q2 earnings soared to 23 cents per share from 4 cents a year ago, beating Wall Street estimates by 5 cents. Revenue climbed 29% to $4.96 billion, also above above analyst expectations.Halliburton reported sequential North America revenue growth of 24% to $2.8 billion, outpacing the 21% growth of the U.S. land-rig count, as equipment utilization and pricing increased, especially in pressure pumping. North America margins expanded by double digits, and overall completion and production margins jumped by 700 basis points to approximately 13%.International revenue rose 7% sequentially, to $2.2 billion, on increased drilling in Latin America and increased well completion and drilling services in Europe and Africa. But the service company saw a decrease in stimulation services in the Middle East, which weighed on pricing.The company is still bullish on growing North American margins and said its pressure-pumping equipment was sold out for the third quarter. On Friday, Schlumberger said it was sold out until Q4.Baker Hughes, which merged with General Electric's (GE) oil & gas unit to form Baker Hughes, a GE Company (BHGE), will announce Q2 results Friday.

Meanwhile, U.S. crude production hit a two-year high last week, but before that, it declined in three out of the prior 10 weeks.""U.S. E&Ps operated beyond cash flow,"" Chairman and CEO Paal Kibsgaard said during the company's conference call. ""At current oil prices, industry will be a bit more constrained than what we've seen in 2016.""The oilfield services provider anticipates its pressure pumping equipment in North America will be deployed at ""almost exactly the same rate"" as during Q2.Still, Schlumberger sees its U.S. land activity remaining strong during the second half of the year, and its fracking calendar is booked into Q4, with all of its pressure pumping equipment active then.""We have never been better positioned to capture growth"" in the region, Kibsgaard said.Surging North American fracking activity and a turnaround in international drilling helped boost Q2 results.North America revenue jumped 27% from a year ago to $2.2 billion. Latin America revenue rose 3% to $1.04 billion. Europe and Africa revenue fell 10% annually to $1.75 billion but gained 6% from Q1. Middle East and Asia revenue slipped 2% annually to $2.35 billion but edged up 1% sequentially.""While the activity outlook in North America for the second half of the year remains robust, we are now also seeing more positive signs in the international markets with increases in activity and new project plans starting to emerge in several GeoMarkets,"" Kibsgaard said in a statement.In the U.S., hydraulic fracturing revenue soared 68% in Q2 vs. Q1 as completions activity intensified and pricing continued to improve. All U.S. land product lines were profitable due to higher pricing, market share gains, improved efficiency, resource additions, and supply chain management.Earnings jumped 52% to 35 cents per share, beating Zacks Investment Research expectations by 5 cents. Revenue was up 4% to $7.46 billion, topping estimates for $7.26 billion.Shares reversed earlier gains and closed down 0.7% at 66.53 on the stock market today, as oil prices lost 2.5% to settle at $45.77 a barrel. Rival Halliburton (HAL), which will report Q2 results on Monday, fell 2.2%. Baker Hughes, which merged with General Electric's (GE) oil & gas unit to form Baker Hughes, a GE Co. (BHGE), slipped 2.4% ahead of its report July 28.Kibsgaard is bullish on oil prices and sees crude inventory declines accelerating in second half of the year.But he warned U.S. producers must start showing some constraint and operating within cash flow while OPEC must continue moderation with its supply-cut deal.OPEC and top nonmembers will meet in Russia Monday to discuss the effectiveness of the deal and if deeper cuts are needed. Reports Friday indicated OPEC production is rising this month.""What will happen in 2018? It's a bit early to say,"" Kibsgaard said. ""As of now, I think it's still likely that we will continue to see strong activity in 2018. But will it have the same type of growth rate in 2017? That remains to be seen.""RELATED:U.S. Crude Output Jumps To Highest In 2 Years; Inventory Falls

47,SLB,"Oilfield service providers Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger (SLB) likely didn't see any pricing improvements in the third quarter, but if U.S. oil stays around $50 per barrel, activity in North America will increase in the fourth quarter.Analysts see Halliburton reporting a 7-cent-per-share loss, swinging from a 31-cent-per-share gain in the year-ago quarter when it announces results Wednesday. Revenue is seen falling 30.3% to $3.89 billion.Schlumberger's earnings are expected to plunge 71.8% to 22 cents a share and revenue is seen tumbling 16.2% to $7.1 billion when it announces results Thursday.Halliburton is expected to benefit from U.S. crude prices hovering around the key $50 price point, more so than internationally focused Schlumberger, but neither company will see any service-pricing improvement in the third quarter, a major issue both mentioned on their second-quarter calls.""I don't think they made any more progress on price recovery in (the third quarter),"" said Robin Shoemaker, a KeyBanc director. ""They will be emphasizing in the results that their goal is to push pricing higher.""Shoemaker is more bullish on North America than the international market.""The $50 threshold is important for the North America market,"" he said. ""We will see higher activity if oil holds, but it won't immediately have an impact internationally where the market is quite weak and even declining in some areas.""U.S. oil prices fell 0.8% to $49.94 a barrel, the first close under $50 since Oct. 7.IBD's TAKE: Oilfield service providers are expected to be the first in the oil patch to see stock gains as oil prices increase. Halliburton and Baker Hughes are consolidating near buy range as oil bounces around $50. More rigs are being put to work in the U.S. as the oil rig count rose by four to 432 in the latest week, according to Baker Hughes data out Friday, marking a seventh straight week of increases.On the international side, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries reached an agreement last month to cut production to 32.5 million-33 million barrels per day. But who will cut and how much will be decided at OPEC's official meeting in November.Goldman Sachs analysts warned that oil prices could come crashing back to $43 a barrel if OPEC fails to follow through with the agreement. The International Energy Agency said last week that the oil market could rebalance in the first half of 2017 if OPEC sticks to its production cap.Baker Hughes' (BHI) third-quarter results are on tap for Oct. 25. Baker Hughes and Halliburton called off their merger earlier this year over concerns the deal wouldn't pass antitrust regulators.Schlumberger shares fell 0.4% on the stock market today.

50,SLB,"Schlumberger (SLB) will report second-quarter results Friday amid another retreat in oil prices and signs that even the U.S. energy sector may be faltering.XAnalysts expect the oilfield services provider's earnings to climb 23% to 30 cents per share with revenue up 1.2% to $7.25 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Management's guidance may turn dimmer. In early April, U.S. crude topped $54 a barrel. But since then, it has plunged below $43 a barrel and is now hovering around $46. Schlumberger stock has fallen more than 10% since early April and closed essentially flat at 66.83 on the stock market today.Continental Resources (CLR) CEO Harold Hamm recently warned $50 oil isn't sustainable and that a drop below $40 would idle rigs. Last month, Baker Hughes reported the first drop in U.S. rig counts since January, and U.S. drillers only added two rigs last week.U.S. production has stumbled as well. Energy Department data show declines in three out of the past 10 weeks after earlier being on pace to set a new record sometime this summer.The latest hiccups could cloud Schlumberger's plans. When the company reported Q1 results in April, North America was a bright spot, and management said that it would deploy more equipment here in Q2 as oil majors like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) shift their focus from overseas to shale operations.Also last quarter, Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard warned investors that the company expects another challenging year for its international segment as he sees a third year of underinvestment outside the Middle East, Russia and land operations in North America.Last week the International Energy Agency echoed that sentiment, saying underinvestment in new conventional projects will lead to a supply squeeze soon as investment in conventional oilfields hit the lowest level in over 70 years.But there are still some Middle East deals in the works. During President Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia in May, Schlumberger said it signed a memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco to help build jobs in the oil and gas services sectors.The announcement was light on details so look for analysts to ask for more information on the conference call with management.Schlumberger could also give an update on raising prices for its services after offering deep discounts during the depth of the oil bust. But oil is struggling to hit the key $50 barrel as OPEC's production cut deal has done little to prop up prices.OPEC compliance fell to 78%, the lowest rate this year, after reaching a peak of more than 90% earlier this year, as production increased in Saudi Arabia, according to a report last week from the IEA.OPEC and top nonmembers will meet in Russia on July 24 to discuss the effectiveness of the deal and if deeper cuts are needed.Halliburton (HAL) will report Q2 results on July 24 and Baker Hughes, which merged with General Electric's (GE) oil & gas unit to form Baker Hughes, a GE Co.

51,SLB,"U.S. crude inventories fell less than expected last week, with production levels rebounding. Crude prices rose modestly.XEstimates: Analysts polled by Reuters expected a 2.9 million barrel drop in crude stockpiles for last week from the Energy Information Administration.However, late Tuesday the American Petroleum Institute showed an increase of 1.8 million barrels last week.Results: Crude supplies fell by 1.5 million barrels, EIA said. Gasoline stockpiles dropped by 2.5 million. Crude production increased by 20,000 barrels per day to 9.43 million bpd after last week's unexpected decline.U.S. crude oil futures initially fell, dropping below $49 a barrel, but turned up for a 0.4% gain to $49.36. Brent crude advanced 0.5% to $52.05.U.S. crude recently topped $50 a barrel for the first time in months, in part due to the EIA report that U.S. crude and gasoline stockpiles fell while crude production fell. Also lifting oil prices: Nigeria agreed to an eventual production cap and Saudi Arabia said it would further restrain crude exports.Still, concerns remain about oversupply. Reports last week also showed that OPEC output also touched a high for the year, despite promises to curb production in the coming months, Reuters said.Meanwhile, Anadarko Petroleum (APC) and shale specialists such as Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Diamondback Energy (FANG) have cut capital spending with crude prices having held below $40 for so long. Oil-services giants Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger (SLB) are also anticipating a slowdown.Exxon Mobil (XOM) rose 0.4% to 80.50 in the stock market today, while Chevron (CVX) edged up 0.1%.

54,SLB,"Shares of Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) broke out into buy range Monday, helped by a rally in oil prices, with rival Schlumberger (SLB) closing in on its own entry point.U.S. crude jumped 3.1% to settle at $51.35 per barrel, the highest finish since July 2015. Brent was up 2.3% to $53.14, also the highest in more than a year. Providers of oilfield services are expected to be the early beneficiaries of the oil rally.Halliburton shares climbed 2.2% to close at 47.26 in the stock market today, breaking out of a cup base with a 47 buy point. Baker Hughes rose 1% to $53.35, topping a 52.93 buy point from a flat base.The uptick in oil prices comes as top producers met in Istanbul to discuss the production cuts agreed on last month. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to cap production at 32.5 million to 33 million barrels a day, down from the cartel's daily production of 33.2 million barrels at the end of August. Details on who will cut and how much will be decided at OPEC's official meeting in November.As OPEC cuts back, U.S. drilling is expected to increase next year. Rigs in operation will average 579 for 2017, up 29% from what's expected this year, according to a study out last month by Platts RigData, a forecasting unit of S&P Global Platts.

56,SLB,"In just the past year and a half, antitrust concerns have undone or jeopardized several merger deals, adding to doubts that AT&T (T) can consummate its $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner (TWX).AT&T agreed to pay $107.50 a share for Time Warner, but the media giant's stock fell 3.1% to 86.74 on the stock market today, well below the bid price and an indication investors are skeptical that the deal will go through. AT&T fell 1.7% to 36.68. Still, the companies see the deal closing in late 2017.The Obama administration has become more aggressive on mergers and acquisitions lately, either suing to block them or demanding conditions that were too onerous to accept. Donald Trump has said he would block an AT&T-Time Warner deal as president, while Hillary Clinton has voiced concerns.In February  2014, Comcast (CMCSA) agreed to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion, combining the top two cable and broadband providers. The Federal Communications Commission raised concerns, with consumer groups and Netflix (NFLX) also objecting. With regulators expected to block the deal outright, Comcast gave up in April 2015.Charter Communications (CHTR) moved in, agreeing in May 2015 to buy TWC. That deal closed in May 2016.In November 2015, Pfizer (PFE) reached a deal to buy Allergan (AGN) for $160 billion in a so-called tax inversion that would've allowed Pfizer to change its domicile to Ireland and slash its tax bill.The deal, which would've created the world's largest drugmaker, came at a time when politicians were already bashing tax inversions. The Treasury Department introduced a series of new rules that made inversions less attractive.In April, Pfizer walked away from the deal, citing the Treasury rules.RELATED:Forget Allergan: Pfizer Has Its Sights On This Cancer Drugmaker Allergan, Pfizer Strike Off Down Separate Paths After Merger Killed As crude prices were collapsing in November 2014, oilfield services provider Halliburton (HAL) agreed to buy rival Baker Hughes (BHI) in a deal that was worth $34.6 billion at the time. It also would've put the combined companies above Schlumberger (SLB), prompting regulators to warn of a duopoly.Halliburton scrambled to find buyers for assets it sought to shed to win regulatory approval. But the Justice Department reportedly pushed Halliburton to sell more than $7.5 billion in assets to a single buyer.Then in April, the DOJ filed a lawsuit to block the merger, and in May the companies called off the deal, which by then was worth about $28 billion.RELATED:Why Halliburton's Failed Buyout May Actually Hurt CompetitionHalliburton Eyes New Deals After Ending Baker Hughes Bid In February 2015, Staples (SPLS) agreed to buy Office Depot (ODP) for $6 billion as the retailers faced pressure from e-commerce rivals like Amazon (AMZN).It was their second attempt. An earlier one was blocked by the Federal Trade Commission in 1997, but Staples and Office Depot said this time was different because the industry landscape was completely different, citing Amazon and other competitors.The FTC disagreed and sued in December 2015. In May, a judge sided with the federal government.In September 2014, General Electric (GE) inked an agreement to sell its home appliance business to Electrolux (ELUXY) for $3.3 billion as the industrial conglomerate sought to shed noncore assets and focus on areas like aviation, power systems, and oil and gas.The DOJ sued in July 2015, saying the merger would hurt consumers. Before a judge could rule on the lawsuit, GE walked away in December. The next month, GE sold the unit to China's Haier for $5.4 billion.In December 2013, top food distributor Sysco (SYY) agreed to buy rival US Foods for $3.5 billion. In February 2015, the FTC sued, arguing that a merger of the No. 1 and No. 2 players in the market would result in higher prices for restaurants, hotels and other companies that buy food and related supplies.In June 2015, Sysco abandoned the deal after a judge ruled in favor of the FTC.In July 2015, Anthem (ANTM) said it would buy Cigna (CI) for $54 billion, creating the largest health insurer by membership. It came just three weeks after Aetna (AET) reached a deal to acquire Humana (HUM) for $37 billion. The consolidation efforts came as the health sector struggled to find savings and address higher-than-anticipated costs associated with ObamaCare mandates.In July, the DOJ filed lawsuits to block both deals, saying much of the U.S. health insurance market would be controlled by just three companies. But in August, the DOJ signaled it might be willing to reach a settlement with Anthem and Cigna to allow their merger.In October 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) said it plans to buy Rite Aid (RAD) for $17 billion, bringing together the No. 2 and No. 3 drugstore chains and leapfrogging No. 1 CVS Health (CVS).Walgreens has been looking for buyers who could help the company offload stores and pass regulatory muster. Management is also in talks with the FTC and appeared to be making progress this summer.But Kroger (KR) seems unwilling to buy hundreds of stores that Walgreens and Rite Aid are trying to divest. Kroger had been interested, but wanted to close the locations and reopen them in its grocery stores. The FTC wants to preserve the stand-alone drugstores, sources told the New York Post.

62,SLB,"Crude oil futures ended their longest winning streak as Russia reportedly said it wouldn't make any further production cuts. That sent shares of Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and other energy stocks lower, pressuring the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 index.XWhen a committee meets July 24 in St. Petersburg to discuss an oil-production deal that OPEC and the top non-OPEC producer agreed on in May, Russia won't agree to any further output cuts, according to Bloomberg.Sources told Bloomberg that further cuts — on top of the 1.8 million barrels per day agreed on last year — would ""send the wrong message"" as the group just agreed to extend the cuts in May. But another source said that there are worries that only cutting 1.8 million barrels per day from the market isn't doing enough to stabilize prices higher.On Monday, Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar Ali Al-Luaibi said he wouldn't comment on deeper production cuts until after the St. Petersburg meeting.U.S. crude closed down 4.1% to $45.13 a barrel, its biggest drop in a month.Exxon Mobil shares fell 1.5% to 80.85 on the stock market today, back below its 50-day line. Chevron was off 1.6% to 104.62.

Indexes pared losses and held within the tight trading range of the past few days. The Dow, however, hit a seven-session low.Preliminary figures showed that volume rose. Losing stocks led winners by 9-to-5 on the NYSE and by 7-to-5 on the Nasdaq in the stock market today.Energy stocks fared particularly poorly after the price of crude oil hit a three-month low on supply worries.Schlumberger (SLB) fell 1% in heavy volume. The oil-field services provider is forming a base and is close to the 82.06 buy point.Metals also were broadly weaker. Transportation stocks also were noticeably weaker, as the Dow transports shed 0.9%.Wabtec (WAB), a maker of parts for locomotives, subways and buses, missed Q2 profit estimates and lost 7% in heavy volume. It cited weakness in the railroad business.Retail and some software and chip stocks came out as winners.

The report also said deals were expected with KBR Inc. (KBR), Jacobs Engineering (JEC), Nabors Industries (NBR), Weatherford International (WFT), McDermott International (MDR) and Rowan Companies (RDC).GE shares fell 2.25% to 27.41 on the stock market today, a fresh 15-month low Schlumberger dipped 0.5%, Baker Hughes fell 0.1% and Halliburton fell 0.9%, with crude oil futures up 0.8%. (General Electric is merging oil and gas assets with Baker Hughes.)Last month, Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard said he was worried about global underinvestment but said that investments in the Middle East and Russia ""will remain resilient"" though activity won't really start to accelerate until 2018.The flurry of deals come as Aramco looks put nearly 5% of its company up for sale in an initial public offering next year. Lower oil prices have put a damper on the IPO, and the kingdom is looking at alternative means of revenue outside oil and gas to fund the government.Defense giants could also be big winners during Trump's visit, as more than $100 billion in arms sales are expected, including a Lockheed Martin (LMT) air-defense system and laser guided bombs from Raytheon (RTN).Lockheed shares fell 0.9% to 269.24, dropping just below a 270.10 buy point.

73,SLB,"Saudi Arabia has reportedly reached a deal to buy four Lockheed Martin (LMT) Littoral Combat Ships for $6 billion, as part of a $100 billion arms package that is expected to be finalized during President Trump's visit to the Middle East ally.The deal is expected to be announced Saturday, according to Bloomberg, when President Trump arrives in Riyadh. The ships had already been approved by the State Department in 2015 but the deal wasn't completed under President Obama.X A flurry of deals across the defense and energy sectors are expected during Trump's first presidential visit abroad.Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system, which costs roughly $1 billion, is expected to be part of a massive $100 billion defense package as well as software for command and control capabilities and satellite communications systems, also from Lockheed.Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner reportedly helped push the THAAD deal though by calling Lockheed's CEO Marillyn Hewson and asking her to lower the price for the Saudis, according to the New York Times.And a formal agreement for more Pac-3 Patriot missiles from Lockheed is expected as it has already been approved by Congress.Raytheon (RTN) is another big defense winner as Trump is expected to lift the Obama administration's hold on a $1 billion sale of  Penetrator Warheads and Paveway laser-guided bombs.An order for 115 M1A2 General Dynamics (GD) tanks is expected to be finalized during the visit as well.Lockheed shares rose 2% to 272.76 on the stock market today, retaking a 270 buy point. Raytheon climbed 1.5%, still in buying territory. General Dynamics advanced 1.7%, also retaking its own 194.10 entry. Northrop Grumman (NOC) rallied 1.2% to 249.84, closing above a 249.53 entry for the first time, though volume is low.On the energy side, General Electric (GE), Schlumberger (SLB), Baker Hughes (BHI) and Halliburton (HAL) are expected to announce deals with Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's state run oil company, according to an earlier Bloomberg report.Senior executives from Boeing (BA), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and 42 other companies are expected in Riyadh.
"
74,SLB,"Halliburton (HAL) said an oil price of $50 per barrel is enough to spur ""a significant increase"" in U.S. drilling, even as OPEC and its partners struggle to keep crude higher.U.S. oil futures hovered around that level Monday, closing down 0.8% at $49.23 a barrel, after diving nearly 7% last week on continued worries over increased U.S. production.""In North America, $50 oil prices would drive a significant increase in activity,"" said Halliburton President Jeff Miller during the company's conference call.International activity, however, has bottomed out and will react less to a specific price and more on overall stability of pricing, Miller said, noting that the Middle East overall has been resilient.The comments come as OPEC and top non-OPEC producers weigh whether to extend their agreement to reduce output. While the deal struck late last year initially lifted crude, the price has come back down as U.S. companies rushed to pump more oil.Meanwhile, U.S. shale companies don't need oil prices to be high, as improved their drilling techniques and technologies have enabled them to extract oil profitably at lower prices.But the additional demand for oilfield services is allowing Halliburton to charge higher prices, after the company along with Schlumberger (SLB) and others in the space offered steep discounts to exploration and production companies during the depths of the oil bust.Halliburton has said since October that it was committed to raising prices again, even if that means potentially losing customers and market share. After reporting Q4 results last January, management said it was accommodating customers that agreed to higher prices but walked away from those who didn't.Now, Halliburton has seen pricing gains in pressure pumping and well construction service lines across all its North American shale basins.""We are basin agnostic in terms of how were are positioned,"" Miller said. ""Clearly the Permian has the most activity. I like the way we are positioned in each market. Fleets are busy, and we are starting to see the calendar firm up.""Halliburton shares were down 0.7% to close at 46.75 on the stock market today, after rising 2% earlier as Q1 results topped views. Schlumberger fell 1% to 74.10. Baker Hughes (BHI), which is merging its oil and gas operations with General Electric (GE) and reports Tuesday, climbed 1.7% to 58.65.Halliburton's adjusted earnings fell 43% to 4 cents per share, above analyst views for 3 cents. Revenue rose 1.9% to $4.28 billion, beating Wall Street views for $4.26 billion.Expectations were muted after the oilfield service provider warned on international activity last month.North America revenue rose 24.4% with U.S. onshore revenue up nearly 30%. International revenue fell 8% as seasonal declines in activity were ""exacerbated by the current cyclical headwinds,"" CEO Dave Lesar said in a release.Still Halliburton expects Middle East and Asia revenue to remain flat in Q2.On Friday, Schlumberger said investments in the Middle East and Russia ""will remain resilient"" but activity won't really start to accelerate until 2018.It also reported a 37.5% drop in quarterly earnings in line with views. While revenue increased 5.7% to $6.89 billion, Schlumberger's first increase in revenue in two years, it fell short of Wall Street views for $6.97 billion. Still, Instinet raised its price target on Schlumberger to 91 from 85 on Monday.Schlumberger, which generates most of its revenue overseas, had been more cautious about redeploying its U.S. fracking equipment than Halliburton, but Chairman and CEO Paal Kibsgaard said Schlumberger plans to have its entire current idled capacity deployed in Q4.RELATED: Saudi Arabia Says Top Producers Agree To Extend Cuts, But Oversupply Weighs
"
75,SLB,"Schlumberger (SLB) finally reported a rise in revenue and said it would deploy more equipment in North America in Q2, but it warned that the global oil and gas industry's underinvestment is unsustainable. Yet with crude futures tumbling during the week to below a key level, it's unclear how much energy companies will want to invest, especially outside of U.S. shale fields.EPS fell 37.5% to 25 cents, in line with analyst views. Revenue rose 5.7% to $6.89 billion, Schlumberger's first increase in revenue in two years, but short of Wall Street views of $6.97 billion.North American revenue rose 6% sequentially to $1.87 billion, while international revenue fell 7% to $4.92 billion, mostly on weakness in Asia and Africa.Meanwhile, the number of U.S. oil rigs in operation rose by five to 688 this week, the 14th straight gain, Baker Hughes (BHI) said Friday.U.S. crude futures fell 2.2% to $49.62 a barrel on Friday, capping a 7.4% weekly loss.Schlumberger shares fell 2.2% to 74.84 on the stock market today, hitting an 11-month intraday low of 73.15.""As the recovery builds momentum, industry cash flow and productivity remain under pressure and limit the industry's ability to increase present levels of E&P investment,"" said Chairman and CEO Paal Kibsgaard in a statement. ""At the same time, the value chain remains focused on trying to capture the limited value that is created, rather than seeking new ways to collectively create more value. This approach is not sustainable, either from addressing the underlying industry challenges or from ensuring that the future supply of hydrocarbons can meet the projected growth in demand.""Kibsgaard expects another challenging year for its international segment as he sees a third year of underinvestment outside the Middle East, Russia and land operations in North America.But there are some signs of good news.Latin American revenue was flat, a sign that the market has reached a bottom in the region Kibsgaard said on the company's conference call and investments in the Middle East and Russia ""will remain resilient"" but activity won't really start to accelerate until 2018.Still the recovery ""will be led"" by North American land drilling, where Kibsgaard sees a 50% increase in investment levels this year.Schlumberger, which generates most of its revenue overseas, has been more cautious about jumping back into U.S. fracking than peers like Halliburton (HAL) have been, but Kibsgaard said Schlumberger plans to have its entire current idled capacity deployed in Q4 as deployment accelerates in Q2.""Halliburton is accelerating their reactivation,"" said Kevin Simpson, managing director at Griffin Securities, before Schlumberger's report. ""Those costs are going to hurt near-term earnings, but I think it's the right thing to do given the customer base in general has geared itself to be able to expand in a $50+ oil environment.""Schlumberger expects ""solid top line growth"" in its North American land segment on continued rig count growth and a growing market share in directional drilling.General Electric (GE), which is merging its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes later this year, also reported early Friday. GE beat earnings estimates, but oil and gas revenue fell 3%.Halliburton shares fell 1.1%. Baker Hughes lost 3.1% while GE slid 2.4%.RELATED: Saudi Arabia Says Top Producers Agree To Extend Cuts, But Oversupply WeighsOil Prices Tumble The Most In Six Weeks On OPEC, Shale News
"
76,SLB,"Schlumberger (SLB) is expected to report its first year-over-year revenue growth in nine quarters when it announces first-quarter results Friday, as the rebound in oil prices lifts drilling activity.But the energy sector's recovery has been uneven, and analysts expect the oilfield service provider's earnings to fall 37.5% to 25 cents per share, while revenue is seen rising 7% to $6.98 billion.""It's going to be a tale of two markets"" for Schlumberger international vs. U.S., said Kevin Simpson, managing director at Griffin Securities.In its international segment, which accounts for three-fourths of total revenue, Schlumberger is still likely seeing pricing pressure from larger Middle Eastern customers like government-run Saudi Aramco, which continue to demand discounts, he said.But international activity has hit its low point, Byron Pope, a managing director at Tudor Pickering Holt, who also cautioned that investors should not expect a dramatic recovery any time soon.""The North American landscape cycles up and down faster than international activity,"" he said. ""It will take time before we see international oilfield activities perk up.""Meanwhile in the U.S., Schlumberger has seen a ""strong recovery"" for some of its more high-tech services like steerable drilling, Simpson said.But the company has been more cautious about jumping back into U.S. fracking than peers like Halliburton (HAL), so any guidance from management on how aggressively it will pursue the shale surge will be key.""Halliburton is accelerating their reactivation,"" Simpson said. ""Those costs are going to hurt near-term earnings, but I think is the right thing to do given the customer base in general has geared itself to be able to expand in a $50+ oil environment.""Schlumberger shares ticked up 3 cents to close at 76.51 on the stock market today, after hitting their lowest close since September on Wednesday as oil prices tumbled, and remain in a flat base with a 87.94 buy point. Halliburton rose 0.55%.IBD'S TAKE: Oilfield service providers look to raise prices after giving massive discounts during the depths of the oil prices bust and U.S. producers will have to show lean they have gotten during the downturn. Halliburton is scheduled to report Q1 results on April 24 and Baker Hughes will announce requests on April 25.Baker Hughes will likely give an update on its oil and gas operations merger with General Electric (GE) slated for the middle of the year.GE will also report quarterly results Friday along with Honeywell (HON).RELATED: Dow's GE, Baker Hughes Eye Big Data Efficiencies As Oil Prices Hit CapOPEC Won't Commit To Extending Cuts As U.S. Output Continues To Rise

Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) shares lost 2.8% to 53.55.U.S. crude futures closed down 2.4% to $43.16 a barrel, as a recent retreat dashes hopes that oil would stabilize near $50.IBD'S TAKE: Exxon Mobil is still out of buy range even as oil prices fall, but the downturn pushed Shell and Chevron below their buy points. Chevron, Shell, Exxon and other oil majors will report Q2 results this week. In a note out late Sunday, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Longson said the gasoline market is ""severely oversupplied.""Crude oil demand is trending below refined product demand for the first time in three years. ""Refineries are the true consumer of crude oil, and crude oil demand is ultimately more important than aggregate refined product demand for oil balances,"" the note said. ""Given the oversupply in the refined product markets, fading refinery margins and economic run cuts, we expect crude oil demand to deteriorate further over the coming months.""Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, said the mood on the oil market was negative on higher rig counts and the Federal Reserve meeting this week, which could affect interest rates and the strength of the dollar.Rig counts hit a bottom during the second quarter and are now on the uptick, rising last week by 15 to 462, according to Baker Hughes (BHI). That marks the fourth straight rise and the seventh gain out of the last eight weeks.Oilfield service providers Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger (SLB) said in their earnings reports last week that they both believe the North American market has turned a corner.On Friday, Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard said global markets are headed for a significant supply deficit, assuming steady growth in energy demand. He also said that the level of oil and gas exploration activity is at unprecedented lows, so there are ""huge growth runways"" for the oilfield service provider.Halliburton shares tumbled 2.9% to 42.54. Schlumberger fell 1.1% to 80.71.

78,SLB,"Schlumberger (SLB) CEO Paal Kibsgaard said the level of oil and gas exploration activity is at unprecedented lows, so there are ""huge growth runways"" for the oilfield service provider going forward.During the conference call Friday, he noted global markets are headed for a significant supply deficit, assuming steady growth in energy demand.""It's clear we have reached the bottom in North America land, and activity will increase with a steady increase in rig count and associated fracking activity as both rigs and wells are coming out of (drilled but uncompleted) inventory,"" he said.And in the Middle East, he noted Kuwait and the UAE plan to increase production, while Saudi Arabia seeks to maintain maximum sustainable levels.Schlumberger shares rose 2% to 81.61 in the stock market today, nearing its buy point of 82.06. Rival Halliburton (HAL) rose 0.7% and is about 6% from its entry point. Baker Hughes (BHI), which reports July 28, rose 0.1%.Baker Hughes on Friday reported that U.S. oil rigs in operation for a fourth straight week. Crude oil prices fell 1.3% to $44.19 a barrel.IBD'S TAKE: Elsewhere in the energy sector, oil majors like Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron have entered buying territory, but U.S. shale exploration and production companies are still well out of range. Late Thursday, Schlumberger said Q2 earnings fell 74% to 23 cents per share, beating by a penny, and revenue, excluding the Cameron deal, fell 20% to $7.16 billion, above views for $7.12 billion.With the improvement in oil in recent months, the company has shifted focus to recovering temporary price concessions made during the depths of the oil bust.For Q3, Schlumberger projects earnings about flat vs. Q2's 23 cents, in line with Wall Street estimates.Halliburton has also said it sees signs the worst of the oil crash is over, and on Wednesday it reported Q2 results above Wall Street estimates.

The oilfield service providers could join giants like Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell in buy territory.Kibsgaard said that as oil prices rise from lows in January, the company is renegotiating contracts, warning that prices that service companies charge also must recover to close the widening gap between oil production and demand.""At the same time, the effects of the cuts that we have seen in E&P spending are now clearly visible in falling oil production, and with demand remaining strong, we are heading more rapidly towards an increasing negative gap between global supply and demand for oil,"" he said in a statement. ""This will require significant capability and capacity to reverse, and without pricing recovery the service industry will be challenged to deliver.""Rival Halliburton (HAL) also saw signs the worst of the oil crash is over. On Wednesday, the company said it's Q2 swung to a loss of 14 cents per share from 44 cents a year ago. Analysts were expecting a 19-cent per-share loss.

81,SLB,"Dow Jones industrial components Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) are expected to report relatively strong first-quarter results Friday as oil prices rebound.Shareholders are also reaping the bounty of higher crude prices, after the sector was cautious with its payouts and buybacks during the depths of the oil bust. On Wednesday, Exxon raised its quarterly dividend 3% to 77 cents. Chevron, however, kept its dividend unchanged at $1.08.More returns are possible as more cash rolls in. Exxon's earnings are expected to nearly double to 85 cents per share, with revenue up 33% to $64.73 billion. Chevron is seen swinging to a profit of 86 cents per share vs. a loss of 11 cents in the year ago quarter. Revenue is expected to jump 41% to $33.305 billion.""Neither company will really blow the numbers away, but there is more optimism relative to last year,"" said Sam Margolin, a managing director at Cowen and Company.Unconventional drilling isn't just for U.S. exploration and production companies anymore.In January, Exxon announced it would double its holdings in the Permian Basin by purchasing $5.6 billion in assets in the Delaware section of the basin, the largest oil and gas deal since November 2014.Margolin expects Exxon to get more questions from analysts about its future M&A strategy.Chevron has also expanded its holdings in the Texas portion of the Permian Basin. Earlier this year, Chairman and CEO John Watson said it ""wouldn't surprise"" him if unconventional activity accounted for a quarter of the company's production by the middle of next decade.And during its March analyst day, Chevron said it expects 325,000 to 450,000 barrels per day out of the Permian Basin by 2020.Liquefied natural gas will be another tailwind for the integrated oil majors. LNG prices went up in Q3, but Margolin said pricing typically lags at least a quarter.Overseas, meanwhile, things aren't as bright.Oil prices were up during the quarter thanks to a production-cut deal among OPEC and top non-OPEC producers to remove 1.8 million barrels a day off the market to ease oversupply concerns and support prices. The deal could be extended for an additional six months when the producers meet May 25.And rising oil prices mean more investment. Exxon will likely give an update on its test wells in Guyana after announcing a massive find offshore in March.But last week, oilfield service provider Schlumberger (SLB) warned of a third year of underinvestment outside the Middle East, Russia and land operations in North America.Exxon could also get questions about the Treasury Department's refusal last week to give the oil major permission to drill with its Russian joint venture. Russia has been under sanctions since annexing Crimea in 2014.RELATED:Halliburton: This Oil Price Is Enough For 'Significant Increase'

Halliburton is in a long consolidation with a buy point of 46.79.""Our activity outlook has not changed and our strategy is working,"" Chief Executive Dave Lesar said in the earnings release. ""During the coming recovery, we plan to scale up our integrated delivery platform by addressing our product line building blocks one at a time through a combination of organic growth and selective acquisitions.""North America revenue fell 15% sequentially, outperforming the U.S. rig count, according to the company.

86,SLB,"The second quarter was rough for oilfield service providers Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger (SLB), but the companies could give positive guidance for Q3.While the U.S. oil-rig count fell 25% from April through June, it climbed by seven last week to 447, marking the third straight rise and the sixth gain out of the last seven weeks. KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Robin Shoemaker said the rig count is up 10% from its bottom and will be up 10%-15% in Q3.When the Halliburton announces results Wednesday, analysts see the company swinging to an 18-cent per-share loss from a profit of 44 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.

In May, analysts at Wood Mackenzie said the oil and gas industry will cut $1 trillion from exploration and development spending in the next several years. The deepest cuts are in the U.S., the report said, with capital spending down 50% this year.""Customers are spending less on drilling and that translates immediately into lower revenue for Halliburton and Schlumberger,"" KeyBanc's Shoemaker said.He also expects ""margin deterioration"" from Q1 to Q2 and that weakness out of Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela will weigh more than expected on results.""The only bright spot currently is that activity levels and oil prices are rising,"" Shoemaker said. ""So in the third quarter it's definitely possible that Halliburton and Schlumberger have increases in revenues in North America.""

87,SLB,"ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Fund (SBLGX) makes a habit of staying on top. The now-$3.5 billion portfolio's 15.72% average annual return over the five years ended July 29 ranked No. 5 among all large-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar Inc.It was also in the top 3% and top 5% among its direct rivals over the past 12 months and three years.How does the fund do it? Co-manager Peter Bourbeau, who has been at the helm since July 15, 2009, says he and Margaret Vitrano -- co-manager since Oct. 11, 2012 -- stick to a few techniques, including investing in just their best ideas and investing in not one but several types of growth stocks.The results speak loud and clear. Their fund was in the top 33% of all U.S. diversified stock mutual funds last month. And their track record has made them an IBD Best Mutual Funds of 2016 award winner. The fund outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.Forty-eight-year-old Bourbeau, who is based in Manhattan, spoke with IBD about his investment approach, while he was on the road in Nashville, Tenn.IBD: Peter, you hold three types of growth stocks: cyclical, stable and what you call select. Why not just focus on one?Bourbeau: We believe different types of growth companies will perform better at various stages of a market cycle. We seek to deliver solid performance through the full cycle by owning a diversified portfolio of growth companies which we divide into three categories of growth stocks or buckets: stable, cyclical and select.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersThe select bucket of growth stocks -- which has about 35% of our assets -- are elite growers with disruptive technologies or business models. These are growing earnings at a double-digit rate. We base our growth projections on the size of the addressable market. Facebook (FB), for instance, will only invest in new opportunities that represent 1 billion or more potential users. These companies often look expensive because many of them, like Amazon (AMZN) with aggressive capital spending on its web services business, invest heavily to support future growth. This focus on long-term value creation tends to make them volatile.The stable bucket has about 50% to 65% of our assets. These are stocks like Home Depot (HD) and Microsoft (MSFT). They are industry-leading companies that are growing earnings slightly above average on a very consistent basis. It's this long-term compounding of earnings and cash flows which gives these companies so many options to create shareholder value such as stock buybacks, acquisitions or dividend payments.Comcast (CMCSA), for example, recently announced the acquisition of DreamWorks Animation (DWA). Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) last year purchased SABMiller. Disney (DIS) has the cash to expand its theme parks globally with the opening of a park in Shanghai.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceOur cyclical-stocks bucket has companies whose revenue or profits are depressed for reasons that we think are fixable. Cyclical growers maintain the growth characteristics that we look for, but have issues with a visible inflection point. As patient, long-term investors, we can take advantage of price dislocations caused by near-term headwinds to establish new positions or dollar cost average into existing positions at attractive valuations.Schlumberger (SLB) and Grainger (GWW) are two. American Express (AXP) has faced revenue pressure on the top end by (JPMorgan) Chase (JPM) and Visa (V), and on the bottom by Capital One (COF) and Discover (DFS).IBD: And why do you prefer to be concentrated?Bourbeau: We usually have 40 to 50 names. We're around 47 now. We have 15% annual turnover, so we hold for eight to 10 years on average.We're concentrated because we're looking for the No. 1 leader in a market. Those companies have the highest margins, best free cash flow. They take over weaker companies. They become bigger and more powerful, harder to compete with. They have visionary men and women. Great companies remain great for a long time. Who needs the No. 2 or 3 company?IBD: Give me an example, please, as of your latest disclosure.Bourbeau: Sure. Schlumberger's rivals include Halliburton (HAL) (in oilfield services) and Baker Hughes (BHI) (in oil & gas machinery). But Schlumberger is three times bigger than Halliburton (in terms of market capitalization), its nearest rival in oil field services. (And more than five times the size of Baker Hughes.) It is by far the leader in products, distribution, margins. It is the favorite partner of exploration and production companies and integrated multinationals.IBD: What's your Facebook thesis?Bourbeau: Its rare business model takes advantage of the move of advertising from old media to new and to mobile from the desktop.They bought WhatsApp, they've got Messenger, they've got Instagram. And look at what they've done with video. They're building apps for billions of users as opposed to some of their smaller competitors.If you're an advertiser, you're getting targeting that you never had before. It can be refined down to age, demographic, gender, likes and dislikes. Your ads' effectiveness goes higher. And Facebook is just beginning this movement.IBD: Is Amazon the same -- one innovation building on another?Bourbeau: You're frustrated as investors, seeing huge ramp-ups in capital expenditures. But you know they're also seeing opportunities that we mere mortals could never see. Amazon Web Services started as a pet project for their retail operation. They built an infrastructure that they used maybe one month a year, then they wondered how to use it the rest of the year, and it grew 50%, 60%, 70%. They created an industry, renting software vs. buying it, which (Amazon founder and CEO) Jeff Bezos says will be bigger than retail.What's next? We don't know. Logistics? Moving packages around the world? Not all of their innovations will work. And we're aware of stretched valuations. But an innovative company with $10 billion in free cash flow gives us no reason to be alarmed.IBD: You boosted your stake in VMware (VMW) not long ago. Why?Bourbeau: This is another innovative company that created an entire business, which is server virtualization. Now, that's the mature part of their business. They still have a massive lead, but that will erode over time.They have another suite of products. And creating an easy user experience to a hybrid cloud is something they're going to have a leadership position in. They made acquisitions in network virtualization. One was Nicira (in 2012). They've got deployment to paying customers. The value proposition vs. Cisco Systems (CSCO) is early, but if it works it will be a massive home run.To be balanced, the Dell acquisition (of EMC (EMC), which owns a stake in VMware) was unfortunate. Structuring the deal with tracking stock (that mimicked shares of VMware) punished equity in VMware and made a messy transition. But we're finally toward the tail end of that. VMware will operate as a public company.It has double-digit free cash flow yield. It is a very cheap asset. They've got a huge buyback in place. It is a name we continue to like.IBD: Another position you've boosted is Xilinx (XLNX). Why?Bourbeau: This is an interesting company. They don't own their own manufacturing. They design intricate, high-power chips for very particular applications like cell towers, moving massive data, programmable logic device (PLD) chips that can handle enormous amounts of instructions and can change instructions on a chip remotely.They're used in defense. There are 17 PLD chips in the Mercedes S-class cars. And the fact that they don't manufacture them means this is almost a software company in terms of margins. Lastly, this was a duopoly. But Intel (INTC) bought Altera, so Xilinx could be an acquisition target down the road, not that's that what we're playing for.IBD: Cyclicals that you like or added to recently -- American Express, Schlumberger, VMWare, Xilinx: only VMWare has average growth of 10% or faster in the last three and five years. Only Schlumberger has expected earnings north of 10% in 2017. Do these companies need faster growth to get their stocks moving? When will that happen?Bourbeau: Growth rates are not the main criteria with cyclical stocks. We target an inflection point for each. If reached, it should cause earnings to normalize and stock valuation to increase.Here are their inflection points. For SLB, they include crude oil prices reaching supply-demand equilibrium and global production ramping up. Also, 65% incremental margins, which is a lot higher than any other recovery. For AXP: normalization of business post Costco (which no longer accepts AmEx cards). Normal earnings growth rate should return in 2017. XLNX: product cycle and further application penetration as well as market share gains. VMW: we don't have a comment.IBD: How do you and Margaret Vitrano divide duties, running this fund?Bourbeau: We don't divide up the portfolio. We're devoted to the same process. But we each have a slight bias in our knowledge bases. Margaret, given her consumer discretionary and technology background, has different experiences from my health care and financials background. But when we look at companies, we're on the same calls at the same time. Our different backgrounds helps us fact-check each other.IBD: And who was your mentor, Peter?Bourbeau: The first was Richie Freeman, who has run ClearBridge Aggressive Growth (SHRAX) (since 1983, and whose co-manager now is Evan Bauman). We talk every day. He's just down the hall. We're constantly talking ideas, sports.But our portfolio construction is now a little different. Richie's turnover is zero. When he's comfortable with a name, he's on it forever. Margaret and I are more disciplined in valuation. Our turnover is 15%, which makes Richie's fund look like a hedge fund.If you look at sectors, Richie and Evan are eclectic. Richie is more likely to have zero in a given sector if he doesn't like it. That's not how Margaret and I look at the world. We have industrials, media (and something in every sector). And Richie can have significant overweights. And he is more all-market-capitalizations. Margaret and I are more large cap.

97,SLB,"FMC Technologies (FTI) and Technip announced a merger deal Thursday, creating a company that could take on oilfield service giants Schlumberger (SLB) and Halliburton (HAL).The deal between FMC, which specializes in underwater systems, and France's Technip will create a new company called TechnipFMC, valued at $13 billion.

Schlumberger rose 1.4%, while Halliburton dipped 0.35%.Together FMC and Technip had revenue of $20 billion last year, more than Baker Hughes (BHI) and just under Halliburton and Schlumberger.Oilfield service providers are looking at mergers, as oil prices continue to remain under pressure. Schlumberger bought Cameron International last year. But Halliburton scrapped its takeover of Baker Hughes over worries it wouldn't pass antitrust regulators in the U.S. and Europe.Oilfield service providers have also scaled back their workforces to try to cut costs. Technip said last year it would cut 6,000 jobs. Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes have made deep cuts as well, collectively laying off tens of thousands of workers.

98,SLB,"Halliburton (HAL) is interested in smaller acquisitions in the future to help boost product offerings, after terminating its $28 billion deal to buy rival Baker Hughes (BHI) amid antitrust pressure.A successful buyout of Baker Hughes would have helped the oilfield services company with its artificial lift and chemical lines, Halliburton said Tuesday. Now it must look elsewhere.“We are going to invest in those product lines where we are weak and look at collective acquisitions to round them out,” management said on a conference call.Shares closed down 4.7% in the stock market today. Baker Hughes fell 3.8%, and rival Schlumberger (SLB) lost 2.9%, as oil prices slumped.U.S. oil had jumped 20% during April, with Brent futures gaining 21%, but they have since retreated amid signs that OPEC is continuing to boost output and fresh indications of a slowing Chinese economy.Halliburton doesn’t think the earlier rally in oil prices will lead to meaningful activity increases in the second half of the year.“Clearly they (producers) are more optimistic about things, but I don’t think we’ve seen that optimism translated into any set plans to actively increase rigs in the back half of the year,” management said.Earlier Tuesday, Halliburton reported first-quarter earnings excluding items fell 85.7% to 7 cents per share, beating analyst views by 4 cents. Revenue fell 40% to $4.2 billion.But including more than $2 billion in charges for asset impairments, severance costs and other effects of the oil slump, Halliburton's net loss widened to $2.41 billion from $643 million. Halliburton, Baker Hughes and Schlumberger alone already have cut tens of thousands of jobs since late 2014.Halliburton also booked costs of $378 million related to the Baker Hughes bid. Halliburton must pay a $3.5 billion breakup fee to Baker Hughes after calling off the megamerger Sunday. The agreement was first announced in November 2014, but had been extended several times to try to meet regulator concerns.
"
99,SLB,"Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) called off their megamerger Sunday in the face of antitrust objections from U.S. and European regulators.""Challenges in obtaining remaining regulatory approvals and general industry conditions that severely damaged deal economics led to the conclusion that termination is the best course of action,"" said Halliburton Chairman and CEO Dave Lesar in a joint statement with Baker Hughes.The Halliburton-Baker Hughes deal was initially valued at nearly $35 billion but was worth about $28 billion as of Friday due to plunging stock prices. Halliburton will pay a $3.5 billion breakup fee.The merger would have combined the No. 2 and No. 3 oil services firms, taking on current No. 1 Schlumberger (SLB). The agreement was first announced in November 2014, but had been extended several times to try to meet regulator concerns.""The companies' decision to abandon this transaction – which would have left many oilfield service markets in the hands of a duopoly – is a victory for the U.S. economy and for all Americans,” said Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a statement.On April 6, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit to block the deal. The European Union also seemed likely to object.On April 22, Halliburton gave some preliminary first-quarter figures, delaying its official Q1 release to May 3 from April 25.The sharp drop in oil and natural gas prices has slashed demand for oil services firms. Halliburton, Baker Hughes and Schlumberger have cut tens of thousands of jobs since late 2014.Over the past 12 months, Halliburton stock has fallen 14%, but Baker Hughes has tumbled 29%, as investors saw a deal as less and less likely. But since April 6, when the DOJ filed its lawsuit, shares of both companies have risen about 13%.

Cisco (CSCO) and Salesforce (CRM) had upbeat reports that were good news for IT spending. General Motors (GM) and Uber tested self-driving cars on the road, joining Alphabet (GOOGL) Google cars, while Google held a major developers conference.The major averages continued to move sideways in a choppy fashion as the market remains under pressure. The Nasdaq rose 1.1% for the week after falling for the prior four weeks. The S&P 500 eked out a 0.3% rise while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.2%, its fourth straight weekly decline. The S&P 500 and Dow moved back above their 50-day moving averages on Monday as Apple rose on Buffett's stake, but then fell back as near-term Fed rate hike buzz took hold, pushing up the dollar. Thanks to Friday gains, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq are slightly higher for the week.While some stocks broke out -- Salesforce and Lowe's -- older breakouts struggled. Facebook (FB) closed just below a buy point Thursday, though it regained its entry point on Friday. McDonald's (MCD) fell below its late March entry area.Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s April meeting showed policymakers are close to raising benchmark interest rates again next month, surprising Fed watchers who priced in an increase later in the year. But before raise rates for a second time, the Fed wants to see signs growth is picking up in Q2, along with stronger labor markets and inflation heading for the 2% target.New York Fed President William Dudley said the next day a rate hike in the June-July timeframe is reasonable, unless the economy stumbles. He said a June rate hike is ""definitely live."" Other policymakers made similar comments. The next meeting will be held June 14-15, followed by another on July 26-27.April consumer prices had their biggest monthly gain in three years. Weekly jobless claims fell sharply after spiking to the highest since February 2015 in the prior week. Industrial production was strong in April, but manufacturing surveys for May from the New York Fed and Philly Fed showed unexpected deterioration.Existing-home sales and housing starts rose for April, while builder sentiment was steady in May.Mega-investors piled into Apple. Warren Buffett disclosed on Monday May 13 that Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) bought 9.8 million shares of Apple last quarter, valued at about $1.07 billion at quarter’s end. Midweek, Greenlight Capital disclosed it raised its stake in Apple 30.7% to 8.2 million shares, and billionaire George Soros' Soros Fund Management said it took a 3,100-share stake in Apple. Buffett's investment reflects confidence in Apple's pipeline of products, including future iPhones or even a rumored Apple Car. But it also suggests a shift in Apple's lifecycle from a growth company to a value play.Apple stock rose 5.2% for the week after hitting a 23-month low in the prior week.Playing catch-up, Alphabet's Google introduced a voice-activated Wi-Fi speaker system with built-in search. Google Home, expected to ship in 2016, will compete with the Amazon.com (AMZN) Echo.

Apple rival Xiaomi plans to ship its Android-based TV set-top box to the U.S. in 2016.Both home improvement chains topped estimates on strong housing market growth and favorable spring weather, raising guidance. But Home Depot fell 2.5% on Tuesday and 1% for the week, as same-store sales growth cooled from 10.2% in Feb. to 6.7% in March and 4.3% in April. Meanwhile, Lowe’s shares climbed 6.4% to an all-time high, breaking out of a nearly four-month long consolidation.Salesforce.com reported Q1 EPS and revenue that topped views as the business software provider signed more big deals with enterprise customers.

On its earnings call, management touted a new cloud alliance with Amazon Web Services. Salesforce stock jumped 6.1% for the week, breaking out of a base and nearly hitting an all-time high.Cisco Systems reported a 6% adjusted EPS gain for its fiscal Q3, with revenue up 3%, both edging past analyst forecasts. Profit and sales guidance was also bullish. Analysts had lowered expectations ahead of Cisco earnings due to the growing number of companies outsourcing to cloud computing service providers such as Amazon Web Services, reducing demand for Cisco’s networking gear. The lowered expectations also reflected lower spending on information technology overall.Well aware of the trends, Cisco is diversifying into newer, higher-growth segments such as software, data centers, security, wireless and the Internet of Things market.Cisco stock rose 5.4% for the week.The Energy Information Administration reported a domestic stockpile increase of 1.3 million barrels vs. a 3 million barrel decline expected by analysts. The American Petroleum Institute reported a drawdown of 1.14 million barrels. U.S. production continues to fall while gasoline demand ramps up.Oil prices hit fresh seven-month highs during the week. U.S. futures closed the week at $47.75 a barrel, up 3.3%.Goldman Sachs said that oil could hit $50 per barrel later this year as the market “likely shifted into deficit in May,” earlier than Goldman expected. But the supply deficit will be short-lived and will swing back to surplus next year.FMC Technologies (FTI) and France’ Technip announced a merger that would rival oilfield service giants Schlumberger (SLB) and Halliburton (HAL).Occidental Petroleum (OXY) reportedly offered to buy Apache (APA). But Oxy said it didn’t “have any knowledge” about an offer. In November, Anadarko (APC) withdrew a bid to buy Apache, which had rejected the offer.Wal-Mart and Target moved in opposite directions after issuing their quarterly earnings reports.Target’s Q1 EPS increased 17% to $1.29, beating views for $1.19. But sales dropped 5% to $16.2 billion, missing estimates. Same-store sales grew 1.2%, short of predictions for a 1.6% gain. Target’s Q2 EPS guidance of $1 to $1.20 widely missed expectations for $1.36.Shares plunged 7.1%, hitting their lowest levels since late 2014.Wal-Mart’s Q1 profit fell 5 cents to 98 cents a share but beat estimates by 10 cents. Sales rose 0.9% to $115.9 billion vs. forecasts for a drop to $113.2 billion. U.S. same-store sales climbed 1%, the seventh straight gain. For Q2, Wal-Mart sees EPS of 95 cents to $1.08, with the midpoint above estimates for 98 cents.Shares popped 7.6% for the week, retaking their 200-day and 50-day lines after gapping down in sympathy with Target on Wednesday.Outshining its ailing department store peers, TJX (TJX) Q1 EPS and sales rose 10% to 76 cents and $7.54 billion, comfortably topping. Comps rose 7%. The off-price retailer guided full-year EPS up to $3.35-$3.42, still shy of estimates. Off-price peer Ross Stores edged past Q1 EPS views with a 6% gain, but revenue's 5% gain to $3.09 billion missed. Comps grew 2%. Q2 and full-year EPS guidance fell short of consensus. Ross Stores fell 3.4% for the week, while TJX climbed 3.7%.General Motors acquisition Cruise Automation confirmed that its self-driving technology was being tested on Chevy Bolts after photos of the all-electric cars surfaced online. Uber on Thursday also posted a photo of a hybrid Ford (F) Fusion outfitted with self-driving technology that it said would be undergoing testing.GM and Lyft plan to road-test autonomous Bolt taxis in the coming months, and Ford has established a subsidiary focused on autonomous-car technology and ride-sharing. But the carmakers face stiff competition from the likes of Toyota (TM), Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet, which recently inked a tech deal with Fiat Chrysler (FCAU).Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (RRGB) plunged 21% this week to a 3-year low on weak sales and slashed revenue guidance. Sonic (SONC) said it would miss its own fiscal Q3 same-store sales target, triggering an 8.65% weekly stock loss. The reports, which followed a weak May 11 sales outlook from Wendy’s (WEN), intensified fears about burger competition as both value and upscale offerings spread. Wendy’s stock fell 2.8%. Shake Shack (SHAK), which popped on solid results earlier this month, slid 6.9%. McDonald’s lost 4.9%.Campbell Soup (CPB) and Hormel (HRL) reported disappointing quarterly results, perhaps indicating that sluggish consumer spending is spilling over into the foods group. Hormel, the parent of Spam lunch meat, Skippy peanut butter and other leading brands, plunged xx% for the week to a 2016 low. Q2 earnings growth was strong as sales in 4 of 5 product groups rose, Hormel also raised guidance. But its Q2 profit margin shrank to 11.9% before interest and taxes, down from 14.4% in the prior quarter. Campbell said fiscal Q3 EPS rose 5% to 65 cents, beating by a penny. But sales fell 1.6% to $1.87 bil, missing Wall Street’s target. Shares fell 6.4% Friday and 9.4% for the week, falling to a 3-month low.

101,SLB,"The antitrust concerns that forced Baker Hughes (BHI) and Halliburton (HAL) to call off their merger may actually reduce competition instead of preserving it.The combination of the No. 2 and 3 oilfield service providers would've improved pricing power for the remaining companies. But regulators have now made that more difficult with one of the biggest players staying independent.""I think this is going to make it far more challenging for some small and midsize U.S. land and service companies to get pricing power back,"" said Matthew Marietta, an equity research analyst at Stephens.The failure of the Halliburton-Baker Hughes deal also could lead to more intense competition among the smaller players and increase bankruptcy rates, he added. ""In a weird way this could lead to fewer service companies in the long run.""But Robin Shoemaker, a director at KeyBanc, said the market is ""extremely oversupplied"" and that even if the merger did happen, competition would stay ""fierce"" because of overcapacity.Meanwhile, other suitors may not immediately call on Baker Hughes. General Electric (GE) was reportedly interested in Halliburton assets that needed to be offloaded to get antitrust approval for the Baker Hughes deal but, Marietta doesn't think GE would be in the market for Baker Hughes as a whole.But two good takeover targets for GE or another major player would be Oceaneering International (OII) and Flotek Industires (FTK), he said. Flotek is a specialty chemical company, and Oceaneering is a leader in a variety of subsea products.Baker Hughes shares spiked nearly 5% higher at the open, rising above the 200-day moving average. But shares reversed to close down 2% in the stock market today. Halliburton rose 1.8%. Moody's said Monday that both companies are still on review for a possible credit downgrade.Rival Schlumberger (SLB) shares fell 1.2% as crude prices dipped. GE edged up 0.5%, Oceaneering lost 0.8%, and Flotek dipped 1%.For now, Baker Hughes is charting a course as an independent company. On Monday, it said it would buy back $1.5 billion in shares and debt of $1 billion using the $3.5 billion breakup fee that Halliburton must now pay on May 4. Baker Hughes is also refinancing its $2.5 billion credit facility.Baker Hughes CEO Martin Craighead said in a statement that the company would remain focused on well construction, including drilling services, drill bits and completions, and production services, including artificial-lift and production-chemicals innovation to help “customers lower their costs and maximize production.”Baker Hughes will cut $500 million in costs “that were retained in compliance with the former merger agreement.”Halliburton, Baker Hughes and Schlumberger alone already have cut tens of thousands of jobs since late 2014. Shoemaker expects further cuts at Baker Hughes as it tries to lower costs and continue building-back market share that it lost waiting for the merger to go through.Halliburton will have its first-quarter conference call, which had been scheduled for last week, on Tuesday after pre-announcing a 40% drop in revenue to $4.2 billion.

It was the fifth straight weekly decline, even as oil prices continue to rebound.Shale companies have slashed drilling activity since late 2014, as crude prices plunging from above $100 a barrel in mid-2014 made many projects unprofitable. U.S. crude production held up remarkably well thanks to companies focusing on the most-productive fields, with the best crews and new technical tricks. But output has now dropped below 9 million barrels a day, though that's only the lowest since late 2014.Crude prices have rebounded in past three months. U.S. futures rose 1.3% to $43.73 a barrel on Friday, near 2016 highs. That was up more than 8% for the week even after major oil producers failed to agree on an output freeze at the April 17 Doha meeting.But oil prices haven't risen high enough, or long enough, to encourage exploration and production companies to step activity so far. Some new drilling might be marginally profitable at current prices, but there's no guarantee that oil will hold above $40 next week, let alone the end of 2016.Oil field services giant Schlumberger (SLB) fell fractionally on the stock market today after reporting a sharp earnings decline that was not as bad as feared late Thursday, though it warned of further industry deterioration.

112,SLB,"Industrial production fell sharply in March, the Federal Reserve reported Friday, reviving concerns about manufacturing amid several reports indicating a factory recovery is getting started. That comes ahead of several big industrial earnings reports next week, including General Electric (GE), Caterpillar (CAT) and General Motors (GM).Industrial output of the nation's manufacturing, mining and utilities fell 0.6% last month, far worse than the 0.1% dip that Wall Street had expected. Much of that reflected weaker utility demand due to warm March weather, as well as a sharp mining decline, reflecting shale oil and gas woes.But manufacturing production also fell, losing 0.3%, the worst drop since February 2015 and defying forecasts for a 0.1% increase.Worse, February figures were revised lower, with overall output now seen down 0.6% vs. the prior 0.5%, and manufacturing down 0.1% vs. the initial 0.2% gain.But a regional factory gauge showed surprising strength in April, rising to the highest level since the start of 2015.The New York Fed's Empire State Manufacturing Index rose to 9.56 in April  from 0.62 in March, and seven sub-zero readings before that. Economists had expected a smaller rise.The report showed broad-based improvement, with order growth the best since late 2014 and the employment subindex turning positive.Manufacturing is benefiting from signs that China's economy may be stabilizing and the energy sector have bottomed. That should be good news for industrial giant General Electric and heavy equipment maker Caterpillar.

121,SLB,"Just how bad will the U.S.' slap-fight over trade, which escalated with China on Friday, be for S&P 500 earnings and stocks? Just how much can the U.S. economy, which delivered solid June jobs growth on Friday, still grow after a nine-year expansion?Analysts expect another blowout quarter in Q2 — 20.7% earnings-per-share growth for S&P 500 index components and an 8.1% jump in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters. Wall Street is betting on continued scorching results for the rest of the year. But they may not be as scorching if President Donald Trump's trade wars with China, Canada, Mexico, Europe and others become more heated. The quiet earnings growth next year might be even more muted.Analysts say the effects of a trade war have yet to be priced into financial forecasts.""I think the first tangible impact should start showing up in estimate revisions as these earnings results come out,"" said Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks.In other words, the second-quarter earnings season could offer some higher drama than CEOs' usual blanched remarks about ""headwinds"" and ""tailwinds."" Investors, even more than usual, will focus on earnings guidance and post-earnings call commentary to get some answers as to how the tariffs will affect profit, sales, prices, corporate strategy and shareholder returns.Higher costs for parts and supplies that U.S. companies bring in from overseas could mean higher costs for customers. Businesses could rethink or even uproot complex global supply chains. Higher prices on U.S.-made goods sold overseas could crimp international demand. Companies could cut or delay major investments.S&P 500 index companies, filled with hundreds of U.S. multinationals and exporters, are more exposed to tariffs and global demand than the U.S. economy itself.As for the second-quarter itself, the gains from S&P 500 companies come courtesy of President Trump's tax cuts and an enduring U.S. economy.Rebounding oil prices will lift the energy sector's Q2 earnings by around 141.5%, with sales up some 20%, according to Thomson. S&P 500 energy stocks, which include Dow Jones giants Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) as well as ConocoPhillips (COP), Valero (VLO), Marathon Oil (MRO), Schlumberger (SLB) and many others, have generally been strong performers.Analysts expect the S&P 500 financials to clock a 22% gain in earnings on a 4.5% bump in revenue, as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and other banks enjoy lower taxes and deregulation. Thomson forecasts semiconductors and internet software and services to lead the S&P 500 tech components toward 25.5% earnings growth. Tech revenue is seen jumping 12%. Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB) are all slated to deliver solid-to-stellar growth.As estimates stand now, Thomson Reuters is forecasting the 20%-plus earnings growth to reach into the third and fourth quarters.""The last time we had earnings growth in Q3 and Q4 like this was in 2010,"" Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters, said in an email.However, looking past 2018, analysts appear to have a harder time justifying bullish expectations for S&P 500 companies.""You look at the numbers going forward, you really don't start to see a significant drop in growth until you get into 2019, when again, you'll be back to apples-to-apples on the tax rates,"" said John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet.But tougher comparisons aren't a massive concern right now, analysts say. And next year's growth still looks solid. Dhillon said that for 2019 investors can expect a 9.7% earnings growth rate, ""which is still higher than the 20-year average of 7.3%.""Wall Street also worries that the U.S. economy has fewer tools at its disposal to keep its marathon run going. The dollar is stronger. The yield curve is flatter due partly to the Federal Reserve's decisions to lift short-term interest rates.The narrowing yield curve, the gap between rates on short-term and long-term government debt, looms large for banks in particular. The flatter curve, also seen as a precursor to an economic downturn, has dragged bank stocks lower in recent months.Banks also lend money to borrowers based on long-term rates, but borrow from depositors according to short-term rates. The narrower the difference between the two, the narrower the banks' net interest margins. JPMorgan, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) report second-quarter earnings on Friday.The three banking giants, which all announced hefty shareholder-return packages last month, are expected to deliver solid EPS growth. But JPMorgan stock, along with that of Citigroup, Wells Fargo and others, is near 2018 lows.When the Fed raises rates that affects the money flowing into global, emerging markets as well.""If U.S. interest rates are going up,"" Mian said, ""and an investor or a class of investors is scouring world markets for yield and returns, and if the yield and return is going up in a developed market like the U.S., then there's no reason to take the extra risk of going to Argentina or Turkey when you can get it in the U.S.""The U.S. on Friday lobbed tariffs at $34 billion worth of Chinese products — more than 800 types of products total. That's the first part of a $50 billion response for what Trump says are China's trade abuses against the U.S.The U.S. tariffs target aircraft parts, industrial parts and equipment, some vehicles and other machinery. The duties from the U.S. targeted products related to China's tech-focused ""Made in China 2025"" plan. Trump has said that initiative would ""hurt economic growth for the United States and many other countries.""""The United States can no longer tolerate losing our technology and intellectual property through unfair economic practices,"" Trump said in a statement last month.China on Friday responded with penalties of its own on U.S. products, including automakers and agriculture. China aimed those tariffs squarely at Trump's base.Trump has threatened to levy another $200 billion in tariffs on China, and even more. Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to impose a global import tariff on autos. That follows duties on steel and aluminum that have spurred Europe, Canada and Mexico to retaliate.Further trade discord could force companies to rethink their supply chains. Those adjustments could undo corporate America's efforts over the past two decades to more efficiently manage their inventories. Such practices over that time firmed up businesses' balance sheets.The brinkmanship has swept up some of the most iconic American businesses along the way. General Motors (GM) said as much last week, warning that more tariffs would lead to ""reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic American company.""Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would offer more detail, on its earnings call this month, about its plans to move some production out of the U.S. to skirt tariffs from the EU. Brown-Forman (BFB) is raising the price of Jack Daniel's in parts of Europe because of the tariffs imposed by the EU.No one knows how the Trump trade wars, and their impact on S&P 500 companies, will play out.""We expect company-specific risks from tariffs and China-trade exposures to be a central discussion topic during 2Q18 earnings calls,"" RBC analyst Deane Dray, who covers industrials vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, wrote in a note last month. ""But no one has a crystal ball on how the tariff situation will ultimately play out, especially the potential knock-on effects.""He said companies like 3M (MMM) and Danaher (DHR) looked best equipped among industrials to handle the trade disputes.The trade war also threatens chipmakers like Micron (MU). A Chinese court blocked sales of some of its chips in the country, a move seen as pushback from the nation against Trump's trade salvos. China has held up approving the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Boeing (BA) isn't subject to China tariffs, but Beijing could favor Airbus (EADSY) jets in a protracted U.S.-China trade war. The aerospace company in April downplayed worries over a trade war.Baird analyst Benjamin Hartford covers transportation and logistics companies like UPS (UPS), FedEx (FDX) and Expeditors International (EXPD). Hartford wrote in a research note last month that he'd seen no ""material evidence (yet) of freight volume weakness amid rising global trade tensions.""Some analysts, like Tigress' Ivan Feinseth, expressed optimism that strength in corporate earnings would offset any trade damage. Others wonder how much a trade war will hurt corporate travel for the likes of global carriers like American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), and cargo demand broadly. Delta Air earnings are due Thursday.""We still expect demand to grow, but those expectations are dampened with each new tariff introduced,"" Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said of air cargo demand in a statement this week.

125,SLB,"The Justice Department is poised to sue to block Halliburton's (HAL) $35 billion deal to acquire rival Baker Hughes (BHI), according to media reports Tuesday.A lawsuit could be filed as soon as this week, Bloomberg reported. Reuters and Dow Jones also reported the government's planned action.The merger deal of the No. 2 and 3 oilfield service providers had drawn intense scrutiny, and proposals for selling off assets didn't satisfy regulators.Baker Hughes shares fell 5.1% on the stock market today. Halliburton shares rose 1.2%. Rival Schlumberger (SLB) edged up 2 cents to 72.66.The deal originally was announced in November 2014, but government officials have been skeptical, concerned that it would shrink the industry down to two major players: the merged Baker Hughes-Halliburton and Schlumberger.Halliburton reportedly has offered to sell $7.5 billion in assets, but regulators are said to want it to sell assets with approximately $10 billion in revenue rather than divesting operations in smaller pieces.That's a tall order since oil prices plunged, leaving giants like General Electric (GE) as one of the few companies able to make such a purchase. GE shares dipped 0.8% Tuesday.Under the terms of its merger deal, Halliburton must pay a $3.5 billion breakup fee to Baker Hughes.The Justice Department also is suing hedge fund ValueAct, alleging that it took large stakes in Halliburton and Baker Hughes with plans to influence the deal but didn’t disclose its stake to regulators.Meanwhile, European Union officials have repeatedly delayed their decision on whether to approve the merger.

Halliburton had said it could sell up to $7.5 billion in assets to meet the department’s concerns.""The proposed deal between Halliburton and Baker Hughes would eliminate vital competition, skew energy markets and harm American consumers,"" Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a prepared statement. ""Our action makes clear that the Justice Department is committed to vigorously enforcing our antitrust laws. In the days ahead, we will continue to stand up for fair deals and free markets, and for the American people we are privileged to serve.""But Halliburton and Baker Hughes shot back, saying the merger would lower prices by combining services under one company and that they believe Halliburton offered to sell enough assets in a ""significantly enhanced"" divestiture package to meet the Justice Department's concerns.""The proposed merger of Halliburton and Baker Hughes is pro-competitive and will allow the companies’ customers to benefit from a more flexible, innovative and efficient oilfield services company,"" the two companies said in a joint prepared statement. ""The transaction will provide customers with access to high quality and more efficient products and services, and an opportunity to reduce their cost per barrel of oil equivalent.""The merger, announced in November 2014, would combine the No. 2 and No. 3 oilfield service providers, with only Schlumberger (SLB) as a major rival. Halliburton shares jumped 5.9% in the stock market today.

128,SLB,"The Halliburton (HAL)-Baker Hughes (BHI) deal might not happen, despite Halliburton's best efforts to shed assets to alleviate antitrust concerns,  as the Justice Department is tilting towards blocking the deal, according to a New York Post report Monday.Halliburton's last offer might not be enough, as the DOJ could announce its decision to reject the deal Wednesday during the American Bar Association’s annual antitrust conference, according to sources cited by the Post.Meanwhile, the Justice Department is suing hedge fund ValueAct, alleging it took large stakes in Halliburton and Baker Hughes with plans to influence the deal but didn't disclose its stake to regulators.ValueAct rejected the government's claims and vowed to ""vigorously defend our position.""Halliburton closed down 3.1%  in the stock market today, and Baker Hughes dropped 3.45%.Halliburton said it could sell up to $7.5 billion in assets to meet the DOJ's concerns, and in January, Halliburton said in a release that it plans to offer a “substantial remedies package that it believes will address any substantive competition concerns.""But as oil prices fall, companies are investing less in oil and gas, and only General Electric (GE) has remained willing to buy some of the assets, with Weatherford International (WFT) dropping out, according to the Post's source.General Electric shares fell 2.2% Monday after the company received a ratings downgrade. Weatherford stock dropped 3.2%.If Halliburton can't get the deal to close, it must pay a $3.5 billion breakup fee to Baker Hughes, so Baker Hughes could leave negations at the end of the month if the DOJ doesn't reach a decision by then.Regulators have been skeptical of the deal since the beginning, concerned that it would shrink the industry down to two major players: Schlumberger (SLB) and Halliburton-Baker Hughes. Baker Hughes has been been trading at a significant discount to Halliburton’s offer price.Schlumberger stock edged up 0.7%.The deal isn't facing push-back in just the U.S. -- European antitrust officials are to decide by July 11 on the merger, which has has already received regulatory clearance in Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Kazakhstan, South Africa and Turkey, according to Halliburton.Image provided by Shutterstock.

131,SLB,"The world's No.1 oil services firm sees the exploration and production sector in ""full-blown cash crisis,"" that won't get better until at least 2017.Schlumberger (SLB) on Monday warned that ""today the E&P industry finds itself in the deepest financial crisis on record, with profitability and cash flow at unsustainable levels for most oil and gas operators which in turn has created an equally dramatic situation for the service industry.""Schlumberger sees first-quarter revenue of $6.5 billion, down 15% vs. Q4 and about 37% vs. a year earlier. Wall Street had forecast about $6.95 billion. The company sees no significant recovery until next year at the earliest.""This 'hold-your-breath and-hope-for better-times-soon' playbook has in the past allowed the industry to live through shorter-term demand downturns while waiting for business to return to normal,"" Schlumberger said in a presentation. The major difference in the current industry situation is that we are unlikely to see oil prices returning to the $100 level because this downturn is not driven by lower demand or by external factors. It is instead an immediate result of OPEC’s decision to protect market share rather than oil price which clearly demonstrates that they still have a firm grip on the global E&P industry.""Schlumberger said E&P operators are cutting costs over the last 18 months by squeezing services firms, not greater efficiency.""The unsustainable financial situation of the service industry together with the massive capacity reductions mean that the cost savings from lower service pricing should largely be reversed when activity levels start picking up.""Along with massive capital spending cuts, that suggests that U.S. shale operators will not be able to boost output significantly any time soon, even if some wells are profitable at the current U.S. crude price of about $40 a barrel.

132,SLB,"President Donald Trump announced the U.S. will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, but oil prices stayed lower as Washington put off reimposing sanctions, potentially giving the deal's backers time to craft a fix.XIran blasted President Trump's decision, but President Hassan Rouhani also said Tehran will remain in the nuclear deal without the U.S., according to Reuters. The leaders of the U.K., France and Germany reaffirmed their commitment to the pact, noting the International Atomic Energy Agency has found Iran remains in compliance.Earlier, Trump said Iran had cheated on the deal and used oil revenue to sow chaos in the region, in part by sponsoring terror groups.""We will be instituting the highest level of economic sanction,"" he said, adding that other countries that aid Iran's nuclear program will be ""strongly sanctioned"" by the U.S.Sanctions will target Iran's energy, petrochemical, and financial sectors, according to the White House. But the Treasury Department said there will be three- or six-month wind-down periods before sanctions are actually reimposed.Countries can also seek a waiver from sanctions during the wind-down period by reducing their imports of Iranian oil.U.S. crude settled down 2.4% at $69.06 a barrel, after diving as much as 4.4% earlier, and continued to pare losses after hours. Brent crude finished 1.7% lower at $74.85 a barrel.Oil markets had largely priced in Trump's announcement ahead of time, said Bob McNally, president of the Rapidan Group energy consulting firm.If talks to keep the nuclear deal alive fail by year's end, when the wind-down periods close, and the U.S. reimposes the sanctions that were in place prior to the deal, then oil markets could lose at least 500,000 barrels a day from Iran in the first half of next year, he estimated.""The next scenario is that Iran walks away from the deal, and that risks a military conflict,"" he said in an interview.If things get that far, he sees a $10-$15 risk premium in oil, but right he puts it at $3 a barrel.Steve Wood, Moody's Managing Director for Oil & Gas, said in a note that he still expects oil prices to stay in the $45-$65 per barrel range over the medium term as non-OPEC production grows.Markets are seeing some whipsaw action because the Iran situation is adding a risk premium, while efforts to ease tensions with North Korea are reducing risk, said Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group.But the bottom line is that consumers will pay higher gasoline prices, he warned.""The world can't afford to lose those Iranian supplies,"" he told IBD. ""Not a lot of spare capacity. Ultimately, this means higher prices for oil but maybe some of that is already priced in.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Boeing has agreed to sell planes to Iran Air and to another Iranian carrier, Aseman Airlines, for a total of about $20 billion at list prices. Rival Airbus (EADSY) has a $10 billion deal with Iran that would be complicated by any sanctions that U.S. suppliers face.Similarly, European companies like oil major Total (TOT) and auto giant Volkswagen (VLKAY) would also have to grapple with getting around any U.S. sanctions for their Iran business plans.Meanwhile, some U.S. companies in the oil sector had made early moves in Iran.

France's Total dipped 0.5%, while U.S. rival Exxon Mobil (XOM) climbed 0.45% and Chevron (CVX) rose 1.3%.Iran's oil sector has been looking for more international expertise and investment as it seeks to build its production back up. Output jumped to just under 4 million barrels a day from about 2.5 million when sanctions were in place, and Tehran has plans to ramp up further to 4.5 million.Exports are also up, and jumped 16% last month to 2.70 million barrels per day, according to Platts, with India and China the biggest importers. Separately, Iran's oil ministry reported exports of 2.617 million bpd, the highest since the nuclear deal begin in January 2016.""Demand for Iranian crude in China and India is likely to remain very strong even if sanctions are imposed, though refiners in Europe, South Korea and Japan are likely to tread more carefully,"" the Platts report said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Energy Stocks And Industry NewsBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

135,SLB,"Diamondback Energy (FANG) said Wednesday it has never pushed to expand oil production just for the sake of growth, but the shale firm still has big production and capital spending increases planned for this year.X During the company's conference call Wednesday, CEO Travis Stice said that Diamondback wants to maintain flexibility and accelerate activity as commodity prices and service costs allow.""Diamondback has never been a 'drill baby drill' company,"" Stice continued.Still, the company said late Tuesday that it sees full-year production of 108,000-116,000 barrels per day, up 37.6%-46% from 2017's production of 79,200 bpd, which was an 84% jump from 2016.Diamondback isn't the only company looking to boost production. Occidental Petroleum (OXY) said Tuesday that it sees 2018 production rising 8%-12% from 2017 levels.Led by shale producers increasing their output this year, the U.S. is expected to become the world's largest producer. The International Energy Agency said Tuesday that U.S. production will overtake Saudi Arabia ""soon"" and ""catch up to Russia by the end of the year.""On Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said domestic oil production edged up to 10.27 million barrels per day from 10.25 million the prior week.Shares of Diamondback Energy jumped 6.8% to 122.83 on the stock market today as U.S. crude futures rebounded back above $60 a barrel.

Tangshan, a Chinese steel hub, has been preparing to host the 2016 World Horticultural Exposition beginning April 29, and China has ordered area steel mills to halt or slash production for six months starting late next month to thin the dense smog that hangs over the city.That has also sent steelmakers scrambling for iron ore before operations go offline. Iron ore prices shot up nearly 20% on March 7 alone.“What does horticulture have to do with iron ore? In Tangshan, China, everything!” Axiom analyst Gordon Johnson wrote in a research note this month.Gold, oil and a host of other commodities also rebounded.But flower power is no match for fundamentals. Supply and demand are still out of sync, making the rally unsustainable, analysts conclude. The recovery is already faltering, with oil falling back below $40 a barrel Wednesday and iron ore futures tumbled Thursday in Shanghai, testing $50 per metric ton.That threatens to reverse a major rotation out of medical stocks into commodity-related sectors.Mining giants Rio Tinto (RIO), BHP Billiton (BHP) and Vale (VALE), along with Exxon Mobil (XOM), U.S. Steel (X) and heavy equipment giant Caterpillar (CAT), enjoyed strong runs from late January lows -- despite reporting several straight quarters of plunging profit or outright losses. Even with a retreat this week,  SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), a huge gold-backed ETF, has been a big winner in 2016.The Steel-Producers industry group jumped 184 spots in rank over the past 13 weeks to third out of the 197 industry groups that IBD tracks. Mining-Gold/Silver/Gems, now No. 1, was 145 just 13 weeks ago. Metal Products, Machinery-Construction/Mining and a slew of other commodity- and energy-related groups have moved to the top quartile after being at the bottom at year-end.Several factors have fueled the rally in commodity prices and stocks.However, some believe commodity markets have already priced-in potential gains from the Fed's economic engineering -- and the dollar has bounced back in the last few days.""The market is sort of getting ahead of itself, and we think that Chinese demand for these commodities remains weak and is likely further to weaken,"" Morningstar analyst David Wang told IBD. ""We still see downside for a lot of these commodities, especially iron ore.”The massive environmental disaster in Brazil resulting from a dam burst at a mining facility run by Samarco – a Vale and BHP Billiton joint venture – has curbed iron production. Port issues in Brazil and Australia, Wang said, also have hindered supply.But China's flower-powered steel frenzy is temporary, and Samarco could come back online. China also continues to use more scrap steel, hindering demand for new ore, Wang said.And more iron ore capacity is set to come on line.“The remaining money that they have to spend on some of these expansions isn’t so large anymore, such that -- in their view, with perhaps an optimistic price forecast -- the project still looks like it’s going to have a good return for their shareholders,” Wang said.BHP CEO Andrew Mackenzie made similar remarks this month in an interview with CNBC: ""Of all the products that we produce, (iron ore) has the greatest risk of price downside, but we still make the most money in it. So, if we can continue to reduce the cost of producing iron ore in Australia, we can win market share, and we can still make appropriate profits.""Wang said he sees iron ore sinking to $35 per metric ton over the next few years -- eventually settling to $30, from a peak this month of around $60.The reasons for the oil-price crash that began in mid-2014 have been exhaustively repeated: U.S. shale production flooded the market. OPEC defended its market share rather than cut output to raise prices and shale output remained much higher for much longer than expected. Meanwhile, Chinese demand has been tepid.But after falling from more than $100 a barrel to the mid-$20s, U.S. crude prices rebounded above $40 a barrel this month on hopes that an output freeze among big oil-producing nations will hold. U.S. production also has started to fall, as the number of rigs in operation craters.The industry, though, isn’t taking the bait. Oil services giant Schlumberger (SLB) on Monday said oil explorers and producers were suffering their “deepest financial crisis on record” and in turn are straining the servicers.That suggests that shale producers have neither the means nor the will to quickly ramp up activity, which should support prices. But, as Schlumberger concluded, “We are unlikely to see oil prices returning to the $100 level.”As if on cue, oil prices have retreated this week amid a stronger dollar, another big supply build and the Brussels terror attacks, closing below $40 on Wednesday.The Fed's decision to rein in rate-hike plans has made gold look more attractive relative to the dollar. Meanwhile, U.S. growth has been uninspiring, but better than many overseas economies.“It’s all about the flight to safety,” Morningstar analyst Kristoffer Inton told IBD.But the money flowing into gold can flow out just as quickly when confidence returns, he said, adding supply to the market. The dollar's mini-rally sent gold to a one-month low Wednesday. The SPDR Gold Shares ETF fell 2.3% but is still up 15% in 2016.Inton remains more optimistic on gold long-term. Jewelry accounts for nearly half of gold demand, he said, and much of jewelry demand comes from India and China. Rising incomes in the world's two most populous nations through the end of the decade should keep demand intact, and gold’s cultural significance there should help protect the commodity from the tourism fluctuations that can dictate jewelry sales.Even if commodities’ boom-and-bust cycle hinges on China, the government there may be running out of ways to orchestrate a growing, consumer-driven economy.Axiom, in research this month, noted that China’s migrant population last year fell for the first time in three decades, implying “a deepening slowdown in China’s urban labor opportunities” and potentially threatening the nation’s plans to usher swaths of its population into cities.China Premier Li Keqiang said Thursday that the government has enough tools to keep growth strong and insisted that debt levels are not too high.But Johnson says that China’s credit in recent years has far outpaced nominal GDP growth.“There’s just been a ton of bad debt created, a lot of projects that were invested in that were illogical, and are loss-making,” he told IBD, later adding: “The more and more of these bad investments that are done, the bigger this problem’s going to become.”China could enact massive reforms that slash overcapacity and employment in steel and other heavy industries, or let those sectors limp along with state-run banks weighed down by nonperforming loans. Neither option is particularly bullish for commodity prices.“Any prior period in history where you’ve had a massive misallocation of capital -- Russia in the 50s, Brazil in the 80s, Japan in the 90s -- and the list goes on and on, it’s either been followed by 10 years of slow growth or a banking crisis,” Johnson said. “And we think China is choosing the former, 10 years of slow growth, via their piecemeal efforts to try to stabilize things. But we think it’s just not possible.”
"
139,SLB,"A deal among top oil producers looked more likely Tuesday as an agreement to freeze output appeared possible even without Iran, but oil prices fell nonetheless after terrorist attacks rocked Brussels.A senior OPEC delegate told the Financial Times that Saudi Arabia would join the oil freeze pact regardless of whether Iran joins.“There is agreement from many countries to go along with a freeze -- why make it contingent on Iran,” the delegate said.Brent crude closed up 0.6% to $41.79 a barrel. U.S. crude fell 0.2% to $41.45.In the stock market today, BP (BP) fell 0.55%, Chevron (CVX) shares fell 0.9%, and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) 1.1%.Producers from OPEC and non-OPEC countries are expected to meet in Doha, Qatar, on April 17 to discuss freezing output at January levels. Top producers were supposed to meet in Moscow on March 20, but Iran balked at the meeting.Last month, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Qatar and Venezuela agreed to freeze production, but only if other major producers joined in. Earlier this month, Kuwait similarly said it would join the pact if Iran, along with all other major producers, did as well.Iran currently produces 1.1 million barrels per day, but it had produced 2.5 million barrels per day before sanctions over its nuclear program were implemented. Iran has said it plans to boost output by 1 million barrels per day over the next 6 to 12 months.On Monday, OPEC Secretary-General Abdalla Salem el-Badri said Iran may join the freeze in the future. El-Badri also said that some OPEC members wouldn't attend the meeting in Doha, but that 15 or 16 countries in total were scheduled to attend.But a Libyan OPEC official said the country had no plans to attend the meeting in Doha. Libya is only producing 400,000 barrel a day, down from the 1.6 billion it produced before the 2011 civil war.""Clearly, they have to allow us to go back to our production when the security situation in the country improves,” the official told Reuters.Also Monday,  Schlumberger (SLB), the largest oilfield services provider, said it sees first-quarter revenue falling 15% on spending cuts. Schlumberger shares were 1.7% lower Tuesday.Transocean (RIG) CEO Jeremy Thigpen told Bloomberg that he doesn't see rig pricing rising for another three years. Transocean shares plunged 5% Tuesday.
"
140,SLB,"European antitrust regulators on Monday delayed their review of Halliburton’s (HAL) $35 billion takeover of Baker Hughes (BHI) for a third time.The European Commission said important data about the merger between the two oilfeld service providers weren’t provided.""Once the missing information is supplied by the parties, the clock is restarted, and the deadline for the Commission's decision is then adjusted accordingly,"" an EC spokesman said in an email to Reuters.Halliburton shares closed up 0.2% in the stock market today. Baker Hughes shares fell 0.8%.The European Commission stopped its investigation into the companies on Feb. 18 to get more information from them and then restarted the probe on March 8, saying a decision was expected by July 11.Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are concerned that a merger between the No. 2 and No. 3 service providers would reduce competition. Schlumberger (SLB) is the current market leader.In January, Halliburton said it would offer a “substantial remedies package that it believes will address any substantive competition concerns.”But the U.S. Justice Department is reportedly pressuring Halliburton to shed more assets as part of its own review of the deal.General Electric (GE) and Weatherford International (WFT) could be buyers for some of the assets Halliburton needs to shed to get antitrust approval.The deal has already received regulatory clearances in Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Kazakhstan, South Africa and Turkey, according to Halliburton.Schlumberger shares rose 1.9%. GE added 0.55%, and Weatherford shares edged up 0.7%.

141,SLB,"U.S. oil futures topped $41 a barrel intraday, but reversed lower falling back below $40 as Baker Hughes (BHI) reported the U.S. oil rig count rose for the first time in 2016.West Texas Intermediate closed down 1.9% to $39.44 a barrel after rising to a 2016 high of $41.20 intraday. On Thursday, U.S. crude topped $40 for the first time this year.Brent crude fell 0.8% to $41.20 after setting a 2016 peak of $42.54 intraday.U.S. oil rig counts have plunged over the past year as lower oil prices make new drilling unprofitable. Crude prices have rebounded, but it's unclear when shale companies  would be willing to step up activity. Continental Resources (CLR) has stopped all new activity in the Bakken Shale, as Continental and other companies have slashed capital spending.Even if new shale wells would be profitable at $40, companies know that a mini-boomlet could quickly boost supply and crater prices. With capital budgets slashed and crews cut, it could take months to significantly ramp up activity.So even though the increased rig count is marginally good news, oil services giants Schlumberger (SLB) fell 1.4% and Halliburton (HAL) 0.3% on the stock market today. Baker Hughes rose 1.15%. Halliburton is trying to buy Baker Hughes, but faces skeptical regulators.Continental Resources erased afternoon losses to rise 1.2%.Oil prices have been getting a lift from a weakened dollar after the Federal Reserve signaled Wednesday it likely wouldn’t raise interests rates before June. Oil is priced in dollars, so a weaker dollar helps boost prices by making it cheaper for holders of other currencies.Also Wednesday, Qatari Energy Minister Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada said Saudi Arabia, Russia and other oil exporters — including Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries members and non-OPEC countries — plan to meet April 17 in Qatar to discuss a possible oil-production freeze

142,SLB,"Shares of Halliburton (HAL), BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) fell in the stock market today after the Obama administration outlined a proposed leasing program for 2017-2022 that bars offshore drilling in the Atlantic Ocean.Oilfield services specialist Halliburton lost 1.4%, rival Schlumberger (SLB) 0.3%, BP 1% and Royal Dutch Shell 0.6%.The announcement, made by the Department of the Interior, marks a reversal from an administration proposal made last year in which it appeared open to allowing drilling off parts of the East Coast after 2021.""The Proposed Program does not schedule any lease sales in the Mid- and South Atlantic Program Area due to current market dynamics, strong local opposition and conflicts with competing commercial and military ocean uses,"" the department said in a statement.“We heard from many corners that now is not the time to offer oil and gas leasing off the Atlantic coast,” Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell said in the statement. “When you factor in conflicts with national defense, economic activities such as fishing and tourism, and opposition from many local communities, it simply doesn’t make sense to move forward with any lease sales in the coming five years.”Offshore driller Transocean (RIG) stumbled 2%. Diamond Offshore Drilling (DO) gained 0.55%, while London-based offshore driller Noble Corp. (NE) surrendered less than 0.1%.Drilling off the Atlantic has been banned in the U.S. for years but has been seen as potentially prime territory for oil extraction. Environmentalists have been opposed to any new drilling.

143,SLB,"Baker Hughes (BHI) expects conditions in the oil and gas industry to be ""challenging for a longer period of time"" as U.S. shale companies ramp up production, but Big Data initiatives from Dow Jones industrials component General Electric (GE) and the oilfield service provider could help create more efficiencies.Crude prices have suffered in recent months amid concerns that rising U.S. production and inventories may offset an agreement among OPEC and top non-OPEC oil producers to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day.""The North American shale segment serves as an effective near-term cap on commodity pricing,"" said Baker Hughes CEO Martin Craighead in prepared remarks for the Scotia Howard Weil Energy conference. ""And I think that's exactly why the hydrocarbon price recovery, despite the OPEC reductions, has been more muted than many had hoped.""U.S. crude futures jumped 2% to $48.68 per barrel Tuesday on reports of Libyan supply disruption but were above $56 at the start of the year. Brent was also up 2% to $51.77.Baker Hughes shares rose 1.7% to 59.07 at the close on the stock market today. GE, which is merging its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes, edged up 0.6% to 29.62. Rival oilfield service providers Halliburton (HAL) rose 0.5% to 48.02 while Schlumberger (SLB) climbed 1.7% to 78.31.Despite the recent weakness in oil prices, U.S. producers have been finding new ways to operate more efficiently, lowering the price that they need to make a profit.Baker Hughes and GE believe U.S. producers can become even more efficient with the help of Big Data.Craighead said ""intelligence and predictive analytics"" such as ""better reservoir characterization"" will help companies pinpoint where and how to drill and complete wells.He added that GE's cloud-based Predix industrial operating system will help create an Internet of Things for the oilfield, helping cut costs and improve productivity.Meanwhile, GE sees the oil and gas sector saving $220 billion by 2035 from technology-driven productivity, according to a presentation for the Scotia Howard Weil Energy conference.GE also said it plans to have 600 oil and gas data scientists by the end of this year, with 175 in Silicon Valley.GE and Baker Hughes are scheduled to merge their oil and gas operations in the middle of the year. GE said it will file more information about the merger with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday. Earlier this month, the Justice Department asked for more information regarding their deal.Under the terms of the merger agreement, GE will contribute its oil and gas business and $7.4 billion via a one-time cash dividend to Baker Hughes shareholders. The new publicly traded company will be 62.5% owned by GE and 37.5% owned by Baker Hughes shareholders.RELATED: Dow Stock GE May Have Headed Off Activist Investor Fight With This MoveSaudis, Other Gulf Oil Producers May Cut U.S. Exports As Supply SwellsWhy OPEC, Russia May Be Desperate Enough To Help U.S. Shale

145,SLB,"The recent retreat in oil prices has weighed on shares of exploration and production companies as well as oilfield services firms, like Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger (SLB), that cater to them. But cheaper oil can be good news for refiners, which could see wider profit margins as their input costs drop, and one stock in particular has drawn the attention of Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKB) Warren Buffett.Shares of Marathon Petroleum (MPC) are in a cup base with a 54.69 buy point and closed Friday at 50.79. The stock broke out previously in September and November.Valero Energy (VLO) is in a flat base with a 71.50 entry and will start the next trading week at 68.90.Western Refining (WNR) is in a flat base with a 40.19 buy point. It finished Friday at 36.75.Phillips 66 (PSX) has a longer way to go. Shares are in a flat base with an 88.97 entry but are about 10% below that threshold.But for what it's worth, Berkshire has built up its stake in the refiner in the last few years and now holds more than 15%, making Berkshire the top shareholder.The rapid accumulation of shares has raised speculation about a buyout. Last year, an S&P Global Markets Intelligence analyst told IBD that Buffett's pattern of Phillips 66 stock purchases is reminiscent of his transactions leading up to his $9.7 billion acquisition of lubricant and chemical maker Lubrizol in 2011.

Baker Hughes shares slid 0.9% to 59.41.IBD'S TAKE: Oil prices are climbing on the OPEC- non-OPEC production cut so investors are ready to get back into the game and find stock winners in the oil patch. GE and Baker Hughes announced the deal in October after the DOJ filed a suit to block the Halliburton (HAL)-Baker Hughes merger.Under the terms of the merger agreement, GE will contribute its oil-and-gas business and $7.4 billion via a one-time cash dividend to Baker Hughes shareholders. The new publicly traded company will be 62.5% owned by GE and 37.5% owned by Baker Hughes shareholders.Unlike the failed Halliburton deal, which would've combined two of the three top service providers, analysts expect the GE deal to pass muster with regulators.GE has been expanding its oil and gas operations to focus on its industrial core after selling most of its GE Capital assets.The deal with Baker Hughes will give oilfield service providers Schlumberger (SLB) and Halliburton another serious competitor.Halliburton fell 1.5% while Schlumberger sank about 1%.RELATED:Baker Hughes Sees U.S. Shale Activity Rising But Overcapacity To Weigh On PricingGE Warns Policy Uncertainty Will Hit Businesses; Trump Tax Plan To Come

Baker Hughes stock was down 3.6% to 44.90. Oil prices retreated Tuesday. Lower oil prices have pressured the stocks, which peaked in mid-2014 along with crude futures. Halliburton and Baker Hughes have rallied in recent weeks with oil, moving back above their 50-day moving averages, but remain in a downtrend.In January, Halliburton said in a release that it plans to offer a “substantial remedies package that it believes will address any substantive competition concerns.”Last month, the New York Post reported that the Justice Department is putting pressure on Halliburton to sell more than $7.5 billion in assets. Earlier, the DOJ had required Halliburton to sell $7.5 billion in assets, including its drilling assets, to a single buyer in order to get approval for the megamerger.

150,SLB,"The U.S. added a lot more jobs than expected in February, easing fears that the economy is flirting with recession. That won't push the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at this month's policy meeting, analysts said, but a move could be in play after that.U.S. employers added a net 242,000 jobs for the month, the Labor Department said Friday, ending a three-month string of decelerating gains. January's jobs gain was revised up to 172,000 from 151,000. December also was revised higher.Economists had expected a gain of 190,000 jobs. February's total was solidly above the high end of the consensus range of 217,000.The unemployment rate held steady at 4.9%, even as the labor force participation rate rose to 62.9%, continuing a gradual rise from a decades-low 62.4% in September.The number of people entering the workforce swelled by 555,000, the most since January 2015. The three-month average of nearly 508,000 was the highest since March 2000, as Americans finally decided to enter the workforce in greater numbers.But workers took home smaller weekly paychecks.The average workweek fell by two-tenths of an hour to 34.4 hours per week, below estimates.Average hourly earnings fell 0.1%, also missing forecasts. Prior estimates for December and January were cut by 1 cent for each month. Year over year, hourly pay grew 2.2%, down from 2.5% in January and 2.6% in December. Still, cheap gasoline is keeping inflation-adjusted wage gains high, supporting consumer spending.The mixed data suggest that a Fed rate hike this month is not on the table analysts say.""There are no signs there has been a meaningful pickup in wage growth that would make them act sooner than later,"" said Richard Moody, chief economist at Regions Financial Corp. ""It gives them latitude to do nothing in March.""The central bank took heat for its December rate hike, its first in nearly a decade, amid sluggish U.S. and global data. The criticism intensified as global financial markets buckled early this year.Stocks rallied modestly Friday, capping their third straight week of gains.Aggregate payrolls -- total hours worked multiplied by wages -- fell 0.5%, the biggest one-month drop since June 2009. Year over year, aggregate payrolls rose 3.8%, the smallest gain in two years.Private sector payrolls rose by 230,000 jobs, while governments added 12,000 positions. The service sector created 257,000 jobs, more than the overall employment gain, with education and health services adding 86,000 jobs.Construction payrolls rose by 19,000, the latest solid gain for that sector. But mining and natural resources cut 18,000 positions, bringing total job losses in that sector to 170,000 since September 2014. Manufacturing payrolls fell by 16,000 jobs after jumping 23,000 in January.Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger (SLB) are among the energy companies that have announced layoffs in recent months.The recent downshift in wage gains could reflect a shift from higher-paying manufacturing and mining jobs to lower-paying service positions.""It kind of struck me that the jobs that are being produced aren’t strong, high-paying jobs,"" said Steve Kalayjian, chief market technician at KnowVera, a New York-based financial technology and research company. ""These are minimum-wage jobs, if not better.""Overall, the U.S. continues to outperform the rest of the globe.

153,SLB,"The oil industry has now taught a new generation of investors just how brutal its downturns can be, with the 18-month price collapse that began in June 2014. But the industry's recoveries can also be powerful affairs, often lasting years. That fact has kept a large audience of investors closely tuned to the price recovery begun after oil scraped 13-year…
"
154,SLB,"The battle between OPEC and U.S. shale companies isn't the only cage match in the oil sector. A debate is raging over how innovative producers have become vs. how much they relied on discounts given during the depths of the price bust.Those discounts are now disappearing, and higher demand for labor, equipment and fracking materials is pushing costs up, meaning producers will soon reveal whether they spent the last two years developing new ways to do more with less, or simply coasted by on cheap inputs.The answers that emerge will not only help determine how quickly U.S. crude production recovers and how competitive domestic exploration and production companies will be against OPEC rivals, they will eventually trickle down to the bottom lines and share prices of firms like EOG Resources (EOG), Continental Resources (CLR), Diamondback Energy (FANG) and Parsley Energy (PE). Global integrated giants like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), which are both on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, may also feel the changes as they focus more on shale plays.""E&Ps will be able to handle the price inflation,"" said James Williams, an economist at energy consultant WTRG. ""But it will slow the rate of production increases, absolutely. It doesn't look well on their bottom line, so it won't be as easy to get more money to drill a new well. That's the normal cycle of a market. If you want service companies to survive, you're going to have to pay them more money.""Companies and analysts have thrown around a wide range of numbers on what share of cost savings is due to structural efficiencies and innovation and what share is due to cyclical discounts.At one end of the spectrum, EOG Resources said in November that 75% of its cost savings were from efficiencies. At the other end, Schlumberger (SLB) said last year that ""there has been little to no fundamental change in technology ... and no general transformation of the industry business model.""Barclays analyst Dave Anderson told IBD he would be surprised if more than half of cost savings are structural, estimating the real number to be closer to a third. Meanwhile, Macquarie Securities analyst Paul Grigel thinks half of cost savings are from sustainable improvements and innovation, and Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg agrees.Diverging expectations on cost growth are also emerging. According to a recent Barclays survey, nearly 80% of North American oil companies expect an increase in oilfield service prices, with more than half of them only seeing an increase of up to 10%.But Halliburton's (HAL) CEO Dave Lesar said in January he would ""be using something higher"" than 10% when calculating price increases, adding that while some cost reductions are structural, equipment demand will tighten and prices will rise.Exxon is confident it can keep costs under control, saying planned increases in its capital spending this year and through the end of the decade assume no significant cost inflation, with most of the extra dollars going to exploration and production.To be sure, several factors are at play in the debate. Producers and service providers have incentives to discount what the other says as they negotiate new prices. Different shale formations have different geologic traits that can be costlier or cheaper, though recent innovations have made vast amounts of oil recoverable in places like the Permian Basin. There's also a backlog of wells that were drilled during the downturn but weren't completed as producers waited for prices to rebound. Completing wells today with drilling costs that were booked years ago may skew a company's overall efficiency numbers.The price of oil will also be key as any further increases would spur more activity and boost demand for services.Diamondback Energy CEO Travis Stice told analysts last month he expects service cost increases to be ""muted"" if oil stays rangebound at $50-$55 per barrel. But if prices rise to $55-$60, then he sees cost increases starting to ""accelerate in the back half of the year.""U.S. crude prices edged down 0.1% to settle at $53.14 a barrel on Tuesday.Drilling and completion costs will largely determine the price that companies need to either make a profit or take a loss on a project. In the Permian's Delaware basin, the average break-even price — including drilling and completion costs, operating expenses and royalties — was $32.16 per barrel, according to S&P Global Platts. But if drilling and completion costs rise 10%, the break-even price climbs 8% to $34.74. If those costs jump 25%, the break-even goes up 20% to $38.60 per barrel.About one-third of a well's cost is on the drilling side and two-thirds is on the completion side, according to Barclays' Anderson. Completion includes fracking and bringing oil to the surface.But there is less cost pressure on the drilling side. One reason is that there is still excess supply of equipment like rigs, and improvements in efficiencies are ""stickier,"" said Macquarie's Grigel.The U.S. oil rig count rose to 609 in the latest week, according to Baker Hughes (BHI). That's the highest level since October 2015, but still about 1,000 rigs below the 2014 peak.Among drilling efficiencies, the biggest improvement comes from high-grading, or using ""the best equipment with the best crews,"" Anderson said. Pad drilling — or drilling several wells from a single location vs. moving rigs around — is also popular.Improved sensors and more effective drill bits have shortened drilling times. New rigs have also slashed the time it takes between starting a new well and moving to another well to 7 to 10 days from 3 to 4 weeks.In addition, geosteering services like those from Nabors Industries (NBR) allow companies to drill more accurately. And new lubricants from companies like Flotek (FTK) have reduced drag on drills, while also easing their maintenance needs.Labor cost pressure in drilling services is less pronounced too. Because companies continued to drill wells during the downturn, skilled workers stayed on payrolls and don't need to be coaxed back from another job or state.On the completion side, however, some of the innovations are adding to cost pressures. The biggest is the use of higher proppant loads to release more oil in the fracking process. Longer lateral wells also require more sand. Anderson said producers are now using an average of 4,600 tons of frac sand per well vs. 2,600 tons in 2014.Costs have already gone up for proppants, with sand and chemical companies preparing new rounds of price increases. Last month, fracking materials provider U.S. Silica said it saw positive momentum in pricing in Q3 and Q4, with the trend accelerating in Q1.""We'll see some pretty substantial increases in price as we go through Q1 here,"" said CEO Bryan Shinn, adding that the market will continue to tighten over the coming quarters.Producers have started to back off from higher proppant loads.Trisha Curtis, the president and co-founder of PetroNerds, an energy analytics and advising firm, said companies are now fracking closer to the wellbore, allowing them to use cheaper sand vs. pricier specialized ceramics needed with widely spaced fractures. And some companies are hauling their own water to drill sites instead of outsourcing it.Gary Gould, Continental Resources' vice president of production, told analysts last month that the company is using 1,000-2,000 pounds of fracking sand per foot in the Bakken shale play vs. the 3,000 pounds per foot other operators are using. EOG even sees its sand costs falling by 18%, saying it has multiple sand vendors.Labor costs in completion services look to go up as well. The extended pause in completing wells forced workers out of the sector, and they must now be lured back or new ones must be trained. On top of that, companies are now in a hurry to complete those wells.In the Bakken, Continental plans to increase the number of completion crews there to eight by mid-May from five now, but maintain the number of drilling rigs at four through the end of the year.WTRG's Williams expects a short-term labor shortage in completion crews as companies work down those backlogs and compete new wells that were drilled more recently.And while companies established new drilling techniques over the last two years, completions only started to thaw out recently, and producers are still trying to find the right recipe that yields the highest production.There is a completion learning curve, Williams said, and as more wells are completed, new techniques will be found. ""Every time one completion is done you get more information on how to do it better. Some of these improvements are experimental.""But developments in automation look to offset some labor pressure on both the drilling and completion sides. Repetitive or dangerous tasks like connecting pipes, sending them down wells, mixing chemicals and monitoring equipment have been automated at some sites.Nabors Industries even expects more automated drilling rigs will eventually let it slash the number of workers at each well site to just five from 20 today, according to Bloomberg.But what's not automatic is the ability to take advantage of the latest improvements. Good management still matters.Companies that allow their engineers more flexible drilling practices to experiment will do better than those that jump on a drilling frenzy and send efficiencies ""out the window,"" warned PetroNerds' Curtis.Meanwhile, there is an upside to higher costs, which can encourage more innovation, and the current environment may be more favorable than when producers were in survival mode.""The best innovation comes when things aren't booming per se but when you are a little stressed,"" said Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group. ""You have to have enough money to do the studies to innovate. But it does help to have a little cost pressure to do that.""RELATED:IEA: Shale Productivity Has Improved By 'Leaps And Bounds' Does OPEC Have Anything Left In The Tank As U.S. Shale Looms?New Ways The U.S. Can Squeeze Its Oilfields -- And Its Rivals

155,SLB,"Looking for some ideas for your portfolio? Want to boost the octane in your retirement account? Then check out how American Funds and Fidelity Investments — the second- and third-largest mutual fund complexes after Vanguard as of Dec. 31, according to Morningstar Inc. — were allocating their shareholders' money.The main lesson for individual investors? Even the smart money, in the form of these two fund families, can disagree about some key decisions.The three sectors in which their stock fund weightings differed from each other the most were information technology, consumer staples and energy.Fidelity's stock funds overall had 26% of their shareholders' money in tech, the group's largest sector weighting, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research for research firm CFRA.American Funds was well below that, with just 18% in tech.American Funds had more in consumer staples, 9% vs. only 7% for Fidelity.And American Funds had more in energy, 10% vs. just 6% for Fidelity.We recently dissected recent big buys by Fidelity, so here's a look at some big fourth-quarter buys by American Funds, whose 64 stock mutual funds were up 4.90% year-to-date as of Feb. 28, according to Morningstar Inc. The broad market, measured by the S&P 500, was up 5.94%.American Funds boosted its share count in chipmaker Analog Devices (ADI) by a whopping 43%.Analog Devices has a top-notch 98 Composite Rating from IBD, a peg under the highest possible on a scale from 1-99. The stock's earnings per share rose 6%, 2% and 68% in the past three quarters. Share price is up 14% this year going into Monday.Drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) was another stock in which American Funds made a big increase in its share count, adding 40% more to its stake.Bristol-Myers has a weak 61 Composite Rating. Share price has been trending lower since mid-July. Shares are down 2% this year but have rallied 22% since Jan. 26, when the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that fell short of analysts' consensus view and cut its 2017 guidance.One reason for Bristol-Myers' rally is that its cancer drug Opdivo recently won approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat metastatic urothelial carcinoma, the most common type of bladder cancer. It got a similar green light in Europe last year.American Funds jacked up its number of shares in Facebook (FB) by a net 39% in Q4. The stock has a good 92 Comp Rating. Shares have climbed 19% so far this year.Alphabet (GOOGL) is another name in which American Funds raised its bet, by 16% in the social-media giant's case. Share price is up 7% so far this year.Additional tech-oriented bellwethers were among the stocks in which American Funds made net new buys, including consumer electronics giant Apple (AAPL), chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) and software titan Microsoft (MSFT).But the big fund family hedged its bets in some other tech titans, including net redemptions in chipmaker Intel (INTC) and Amazon (AMZN). It also trimmed big-box building products chain Home Depot (HD).Trims did not mean that individual mutual funds within the family had lost faith totally with individual stocks. Home Depot, a Q4 trim, remained a top-10 position in some of American Funds' largest portfolios.Home Depot was a top-10 holding by $84.9 billion Fundamental Investors (ANCFX), whose 10 biggest positions also included Amazon. Three net new buys — Broadcom, Microsoft and energy equipment and field services company Schlumberger (SLB) — were also top-10 positions in the fund, according to Rosenbluth.The $90.6 billion American Funds Washington Mutual Investors (AWSHX) also had top-10 positions in Home Depot, Microsoft and Schlumberger.While Schlumberger was prominent in some individual funds, American Funds overall also made Q4 net big buys in integrated energy giant Chevron (CVX), boosting its share count by 4.8% to 70 million by the end of Q4.The fund group also boosted its share count in Royal Dutch Shell by 7.3% to 96 million.American Funds trimmed its share counts in several consumer-staples stalwarts. It trimmed 15% of its shares in household products giant Procter& Gamble (PG), soft drink leader Coca-Cola (KO) by 9.2% to 234 million and tobacco company Philip Morris International (PM) by 4.1% to 157 million.RELATED:Despite Brief Jitters, Investors Still Favor Online Leaders And Infrastructure PlaysMutual Fund Managers Cite Tech, Financial, Energy And Industrial Names They Like For '17

159,SLB,"Officials are pushing Halliburton (HAL) to shed more assets to get approval for its purchase of peer Baker Hughes (BHI), according to reports.The Justice Department is putting pressure on the oil-field service provider to sell more than $7.5 billion in assets, according to the New York Post.Earlier, the DOJ had required Halliburton to sell $7.5 billion in assets, including its drilling assets, to a single buyer in order to get approval for the megamerger. Possible buyers included General Electric (GE), which is expanding its oil and gas operations as it divests its financial operations, and Weatherford International (WFT). But the downturn in oil prices has cooled demand for Halliburton's assets.Regulators have been skeptical of the deal since the beginning, concerned that it would shrink the industry down to two major players, Schlumberger (SLB) and Halliburton-Baker Hughes.Halliburton shares closed down 1.1% in the stock market today. Baker Hughes shares fell 2.6%. Schlumberger shares fell 1%. GE shares dipped 0.9%. Weatherford shares dipped 0.5%.In December, Halliburton and Baker Hughes extended the time period for closing their merger to April as discussions continued.On Thursday, Halliburton said that it would cut its workforce by 8%, roughly 5,000 jobs, as oil stays lower for longer.  The oil-field service provider has cut 22,000 employees or 25% of its workforce since 2014.Meanwhile, rival Schlumberger has laid off 34,000 workers, 26% of its workforce, since the end of 2014 with 10,000 job cuts in the past quarter.Image provided by Shutterstock.

160,SLB,"The collapse in crude oil prices has slashed the U.S. oil rig count by 75%, but those expecting Texas to suffer an economic meltdown as it did during the 1980s should think again, economists say.First, the bad news. The Dallas Federal Reserve's region, which is more exposed to energy markets, had another bad month. While its general activity index improved slightly to -31.8 in February from -34.6 in January, it remains deep in contraction and at levels not seen since the recession.The production subindex was also up slightly but still negative, while gauges for new orders and employment were at their lowest since 2009.Layoffs in the energy sector began at the blue-collar level and are working their way up to the white-collar level, according to Patrick Jankowski, senior vice president of research at the Greater Houston Partnership.The Texas unemployment rate rose in December to 4.7%, thought it's still below the national average of 4.9%. A 70% plunge in crude oil prices since June 2014 has been a big culprit.Since 2014, Houston-based oilfield services giant Halliburton (HAL) has cut 22,000 employees worldwide, or 25% of its workforce. Rival Schlumberger (SLB), also based in Houston, has laid off 34,000 globally, or 26% of its workforce, since the end of 2014.Energy's problems are also impacting everything from homebuilders to restaurants. During their most recent quarterly earnings reports, KB Home (KBH), PulteGroup (PHM) and Lennar (LEN) each reported weakness for homes in the Houston market.Meanwhile, Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants (DRI) reported seeing some weakness in its Texas chains, and Polaris Industries (PII), a maker of all-terrain vehicles and motorcycles, also found that oil and gas regions hurt Q4 earnings and predicted continued softness this year.So, while things are grim, it's important to keep some perspective. Texas has a population of more than 26 million people, spread out in 254 counties and living in several dozen metropolitan areas and countless rural communities. While Houston has a significant exposure to oil, major cities such as Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin, San Antonio and El Paso do not.""The economic impact varies across the state,"" said Bud Weinstein, associate director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University. ""The oil-producing regions of the state have been hit the hardest.""Texas also has a $16 billion rainy day fund, largely derived from the energy sector, which can cover any shortfalls in state tax revenue caused by the oil bust. Texas also relies less on oil and gas taxes than other energy-heavy peers do.The Lone Star State generates about 9% of its revenue from oil and gas taxes vs. more than 40% for states like Alaska and North Dakota.Texas is better suited to withstand sustained low prices than it was during the 1980s, when the bottom fell out of the oil market. With help from the rise of technology, health and other industries, the Texas economy is more diverse.Oil and gas represents about 14% of the state's economy vs. more than 20% in the 1980s, Comptroller Glenn Hegar told lawmakers last month.The Dallas-Fort Worth area, a laggard during the economic recovery after the recession, currently has thriving business services and technology sectors. Its tax incentives, major international airport, and affordable housing costs have attracted companies seeking to relocate their headquarters. For example, Toyota Motor (TMC) is moving its U.S. base to the Dallas suburb of Plano.The petrochemical sector, which often runs counter-cyclical to oil, is performing well, with Dow Chemical (DOW) and Chevron (CVX) building projects in the Houston area.Lastly, limits on interstate banking helped exacerbate the economic crisis in Texas during the 1980s, when collapsing oil prices as well as overbuilding in commercial and residential real estate led to smaller Texas banks failing.Today, big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America (BAC) have footholds in Texas. Although each lender has boosted its energy loan loss reserves (JPMorgan alone increased its reserve to $1.5 billion for Q1), sustained low oil prices are unlikely to lead to widespread banking failures.Like any industry during a downturn, the Texas oil sector will be forced to become more efficient.""The energy industry will be smaller,"" Jankowski said. ""It will find a way to produce the same amount of oil with fewer people and more technology.""

161,SLB,"Halliburton (HAL) announced another round of layoffs Thursday as oil stays lower for longer, but prices jumped as OPEC and non-OPEC members scheduled a production meeting for March.Halliburton said it would cut its workforce by 8%, roughly 5,000 jobs.  The oilfield service provider has cut 22,000 employees or 25% of its workforce since 2014. Halliburton also has been divesting assets to get European regulators to approve its acquisition of Baker Hughes (BHI).Meanwhile, rival Schlumberger (SLB) has laid off 34,000 workers, 26% of its workforce, since the end of 2014 with 10,000 job cuts in in the past quarter.Halliburton shares closed up 0.1% in the stock market today. Baker Hughes jumped 3.2%.  Schlumberger rose 0.2%.Crude futures were down for most of the day but quickly reversed on news of the March meeting. Brent oil finished up 2.6% at $35.29 per barrel, and U.S. crude settled up 2.9% to $33.07.Venezuelan Oil Minister Eulogio Del Pino said he would meet with his counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Russia and Qatar next month to talk about freezing output at January levels, according to Bloomberg News.At the IHS CERAWeek conference in Houston earlier this week, Saudi Oil Minster Ali al-Naimi said there would be another meeting but also said a production cut “is not going to happen.”While January saw record oil output from top producers, suggesting it would do little to ease the supply glut, markets have been encouraged by signs of any sort of cooperation among OPEC and non-OPEC members.

162,SLB,"Halliburton (HAL) CEO Dave Lesar said Monday that oilfield service prices would increase by more than 10% this year, a higher rate than what most exploration and production companies expect.After crude prices rally, companies will demand equipment and crews at a certain location and at a specific time, resulting in shortages, he told analysts during a conference call after releasing mixed fourth-quarter results.""I don't see that there is going to be the ability for the customer to hold prices down,"" he said. ""It's going to be a supply and demand market and we will work with those customers that want to work for us.""His prediction of a service price hike above 10% follows a recent Barclays survey that found that more than half of U.S. exploration and production companies see an increase of up to 10% this year.On Friday, competitor Schlumberger (SLB) said the company needs ""significantly higher pricing before we get into a sustainable operating environment"" and that it was in ""active pricing conversations with customers.""Halliburton shares closed down 2.9% at 54.80 on the stock market today.

Revenue fell to $4.02 billion, below views for $4.09 billion. North American revenue grew 9% sequentially to $1.8 billion. International revenue rose 2% sequentially to $2.2 billion.Edward Jones analyst Rob Desai had said he was expecting Halliburton to benefit more from its exposure to North America in Q4.""Despite the positive sentiment surrounding the North American land market, it is important to remember that our world is still a tale of two cycles,"" Lesar said in the earnings release. ""The North America market appears to have rounded the corner, but the international downward cycle is still playing out.""Halliburton also said that North American revenue would grow in line with rig count this year.

But the rebound in crude has boosted demand for services and materials, and rival Halliburton (HAL) has said it is ready to increase prices, even if it means losing some market share.Schlumberger said exploration and production investments in North America will increase by 30% this year with the biggest growth seen in the Permian basin, ""which should lead to both higher activity and a long overdue recovery in service industry pricing.""""On fracking, we need significantly higher pricing before we get into a sustainable operating environment,"" CEO Paal Kibsgaard said during a conference call with analysts.

165,SLB,"Analysts see Schlumberger's (SLB) fourth-quarter earnings and revenue falling due to steep discounts offered during the period, but it's unclear whether the oilfield service provider will reverse the tide and announce price increases for 2017.Schlumberger's earnings are expected to plunge 58.5% to 27 cents per share with revenue down 8.7% to $7.07 billion when the company announces quarterly results Friday. Part of the reason is that Schlumberger and other oilfield service providers slashed prices during oil's downturn.Now that oil price have gone up in the wake of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' deal to cut output, the question is whether service providers will raise prices. In November, Halliburton (HAL) said it's open to increasing its prices even if it means losing some customers.And oil firms seem ready for price hikes. Nearly 80% of U.S. exploration and production companies expect an increase in field service prices, a recent Barclays survey showed. More than half, though, only see an increase of up to 10%.Schlumberger shares fell 0.3% to 87.21 on the stock market today. Halliburton, which reports next week, rose 0.4%. Baker Hughes (BHI) shares advanced 0.4% also.Analysts don't see international service price increases until later this year or early next year.On Thursday, sources told Reuters that Halliburton signed a $210 million deal to drill 30 wells for Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) in Iraq's Majnoon field. Shell shares dipped 0.6%.The deal comes after sources told Reuters in November that Shell was considering exiting Iraq.Iraq had been a major opponent of the OPEC production cut and wanted to be exempt as it needs oil revenue to fight the Islamic State.Earlier this month Reuters and Bloomberg said Iraq was boosting exports from Basra field. Iraq's prime minster accused the autonomous Kurdish region of exporting more than what it was allowed.RELATED:U.S. Oil Rig Count Falls, But Crude Caps 3% Weekly Slide

166,SLB,"As Donald Trump assumes the presidency and the GOP Congress works to kill ObamaCare, General Electric (GE) CEO Jeff Immelt said Friday that some customers could become more cautious.Still, the industrial conglomerate sees better prospects for its healthcare business internationally as the middle class grows in other nations.""If I took it by segment, the Affordable Care Act is getting the most attention in the media and by our customers,"" Immelt said on a conference call after reporting mixed Q4 results. ""I think you could see some caution around the Affordable Care Act as you go forward. We haven't really seen that much. But that could happen.""GE also said it was more upbeat about the U.S. economy and sees ""strengthening"" in Europe, while oil-related markets are ""stabilizing,"" helped by OPEC's deal to curb oil production.But Q4 offered up a lot of what Wall Street had heard for much of 2016: slow growth, volatility and ongoing weakness in the oil sector. And some on the Street may have been concerned about sales in the company's reliable power segment.Organic revenue and orders, two much-watched figures, fell 1% and 3%, respectively. Oil and gas revenue and transportation revenue — which respectively sank 22% and 23% in Q4 — have weighed on the industrial giant's results due weaker commodity demand.""It's largely a repeat of what we heard in the previous several quarters in 2016,"" Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau said.Earnings per share fell 12% to 46 cents, matching estimates. Revenue slipped 2% to $33.1 billion, missing forecasts for $33.63 billion. GE backed its 2017 organic growth target of 3%-5%.Aviation revenue rose 7%, as air carriers update their fleets with planes containing GE's engines. Renewable energy revenue jumped 29%. Healthcare revenue increased 3%. Power systems revenue rose 20%.""I think there's some concern more in that power business that sales were weaker than expected,"" Windau said. ""Some of those orders or shipments got pushed out into 2017.""GE this week said it secured more than $1.4 billion in orders from the Iraqi government to develop power plants.Shares fell 2.2% to 30.53 on the stock market today, dropping below their 200-day line and slipping further below a buy point of 31.59 after breaking out last month.General Electric in recent years has tried to focus more on its industrial roots — and become more of a tech company. GE's oil and gas unit will merge with oilfield services provider Baker Hughes (BHI) this year.Baker Hughes edged up 2 cents to 61.98. Rival Schlumberger (SLB), which also reported results Friday, fell 0.8%, and Halliburton (HAL) climbed 2% ahead of its report Monday.IBD'S TAKE: General Electric has attempted to turn more into a tech company, with a big, long-term focus on the so-called Industrial Internet. GE, like other industrials, had warned of a slow-growth environment due to the rout in commodity prices and a sluggish global economy. Several big industrial companies will follow GE's report next week.United Technologies (UTX) reports Q4 results early Wednesday: EPS up 14% to $1.56 with revenue essentially flat at $14.7 billion. Caterpillar (CAT) reports early Thursday: EPS down 11% to 66 cents as revenue slides 10.8% to $9.84 billion. Honeywell (HON) reports early next Friday: EPS up 10% to $1.74 with revenue up 1.7% to $10.15 billion.Some analysts say investors could be focused more on how GE and other industrials might do in the second half of this year and beyond, when oil and commodity prices may rebound more strongly and policies under the incoming Trump administration become more concrete.""These things, from an economic perspective, are taking time to work their way through the system,"" Windau said.RELATED:General Electric Stock Near Buy Zone Ahead Of Q4 Report

170,SLB,"North American oil companies will boost exploration and production spending by 27% in 2017 after sharp drops in the prior two years, though higher oilfield service costs will account for some of the increase, according to Barclays analysts Monday.U.S. crude futures fell 3.8% to settle at $51.96 a barrel, the lowest since mid-December, amid worries ramped-up U.S. production will offset cuts from OPEC.Barclays sees large-cap companies in North America increasing upstream outlays by 58%, with small- and midcap companies spending 43% more.

But as prices climbed last year, they signaled they could take back those concession with, Halliburton saying it's open to increasing its prices even if it means losing some customers.Nearly 80% of E&P companies expect an increase in field service prices, the Barclays survey showed, but over half of them only see an increase of up to 10%.Halliburton shares fell 1% to close at 56.07 on the stock market today.

172,SLB,"Are energy stocks and mutual funds about to run out of gas? Or have they still got fuel in their tanks? Energy-focused stock mutual funds have been turbocharged during the past year. They've gained roughly twice as much on average as the broad market in the form of the S&P 500, in the 12 months ended Jan 18. Their average 12-month trailing yield is more than double the S&P 500's.In addition, they've outperformed and provided higher yield than income-oriented stock mutual funds overall as well.Many companies involved with energy production have highly appreciated share prices. The question going forward is, can they keep it up?Their kissing cousins, power utilities, have the opposite problem. Many have sold off, giving a big boost to their dividend yields. Seen by many investors as proxies for bonds, many utilities sold off in the run-up to the Federal Reserve's December interest rate hike and the prospect of future hikes. So, can these rally?Robin Wehbe, a manager of $313.7 million Dreyfus Natural Resources (DLDRX), says energy stocks still have room to run in part because the oil downturn forced many to begin cutting costs. Ongoing cost-cutting combined with stable oil prices around $50 a barrel or higher assures many oil services firms of a path to profitability, he says.Skip Aylesworth, co-manager of $1.4 billion Hennessy Gas Utility (GASFX), says many natural gas distribution companies are now geared to be profitable with the price of gas above $3 per million metric British thermal units (mmBTU), and the fuel is above that threshold.In addition, many state regulators have begun to offer local and regional utilities rate formulas that are more profitable if the utilities replace aging underground pipes. Pipe replacement is often a 10- to 20-year process, Aylesworth says. So incentives can give utilities a way to transform 2% to 3% annual earnings into 9% to 11% for decades, he adds.Jay Hatfield, manager of InfraCap MLP ETF (AMZA), expects oil to break out of its $50 to $55 range and trade as high as $70 as the summer driving season approaches. Energy infrastructure MLPs should benefit, he says, as many are still trading at what he sees as oversold prices.IBD's TAKE: This IBD report looks at strategies for deriving income from dividend stocks at a time when rising interest rates are clobbering bonds and bond proxies.The stakes are high.Energy-focused stock funds' average gain of 55.55% over the past 12 months more than tripled the 17.85% average gain by all income-oriented stock mutual funds in that span. And their 4.56% 12-month yield more than doubled the 1.87% average yield of income-oriented stock funds.Many funds categorized as growth & income had zero or little yield in that year.Reflecting the outperformance and excess yield of energy-focused funds in the past 12 months, the bulk of all top-performing income-oriented stock funds were energy sector funds or energy-focused master limited partnership (MLP) funds. The latter invest in MLPs whose business tends to be running energy pipeline companies.There is a similar predominance of energy funds when you look at just portfolios with $100 million or more in assets.Among the top holdings in Wehbe's fund are oil and gas field services companies Schlumberger (SLB) and Halliburton (HAL). Wehbe, who did not discuss individual names, said, ""Field services stand out uniquely (in the energy space)."" There is little new need for large extraction equipment, he says. There is greater need for services and small equipment.""Tightness will come from the short-cycle consumables business,"" he added. ""We mean valves and measurement tools, things from something like a hardware store for the oil patch.""Schlumberger and Halliburton have modest Composite Ratings of 50 and 55 from IBD. Their dividend yields are 2.3% and 1.3%.An energy infrastructure MLP that Hatfield likes is Apache (APA). ""If we are correct about the oil markets (surging in per-barrel price to nearly 70), energy stocks and energy infrastructure MLPs are very likely to outperform the market,"" he said. ""We like Apache, which trades at a reasonable multiple of 2017 Ebitda, has exposure to the attractive Permian basin and has been discussed as a potential takeover candidate.""Its Composite Rating from IBD is a weak 43.Aylesworth, who focuses mainly on natural gas distributors, says there has been a lot of consolidation in the local distribution company (LDC) market. Nova Scotia-based Emera completed its acquisition of Tampa, Fla.-based TECO Energy last July. ""M&A activity in that space will continue,"" Aylesworth said. ""The acquirers keep getting stronger.""For Emera, that takeover boosted its exposure to rate-regulated markets, which provides stability to revenue and earnings. At the same time, it provides Emera entry to a growing market.Trading around 46, the stock is 8% below its July 7 high.Aylesworth also likes Tulsa-based ONE Gas (OGS), which he describes as a local distributor in regulated markets. He likes the fact that the company has an expanding footprint in communities that are growing in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. Last week the utility raised its quarterly dividend by 7 cents per share to 42 cents, resulting in a $1.68 per share dividend and a yield of 2.7%.Like Atmos Energy (ATO), another local distribution pure play, ""these companies are pretty fully valued, but earnings will continue to grow,"" he said. ""They're good mom-and-pop investments.""ONE Gas has a weak 54 Comp Rating. It has bounced off its 10- and 40-week moving averages. Trading around 64, it is not far from its all-time high above 67 in July. Atmos, with a weak 59 Comp Rating, is also trying to stay above its short- and long-term moving averages. Trading around 75, it's not far from last July's high near 82.Calgary-based TransCanada (TRP) and Enbridge (ENB) both operate major long-distance energy pipeline networks. TransCanada's network extends from Canada into Mexico. Enbridge's extends east and west as well as north-south. In long-distance pipelines, ""these are these are the big kahunas,"" Aylesworth said. ""They have good balance sheets and histories of increasing dividends.""TransCanada has a so-so Comp Rating of 75. Its dividend yield is 3.6%. Enbridge's is 3.7%. It has a weak 46 Comp Rating. Both are trading near their September highs.RELATED:Leading Stocks That Are Driving A Hot Mutual Fund's RallyWhere Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock Gains In 2017

176,SLB,"Iran qualified 29 international oil companies to bid in tenders for crude and natural gas development projects as the Persian Gulf state seeks investment in energy.China National Petroleum, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Total (TOT) are among the companies that will be invited to bid in tenders, according to a list published Monday on the website of National Iranian Oil. Total, along with Lukoil (LUKOY) and the oil unit of Gazprom (OGZPY), are some of the companies on the list that have already signed preliminary agreements with Iran to study oilfields for potential future development.State producer NIOC will hold its first tender in late January to seek partners for a project to develop the South Azadegan oilfield, the Iranian Students News Agency reported Tuesday, citing NIOC Managing Director Ali Kardor. Shell and Malaysia's Petroliam Nasional both signed preliminary agreements last month to conduct development studies at Azadegan and other oilfields.Iran aims to attract more than $100 billion in foreign investment to speed growth in its energy industry after sanctions cut international companies' involvement in developing the world's fourth-largest oil reserves. Since sanctions eased last January, the producer has doubled exports as crude prices rallied. Brent crude gained 52% last year and was at $58.10 a barrel at 2:02 p.m. in London.The country boosted oil production last year by 870,000 barrels a day to 3.67 million by November, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While the country has reached several initial agreements with international companies, it has yet to sign any concrete deals to boost crude production since Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh outlined more than 50 potential projects at a Tehran conference in November 2015. Zanganeh said at the time that the country was targeting about 5.7 million barrels a day of crude and condensate production early in the next decade.Companies from Italy, Spain, Japan and India also made the list. U.S. oil services provider Schlumberger (SLB) was among those identified, according to the NIOC website. U.S. sanctions legislation prevents companies based in that country from investing in Iran's energy industry, while foreign subsidiaries of American entities are allowed to operate in the Persian Gulf country.

182,SLB,"General Electric (GE) and Baker Hughes (BHI) said Monday that they will combine their oil and gas operations. Unlike the failed Baker Hughes merger with Halliburton (HAL), analysts say this deal will pass regulators.GE shareholders will own 62.5% of the ""new"" Baker Hughes, while Baker Hughes shareholders will own 37.5% and receive a one-time cash dividend of $17.50 per share.The deal will add 4 cents per share to GE's earnings by 2018 and 8 cents by 2020.GE CEO Jeff Immelt will be the chairman of the new company and Lorenzo Simonelli,  CEO of GE Oil & Gas, will be CEO. Baker Hughes CEO Martin Craighead will be vice chairman.General Electric shares fell 12 cents to 29.10 at the close the stock market today after rising to 29.65 early. Baker Hughes stock, which initially popped to 62.16, reversed and tumbled 6.3% to 55.40. That erased virtually all of Friday's 8.4% pop after GE confirmed it was in talks with Baker Hughes.The GE deal comes after a failed Halliburton takeover bid that ended earlier this year after the Justice Department filed suit to block the deal on antitrust grounds.""There's not really any significant overlap,"" said Robin Shoemaker, equity research analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets. ""I don't think there is much for the DOJ to object to here.""Halliburton shares fell 1.3% to 46.Crude oil futures weren't helping energy stocks. U.S. crude closed down 3.8% to $46.86 a barrel, extending last week's big drop as OPEC and big oil producers failed to agree on specific production curbs for individual countries. That raised doubts about whether a deal will take place in late November as planned.Despite the downturn in oil prices, GE has been focused on expanding its oil and gas and industrial operations after shedding most of its GE Capital assets.""They've made some acquisitions in a much stronger oil-price environment, so now was an opportunity to make their largest acquisitions close to the low point in the business cycle. They were able to do this without paying a significant premium,"" Shoemaker said.Last year GE aquired power generation giant Alstom and bought lift equipment maker Lufkin Industires in 2013.Shoemaker also believes that Schlumberger (SLB) and Halliburton will have a ""stronger competitor""  because of the deal, but smaller firms with their own niche market space won't be affected.Schlumberger shares were off 1.2% to 78.23.IBD'S TAKE: After GE Capital nearly brought down the company during the financial crisis, GE shifted its focus to its industrial core. The company -- already a leader in jet engines, wind turbines and locomotives -- also wants to be e leader in industrial internet technology.GE said late Thursday that it was in talks with Baker Hughes about an alliance, but not an outright purchase.""We are in discussion with Baker Hughes,"" GE spokeswoman Deidre Latour said in a statement.

General Electric, which set an eight-month closing low on Thursday, climbed 2.1% to 29.22.Baker Hughes had broken out of a base on Tuesday, hitting a 52-week high after reporting a smaller-than-expected loss. With oil prices rising, demand for oil services is rising. But Halliburton and Schlumberger have said pricing remains tough and that they will prioritize profits over market share.Halliburton in 2014 agreed to buy Baker Hughes for 78.62 a share, or $35 billion.

185,SLB,"Halliburton (HAL) is still in a ""brawl"" on pricing with competitors, despite the recent rebound in crude and drilling activity, and signaled Wednesday it's open to increasing its prices even if it means losing some customers.The oilfield services provider and rivals like Schlumberger (SLB) slashed the prices they charged during the depths of the oil bust. As oil headed back up this year, they indicated such discounts would be taken back.But Halliburton CEO Dave Lesar said on a conference call that while the industry can see ""the light at the end of the tunnel"" and unconventional drilling was leading the oil price recovery, the market is still ""very challenging.""The company doesn't expect activity in North America to increase in Q4 as customer activity is typically lower on holiday- and weather-related closures. Lesar said some customers were delaying drilling ramp-ups until Q1. By then, they could see higher prices.""We have the highest market share that we've ever had in the U.S.,"" Lesar said. ""If we have to give some of it back to move margins up, we might take that approach.""Halliburton reported Q3 earnings per share of a penny vs. analysts' views for a loss of 7 cents, prompting Lesar to say, ""I never thought I would be so satisfied by barely making a profit.""Revenue sank 31% to $3.83 billion, below views for $3.89 billion. Operating margin jumped to 3.3% from 0.8% a year ago.Edward Jones analyst Rob Desai said Halliburton should see pricing improvements on services in North America in Q4 or Q1, but it could be a year before prices rise internationally.""Schlumberger mentioned previously that in some of their contracts they had an oil price slider,"" he told IBD. ""They gave a lot of discounts, but if oil prices improved they had to get better pricing. I think there is a similar case at Halliburton.""Halliburton shares were up 4.25% to 49.07 on the stock market today, gapping up above buying range after bobbing above and below its entry point for the last week. Schlumberger (SLB) rose 2.5% to 83.44 clearing an 82.54 buy point. Baker Hughes (BHI) rallied 2.4% to 52.83, closing just below a 52.93 pivot after breaking out last week.Also adding momentum to shares in the energy sector was a rally in oil prices, helped by a drop in U.S. crude inventories.IBD'S TAKE: Oilfield service providers are expected to be the first in the oil patch to see stock gains as oil prices increase. Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes are near buy range as oil bounces around $50. Desai, who now sees Halliburton breaking even in Q4 vs. a prior view of a loss of 10 cents a share, said the oil price needed for renewed activity has been falling, but doesn't expect it to fall much below $50 per barrel as drilling-improvement gains are maxed out.On the conference call, Lesar maintained that ""significant activity increases starts with sustainable commodity prices of over $50 per barrel.""Schlumberger reports Thursday.

Among shale producers, Continental Resources (CLR) edged 0.25% lower and Diamondback Energy (FANG) dipped less than 0.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Shale stocks like EOG, Concho and Pioneer Natural are making gains heading into buy range or extending above buy range as oil prices bounce around $50 per barrel. While rig counts in the U.S. have been on the rise, on its Q3 conference call this week, Halliburton (HAL) CEO Dave Lesar maintained that ""significant activity increases start with sustainable commodity prices of over $50 per barrel.""Lesar also said that while the industry can see ""the light at the end of the tunnel"" and U.S. unconventional drilling was leading the oil price recovery, the market is still ""very challenging.""He doesn't see North American drilling picking up in Q4, due to downtime and closures caused by seasonal weather and the holidays.Both Halliburton and Schlumberger (SLB), which reported earnings late Thursday, signaled that they'll focus on profits over market share as pricing for oil services remains difficult.Halliburton shares ended 0.7% lower but still in buy range from Wednesday's breakout.

187,SLB,"The number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. fell for the 14th time in 15 weeks, as top shale firms hold off on completing wells.Baker Hughes (BHI) said Friday that the rig count fell by 13 to 400 in the past week, the lowest level since December 2009 and down from a peak of 1,609 in October 2014.The number of natural gas rigs ticked up to 102 from 101, despite prices hitting a 17-year low during the week.Crude prices rallied for most of Friday as pipeline issues in Iraq and Nigeria are expected to keep 800,000 barrels temporarily off the market. But they reversed lower, with Brent futures closing down 0.5% at $35.10 a barrel and U.S. oil down 0.9% at $32.78.The oil bust and the collapse in drilling activity have hit oilfield service providers especially hard, with the pain continuing as prices stay lower for longer.On Thursday, Halliburton (HAL) said it would cut its workforce by another 8%, roughly 5,000 jobs. Since 2014, the company has slashed 22,000 employees, or 25% of its workforce. Halliburton also has been divesting assets to get European regulators to approve its acquisition of Baker Hughes.Rival Schlumberger (SLB) has laid off 34,000 workers, or 26% of its workforce, since the end of 2014, including 10,000 cuts in in the past quarter.Baker Hughes shares closed up 2.3% in the stock market today. Halliburton rose 0.95%. Schlumberger edged up 0.2%.The new round of  layoffs come as U.S. shale drillers stop completion activities in the massive Bakken shale formation.Late Wednesday, Continental Resources (CLR) said it stopped fracking operations in the Bakken. It already had planned to defer most completions in the North Dakota play in 2016.It has four operated drilling rigs in the North Dakota Bakken, with plans to maintain that level through the year, but said it has no stimulation crews deployed there.Also late Wednesday, Whiting Petroleum (WLL) said it will stop completing wells and cut its 2016 capital spending budget by 80% from 2015 to $500 million.Shale companies hope that by leaving wells drilled but not completed, they can bring back production quickly once oil prices rise. Fracking a well normally accounts for two-thirds of a well’s total production costs.While oil companies are trying to save money by operating fewer rigs and slashing budgets, their debt ratings are in jeopardy as lower revenue and investment will likely hurt companies for the next four years.Late Thursday, Moody's put Chevron (CVX) on review for a downgrade on expected negative free cash flow and changed Exxon Mobil’s (XOM) debt rating outlook to negative, as lower capital reinvestment will likely haunt the oil major for the rest of the decade.The ratings agency also downgraded ConocoPhillips’ (COP), Marathon Oil’s (MRO), Devon Energy’s (DVN) and Apache’s (APA) senior unsecured ratings with a negative outlooks late Thursday. It also cut ratings on EOG Resources (EOG) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY), but sees a stable outlook.Image provided by Shutterstock.
"
188,SLB,"Drilling activity has crashed, but efficiencies and American ingenuity have helped make each well far more productive.The number of oil rigs fell by 26 last week to 413, the lowest since December 2009, Baker Hughes (BHI) reported Friday. That's down 19% over the last four weeks and 59.5% vs. a year earlier.But U.S. oil output, though off peak levels, has held up remarkably well. That's in large part because Continental Resources (CLR), Concho Resources (CXO) and other shale producers are becoming, well, more productive with every well. They focused on the best wells, kept the best crews, while employing new technical advances and practices. They've also been able to squeeze suppliers and services firms such as Baker Hughes, Schlumberger (SLB) and Halliburton (HAL).• Bakken Shale new wells should produce 737 barrels per day in March, up from 558 bpd in March 2015. That's a 32% increase -- 88.5% vs. March 2014.• Eagle Ford new wells are expected to generate 812 barrels per day in March, up from 665 bpd a year earlier. That's a 22% jump.• Niobrara new wells should produce 741 barrels per day, up 39% from 533 bpd in March 2015.• Permian Basin new wells should produce a 423 barrels per day, a 49% spike from 284 bpd a year earlier.• Utica new wells should generate 309 barrels per day, a whopping 83% increase from 168 bpd in March 2015.Continental Resources, Concho Resources and other shale firms have been able to concentrate efforts, slashing capital spending and operating costs without a big blow to production. But with oil down to $30 a barrel or lower, these companies are under heavy  strain. Continental and Concho earnings reports are due this week, with the former expected to post a loss and the latter a 96% EPS dive.As for suppliers such as Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes, they've cut tens of thousands of jobs.  But those oil services giants should emerge stronger after the oil bust, D.A. Davidson said in research reports last week.Schlumberger stock rose 3.6% last week, Baker Hughes 5.6% and Halliburton 7.8%. (Halliburton is trying to buy Baker Hughes, but faces skeptical antitrust officials.) On Monday, Schlumberger rose 2.1% in the stock market today. Halliburton rose 4.75% and Baker Hughes 3.2%.Meanwhile, Concho Resources advanced 5.9% last week but Continental Resources dived 9.7%. On Monday, Concho climbed 2.9% while Continental spiked 7.1%.
"
189,SLB,"Oilfield-services giants Halliburton (HAL), Baker Hughes (BHI), Schlumberger (SLB) and Weatherford International (WFT) stand to come out of the oil bust even stronger, D.A. Davidson said, citing their diversification, acquisitions and spending restraint.The bullish forecast, appearing in several research notes dated Thursday, follows more than a year of cuts to industry spending plans and tens of thousands of layoffs -- including at those companies -- amid collapsing crude prices.Low prices have devastated drilling activity, a mainstay for oilfield-services providers. The U.S. oil rig count also fell by 26 to 413 this week, Baker Hughes said Friday, down from a peak of 1,609 in October 2014.But D.A. Davidson expects ""significant improvement"" in the companies' financial performance next year as commodity prices and spending levels recover.""Diversified service companies are the best positioned to weather the current commodity cycle and come out stronger on the other side,"" analyst Sonny Randhawa said in initiating coverage of all four stocks with a buy rating.The firm added: ""We believe diversified service companies are well positioned in this cycle and would 'embrace the volatility' and use short-term dips in crude prices as opportunities to increase exposure, becoming more aggressive with the severity of the pullback.""Halliburton's proposed merger with Baker Hughes would create a company that would be a ""formidable international competitor for large scale integrated projects"" that would give Schlumberger a run for its money, Randhawa said.Randhawa still thinks a merger is likely despite regulators' concerns about the combined company's potential size and threat to competition.Halliburton shares closed down 0.3% in the stock market today as oil prices fell. Baker Hughes added 0.35%, and Schlumberger gained 0.3%.As for Schlumberger, Randhawa said the company was set to ""disproportionately outperform in this environment due to its scale, global diversification, technology leadership and game-changing Cameron acquisition.""The purchase of Cameron, which makes products for the oil and gas business, would cut costs for customers and bring together ""downhole and surface technology across the drilling and production life cycle,"" Randhawa said.And Weatherford, he said, has ""emerged as a more focused entity"" after two years of cutting costs and selling off assets.Weatherford, which also provides mechanical products and technological services to the oil and gas drilling industry, gapped down 4.8% Friday.D.A. Davidson expects capex cuts in the U.S. to slow down, easing from a 50% decrease last year to a 40% decline this year.

190,SLB,"The proposal from top oil producers Tuesday wasn't the output cut the market had hoped for, but the deal could still represent a starting point for discussions on eventual cuts.At a meeting in Doha, Qatar, oil ministers from Saudi Arabia, Russia, Qatar and Venezuela agreed to freeze production at January levels, but only if other major producers join. Iran said it has no intention to join them.Analysts also noted that too much oil was already on the market in January, suggesting the glut would continue. Markets dismissed the pact too, with U.S. crude futures falling 1.4% to $29.04 a barrel, and Brent dropping 3.6% to $32.18.Oil ministers from Venezuela, Iraq and Iran will meet in Tehran on Wednesday to discuss an agreement. Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, is hopeful, pointing out that the top oil producers are willing to talk, unlike a few weeks ago.""Whether this first step of a million miles leads to a strong decline (in production) down the road has yet to be seen, but it's a step in the right direction,"" he told IBD.While Tuesday's agreement doesn't include a reduction in output, the proposed freeze at January levels could still serve as a ceiling, which has been missing from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries amid sharp internal divisions.In December, OPEC failed to agree on a ceiling for the first time in recent memory after members kept producing over their limits for more than a year. The lack of a ceiling has allowed individual producers to do what they wanted.""So this isn't a production cut,"" Flynn said. ""It gives us a starting point for a production cut.""Iran could be one of the major stumbling blocks to a production cut, as Tehran seems unlikely to agree to any deal unless it is allowed to keep increasing output to levels seen before the West imposed economic sanctions.Over the weekend, state-run Iranian media said the country had sent its first shipment of crude to Europe in five years, adding that Tehran has already reached deals to export oil to France, Russia and Spain.But Iran needs money flowing in if it wants to boost production, and Tehran won't get that if oil prices continue to fall, Flynn noted. So Iran still has an incentive to hope the other major players can come together for a production cut.Meanwhile, U.S. producers have been trimming output since prices sank. Total domestic crude output hit 9.61 million barrels a day in June, but it has since dipped below 9.2 million. Earlier this month, the Energy Information Administration said it sees 2016 production averaging 8.7 million barrels a day.Low prices are also stressing producers' finances. Dozens of companies in the U.S. filed for bankruptcy protection last year, and the pace is expected to pick up this year.On Tuesday, Deloitte said a third of oil producers worldwide could go bankrupt as low oil prices dry up liquidity. The report looked at 500 companies in the oil and gas sector.The report came a week after Chesapeake Energy (CHK), amid reports it may look at restructuring, said it doesn’t have plans right now to file for bankruptcy protection.Earlier this month, oil and gas producer Linn Energy (LINE) and affiliate LinnCo (LNCO) said they would “explore strategic alternatives” but added that they have enough resources to continue operations.The Deloitte report also found that producers are filing more bankruptcies than oilfield service providers, most likely due to larger capital costs for producers. Eventually, service providers will start feeling the squeeze too -- giants like Schlumberger (SLB), Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) have already slashed tens of thousands of jobs.

191,SLB,"Moody's put Chevron (CVX) on review for a downgrade on expected negative free cash flow and changed Exxon Mobil's (XOM) debt rating outlook to negative, as lower capital reinvestment will likely haunt the oil major for the rest of the decade.The ratings agency predicts negative free cash flow this year and next at Chevron, according to a note from Pete Speer, Moody’s senior vice preesident. He thinks negative free cash flow could even continue until 2018.Last month Chevron cut its capital spending for this year by 25% vs. 2015, but Moody's sees negative free cash flow to exceeded $15 billion in 2016, despite the spending cut. Chevron had negative free cash flow of around $16 billion in 2015.Chevron shares closed down 1.1% in the stock market today as oil prices fell.Moody's changed Exxon's debt rating outlook to negative from stable on ""negative free cash flow and weak cash flow based leverage metrics for ExxonMobil in 2016 and 2017.""Exxon is also cutting capex this year and Speer thinks the ""diminished level of capital reinvestment could adversely affect Exxon's reserve replacement and production profile in the latter part of this decade.""Exxon shares dipped 0.3%.Moody's also downgraded ConocoPhillips' (COP), Marathon Oil's (MRO), Devon Energy's (DVN) and Apache's (APA) senior unsecured ratings with a negative outlooks late Thursday. It also cut ratings on EOG (EOG) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY), but sees a stable outlook.Conoco shares climbed 3.2%, Marathon leapt 8.7% and Devon Energy gained 3.7%. EOG dipped 1.5%. Occidental rose 0.2% and Apache shares climbed 4.45%.In January , Moody’s put 175 energy and mining companies, including Royal Dutch Shell’s (RDSA), BP (BP), Schlumberger (SLB) and U.S. shale firms, on review for potential credit downgrades, citing the deterioration of commodity prices and expected oil production increases from Iran.Later, Standard & Poor downgraded Shell’s and Chevron’s credit ratings and put  BP, Italy’s Eni (E), France’s Total (TOT) and Norway’s Statoil (STO) on notice for potential downgrades.Image provided by Shutterstock.

198,SLB,"Durable goods orders jumped in July, rising 2% when analysts had expected a 0.4% decline. A 3.4% monthly increase in June was revised up to a hefty 4.1%. Orders are nearly 20% lower vs. a year ago, but that's mostly because of big air show order sets skewing the data.Excluding transportation, July orders were up 0.6%, also stronger than expected, and were only 2.5% lower vs. a year ago. There were gains in many categories in July, a sign of strength.One of the most closely watched components of the Commerce Department's durable goods report is core capital goods, which gauge business investment. They rose a strong 2.2% in July for the second straight monthly gain. That may be a signal that the capex plunge that followed oil prices down may have leveled off. But oil prices have tumbled over the past several weeks to around $39 a barrel, a 6-year low.Transocean (RIG), a major offshore driller, said late Tuesday that it would suspend its dividend for the rest of the year. But oil service giant Schlumberger (SLB) announced a $13 billion deal Wednesday to buy rival Cameron International (CAM), a sign that Schlumberger sees the oil industry near a bottom.RELATED:Schlumberger Finds Deals With U.S. Crude Below $40.

New orders remain 20% lower vs. a year ago, though that's largely due to summer air show orders skewing the data. Excluding the volatile transportation sector, orders rose 0.6% in July, also stronger than forecast. Core capital goods orders rose 2.2%, the second straight increase. Such positive data shows domestic strength amid global market woes. But will it last? Energy firms may have decided to step up capital spending as oil prices stabilized, but with crude plunging below $40 a barrel, oil and gas firms may make further cuts.Offshore drilling giant Transocean (RIG) halted its dividend late Tuesday.

250,SLB,"The Obama administration as soon as today will unveil new federal regulations on fracking, which has turned America in an energy powerhouse and slashed the price of oil and natural gas, but raised some environmental concerns.That will affect global energy giants such as Exxon Mobil (XOM) as well as domestic players such as Continental Resources (CLR) and Sanchez Energy (SN).The Interior Department rules on fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, will require new rules on well integrity, dealing with wastewater and disclosing chemicals used in the process.The rules will only apply to federal and Indian tribal lands. Existing state and local rules will remain in force. The bulk of increased oil production in recent years has been on private and state land.Interior initially proposed changes in 2012, with rules expected by year-end. That was pushed back, with a new draft proposal issued in May 2013. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said earlier this week that the rules would finally be released within ""days.""As then, industry groups are expected to say that the rules are unnecessary and excessive, while environmentalists say the regulations should go further.The administration has said the cost would be minimal for industry. Industry begs to differ.Energy Companies Slash Jobs, SpendingShale companies are struggling, with the price of oil falling from above $100 a barrel last June to just above $40 now. Drilling activity has plunged, mostly in marginal areas, spurring oil services companies Baker Hughes (BHI), Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger (SLB) have announced job cuts. U.S. production has continued to climb, though analysts expect output to fall later in the year.ConocoPhillips (COP) is cutting capital spending by 28% over three years, but overall North American energy companies are slashing capex by 41% this year, Moody's Investor Service said this week. Sanchez, Concho Resources (CXO) and others have seen big stock declines as profits plunge. Energy stocks generally rallied Friday morning on the stock market today as oil prices rebounded.Senate Republicans have proposed legislation to bar federal regulation of fracking.

Among the oil companies, 69 U.S. exploration and production firms are on review, including shale producers such as Laredo Petroleum (LPI), Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO), Sanchez Energy (SN) and Diamondback Energy (FANG).""We see a substantial risk that prices may recover much more slowly over the medium term than many companies expect, as well as a risk that prices might fall further,"" the ratings agency said in a statement.""Even under a scenario with a modest recovery from current prices, producing companies and the drillers and service companies that support them will experience rising financial stress with much lower cash flows.""'Deepening Financial Crisis'Iran is set to add 500,000 to 1 million barrels a day to global supply after the lifting of sanctions in last year's nuclear deal. The extra oil could more than offset U.S. production cuts of 500,000 barrels, Moody's said.Any credit downgrades may worsen a liquidity crunch among energy companies, which have had to rely more on bank loans as oil revenue dries up. Investors are also losing their appetite for stock and bond offerings from oil companies trying to raise cash.Schlumberger said Thursday that low crude prices are adding to a ""deepening financial crisis"" among its oil producer customers, who exhausted their budgets early in Q4 and prompted ""unscheduled and abrupt activity cancellations.""But many energy stocks rallied Friday as the price of U.S. crude futures jumped 9% to climb back above $32 a barrel. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) rose 5.9%, BP (BP) 3%, and Schlumberger (SLB) 6%.A potential boost in quantitative easing in Europe and forecasts for a severe snowstorm hitting the U.S. East Coast have sent oil prices higher in recent days, though they are still down 70% from their peak in mid-2014.Moody's reviews, many of which should wrap up by the end of Q1, follow more than a year of low oil prices induced by a U.S. fracking boom that took off several years ago.More recently, OPEC members, particularly Saudi Arabia, have refused to cut production in an attempt to keep market share and force higher-cost U.S. producers out of the market.Concerns about falling oil prices have been exacerbated by China's softening economy and worries stateside that lower gas prices haven't produced the freer spending that economists had anticipated.Moody's said global oil output now exceeds demand by about 2 million barrels a day, due to modest consumption growth in China, India and the U.S.Iron ore and copper have struggled with oversupply concerns as well, while coal has suffered due to cheap alternatives and weaker demand in top emerging economies.Moody's also put Vale (VALE), Rio Tinto (RIO), Alcoa (AA) and other mining and mining-related companies on review for a potential downgrade.""Slowing growth in China, which consumes and produces at least half of base metals and is a material player in the precious metals, iron ore and metallurgical coal markets, is weakening demand for these commodities and driving prices to multiyear lows,"" Moody's said.
"
301,SLB,"Crude oil prices soared again Friday, rising above $32 a barrel. But U.S. drilling activity fell to the lowest in nearly six years, suggesting weaker production ahead.U.S. crude futures rose 9% to $32.19 a barrel Friday after tumbling below $27 earlier in the week. It was the biggest one-day gain since Aug. 27.However, U.S. oil rigs in operation fell by 5 in latest week to 510, Baker Hughes (BHI) reported. That's down 807 from a year earlier and the lowest since early 2010.Oil services giant Schlumberger (SLB) late Thursday reported plunging earnings and revenue, citing a ""deepening financial crisis in the E&P (exploration and production) industry."" Schlumberger slashed 10,000 more jobs in Q4.Schlumberger, which also announced a $10 billion buyback, rose 6.1% on the stock market today.Rivals Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes already have cut tens of thousands of jobs. Halliburton, which plans to buy Baker Hughes but faces regulator reluctance, reports earnings on Monday.Halliburton shares rose 3.1% and Baker Hughes 3.2%.Meanwhile, Continental Resources (CLR), a major shale producer, advanced 4.7%. Continental soared 16% on Thursday.Exxon Mobil (XOM) rose 3.3%. Exxon Mobil will report quarterly earnings on Feb. 2.While U.S. producers have slashed shale drilling activity and capital spending, production has remained robust. Domestic field production, while modestly off its mid-year peaks, has climbed for the past six weeks to 9.235 million barrels per day.U.S. ingenuity and technical advances have helped producers do more with less, but with rigs falling so sharply, production likely will resume its decline shortly.Related:Shell, BP, Vale Lead Energy Sector Downgrade RisksSchlumberger Sees Tough 2016, Warned On Downgrade.

311,SLB,"Amid plunging oil prices, Texas factory activity flattened in January and the outlook looks bleak, the Dallas Fed found in its January survey.The headline production index was 0.7, indicating output was little better than in December, and also barely into positive territory. Other gauges were little better: New orders dropped to -7.7, the first negative read in nearly two years. The growth rate of the new-orders index was among the worst performers, with a -18 read.Measures of general business conditions were negative, and one forecasting the next six months touched its lowest since April 2009. ""Oil below $50 is tough,"" one respondent told the Dallas Fed. ""We'll have to see how long it takes to stabilize.""Yet despite the negativity in other parts of the survey, and the reality that plunging energy prices may hit Texas hard, the employment gauge remained strong. Two-thirds of those surveyed reported no change in their number of employees, while 20% reported increases.However, several big energy players have already slashed capital spending plans, with several announcing job-cut plans, including Houston-based oil service giants Schlumberger (SLB) and soon-to-merge Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI).
"
312,SLB,"Emerging from the recession, energy markets saw a robust real estate recovery as high oil prices ignited exploration and production investment in places like the Eagle Ford Shale in southern Texas and the Bakken in the Northern plains.Now oil's price plunge threatens to cap the recovery, particularly in cities like Houston, Oklahoma City and Williston, N.D.However, housing analysts such as the National Association of Realtors' Danielle Hale and Trulia's Jed Kolko expect potential slumps in home sales, prices and construction to be confined to energy markets.Largely based on expectations that a strong job market will induce millennials to become first-time homebuyers, the NAR projects that existing-home sales will climb 8% in 2015 and home prices 4% to 5%. It predicts that single-family home starts will jump 21%, and new-home sales 25%.""While uncertainty will have an effect on areas where the overall economy and jobs market are very tied to oil, there are enough areas that will benefit from lower oil prices,"" Hale said. ""So we're expecting the effect to be a wash nationally.""Outplacement firm Challenger Gray & Christmas said Thursday that 38% of the nearly 104,000 U.S. job cuts in January and February were directly tied to oil, the price of which has dropped by about half since July. Halliburton (HAL), Schlumberger (SLB) and Weatherford International (WFT) alone have all announced layoffs totaling thousands of workers in the last several weeks.The 1,267 drilling rigs operating nationwide at the end of February represented a 28% drop from a year earlier, according to oil service firm Baker Hughes (BHI), which is being acquired by Halliburton.""I'm bullish about every sector of the national economy that's not in oil and gas,"" said Mark Dotzour, chief economist for the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University. ""I'm not bullish about the oil and gas impact on Houston, Oklahoma City and Williston.""Housing demand in energy markets has yet to crater, and weakness likely won't surface until late 2015 or in 2016, according to a recent report on energy markets by Trulia, recently acquired by Zillow (Z).In Oklahoma City, some 20,500 homes sold in 2014, a 6.7% rise over 2013, according to the Oklahoma City Area Association of Realtors, which lumps together single-family homes with half-duplexes, condos and patio homes. The median price at year-end was $150,000, about $6,000 higher than a year earlier. In Houston, single-family home sales increased 2.8% in 2014 and the median home price surged 10.6% to $199,000, according to the Houston Association of Realtors.Waiting For The WaveStill, executives at homebuilders Lennar (LEN), Beazer Homes USA (BZH) and D.R. Horton (DHI), which are active in Houston, anticipate some softness in the market, according to comments made during their respective earnings calls in January.Houston-based apartment developer Camden Property Trust (CPT) also projects a slowdown, particularly with 20,000 new apartments slated to open in Houston this year.Even so, its same-store annual revenue growth has averaged 8% over the past four years in the market, and executives expect it to fall only to the 20-year average of 3.4%, according to remarks on the company's earnings call in January. Unlike the oil bust in the 1980s, when Houston was more dependent on the energy industry, the area now boasts strong health care and port sectors, as well as significant refining and petrochemical industries, Dotzour says. He adds that potential homebuyers in careers that are tied to the energy industry, including attorneys and accountants, are in a ""wait-and-see mode.""""I think the unknown right now is, how will the people outside the oil and gas industry respond to the uncertainty in the energy business?"" Dotzour said. ""Will a cardiologist choose to delay buying a home just because three or four oil executives own homes in the neighborhood?""Falling oil prices failed to keep Houston office landlords from lifting rents 3.6% to $27.35 a square foot in 2014, even with 16.6 million square feet under construction, according to commercial property brokerage Transwestern.Between layoffs and firms looking to sublet unused office space, the area's average vacancy rate has likely ticked up 90 basis points from 10.2% at the end of 2014, says Kevin Roberts, president of Transwestern's Southwest operations.Transwestern predicts that Houston's vacancy rate will climb above 12% over the next two years. Office tenants and buyers are already starting to push for better deals, he says, but landlords are hardly panicking.""Everybody is looking for 2015 to be a little bouncy,"" he said. ""The good news is that the real estate is not financially impaired — tenants are pretty healthy and paying rent, and occupancies are still high.""Building Homes In The BakkenIn northwest North Dakota, Williston is ground zero for the Bakken oil formation and is in the midst of a severe housing shortage. The number of residents more than doubled to 29,595 from 2010 to 2014, and a 2014 Williston Economic Development report projected the city's population to approach 40,000 in 2017. Observers remain upbeat, given the steady environment.""Demand has tempered a bit, but for the most part it's still going strong,"" said Terry Metzler, operations manager for Casper, Wyo.-based Granite Peak Development, a land developer that entered the market in 2011.He acknowledges that apartment rents started to decline in the area, but he attributes most of it to an increase in supply.Developers applied for 422 single-family, multifamily and commercial property building permits valued at $435 million in 2014, up from 276 permits totaling $291 million in 2013, according to the Williston Area Home Builders Association.Among other projects, private equity firm KKR & Co. (KKR) and Denver-based Continuum Partners are developing the Ridge, a community of 1,537 single-family homes, apartments and town houses.Like real estate observers in other energy markets, Metzler hopes the oil price dip is temporary. He notes that as drilling has slowed, work at producing wells continues.""I don't think you're going to see the amount of apartments being built slow down that much,"" he added. ""If we see an extremely prolonged period of very low oil prices, we might see things change.""

The agreement gives Schlumberger the option of buying the rest of the company three years after the deal closes.Sterne Agee analyst Stephen Gengaro lowered his price target on the company to 92 from 95 but still expects Schlumberger to ""outperform its peers in the face of stiff market headwinds buoyed by its strong technology portfolio, diverse geographic footprint, laser-sharp focus on execution, aggressive cost-cutting initiatives, robust free cash generation, and willingness to return excess cash to shareholders.""Baker Hughes (BHI), which is being bought out by Halliburton, also reported earnings above estimates Tuesday. But like Halliburton, it warned of a difficult 2015 and announced plans to cut 7,000 workers""While market demand ended up being more resilient in the fourth quarter than many had predicted, the recent declines seen in rig counts will clearly affect results in 2015,"" CEO Martin Craighead said in the earnings release.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

It also was lower than November's 48.6 and, like that month, indicated slight contraction for new orders and production. Employment slipped more than two points to a 48.1 reading, its second sub-50 reading in three months.A reading above 50 indicates expansion while a sub-50 reading indicates contraction.One positive note: New export orders gained 4.5 points to a 51.0 reading. That's despite manufacturing's woes due to weak global activity.The underwhelming U.S. manufacturing numbers followed weakness in China's manufacturing sector that sent stocks there — and elsewhere — tumbling. Caixin, which sponsors the privately compiled measure of Chinese manufacturing, reported a reading of 48.2 in December, down from November's 48.6.

503,SLB,"Are two heads really better than one? Does a cat have nine lives? And can a pair of bases by the same stock produce a superb breakout?People might disagree on the first two questions. But as regards the third, the answer is an indisputable yes.The base-on-base pattern, which strings together two or more separate bases, appears frequently on the stock market landscape. Why?Sometimes a stock is ready to break out to new highs and does so, but the rally does not achieve a 20% gain because the greater market is taking a break or even going into a correction.When the market is shaky, stocks have a tougher time going higher. Most stocks follow the market's direction, that's all.So, when the stock you have bought correctly and researched thoroughly did not produce the 20% profit that you had hoped for, despair not. Watch for a new base to develop on top of the earlier one. The new base's low can slip into the prior base, but ideally not by much.Schlumberger (SLB), one of the largest firms in the vast oil and gas industry, created a pair of saucer bases before breaking out and achieving a 25% rally in 2014.In the week ended Sept. 6, the Houston-based firm moved past an 85.12 entry on a super-long saucer with handle. The base was as long as an airport runway. (See it in its entirety on a weekly or monthly chart.)Schlumberger's fundamentals were heating up. In the second quarter of 2013, earnings per share rose 14%. Not amazing, but the company has a long record of steady growth. It also marked the highest increase in four quarters.The stock rose seven weeks in a row, up 11.5% to a 52-week high of 94.91 (1). A new correction began. The decline pushed Schlumberger all the way back to its previous 85.12 entry (2) . In this situation, it's smart to exit the stock even with a tiny gain. A determined investor can always buy shares again.The time to buy arrived several months later. The stock molded another saucer pattern that could also be seen as a flat base. The base's decline was a miserly 10.5%. Schlumberger's March 24-25 breakout past a new 93.94 handle entry came in big volume. On July 1, it hit a high of 118.76 — up 26%, ripe for a great sell.

The four-week average rose by 1,750 to 272,500, a three-month high.But by either measure, unemployment filings have held below 300,000 for almost the entire year, hitting a long-term low in July. Sub-300,000 readings normally signal booming job gains, but not in this economic cycle.Net job growth has been mediocre. Yes, there have been layoffs. Hewlett-Packard, now split into HP Inc. (HPQ) and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), announced plans to cut 30,000 workers. Oil services firms Schlumberger (SLB), Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) have announced tens of thousands of job cuts as demand plunges with the price of crude.But jobless claims and layoffs aren't the culprit. The problem is that actual gross hiring — hiring before any job cuts or exits — still hasn't returned to pre-recession levels, according to Labor's JOLTS report. Truth be told, gross hiring wasn't booming in the prior 2001-2007 expansion either, so failing to live up even to that pace isn't encouraging.Weak gross hiring likely is one reason why the labor force participation rate, including among prime-age workers, remains so low. Weak hiring — and firing — also suggest a less-dynamic economy. Some labor market churn is good, as workers move to more-productive jobs and industries.Follow Ed Carson on Twitter @IBD_ECarson and on Facebook.

515,SLB,"More oil rigs were active this week, Baker Hughes (BHI) reported Friday — good news in isolation for oil services firms like Halliburton (HAL), but the drilling trend remains weak, along with crude prices.The number of U.S. oil rigs in operation rose by 17 to 541; but it was the first increase in five weeks. Drilling activity has been falling sharply since late 2014, as plunging oil prices turned profitable operations in loss-making ones. Despite the sharp drop in oil rigs, U.S. shale production has fallen less than expected due to technical advances. And the global supply glut continues.It all means less demand for oil services firms such as Baker Hughes, Halliburton and Schlumberger (SLB). Halliburton, which has a deal to buy Baker Hughes that antitrust regulators haven't signed off on yet, fell 2.2% on Friday. Baker Hughes actually rose 1.3%, while Schlumberger sank 2.7%.U.S. crude oil prices fell 22 cents to $34.73 a barrel on Friday.Compounding the problem: The number of natural gas rigs fell by 17 to 168, hitting a fresh long-time low.

599,SLB,"The October jobs report is due out Friday morning at 8:30 a.m. ET. And it's even more important than usual, with a Fed rate hike hanging in the balance. Here are three key things to look for.1. Will Fed Get A Go Signal?Hiring abruptly stalled in the last two months, with nonfarm payrolls up just 142,000 in September and a downwardly revised 136,000 in August. Private hiring had the worst back-to-back gain in three years. The Federal Reserve is signaling a December rate hike, and markets are starting to believe it. But if hiring remains sluggish, it will be hard for policymakers to pull the trigger.Wall Street is predicting a rise of 190,000 nonfarm jobs in October. Economists also may be expecting an upward revision to September.2. How Hard Hit Is Manufacturing?Manufacturing lost 9,000 jobs in September after falling by 18,000 in August. Manufacturers are exposed to overseas economic woes, a strong dollar and weak energy prices. Mining and construction equipment giant Caterpillar (CAT), oil services giant Schlumberger (SLB), 3M (MMM) and heavy truck engine maker Cummins (CMI) have all announced layoff plans in the last several months.Manufacturing output is still growing, modestly. But with manufacturing productivity ramping up, that may not be enough to maintain factory employment. If factories continue to shed high-paying blue-collar jobs, can services and construction activity offset that?3. Will Weekly Earnings Remain Weak?When economists discuss wages in the jobs report, they usually focus on average hourly wages.September hourly wages actually fell by 1 cent vs. August. But the year-over-year gain remained 2.2%, which is more or less where it's been for years.But workers are paid by the hourly wage, but by how many hours they work. The work week fell in September to 34.5 hours. So weekly earnings rose by 2.2% vs. a year earlier vs. 2.8% in January. (Weekly wages among nonsupervisory employees rose just 1.6%, down from a recent peak of 3% in July 2014.)The good news is the inflation-adjusted wage gains remain solid, because price gains have been nonexistent. But starting in December and January, real wage gains will quickly fade as easy oil and gas comparisons end. So nominal weekly pay will become more pressing.Economists are counting on October hourly earnings to rise by 0.2%, with the workweek unchanged at 34.5 hours.

"
620,SLB,"Yet some prominent economists argue that despite some dissent, most Fed officials, including Chair Janet Yellen, still favor a 2015 rate hike.

Not sure what is coming next,"" said another.General Electric (GE) and Honeywell (HON) reported better-than-expected profit but missed on sales, with the energy sector a drag for both. But investors, cheered by GE's industrial focus, sent its shares up 3.4% to a 7-year high. Honeywell, which cut its full-year revenue target, fell 1.5%.While industrial output fell, analysts had forecast worse. Economists expect the sector to continue struggling, but some saw green shoots in the data.Jennifer Lee, senior economist for BMO Capital Markets, said in a note Friday that she sees ""strength within,"" noting that consumer goods production rose 1.3% in Q3, ""the best reading in nearly two years.""

In a statement, the fund said it ""believes GE is executing a bold transformation that will generate attractive stockholder returns.""But Trian, which has acquired 98.5 million shares of GE stock for a 1% ownership stake, said it wants GE's management ""to deliver on its commitments.""In particular, Trian wants GE to expand its margins, explore more share buybacks, be disciplined in its acquisitions and mull additional ways to consider scaling back GE Capital.GE stock closed up 5.3% to 26.82, pushing back above its 200-day moving average.Nelson Peltz, Trian's founder and CEO, succeeded in shaking up Kraft Foods when the company split itself in two in 2012 and criticized Oreo maker Mondelez International (MDLZ) for purportedly not doing enough to cut costs. Peltz's fund also engaged in a long-running campaign urging PepsiCo to split its snack and beverage businesses. And in May, Trian narrowly lost a bid to win four of DuPont's 12 board seats. Other Trian investments have targeted Dr Pepper Snapple Group (DPS) and Kellogg (K).So far, Trian has taken a more conciliatory approach to GE in what it says is its biggest stake ever. Trian isn't asking for seats on GE's board, and Peltz in a statement called General Electric ""undervalued and underappreciated by the market."" The hedge fund stressed the ""longstanding relationship"" that Peltz and fellow Trian principal Ed Garden have with GE's Immelt.An early test of Trian's approach and its tolerance for acquisitions could come as GE eyes potential targets in the energy sector. General Electric reportedly has been bidding for parts of Halliburton's (HAL) drilling services and drilling-bits units. The Houston-based energy services company is under pressure from the Justice Department to sell off some of its businesses to alleviate antitrust concerns related to its $35 billion deal to buy rival Baker Hughes (BHI).The DOJ also reportedly wants Halliburton to offload $7.5 billion in assets to a single buyer vs. several in order to pass antitrust hurdles, leaving only global giants like GE and Siemens (SIEGY) as potential buyers.Halliburton shares rose 2.5%.

Dow futures traded 14.6 points above fair market value and had halved their gains over the prior hour. Nasdaq 100 futures doubled their hour-earlier gains to 18 points. S&P 500 futures were steady, showing a 3.6-point gain.The stock market today is expected to put in a short, quiet session. Stock markets close at 1 p.m. ET instead of the usual 4 p.m. Calendars show no significant economic releases and only a dribble of quarterly earnings reports due. And a sizeable segment of the trading population has seized the day to complete a four-day holiday weekend, so trading volume is likely to remain quiet.The Nasdaq opens the day with a mild 0.2% gain for the week. The S&P 500 starts 0.3% in the hole. Both are trading sideways, below early November highs and above their 50- and 200-day moving averages.It's been a stronger week for small caps. The small-cap S&P 600 starts Friday with a 1.6% gain and just back above its 200-day line. The broader Russell 2000 has climbed a shade less than 2% since Monday, but is still well below its 200-day level.Premarket action was subdued among most Dow and S&P 500 stocks. Walt Disney (DIS) dropped nearly 2%, the Dow's biggest move and the largest loss among S&P 500 companies.

Schlumberger (SLB) made up the biggest share, with 11,000 planned layoffs, but many other firms, among them Baker Hughes (BHI) and Halliburton (HAL), have also announced layoffs.

Schlumberger, Baker Hughes and Halliburton are all based in Houston.But the latest upsurge in layoff plans pales compared to 2008, when the credit crash triggered a deep recession and massive cuts among financial firms.

1038,SLB,"Equinor ASA (EQNR  -  Free Report) is awarding new contracts for integrated drilling and well services on majority of the Equinor-operated fields on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS) to Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHGE  -  Free Report), Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) and Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report).The contracts comprise options for five two-year extensions. The extension of the contracts is dependent on constant accomplishment of the goals for well deliveries. Initially, the contracts have been awarded for four years and have a total estimated value of about NOK 30 billion.Equinor’s new contracts will ensure that the service supplier, rig supplier and operator have proper interactions with each other so as to simplify each ones roles and responsibilities.The purpose of this practice is to facilitate flawless planning and execution of operations between various contributors. It will also help in drilling more wells, which will result in recovery improvement and enhance long-term operations.The new contracts are projected to generate employment for about 2000 people on 17 fixed platforms and eight mobile rigs. The current service contracts, which expire on Aug 31, 2018, will be substituted with the new ones.The contracts incorporate new methods of joint operations, which will provide the service suppliers with larger accountability for services than before. For successful implementation of integrated operations, support from land will be vital. For mobile units the service contracts will be connected to the rig rather than various licenses. The collaboration model has given very competent and efficient results. It has already been tested out for Johan Sverdrup Phase 1, Aasta Hansteen, Mariner and the Askeladd and Askepott Cat J rigs.The contracts will comprise integrated drilling, cementation and pumping, drilling and completion fluids, electrical logging and completion services for well construction.Per Baker Hughes, it will be the key drilling and well services provider for the eight rigs developing Troll, Oseberg and Grane. These three fields are considered to be the most prolific and dynamic in the Norwegian continental shelf.In a separate announcement, Equinor announced that it had been awarded seven licenses in the 24th licensing round by the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy. Of which, Equinor will operate five and will have partner positions in the other two.The company aims to maintain production on the NCS until 2030 and beyond at the current level. For this, the company is required to get access to new exploration acreage past the already-opened areas.Thus, the award is in line with Equinor’s exploration strategy of securing access to newer areas on the Norwegian continental shelf as exploration in the region gets more challenging.Price PerformanceIn the past three months, Equinor’s shares have gained 16.8% compared with the industry’s 8.6% rise.Zacks Rank Equinor currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1039,SLB,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report), a GE company, reported rig count decline in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, which is issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.A change in the Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by firms like Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1059 in the week ended Jun 15 and fell from 1062 in the previous week. This decline was a first as the tally rose for 10 weeks in a row.Despite rig count slipping to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, it has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. The current national rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 933.    For the week under review, the fall in rig count can be attributed to lower onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 1035, down from 1039. However, the number of rigs operating in the inland waters was four last week, higher than three for the week ended Jun 8. Also, the tally for offshore rigs was recorded at 20, in line with the prior week’s tally.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count was 863, up from 862 for the week ended Jun 8. Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 747.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 194 is lower than 198 for the week ended Jun 8. Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88% below the all-time high of 1,606 in 2008.However, like oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year-ago tally of 186.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 60 units, down from 61 units. Along with that, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations), fell by two units to 999.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 19 units, of which 16 were oil-directed. The count is in line with the tally for the week ended Jun 8.ConclusionThe number of total rigs exploring in the United States declined due to the removal of four onshore rigs in Texas and two in Alaska.West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude continues to hover around $65-a-barrel psychological mark. Investors are waiting for the OPEC meetings on Jun 22, 2018, when the major crude producers including Russia will decide on extension or relaxation of the earlier-signed production curb deal. In other words, the outcome of the OPEC meetings is likely to provide new direction to oil price.Meanwhile, investors can buy two energy stocks with strong growth prospects per our proprietary model.

1040,SLB,"Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) is expected to see 10% to 15% growth in earnings per share in second-quarter 2018, per a presentation by Patrick Schorn at an energy conference held in San Francisco on Jun 12.The company is consistently enhancing capacity in the North American land market, comprising services to hydraulic fracturing and drilling operations. Of late, customers are seeking to sand delivery and services related production separately. Many oilfield services players fail to be competent enough in both the spaces. Through ownership in sand mines, Schlumberger has the potential to beat other players in standalone sand allocation works. Thus, through both sand allocation and production services, the company has been generating cash flow to its full potential.Per the report, Schlumberger is progressing well with operations off the coast of North America since customers prefer the company’s reliable and most advanced services, especially when the business scenario is challenging.Buoyed by such positives, Schlumberger expects North American revenue growth of 12% to 13% through the second quarter of this year.The situation for the company’s Middle East operations is different as Schlumberger expects revenue growth from these areas to lag expectations. Project delays and challenges faced by the start-up developments in India, Saudi Arabia and Iraq are guiding such downbeat sentiments.Both North America and the Middle East strongly contribute to Schlumberger’s business. The solid backdrop for North American operations more than offset the gloomy Middle East picture which will likely support the company’s second-quarter earnings growth.Based in Houston, TX, Schlumberger is the largest oilfield service player in the world. Over the past year, the company has gained 0.7% versus the 6.2% collective decline of stocks belonging to the industry.Currently, Schlumberger carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the energy space are Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report), Eclipse Resources Corporation (ECR  -  Free Report) and Wildhorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report). While Anadarko carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Eclipse and Wildhorse sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. We expect Anadarko Petroleum to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 229.6% in 2018.Eclipse is expected to record revenue growth of 13.5% through 2018.Wildhorse will likely see year-over-year earnings growth of 309.3% in 2018.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1042,SLB,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report), a GE company, reported an increase in rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in this Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1062 in the week (ended Jun 8) compared with the prior week’s 1060. Notably, total count increased 13 times in the last 14 weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 927.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher offshore and inland waters operations. The number of offshore rigs totaled 20, marginally higher than 19. Three rigs operated in the inland waters last week, higher than two for the week ended Jun 1. The tally for onshore rigs was 1039, in line with prior week.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count was 862, up from 861 for the week ended Jun 1. Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 741. The oil rig count rose 11 times in the last 14 weeks.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 198 is higher than 197 for the week ended Jun 1.Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year-ago tally of 185. Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 61 units decreased from 66 units. However, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by seven units to 1,001 units.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 19 units — 16 rigs were oil-directed — higher than the tally of 18 for the week ended Jun 1.ConclusionThe number of total rigs exploring in the United States has increased, courtesy of the addition of three oil rigs in the Permian Basin. In the past six weeks, the number of oil rigs in the Permian Basin increased five times. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude continues to hover around $65-a-barrel psychological mark. This seems favorable for drillers in few U.S. shale plays like Eagle Ford despite the fact that producers are facing labor shortage and low pipeline capacity, especially in the Permian.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and WildHorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report).

1043,SLB,"SeaDrill Limited  recently announced that it anticipates emerging from bankruptcy by the first half of July, bringing in pleasant news for its investors. Notably, the company’s shares have rallied about 60% over a month, handily outperforming the industry’s decline of 4.4%. The elevated investors’ optimism is a result of the company’s restructuring plan that won approval from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in April, after almost a year-long struggle to survive.The company’s financial restructuring plan received approval from 99.8% of the creditors. Per the restructuring agreement, the international offshore drilling company will witness capital injection of $1.08 billion, which would comprise $880 million secured loans and $200 million equity. The existing shareholders will receive only 1.9% stake in the post-restructuring equity. Under the restructuring plan, banks will defer the maturities of all secured credit facilities worth $5.7 billion by five years, with no amortization payments till 2020, along with significant covenant relief. The plan will also witness the conversion of $2.3 billion worth unsecured bonds into 15% of equity in the restructured company.With Seadrill nearing bankruptcy exit with its restructuring plan, it will improve the liquidity position of the company and provide growth opportunities. SeaDrill, having one of the youngest and most advanced drilling fleets, will be poised to secure more contracts post restructuring, helping the company to stabilize its revenues.SeaDrill, whose peers include Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.

1044,SLB,"It was a week where oil prices tumbled to their lowest levels since April. However, natural gas futures edged closer to the psychologically important $3 level.On the news front, energy biggie Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) outlined plans to double earnings by 2025 in its annual meeting and European peer Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) announced early production start-up at the Kaikias subsea development in the Gulf of Mexico. Meanwhile, Pedro Parente abruptly resigned from the position of CEO of Brazil’s Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report).Overall, it was another mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost about 3.1% to close at $65.81 per barrel, natural gas prices edged up some 0.8% to $2.962 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Shell's GoM Find, Cheniere's FID on Train 3 & More)The U.S. oil benchmark slumped for the second week on fears of supply increase, bearish EIA inventory numbers, and soaring rig count.Oil futures fell after reports emerged that Saudi Arabia and Russia were in discussion to step up output amid reduced supply from Iran and Venezuela.The commodity was also spooked by the federal government’s EIA report that revealed increases in refined product inventories - gasoline and distillate. On a further bearish note, the report revealed that U.S. output edged up 44,000 barrels per day last week to 10.77 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs climbing – this time by 2 following a large increase of 15 last week – brought further downside.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved northward last week. Apart from the weekly inventory release showing a smaller-than-expected increase in natural gas supplies, the commodity got a leg up from rising power sector demand.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    In its annual meeting, ExxonMobil Corporation announced its intention to increase earnings by more than two-fold by 2025 and address the risks of climate change.ExxonMobil’s plan will be especially aided by lower-cost-of-supply investments in U.S. tight oil, deepwater and liquefied natural gas (LNG). This will be backed by a group of industry-leading technologies comprising advanced seismology, integrated reservoir modeling and data analytics.ExxonMobil plans to boost tight oil production by fivefold in the U.S. Permian Basin. The company will also bring online 25 projects globally that will add volumes of more than 1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day. About 10 billion oil-equivalent barrels was added to its resource base in 2017 in locations including the Permian, Guyana, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea and Brazil.Recently, the company announced plans to reduce greenhouse emission by 2020. ExxonMobil targets a 15% cut in methane emissions and a 25% deduction in flaring from levels in 2016. Since 2000, the company has spent more than $9 billion on lower-emission energy solutions that have enabled it to achieve 10% improvement in energy efficiency across global refining operations. (Read more ExxonMobil Chalks Out Plans to More Than Double Earnings)2.    Royal Dutch Shell has been making a remarkable progress in forging ahead with its deepwater projects of late. The European oil giant recently announced that the first phase of its deepwater Kaikias project in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) has become functional and that too one year prior to the scheduled date. The first phase of the project is expected to produce up to 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.The Kaikias project is a joint venture undertaken by Shell and MOEX North America, a subsidiary of Tokyo-based Mitsui Oil Exploration Co. Shell holds 80% operating interest in the project, while the remaining 20% stake is held by MOEX North America. Kaikias is estimated to hold more than 100 million barrels of oil equivalent and the project is set to develop in two phases.Shell took the final investment decision (FID) on the project in March 2017 and has been betting on cost and technology efficiencies to make the project more competitive since then. Notably, it has managed to lower the cost of Kaikias by 30% since the FID on the project. Simplified well designs, along with utilization of the existing oil/gas processing equipment and subsea umbilicals brought down the costs. While the total cost of the project has not been disclosed; Shell expects to push breakeven oil prices lower than $30 per barrel.3.    Petrobras’s shares declined more than 20% in the mid-day trading to eventually close at $10.13 (14.6% down) on Jun 1, after the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s CEO Pedro Parente stepped down from his position. Following his resignation, the Brazilian real also weakened against the dollar, sparking fear over the country’s economy. The CEO’s resignation came in the wake of the nationwide trucker strike in Brazil, which had strangled the country’s economy for more than a week. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In an attempt to resolve the truckers’ strike in Brazil, the government intervened on May 23 to temporarily lower diesel prices at the pump by 10% along with freezing the prices for 60 days.Parente believed that the strike had challenged the implemented pricing policy, which is depicted in a statement during his resignation. Per the statement, his role “as CEO had stopped being positive and the government needed to consider alternatives to its pricing policy going forward”.Ivan Monteiro will be serving as the interim CEO after Parente’s resignation. Monteiro has been the CFO of Petrobras since 2015, supervising the company’s successful debt-reduction attempts. He had also led the initial public offering of the company’s fuel-distribution unit, Petrobras Distribuidora S.A. that managed to raise $1.5 billion.

(NOV  -  Free Report) recently agreed to acquire a Dutch rig design and engineering company, GustoMSC. The deal is expected to enable Houston, TX-based National Oilwell to expand its equipment-providing business to the upstream companies. The financial details of the deal are yet to be disclosed.GustoMSC’s designs are present in 10% of the jackup fleet and 8% of the floater fleet, both of which are currently active globally. Hence, the acquisition strengthens equipment provider, National Oilwell’s hold in the offshore industry. Moreover, with the recent improvement in the oil-price environment, the deep-water energy sector is expected to bounce back, making National Oilwell’s move even more profitable in the coming days.Additionally, the acquisition is expected to help the company enhance its jack up equipment, geophysical gear transporting skids and other vessels, with the services designed to broaden its portfolio. The move boosts National Oilwell’s supply chain and is considered as a vertical integration. Furthermore, along with providing offshore oil and gas services, GustoMSC also serves the wind markets.(Read more Is National Oilwell's GustoMSC Acquisition Beneficial?)5.    Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) recently decided to break the OneLNG joint venture (JV) with Golar LNG Limited, primarily due to financial delays. The JV was created to develop the offshore Fortuna LNG project in Equatorial Guinea, in association with Ophir Energy Plc. The project is located in the Block R, operated by Ophir.Although the development plan of the project was ready way back, finding attractive debt financing for the project and finalizing on the investment decision got delayed. The JV was created in July 2016, in which Schlumberger holds 49% stake. The JV holds 66.2% interest in the Joint Operating Company — which was created to develop the offshore Fortuna FLNG project — and Ophir owns the rest of the stake. The total cost of the Fortuna project is anticipated to be around $2.1 billion.With oil price on the rise, the profitability of the project has increased. Yet, the final investment decision failed to meet the previously announced timelines. Focusing on the project would only block Schlumberger’s resources, which the company can use in other projects.

1045,SLB,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes (BHGE), a GE company, reported an increase in rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in this Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1060 in the week (ended Jun 1) compared with the prior week’s 1059. Notably, total count increased 11 times in the last 12 weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 916.   For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 1039, marginally higher than 1036. The tally for offshore rigs was recorded at 19, in line with the count for the week ended May 25.Two rigs operated in the inland waters last week, however, came lower than four for the prior week.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count was 861, up from 859 for the week ended May 25. Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 733. The oil rig count rose 10 times in the last 12 weeks.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 197 is lower than 198 for the week ended May 25. However, like oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year-ago tally of 182.Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 66 units remained in line with the prior week. The horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by an unit to 994 units.   Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 18 units — 15 rigs were oil-directed — in line with the tally for the week ended May 25.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring in the United States has increased, courtesy of the addition of three oil rigs in Cana Woodford and two in Eagle Ford. In the Cana Woodford, oil rigs have been increasing for four weeks in a row. Eagle Ford has also been witnessing the same over the past two weeks.West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude recently fell marginally below the $65-a-barrel psychological mark as there are possibilities that Saudi Arabia and Russia will decide to relax the production cut quota in the OPEC meeting. However, considering the current crude pricing scenario, there is room for ramping up oil and gas drilling activities. Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Wildhorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report). Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

This marked an increase after the rig count fell for three consecutive weeks.Despite rig count slipping to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, it has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. The current national rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 952.For the week under review, the rise in rig count can be only attributed to increased onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 1029, up from 1024. The tally for offshore rigs was recorded at 19, in line with the prior week’s count. Also, the number of rigs operating in the inland waters was four last week, same as the count for the week ended Jun 29.   Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count was 863, up from 858 for the week ended Jun 29, marking an increase after a decline for two weeks in a row.Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 763.   Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 187 is flat with the week ended Jun 29.Per the latest report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88.4% below the all-time high of 1,606 recorded in 2008.

1049,SLB,"SeaDrill Limited  recently announced that it has successfully completed restructuring and emerged from the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process which was launched last year. Notably, post the announcement, shares of the offshore drilling rig contractor touched a 52-week low of 10 cents during the trading session on Jul 2.It should not come as a surprise that its shares have plunged more than 50%, since the company had already warned that post restructuring, investors will be receiving minimal recovery from their existing shares. Unfortunately, during the bankruptcy restructuring, shareholders are the last in the priority line to claim the company’s assets. In many cases, the existing equity becomes absolutely worthless, with the common stockholders getting completely wiped out. In this case, SeaDrill’s shareholders will own 1.9% of the restructured company, effective Jul 3.Let’s Look BackHit by the industry downturn, SeaDrill had been going through a rough patch over the past two years, with its shares plummeting around 97% during the time frame, owing to increased debts and bankruptcy fears. Reduced demand for drilling and diminishing contracts negatively impacted the company’s revenues, earnings, and cash flows. Notably, it has been facing top-line pressure owing to idle rigs and lower day rates. SeaDrill incurred a net loss of $3,102 million in 2017 owing to higher operational and restructuring costs, along with low revenues.The company filed for bankruptcy protection on Sep 12, 2017 to restructure its balance sheet amid volatile oil prices. After months of negotiations and delays, SeaDrill announced a global settlement in the restructuring deal in February 2018. In April, the restructuring plan won approval from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.Notably, SeaDrill’s Chapter 11 filing was just another disruption in the offshore drilling industry. Many offshore drilling companies like Ocean Rig UDW LLC., Paragon Offshore, Hercules Offshore, Inc. and Vantage Drilling Company had also filed for bankruptcy protection amid declining oil prices.The Restructured StatusEffective Jul 3, the existing shares of SeaDrill will be exchanged for 0.0037345 shares of the newly restructured company, with the number of common outstanding shares falling from 504.4 million to 100 million. The fiscal reset provides the company with $2.1 billion in cash, improving its liquidity position. Further, total backlog of the company currently stands at $2.3 billion.Per the plan, the maturities of all secured credit facilities worth $5.7 billion have been deferred by five years, with no amortization payments till 2020, along with significant covenant relief. Under the plan, roughly $2.4 billion of bonds have been exchanged for equity. The scheme has also equitized more than $1 billion in contingent newbuild obligations. SeaDrill has raised $1.08 billion of fresh capital that would comprise $880 million secured loans and $200 million equity.SeaDrill has been given the approval to list its new common shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the same ticker symbol ‘SDRL’. Trading in about 16 million new shares will commence on Jul 3, with additional new shares likely to begin trading in the subsequent weeks. The company intends to report first-half year and third-quarter results in November.What’s Ahead?SeaDrill, having one of the youngest and most advanced drilling fleets, will be now be poised to secure more contracts post restructuring, thereby helping to stabilize its revenues. Especially with the rise in commodity prices owing to robust demand and OPEC production-cuts, market scenario for the drilling and oilfield services companies looks promising with increased upstream spending.SeaDrill, whose peers include Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Nabors Industries Limited (NBR  -  Free Report), among others, has a high economic utilization for its floaters. With successful emergence from bankruptcy, the company is likely to gain a competitive advantage with the newly restructured balance sheet.SeaDrill intends to expand its relationship ties with Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) — the world’s largest oilfield service provider — with which it is already collaborating to offer integrated services to India. The company is also in talks with other major oil service companies for strategic collaboration opportunities. As it is, a wave of consolidation has hit the industry in the last couple of years amid the oil slump, in order to take advantage of integrated offerings, increased scale, synergies and new capabilities. The service providers believe that mergers and acquisitions will help them cut their average costs and benefit from mutual technical expertise exchange.Although SeaDrill has no immediate consolidation plans, the company’s CEO Dibowitz is looking for strategic opportunities to enhance its long-term growth prospects.

1050,SLB,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report), a GE company reported a decline in U.S. rig count.About the Rig Count Baker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.A change in the Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1047 in the week ended Jun 29, down from 1052 in the previous week. This marked a decline in rig count for three weeks in a row.  Despite rig count slipping to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, it has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. The current national rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 940.For the week under review, the fall in rig count can be only attributed to reduced onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 1024, down from 1032. However, the tally for offshore rigs was recorded at 19, up from the prior week’s count of 18. Also, the number of rigs operating in the inland waters was four last week, higher than two for the week ended Jun 22.  Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count was 858, down from 862 for the week ended Jun 22, marking a decline for two straight weeks.However, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 756.  Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 187 lags 188 for the week ended Jun 22. Notably, the tally for gas rigs fell for three consecutive weeks. Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88.4%, below the all-time high of 1,606 in 2008.  However, like oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year-ago tally of 184.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 56 units, down from the prior week tally of 60. The horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) fell by one unit to 991.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is 18 units, of which 15 were oil-directed. The count is in line with the week ended Jun 22.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring in the United States declined primarily due to the removal of three onshore rigs from Texas and two from North Dakota.  West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is again approaching the $75-a-barrel psychological mark. Although the pricing scenario of oil is favorable for drillers, the production possibilities in the domestic shale plays — especially the Permian — remain dull owing to the pipeline bottleneck problem. In other words, the bottleneck in transportation capacity and labor shortage have made Permian operations expensive.Despite the unfavorable business scenario, investors may bet on a few oil and gas explorers.

1051,SLB,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) recently inked a deal to form a joint venture (JV) with Saudi Aramco for manufacturing onshore rigs and equipment in Saudi Arabia. The latest development will brighten prospects of the energy services sector in Saudi Arabia and boost future growth potential of National Oilwell.The Rig-Building JV DealThe JV, which will serve as a major hub for high-specification rigs with breakthrough technologies, aims to construct up to 10 onshore drilling rigs annually. It will also supply advanced drilling equipment, spare parts and packages for jack-up rigs, along with providing repair and maintenance services for the sophisticated drilling technologies.Located at Ras Al Khair on the kingdom’s east coast, the facility will lead to the creation of around 1,000 jobs. While the project is likely to be completed in 2020, the first rig is expected to be delivered in 2021.Houston-based National Oilwell will own 70% stake in the JV and Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil/gas entity will hold the remaining 30%. The tie-up is also supported by Saudi Aramco’s partnership with Nabors Industries Limited (NBR  -  Free Report), which has already agreed to purchase 50 onshore rigs over a period of 10 years.Deal Motive for Saudi AramcoWith the deal leading to the creation of high-specification land rigs along with providing after-market services in Saudi Arabia, it will advance the kingdom’s oil services industry. It will help in encouraging trade with locally produced goods and services. Of late, Saudi Aramco has entered into strategic alliances with various U.S. oil companies including Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Weatherford International PLC, among others, to promote bilateral business between the two countries.The deal is in sync with Saudi Arabia’s reform program “Vision 3030,” as the JV will bolster the kingdom’s manufacturing capabilities, and spur economic diversification along with the creation of jobs. Under the reform plan, the country aims to fuel economic modernization and foreign investment. Saudi Aramco’s plans for IPO are also part of Vision 3030, as the company intends to diversify globally.While the IPO-offering plans have made a slow progress, the company is gearing up for downstream efforts, and aiming to maximize value by making investments in refineries and chemical plants. Saudi Arabia is taking a keen interest in investing in Texas petrochemical plants, and the refineries in Corpus Christi and Port Arthur. In fact, it is planning to invest $18 billion in its U.S. subsidiary, Motiva Enterprises LLC's Port Arthur refinery that has a processing capacity of 603,000 barrels of crude per day.Just a week ago, Saudi Aramco announced its collaboration with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) to foray into the retail petroleum business in India. Both the company signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with a consortium of three Indian national oil companies for investing in the development of $44-billion mega refinery in Ratnagiri.Encouraging Prospects of National OilwellNational Oilwell Varco is one of the biggest manufacturers of drilling equipment in the world, boasting an impressive business model. Strong demand for the firm’s onshore-focused Wellbore unit offers strong upside potential. The latest JV with Saudi Aramco is expected to boost the prospects of National Oilwell going forward, thereby driving revenues and earnings.While offshore-levered Rig Technologies is still bearing the brunt of reduced activities and declining backlog, the gradual uptick in the oil prices is likely to spur a recovery in the offshore segment in the coming period. In fact, last month, National Oilwell inked a deal to acquire a Dutch offshore rig design and engineering company, GustoMSC, boosting the former’s supply chain. The deal is considered as a vertical integration. The acquisition strengthens National Oilwell’s hold in the offshore industry, expanding equipment-providing business to the upstream companies.National Oilwell currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1052,SLB,"Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) will separate from parent company General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report), which is planning to lower exposure in the volatile energy sector.Over the next two to three years, General Electric will likely sell its 62.5% stake in Baker Hughes to strengthen its balance sheet and simplify operations. In July 2017, General Electric had acquired Baker Hughes and merged the affiliate with its oil and gas equipment and services businesses.However, investors didn’t cheer the acquisition as following its closure, share prices of both the companies plunged. Baker Hughes has lost 39.2% since the acquisition, underperforming the 5.3% collective decline of the stocks belonging to the industry, while General Electric slipped 49.1%.Although crude prices have made a massive comeback, Baker Hughes scattered international operations could not benefit from the surge in commodity prices. Also, demand for drill bits and refinery valves of Baker Hughes will likely be blunt in the long term since the energy market is expected to be hurt by limited operational possibilities in prime oil plays and political disturbances, Bloomberg added.All those uncertainties might have convinced General Electric to offload Baker Hughes stake. Sonny Randhawa of Seaport Global Securities LLC announced that the entire interest of General Electric in Baker Hughes will not be sold through corporate buyout but will involve a number of share divestments. Randhawa added that Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) and Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) might be potential buyers but they will not get the approvals from the regulators.Baker Hughes is a leading oilfield service player. Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that it will perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

1053,SLB,"It was a week where oil prices were buoyed by OPEC’s plans for a smaller-than-expected output raise. Meanwhile, natural gas futures again fell below the critical $3 threshold.On the news front, Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A  -  Free Report) said it has committed to the Fram gas field in the North Sea, while Canada’s Baytex Energy Corp. (BTE  -  Free Report) agreed to snap up rival Raging River Exploration Inc. for $2.3 billion. Meanwhile, Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) lost a wage dispute potentially costing the company 4.5 billion in U.S. dollars.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 5.8% to close at $68.58 per barrel, natural gas prices fell some 2.6% to $2.945 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: ExxonMobil, Chevron, Transocean & More)The U.S. oil benchmark rallied after OPEC agreed to stabilize the market by making modest increase in crude output. At the Vienna meeting, top producers came together and decided to raise volumes by about 1 million barrels per day from July to make up for falling production in Venezuela.Friday’s consensus figure was well below some of the numbers that had been floated ahead of the meeting, while the actual addition is expected to be even lesser – at around 700,000 barrels a day – due to several member countries’ inability to boost exports.Earlier in the week, oil futures were buoyed by the federal government’s EIA report that showed a large draw in crude stockpiles due to strong refinery runs. Data showing a reduction in U.S. oil drilling rig count brought further upside.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved southward last week as a larger-than-expected increase in supplies overshadowed the commodity’s growing use for air-conditioning.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Royal Dutch Shell plc recently announced its intention to forge ahead with development of the Fram natural gas field in the North Sea. Banking on improving economics and recovering energy landscape, this is notably the second North Sea project approved by the European energy giant in the past six months.Shell, along with Exxon Mobil, which is its co-partner in the Fram project, intends to produce around 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (comprising about 41 million cubic feet of gas along with 5,300 barrels of liquids a day) from the two wells in the Fram field by 2020. This will increase the The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s output in the North Sea by 10%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Fram field, located 137 miles east of Aberdeen, will be connected using a subsea infrastructure to a processing facility, Shearwater, from which gas will be transported to the shore. Basically, the two wells will transport gas via a subsea pipeline to the Starling field, from which it will be further transported to the Shearwater platform through existing pipelines.Utilizing the existing infrastructure from the nearby hubs will result in huge cost savings associated with the development of new fields. Reduction in development costs has in fact prompted Shell to reinvest in projects in the U.K. once again.

Notably, it marks the biggest buyout in the Canadian oil patch this year.However, the deal failed to garner positive response from its shareholders, as evidenced by the dismal stock movement post the announcement of the merger. Shares of Baytex have dropped 11.92% to close at $3.40 on Jun 18, reflecting investors’ rough initial response toward the pricey deal. Investors are mainly concerned about the company’s intent to finance the deal by the issuance of new stocks that in turn are likely to hurt its earnings per share metrics.Baytex’s operations are mainly focused on Eagle Ford, Peace River and Lloydminster regions while Raging River’s activities are mainly concentrated in East Duvernay (where it holds 260,000 acres of land), and Viking areas. Thus, the buyout expands the geographical footprint of Baytex, creating an enviable diverse portfolio of oil assets in five core areas namely Viking, Peace River, Lloydminster and East Duvernay Shale regions in Canada, and the Eagle Ford play in Texas. (Read more Baytex to Buy Raging River: A Closer Look)3.    Petrobras recently lost a wage lawsuit when Brazil’s Labor Court voted in favor of the workers of Petrobras seeking higher wages. This is notably the biggest lawsuit that the company has faced in the Brazil’s Labor Court, which is expected to cost the company around 17 billion reals or 4.5 billion in U.S. dollars.The case is mainly centered on the Minimum Remuneration Level Regime (RMNR) policy, adopted by Petrobras in 2007. The employees argue that the payments related to special working conditions such as night shifts and hazardous working environment should not be included in the base wage calculation, which will thus lead Petrobras to make additional payment to comply with RMNR. In contrast, the company is of the opinion that such payments should be included in the base wage calculations itself.The ruling in favor of the workers is likely to result in wage increase of around 35% for 59,000 employees. Petrobras intends to appeal the decision in the Supreme Federal Court. (Read more Petrobras Loses Wage Lawsuit, to Pay $4.5 Billion)4.    Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) recently won a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, which enabled the company to recover the profits lost due to unaccredited use of its patented technology outside the country by ION Geophysical Corporation. The ruling countermanded a previous decision from a lower court that constrained the usage of U.S. patent law abroad.The previous ruling from the lower court reduced the damage compensation by $93.4 million. The said Schlumberger technology is used for finding oil and gas under the ocean floor. The significance of the latest ruling is that it enhances the ability of the patent holders to stop rivals and other companies from using their technologies abroad. It also helps them recover profits that were lost due to unauthorized usage of its technologies.WesternGeco, a subsidiary of Schlumberger, was the one fighting the case against ION Geophysical regarding the use of four patented methods, used while conducting marine seismic survey. Notably, Schlumberger received compensation for damages caused due to the occurrence of infringement in the United States. Now the compensation basket includes the lost profits from overseas as well.

(HES  -  Free Report) reiterated the exploration potential of the Stabroek Block, following the announcement of the eighth oil discovery at the Longtail-1 well, offshore Guyana. Stabroek Block is spread across acreage of 6.6 million (26,800 square kilometers).Located about five miles west of the Turbot-1 well, the Longtail-1encountered about 256 feet (78 meters) of superior, oil-bearing sandstone reservoir. The drilling of the well commenced on May 25, 2018, using the Stena Carron drillship to reach a total depth of 18,057 feet (5,504 meters) in 6,365 feet (1,940 meters) of water.The previous outstanding discoveries on the Stabroek Block include Liza, Payara, Liza Deep, Snoek, Turbot, Ranger and Pacora. Currently, drilling results of Longtail are under appraisal. The combined gross recoverable resources of Turbot and Longtail are projected to surpass 500 million barrels of oil equivalent.

1054,SLB,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report), a GE company, reported a decline in rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.A change in the Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1052 in the week ended Jun 22, down from 1059 in the previous week. This marked the decline in rig count for two weeks in a row.  Despite rig count slipping to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, it has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. The current national rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 941.For the week under review, the fall in rig count can be attributed to lower onshore and offshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 1032, down from 1035. Moreover, the tally for offshore rigs was recorded at 18, down from the prior week’s tally of 20. Also, the number of rigs operating in the inland waters was two last week, lower than four for the week ended Jun 15.  Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count was 862, down from 863 for the week ended Jun 15. However, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 758.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 188 lags 194 for the week ended Jun 15. Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88.3%, below the all-time high of 1,606 in 2008.  However, like oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year-ago tally of 183.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 60 units, in line with the prior week tally. The horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) fell by seven units to 992.  Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is 18 units, of which 15 were oil-directed. The count fell from the tally of 19 for the week ended Jun 15.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring in the United States declined primarily due to the removal of two oil rigs in the Permian Basin and one from the Williston Basin. The removal of one natural gas rig from each of Haynesville and Marcellus shale plays also led to the fall in rig count.West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is again approaching the $70-a-barrel psychological mark. Although the pricing scenario of oil is favorable for drillers, the production possibilities in the domestic shale plays — especially the Permian — remain dull owing to the pipeline bottleneck problem. In other words, the bottleneck in transportation capacity and labor shortage have made Permian operations expensive.Despite the unfavorable business scenario, investors may bet on a few oil and gas explorers. However, picking winning stocks may be a daunting task.This is where our VGM Score comes in handy.

1055,SLB,"Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) recently won the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, which enabled the company to recover the profits lost due to unaccredited use of its patented technology outside the country by ION Geophysical Corporation (IO  -  Free Report). The ruling countermanded a previous decision from a lower court that constrained the usage of U.S. patent law abroad.The previous ruling from the lower court reduced the damage compensation by $93.4 million.

The significance of the latest ruling is that it enhances the ability of the patent holders to stop rivals and other companies from using their technologies abroad. It also helps them recover profits that were lost due to unauthorized usage of its technologies.Opponents have raised concern over the situation stating that the patent ruling might act as a risk bearer for the high-technology companies, which have operations outside the country. Schlumberger countered the idea as the law is expected to provide protection against any infringement, including those which occur abroad due to the supply of patented technology from the domestic market. Moreover, the company pointed toward the assembling done abroad using unsanctioned patented technology, as it hurts its foreign sales.WesternGeco, a subsidiary of Schlumberger, was the one fighting the case against ION Geophysical regarding the use of four patented methods, used while conducting marine seismic survey. Notably, Schlumberger received compensation for damages caused due to the occurrence of infringement in the United States. Now the compensation basket includes the lost profits from overseas as well.Price PerformanceSchlumberger has gained 1.7% in the past year against 4.7% decline of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Schlumberger carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the Energy sector can opt for some better-ranked stocks like Continental Resources, Inc.

1056,SLB,"Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report) might be considering the divestment of a major business unit for repaying its significant debt load, according to Mark McCollum — the chief executive officer (CEO) of the firm.  The three-year crude downturn severely affected Weatherford. Following this impact, the company reported loss per share for three years in a row since 2015. Through first-quarter 2018, the company also failed to report per share profit.In addition, Weatherford’s balance sheet has been getting weaker with a surging debt load. As of Mar 31, 2018, the company’s long-term debt stands at $7.6 billion. Hence, to support operations and strengthen balance sheet, Weatherford is relying on asset divestments, which is part of its business restructurings. The company made a major move on Dec 29, 2017, when it divested its hydraulic fracturing unit in the United States, for a cash consideration of $430 million, to Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report).McCollum did not point out the assets the firm is intending to sale and added that his moves will directly benefit the shareholders. Weatherford is also working toward divesting its four smaller business units through 2018, which, together, will likely fetch the company $500 million.Headquartered at Baar, Switzerland, Weatherford is the leading provider of oilfield services to customers belonging to the energy space.The pricing chart of Weatherford is not impressive. The company’s shares have plunged 34.9% over the past year, underperforming the industry’s 6.8% gain.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that it will perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.Meanwhile, two better-ranked players in the energy sector are BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) and WildHorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report).

1057,SLB,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 5.9% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is SLB due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.First-Quarter 2018 ResultsSchlumberger Limited’s first-quarter 2018 earnings of 38 cents per share (eliminating charges and credits) were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line rose from the year-earlier figure of 25 cents.Total revenues of $7,829 million improved from the year-ago level of $6,894 million but failed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,852 million.  Surge in North American directional land drilling operations and awards for Integrated Production Services (IPS) contracts supported the first-quarter results. This was offset partially by operations related to Testing Services in Qatar, Egypt and Brazil.Segmental PerformanceEach of the groups — Reservoir Characterization, Drilling Group and Production Group — recorded a year-over-year rise in earnings.Drilling Group results increased primarily on contributions from the North American directional land drilling works.  Results at the Production Group were mostly buoyed by IPS contracts. Higher North American activities also supported the outperformance.The Reservoir Characterization segment was affected by lower Russian Wireline activity along with a drop in sales of Software Integrated Solutions. However, the negative was partially offset by operations related to Testing Services in Qatar, Egypt and Brazil.Reservoir Characterization: Revenues totaled $1,556 million compared with $1,618 million in the year-earlier quarter. Pre-tax operating income grossed $307 million, up 9% year over year.Drilling Group: Revenues of $2,126 million rose 7% year over year. Moreover, pre-tax operating income was $293 million, up 28% year over year.Production Group: Revenues at this group increased 35% from the year-earlier quarter to $2,959 million. Pre-tax operating income skyrocketed 96% year over year to $216 million.Cameron Group: This segment generated revenues of $1,310 million, up 7% year over year. Pre-tax operating income rose 2% from the prior-year period to $166 million.FinancialsAs of Mar 31, 2018, the company had approximately $4,165 million in cash and short-term investments and $13,526 million in long-term debt. This represents a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 32.7%. In the January-to-March quarter, the company bought back 1.4 million shares.  GuidanceFor 2018, the company projects investments of $2 billion, almost in line with the 2017 and 2016 figures.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.

1058,SLB,"Stocks ended lower on May 25 as crude prices plummeted. The immediate trigger for a decline in oil prices was reports that OPEC and Russia were discussing an increase in oil production. Consequently, stocks of energy companies suffered losses.The energy sector has been on a dream run this year following OPEC and other major oil producers’ decision to extend an output controls agreement. Consequently, oil prices touched three-year highs recently. But could a reconsideration of the same agreement end crude’s spectacular rally? Oil Prices Suffer Weekly LossesOn May 25, the price of WTI crude declined by 4% or $2.83 to end at $67.88 per barrel. This was the largest daily loss for U.S. crude price since July 2017. Currently, oil is nearly 7% lower than the recent highs above $72. This was also its lowest close since May 1. Further, prices suffered a weekly decline of 4.9%.Additionally, Brent crude lost 3% or $2.35 to close at $76.44 per barrel. This was its lowest close since May 8. Brent crude also suffered a weekly loss of 2.6%. In recent weeks, a collapse in production in Venezuela and fears that exports from Iran will fall post Trump’s decision to exit the nuclear deal had boosted prices.Reports of Output Increase Cause DeclineThe decline in crude prices weighed on shares of energy companies. Consequently, shares of oil majors Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) declined 1.9% and 3.5%, respectively.Shares of Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) and ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) Inc. also declined 3.7% and 4.4%, respectively. ConocoPhillips has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The immediate trigger for the decline in crude prices was reports that OPEC and key non-OPEC oil producers were considering an increase in output. On May 25, Russia’s energy minister Alexander Novak met his Saudi counterpart Khalid Al-Falih in Petersburg to discuss the output controls agreement.Subsequently, reports emerged that an increase in production levels was being considered for the first time since 2016. The current agreement, which has been in force since January 2017, aims to limit output to 1.8 million barrels a day.According to a report from Reuters, the planned increase in output is as high as 1 million barrels. Bloomberg has reported that output may be increased by 300,000 barrels to 800,000 barrels per day. Currently, global inventories are close to OPEC’s targeted level, another factor which has helped to boost prices to three-year highs recently.Forecasts for Prices Remain HighAnother reason for the decline in crude prices on last Friday was an increase in total active U.S. rig count. A report from Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report) revealed that the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil increased by 15 to 859 over last week. This was the biggest weekly increase since the week ended February 9.However, despite the losses incurred on Friday Société Générale (SCGLY  -  Free Report) revised its projections for oil prices upward. The bank now believes Brent crude will maintain an average of $72.75 in 2019, $7.75 higher than its earlier forecast. The outlook for WTI was also revised upward by $6.75 to $67.75.The primary reason for analysts’ projections for a continuing uptrend is the massive decline in Venezuelan output. Analysts at the Paris-based bank now believe that monthly declines will continue at the current rate into 2019. The projected fall in crude supplies due to the United States’ decision to exit the Iran nuclear deal is also likely to boost prices in the medium term. 5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

1060,SLB,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report), a GE company, reported an increase in rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in this Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1046 in the week (ended May 18) compared with the prior week’s 1045. Notably, total count increased 11 times in the last 12 weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 901.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 1023, marginally higher than 1021. Four rigs operated in the inland waters last week, higher than three for the week ended May 11. The tally for offshore rigs was, however, recorded at 19 compared with 21.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count was 844, flat with the week ended May 11. Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 720. The oil rig count rose nine times in the last 12 weeks.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 200 is higher than 199 for the week ended May 11.Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year-ago tally of 180.Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 61 units increased from 55 units. However, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) fell by five units to 985 units.   Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 18 units — 17 rigs were oil-directed — lower than the tally of 20 for the week ended May 11.ConclusionThe number of total rigs exploring in the United States has increased, courtesy of the addition of three land rigs in New Mexico and two in Texas.           West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude continues to trade above the $70-a-barrel psychological mark owing to concerns that Iran’s crude export might fall after Trump nixed the nuclear deal. Moreover, there is considerable room for rally in oil prices which could support the persistent ramp up in drilling activities.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Comstock Resources, Inc.

Notably, the total count increased for three in the prior five weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 754.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs were 959, higher than 956. Two rigs operated in the inland waters last week, up from the count of one for the week ended Feb 16.  However, the tally for offshore was 17, down from 18 in the prior week.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 799 was up from 798 for the week ended Feb 16. Further, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 602.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 179 was up from 177 for the week ended Feb 16. With this, the tally increased twice in the last three weeks.Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 151.  Per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 89%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 67 units increased from 65. Moreover, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by one unit to 911.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 17 units — 16 of which were oil-directed — compared with 18 for the week ended Feb 16.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil and natural gas in the United States increased, courtesy of the addition of two oil rigs in each of Permian basin and Cana Woodford resources. Moreover, the Utica and Haynesville basins added one natural gas rig each.Crude pricing scenario has been healthy after the OPEC members agreed to extend the production curb deal beyond first-quarter 2018. Given that oil has been trading mostly over the $60-per-barrel mark since January, we believe that there is considerable opportunity for U.S. shale players to continue ramping up drilling activities.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsSchlumberger’s fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of 48 cents per share (eliminating charges and credits) surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents and the year-earlier figure of 27 cents.Total revenues of $8,179 million improved from the year-earlier level of $7,107 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,116 million.Surge in SIS software sales, ramp up of drilling operations in Colombia and Argentina along with higher pricing in North America’s onshore market supported the strong fourth-quarter results.Segmental PerformanceEach of the groups — Reservoir Characterization, Drilling Group and Production Group — recorded a year-over-year rise in earnings.Drilling Group revenues increased primarily on contributions from the international market. Ramp up of activities in Colombia and Argentina also drove revenues. On top of that, profits at the business unit were supported by the commencement of new projects in China and Qatar.Results at the Production Group were mostly buoyed by solid activities in the international market. Increased operations in Russia, Argentina and Saudi Arabia drove the segment’s fourth-quarter numbers. Surge in pricing in North America’s onshore market also contributed to the outperformance.  The Reservoir Characterization segment was also supported by strong contributions from the international market. Jump in sales of SIS software led to increased profits.Reservoir Characterization: Revenues totaled $1,638 million compared with $1,676 million in the prior-year quarter. However, pre-tax operating income totaled $360 million, up 13% year over year.  Drilling Group: Revenues of $2,180 million rose 8% year over year. Moreover, pre-tax operating income was $319 million, up 36% year over year.Production Group: Revenues at this group increased 40% from the year-earlier quarter to $3,079 million. Pre-tax operating income skyrocketed 146% year over year to $315 million.Cameron Group: This segment generated revenues of $1,414 million, up 5% year over year. Pre-tax operating income rose 8% from the prior-year comparable period to $203 million.FinancialsAs of Dec 31, 2017, the company had approximately $5,089 million in cash and short-term investments and $14,875 million in long-term debt. This represents a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 32.8%. In the October-to-December quarter, the company bought back 1.6 million shares. GuidanceFor 2018, the company projects investments of $2 billion, almost in line with the 2017 and 2016 figures.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.

Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was also allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.The company's stock is suitable solely for growth based on our styles scores.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise SLB has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.

1067,SLB,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE), reported an increase in total rig count in the United States.Details on Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count hampers demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 947 in the week ended Jan 26 — higher than the prior week’s 936. This marked an increase in rig count after the tally fell for the week ended Jan 19.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 712.  For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore operations – the tally rose from 916 to 929. The tally for inland waters was 1, in line with the count for the week ended Jan 19. However, the number of offshore rigs were 17, lower than 19.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 759 jumped from 747 recorded for the week ended Jan 19. This marked an increase after the domestic plays witnessed the removal of five rigs through the week ended Jan 19.Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than the previous year’s count of 566.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 188 was down from 189 for the week ended Jan 19.However, like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 145. Per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88.3%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 66 units jumped from 57 for the week ended Jan 19. Moreover, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by two units to 881.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is 17 units — 15 of which were oil-directed — down from 19 for the week ended Jan 19.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil surged, while the count for natural gas decreased. Overall, the total tally of rigs in the United States jumped, courtesy of the addition of 18 oil rigs in the Permian basin. In the basin, the number of oil rigs has been rising for four weeks in a row. Four rigs were added in the Marcellus shale play.              Crude is trading above the $65-per-barrel psychological mark, which might lead to ramped up activities by oil drillers in domestic shale plays.

1068,SLB,"Q1 earnings season has thus far had a pronounced calming effect on market volatility this week; after more than a month of wild turbulence based on a host of external issues, impressive growth and positive surprises for companies so far reported have brought a welcome tepidness to daily trading. Even when markets are down like they were Thursday, there were no three- or four-digit spikes to strike fear into the hearts of investors.This quarterly good news continues into Friday’s pre-market, with beleaguered industrial major General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) posting a positive surprise on both top and bottom lines. Earnings of 16 cents per share outpaced the 11 cents expected, whereas quarterly sales of $28.7 billion surpassed the $27.9 billion in the Zacks consensus.CEO John Flannery had already described 2018 as a “reset year,” following a long duration of losses and underperforming segments under past leadership. Many analysts still expect GE to take some sort of different form in terms of business holdings down the road, but for now the market is pleased with the Q1 beat.

Though we saw some weakness in the company’s fiscal Q3 report, such as a dip in core gross margins, full-year earnings guidance was ratcheted up to 6-8%. For more on PG’s earnings, click here.Oilfield services major Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report), however, saw an opposite fortune befall the company in its Q1 report: an earnings meet of 38 cents per share combined with a top-line miss of $7,829 million (versus $7,852 million expected) has caused a 1% pre-market sell-off at this hour. Yet revenues were up big from a year ago, with Drilling +28% and Production +98%. For more on SLB’s earnings, click here.Global financial services major State Street Corp. (STT  -  Free Report) beat earnings estimates by 4 cents to $1.62 per share, on revenues in Q1 of $3.02 billion which met estimates exactly.

The bottom line rose from the year-earlier figure of 25 cents.Total revenues of $7,829 million improved from the year-ago level of $6,894 million but failed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,852 million.  Surge in North American directional land drilling operations and awards for Integrated Production Services (IPS) contracts supported the first-quarter results. This was offset partially by operations related to Testing Services in Qatar, Egypt and Brazil.Segmental PerformanceEach of the groups — Reservoir Characterization, Drilling Group and Production Group — recorded a year-over-year rise in earnings.Drilling Group results increased primarily on contributions from the North American directional land drilling works.  Results at the Production Group were mostly buoyed by IPS contracts.

1071,SLB,"We issued an updated research report on Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) on Jan 25.Schlumberger recently reported strong fourth-quarter 2017 results. Earnings of 48 cents per share (excluding charges and credits) beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents and the year-ago figure of 27 cents. Surge in SIS software sales, ramp up of drilling operations in Colombia and Argentina along with higher pricing in North America’s onshore market supported the strong results.Banking on the bullishness, Schlumberger — the largest oilfield services player in the world, with presence in the world’s prospective energy market — issued a positive outlook for 2018. The company, which plans to exit its marine and land seismic acquisition services, believes that the positive oil market sentiment will drive investments by upstream operators in North America shale plays. It is to be noted that the partial recovery in crude price has favored explorers like Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report) and Matador Resources Company (MTDR  -  Free Report).Increased investment in shale operations in North America might result in higher demand for Schlumberger’s oilfield services. Meanwhile, the international market is expected to witness 5% higher spending in 2018 following three years of decline.We appreciate the company’s increased reliance on lucrative international markets. Being the leading provider of technology for complex oilfield projects, Schlumberger is better positioned than most peers to take up offshore projects in the shallow water basins outside North America.However, Schlumberger has lesser exposure to U.S. shale plays — where more drillers have gathered following a partial recovery in crude prices. This is reflected in the fact that during the third and fourth quarter of 2017, the company generated 33% and 34% of revenues from North America. Thus, the low exposure deprives Schlumberger of profitable contracts from shale drillers.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1072,SLB,"Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on Apr 20, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.1%, courtesy of a surge in SIS software sales, ramp up of drilling operations in Colombia and Argentina along with higher pricing in North America’s onshore market. Moreover, Schlumberger delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 6.4% over the last four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.   Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions to get a clear picture of analyst opinion on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents for the first quarter has been stable in the last seven days. The estimate reflects a year-over-year improvement of about 52%.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $7,850 million for the first quarter, indicating a rise of13.9% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to ConsiderSchlumberger is the largest oilfield services player in the world with access to every energy market. Through all operating business segments, the company maintains its position as one of the key players.For the Drilling Group segment, The Zacks Consensus Estimate for pretax operating profit is $299 million, significantly higher than $229 million reported in the first quarter of 2017.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Production Group business unit is pegged at $282 million, higher than $110 million in the prior-year quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for pretax operating income at the Reservoir Characterization segment is $290 million, higher than $281 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Overall, higher crude price during the first quarter is expected to support oilfield players, involved in the setting up of oil wells.The average monthly price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude per barrel for the month of January, February and March of 2018 was recorded at $63.70, $62.23 and $62.73, respectively, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Notably, the average monthly WTI crude price has never touched $60 since 2015. Crude rally was supported primarily by continued production curbs from OPEC and its allies.Nevertheless, we are concerned about Schlumberger’s lesser exposure to the U.S. shale plays – where more drillers have gathered following partial recovery in crude prices. Thus, Schlumberger is losing out on the opportunity to gain profitable contracts from shale drillers of late.Price Performance in Q1During the quarter, Schlumberger lost 3.9% compared with the industry’s 8.3% decline.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Schlumberger is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is -2.22% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 37 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at 38 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Schlumberger carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with earnings ESP of -2.22%, lowers the possibility of an earnings surprise.Stocks to ConsiderThough earnings beat looks uncertain for Kinder Morgan, here are some firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model. These have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Continental Resources, Inc (CLR  -  Free Report) is an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company.

1074,SLB,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported a decline in total rig count in the United States.Details on Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count hampers demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 936 in the week ended Jan 19 — lower than the prior week’s 939. This marked a decrease in rig count for three times in the last four weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 694.For the week in discussion, the fall in rig count can be attributed to decreased onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs were 916, lower than 919. The tally for offshore and inland waters were 19 and 1, in line with the respective counts for the week ended Jan 12. Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 747 slipped from 752 recorded for the week ended Jan 12. This marked a decline after the domestic plays witnessed the addition of 10 rigs through the week ended on Jan 12.However, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than the previous year’s count of 551.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 189 was up from 187 for the week ended Jan 12. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 142.   Per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88.2%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 57 units fell from the count of 62 for the week ended Jan 12. However, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by two units to 879.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 19 units — 16 of which were oil-directed — in line with the tally for the week ended Jan 12.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil decreased while the count for natural gas increased. Overall, the total tally of rigs in the United States declined, thanks to the removal of the respective four and three rigs from the Utica and Eagle Ford shale plays. In the Utica resources, natural gas rig count fell from 27 to 24, while the tally for oil rig was zero against 1 in the week ended Jan 12. At the Eagle Ford shale, the count of rigs exploring crude fell from 62 to 58.On top of that, two rigs were removed from each of DJ-Niobrara basin, Cana Woodford shale and Barnett shale play.Although the count of oil rigs fell, there has been plenty of room for crude explorers to ramp up drilling, given that the commodity has been trading above the $60-per-barrel mark.  Energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) and EOG Resources, Inc.

1075,SLB,"Oil services behemoths Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report) and Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report) have kick-started the fourth quarter energy earnings season in style. Results of the two biggies – providers of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells – are closely followed events. They serve as barometers of oilfield activity, providing a glimpse into demand trends for energy services like drilling, completion, production.Schlumberger, Halliburton Comes Up with Upbeat Q4The world’s largest oilfield services provider, Schlumberger, reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of 48 cents per share (excluding charges and credits), ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents and the year-ago figure of 27 cents. Surge in SIS software sales, ramp up of drilling operations in Colombia and Argentina along with higher pricing in North America’s onshore market supported the strong fourth-quarter results.Smaller rival Halliburton reported better-than-expected fourth quarter profit thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America -- the company’s largest market by sales. Halliburton’s income from continuing operation (adjusted for Venezuela write-downs and charges associated with U.S. tax reform) came in at 53 cents per share, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents – the fourteenth consecutive quarterly outperformance. Moreover, revenues of $5,940 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,567 million.The Road AheadBoth companies, apart from coming out with estimate beating numbers, indicated that activity in North America remain strong even as the international market continues to improve.Schlumberger, which plans to exit its marine and land seismic acquisition services, believes that the positive oil market sentiment will push up North American investment by upstream operators. Meanwhile, the international market is expected to witness 5% higher spending in 2018 following three years of decline.Halliburton also sounded optimistic in its view that the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing, particularly for pressure pumping. Additionally, the outlook for Halliburton’s international market continues to improve. In fact, regional sales were up 11% sequentially in the fourth-quarter on the back of strong activity gains across a number of product services lines in Latin America, as well as increases in drilling and stimulation activity in the Eastern Hemisphere.What the Positive Results Mean for the Oilfield Services SectorThe strong earnings reports naturally pleased investors. Consequently, shares of Schlumberger and Halliburton have surged 4% and 7% since their respective releases. Moreover, the companies' positive outlook for their U.S. and international operations bode well for the health of the oil industry. As it is, crude has been on a stellar run over the past few months.The U.S. oil benchmark wrapped up a strong fourth-quarter amid continued declines in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative. With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, oil ended 2017 at $60.42 per barrel – the first settlement above $60 since June 2015. A year ago, crude futures hovered around the $53 per barrel mark.Importantly, higher commodity prices continue to spur U.S. production to near-record levels supporting the surge in oil production and drilling activity. The U.S. rig count has jumped around 35% from same time last year, reflecting strong demand for oilfield services. And unlike the past few quarters, the tight domestic market is complemented by a gradually improving foreign business that is witnessing a spurt in tendering activity.Overall, the improving macro scenario is likely to translate into significant cash flows for the oilfield service operators.How to Pick the Right Stocks?To guide investors to the right picks, we highlight three oilfield service stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1076,SLB,"It was a week where the price of oil finished lower and natural gas futures also pulled back from their highest levels since May.On the news front, oilfield service majors Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) and Halliburton Co. (HAL  -  Free Report) kicked off the fourth-quarter energy earnings season. Importantly, both companies, apart from coming out with estimate beating numbers, indicated that activity in North America remain strong even as the international market continues to improve. Meanwhile, British oil giant BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) saw its Deepwater Horizon costs spill over $65 billion following a new, $1.7 billion charge in the fourth-quarter.Overall, it was a dismal week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost about 1.5% to close at $63.37 per barrel, while natural gas prices edged down 0.5% to $3.185 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Shell's Acquisition, Apache & Encana's Production Guidance & More)The U.S. oil benchmark recorded its first weekly decline in a month. The major culprit was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. U.S. output rose by 258,000 barrels per day last week to 9.75 million barrels per day, tantalizingly close to December’s record of 9.789 million barrels per day -- the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In fact, the Energy Department believes that U.S. output will break through the 10 million barrels per day barrier soon, thereby cancelling out cuts from OPEC and its allies.The negative sentiment was partially offset by another higher-than-expected weekly draw. Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 33 of the last 41 weeks and are down more than 120 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 412.7 million barrels, current crude supplies are 15% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2015.Meanwhile, natural gas – one of 2017’s worst-performing commodities – settled lower following a smaller-than-expected decrease in supplies. The 183 billion cubic feet (Bcf) withdrawal was also below the five-year (2013-2017) average net shrinkage of 203 Bcf for the reported week, pointing to tepid demand for the heating fuel.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    The world’s largest oilfield services provider, Schlumberger, reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of 48 cents per share (excluding charges and credits), ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents and the year-ago figure of 27 cents.Surge in SIS software sales, ramp up of drilling operations in Colombia and Argentina along with higher pricing in North America’s onshore market supported the strong fourth-quarter results.On a further positive note, Schlumberger issued a positive outlook for 2018. The company, which plans to exit its marine and land seismic acquisition services, believes that the positive oil market sentiment will push up North American investment by upstream operators. Meanwhile, the international market is expected to witness 5% higher spending in 2018 following three years of decline.As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had approximately $5,089 million in cash and short-term investments and $14,875 million in long-term debt. This represents a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 32.8%. In the October-to-December quarter, Schlumberger bought back 1.6 million shares. (Read more Schlumberger's Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates, Up Y/Y)2.    Smaller rival Halliburton reported better-than-expected fourth quarter profit thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America -- the company’s largest market by sales. Halliburton’s income from continuing operation (adjusted for Venezuela write-downs and charges associated with U.S. tax reform) came in at 53 cents per share, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents – the fourteenth consecutive quarterly outperformance. Moreover, revenues of $5,940 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,567 million.Along the results, Halliburton also sounded optimistic in its view that the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing, particularly for pressure pumping.Additionally, the outlook for Halliburton’s international market continues to improve. In fact, regional sales were up 11% sequentially in the fourth-quarter on the back of strong activity gains across a number of product services lines in Latin America, as well as increases in drilling and stimulation activity in the Eastern Hemisphere.Halliburton’s capital expenditure in the fourth quarter was $439 million. For the full year, capital spending was $1,373 million. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had approximately $2,337 million in cash/cash equivalents and $10,430 million in long-term debt, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 55.5%. (Read more Halliburton Shares Leap After Q4 Earnings, Sales Beat)3.    BP is likely to pay additional charge of about $1.7 billion in fourth-quarter 2017 relating to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon (""DWH"") spill. The Court Supervised Settlement Program (""CSSP""), which was established post the DWH, has ordered BP to pay a post-tax non-operating charge of about $1.7 billion for the remaining Business Economic Loss (""BEL"") and other claims related with the CSSP. The payment will be carried out over a multi-year period.The high claims determined by the CSSP along with the effect of the Fifth Circuit’s adverse May 2017 ruling on the matching of revenues with expenses while appraising BEL claims has resulted in this charge.The claims are about seven times higher than the company’s expectations. By the end of September 2017, BP paid about $63.4 billion to cover clean-up costs and legal fees connected to the largest environmental disaster in the U.S. history where 11 rig workers were killed. Moreover, hundreds of outstanding claims have yet to be closed. (Read more: BP to Cough Up Additional $1.7B in Charges for 2010 Oil Spill)4.    Pipeline operator, Energy Transfer Partners (ETP  -  Free Report) recently agreed to divest its compression units, CDM Resource Management and CDM Environmental & Technical Services LLC, to natural gas compression services provider, USA Compression Partners, LP for about $1.8 billion.Per the deal, USA Compression will pay $1.225 billion in cash along with 19.2 million of its common units and 6.4 million of its Class B units to Energy Transfer Partners. However, there won’t be any quarterly distributions for the Class B units in the first year following the closure of the transaction, which is expected by the first half of 2018.The deal is expected to strengthen Energy Transfer Partners' balance sheet by lowering its debt burden. As of Sep 30, 2017, the partnership had long-term debt (less current maturities) of $33,630 million. Debt-to-capitalization ratio was about 52.2%. Apart from reducing the debt load, the cash proceeds of $1.225 billion can also be used for funding new projects. The move also reduces the chance of the partnership slashing its distribution – currently yielding an attractive 11.3% – in the coming quarters. (Read more Energy Transfer Partners Divests Compression Units for $1.8B)5.    Moving forward with its $30-billion divestment goal, Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) is set to offload West Qurna 1 oil field in Iraq to Japan's Itochu Corporation. However, the value of the transaction has been kept under wraps.The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company also intends to close the divestment of its interest in the Majnoon oil field in Iraq to the state-run Basra Oil Company by June 2018. Production in the Majnoon oil field started in 2014, with average capacity of 210,000 barrels per day. It is to be noted, Shell has a 45% operating stake in the Majnoon oil field. Malaysian national petroleum company, Petronas and Iraq’s Missan Oil Company have 30% and 25% stakes in the field, respectively.The primary reason behind Shell leaving Majnoon is that the oil department of the country and the company could not agree on the future production plans and investments for the field. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The divestment is in line with Shell's strategy to steer clear of debt stemming from its $50-billion acquisition of BG Group.

1079,SLB,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report), a GE company, reported an increase in total rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in this Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 990 in the week (ended Mar 16) — higher than the prior week’s 984. Notably, the total count increased for the fifth time in the prior seven weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 789.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 973, higher than 967.Four rigs operated in the inland waters last week, in line with the count for the week ended Mar 9. The tally for offshore rigs was also in line at 13.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 800 was up from 796 for the week ended Mar 9. Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than the previous year’s count of 631. The tally for oil rigs increased five times in the last six weeks.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 189 was up from 188 for the week ended Mar 9. With this, the tally increased five times in the last six weeks.Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 157.Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88.2% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 57 units decreased from 61 units. However, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by 10 units to 933 units.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 13 units — 12 of which were oil-directed — in line with the tally for the week ended Mar 9.ConclusionThe number of total rigs exploring oil and gas in the United States increased, courtesy of the addition of four and three onshore rigs in Oklahoma  and North Dakota respectively. Two onshore rigs were also added in Texas.Crude pricing scenario has been healthy after the OPEC members agreed to extend the production curb deal beyond first-quarter 2018. Given that oil has been trading mostly over the $60-per-barrel mark since January, we believe that there is considerable opportunity for U.S. shale players to continue ramping up drilling activities.  Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Continental Resources, Inc.

1080,SLB,"We expect Halliburton Company’s (HAL  -  Free Report) Completion and Production segment — which makes up around 65% of the oilfield service provider’s total revenue and more than 80% of its operating income — to post improved results in fourth-quarter 2017. This could help Halliburton notch its 14th consecutive quarterly outperformance when it reports on Monday, Jan 22.(See more in Is Halliburton Poised for a Beat This Earnings Season?)   The Completion and Production segment supplies cementing, stimulation, intervention and completion services. The unit comprises of production enhancement services, completion tools and services, and cementing services.A Look at Halliburton’s Completion and Production Performance in Q3Completion and Production revenue grew 12.9% sequentially and 62.5% from the year-ago level. Operating income from the segment was $525 million, significantly higher than the $24 million a year ago. The division also improved from previous quarter’s income of $397 million, helped by better utilization and pricing in the North American land market -- especially in Halliburton’s pressure pumping, completion tools and cementing product service lines.Oil Tailwinds to Boost Q4 ActivityWith U.S. rig count falling to record levels in 2016, oilfield services players (like Halliburton) were hit hard. Unprecedented declines in activity levels and a sharp fall in upstream spending led to lower revenues and pricing headwinds. However, as commodity prices steadily improve and drilling activities pick up, the market for services companies is on the mend.The U.S. oil benchmark wrapped up a strong quarter amid continued declines in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative. With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, oil ended 2017 at $60.42 per barrel – the first settlement above $60 since June 2015. A year ago, crude futures hovered around the $53 per barrel mark.Though we are still not anywhere near the activity highs seen in 2014, spending on exploration projects have experienced a much-awaited rebound. The energy explorers, buoyed by the jump in commodity prices, are set for improving sales and earnings – a part of which is likely to be pocketed by the long-struggling oilfield service providers.In particular, the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing -- particularly for pressure pumping.Completion and Production Unit to BenefitConsequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Halliburton’s largest segment’s fourth-quarter revenue is pegged at $3,641 million, 60.5% higher than the reported figure in the corresponding quarter of 2016 and up 3% sequentially.And with the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company seeing continued pricing strength, its operating income for the division is expected to jump to $570 million from just $85 million in the fourth-quarter of 2016 and representing a 9% sequential increase.(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.)Overall Earnings & Revenue ProjectionsNotably for the world's second-largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report), the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 46 cents reflects a massive growth from the prior-year quarter profit of 4 cents. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $5,574 million indicates a 38.6% increase on a year-over-year basis.Our TakeThe improving oil price outlook and strengthening North American market conditions have led to strong demand for Halliburton’s completions equipment and services. This will support the company’s top and bottom-line growths.Earnings Schedules of Other Major Oilfield Service ProvidersAmong the major players, Schlumberger is scheduled to release today, while Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) will report on Jan 24. Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), another biggie, will report fourth-quarter earnings early next month.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

1081,SLB,"SchlumbergerLimited’s (SLB  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of 48 cents per share (eliminating charges and credits) surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents and the year-earlier figure of 27 cents.Total revenues of $8,179 million improved from the year-earlier level of $7,107 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,116 million.Surge in SIS software sales, ramp up of drilling operations in Colombia and Argentina along with higher pricing in North America’s onshore market supported the strong fourth-quarter results.Schlumberger is the first among the “Big Four” oilfield service and equipment providers to report fourth-quarter results. The other players — Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) and Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report) — will likely report results on Jan 22, Jan 24 and Feb 2, respectively.Segmental PerformanceEach of the groups — Reservoir Characterization, Drilling Group and Production Group — recorded a year-over-year rise in earnings.Drilling Group revenues increased primarily on contributions from the international market.

Increased operations in Russia, Argentina and Saudi Arabia drove the segment’s fourth-quarter numbers. Surge in pricing in North America’s onshore market also contributed to the outperformance.   The Reservoir Characterization segment was also supported by strong contributions from the international market. Jump in sales of SIS software led to increased profits.Reservoir Characterization: Revenues totaled $1,638 million compared with $1,676 million in the prior-year quarter.

1082,SLB,"For this column, even though there is a chance the U.S. government may shut down today, we will not wade into those waters at this time. Instead, we will let D.C. be D.C. After all, even if the government does shut down, it doesn’t take away the positive results we’ve seen overall so far in Q4 earnings season.Yesterday after the bell we saw good Q4 headlines from companies of diverse industries, from Big Tech play IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) to Transportation’s Canadian Pacific (CP  -  Free Report). Although the devil is in the details for IBM in the quarter just passed, we still see beats on the top and bottom lines and growth year over year.Another transportation firm, Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), has this morning topped the Zacks consensus earnings estimate by 2 cents to $1.38 per share. The railway major narrowly missed the analyst consensus on quarterly revenues, however, to $660.4 million. Operation income was up in the quarter, though operating ratio was slightly down year over year. For more on KSU’s earnings, click here.Oil services giant Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report) beat estimates on its top and bottom line ahead of today’s opening bell: 48 cents per share on $8.18 billion in revenues outpaced the 44 cents per share and $8.12 billion expected, respectively. Year over year, Production was up a whopping 146%, with Drilling up 36% from the year-ago quarter. For more on SLB’s earnings, click here.Q4 Earnings Results for Regional BanksNow that most of the biggest bank conglomerates on Wall Street have already posted Q4 results, we now turn to a series of regionally run, smaller banks. The good news here is these banks have performed at least as well as the much larger financial institutions.Birmingham, AL-based Regions Financial (RF  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, posted a one-cent beat to 27 cents per share, even counting a one-time tax write-off amounting to 7 cents per share. Revenues of $318 million easily surpassed the $278 million we had anticipated. For more on RF’s earnings, click here.Providence, RI-based Citizens Financial (CFG  -  Free Report) topped bottom-line estimates by 4 cents to 71 cents per share, on $1.48 billion in revenues which also beat the Zacks consensus and rose 6.3% year over year. This marks at least the fifth straight earnings beat for the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company, with the trailing 4 quarters posting an average positive surprise of 9.1%. For more on CFG’s earnings, click here.Finally, Atlanta, GA-based SunTrust Banks (STI  -  Free Report), another Zacks Rank #2-rated bank, put up $1.09 per share — 4 cents better than the $1.04 expected and +21% year over year — on an in-line $2.31 billion in quarterly revenues. For the full year, SunTrust reports $4.09 per share for a 3-cent beat and +14% growth from the year-ago quarter. For more on STI’s earnings, click here.

1083,SLB,"So far in Q1 earnings, 10.4% of the S&P 500 companies have reported results. The total 52 companies belonging to the index saw year-over-year earnings growth of 27.9% on 10.7% higher revenues. Notably, 84.6% of the firms surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings while 78.8% beat the revenue mark.As of now, we have seen only one S&P 500 release from the Energy space — Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report).Energy Sector Likely to Shine BrightFor the first-quarter of 2018, we expect Energy to eclipse all the 16 Zacks sectors, posting earnings growth of 58.6%. For the January-to-March quarter, we project earnings of $14 billion — the highest in the last four quarters.  Importantly, Energy will likely be among the major drivers behind the S&P 500’s year-over-year earnings growth. Excluding Energy, the index’s Q1 earnings growth will likely drop to 16.5% from 17.8%. A favorable Q1 oil pricing scenario is expected to back Energy’s performance. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude price for the month of January, February and March was reported at $63.70 per barrel, $62.23 and $62.73, respectively. The average oil price never touched $60 in any of the months in the 2015-2017 period, thanks to the extension of OPEC’s production cut deal through 2018-end.Let’s See How SLB & BHGE ere PlacedBoth Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) and Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report) belong to the Zacks Oil & Gas-Field Services industry, which falls under the Energy sector as well. Both stocks are scheduled to report on April 20, before the opening bell.Let’s employ a few parameters to analyze how the stocks will fare earnings season.Earnings ESP & HistoryEarnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have a high chance of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that stocks with a combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Schlumberger will beat estimates this quarter. This is because the stock has an Earnings ESP of -1.72% and a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank of 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Baker Hughes is unlikely to beat estimates, since it has a combination of a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and Earnings ESP of -2.94%. This is because we caution against Sell-rated stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Schlumberger’s earnings surprise history is impressive. The stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 6.4%.The picture is just the reverse for Baker Hughes, with the stock failing to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the past four quarters. The average negative earnings surprise for the last four quarters is recorded at 34.8%.Earnings GrowthWe expect Schlumberger to witness earnings growth of 52% for Q1 2018. Baker Hughes’ projected growth of 250% is much healthier.Price PerformanceSchlumberger stock fell 3.9% during the January-March quarter of 2018, performing better than the respective decline of 7.7% and 12.2% of the industry and Baker Hughes.Bottom LineThe healthy oil pricing scenario is favorable for both the stocks, as oilfield services players are expected to clinch more contracts for setting up oil wells.Although Baker Hughes scores way higher in terms of earnings growth, the stock is unlikely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Meanwhile, Schlumberger has higher chances of trumping estimates.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1084,SLB,"SeaDrill Limited’s  shares have increased 64.68% to eventually close at 36.56 cents on Apr 18, reflecting investors’ optimism on the stock after the company’s restructuring plan won approval from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.  Looking BackHit by the industry downturn, SeaDrill had been going through a rough patch over the last two years, with its shares plummeting more than 91% during the time frame, owing to increased debts and bankruptcy fears. Reduced demand for drilling and diminishing contracts negatively impacted the company’s revenues, earnings and cash flows.Notably, it has been facing pressure in its top line owing to idle rigs and lower day rates. SeaDrill incurred a net loss of $3,102 million in 2017 owing to higher operational and restructuring costs, along with low revenues.The company filed for bankruptcy protection on Sep 12, 2017 to restructure its balance sheet amid volatile oil prices. After months of negotiations and delays, it announced a global settlement in the restructuring deal on Feb 26, 2018.SeaDrill’s Chapter 11 filing was just another disruption in the offshore drilling industry. Many offshore drilling companies like Ocean Rig UDW LLC., Paragon Offshore, Hercules Offshore, Inc. and Vantage Drilling Company had also filed for bankruptcy protection amid declining oil prices.The Restructuring PlanSeadrill has received virtually unanimous backing for its reorganization plan. The company’s financial restructuring plan received approval from 99.8% of the creditors and has also been officially confirmed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. The company now expects to emerge from Chapter 11 in two to three months.Per the restructuring agreement, the international offshore drilling company will witness capital injection of $1.08 billion that would comprise $880 million secured loans and $200 million equity.Under the restructuring plan, banks will defer the maturities of all secured credit facilities worth $5.7 billion by five years, with no amortization payments till 2020, along with significant covenant relief. The plan will also witness the conversion of $2.3 billion worth unsecured bonds into 15% of equity in the restructured company.However, shareholders will be receiving a minimal recovery from their existing shares. Existing shareholders will receive only 1.9% stake in the post restructuring equity.What’s Ahead?With the rise in commodity prices owing to robust demand and OPEC production-cuts, market scenario for the drilling and oilfield services companies looks promising with increased upstream spending. Especially, the North American land markets are expected to have the best margin opportunities; however, the offshore drilling environment still looks a bit challenging.Nonetheless, with Seadrill nearing bankruptcy exit with its restructuring plan, it will improve the liquidity position of the company and provide growth opportunities. SeaDrill, having one of the youngest and most advanced drilling fleets, will be poised to secure more contracts post the restructuring, helping the company to stabilize revenues.SeaDrill, whose peers include Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Nabors Industries Limited (NBR  -  Free Report) among others, has a high economic utilization for its floaters. Post restructuring, the company is likely to gain a competitive advantage with its newly restructured balance sheet.SeaDrill also intends to expand its relationship ties with Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) — the world’s largest oilfield service provider — with which it is already collaborating to offer integrated services in India.Importantly, per Reuters, the company is also in talks with other major oil service companies for strategic collaboration opportunities. As it is, a wave of consolidation has hit the industry in the last couple of years amid the oil slump, in order to take advantages of integrated offerings, increased scale, synergies and new capabilities. The service providers believe that mergers and acquisitions will help them cut their average costs and benefit from mutual technical expertise exchange.Although SeaDrill has no immediate consolidation plans, the company’s CEO Dibowitz is looking for strategic opportunities to enhance its long-term growth prospects.

1086,SLB,"U.S. President Donald Trump fired Rex Tillerson, the secretary of State, on Tuesday, removing him as the nation's top international diplomat. The stunning development, which Trump said necessitated from the two having a 'different mindset' on major foreign policy issues and their 'disagreement on things' including the landmark Iran nuclear deal, capped a difficult tenure for Tillerson. The president replaced Tillerson with Mike Pompeo, the CIA Director, saying that the spy chief 'will do a fantastic job'.Rex Tillerson’s Tumultuous TenureFormer ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) Chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) Rex Tillerson was the first oil executive and the second Texan to be in charge of U.S.'s international diplomacy. Trump and Tillerson have been out of step on a number of issues - from the Iran deal to North Korea and Russia.The decorated oilman was one of the harshest critic of Russian actions, a stance at odds with the White House, and was supposedly against the proposed meeting between Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. The former secretary of state also had serious differences with Trump on how to handle the Iran nuclear accord, from which the President wants to withdraw if it is not ratified per his satisfaction. There were a number of other instances where the two appeared out of sync.Trump’s Cabinet Shuffle: All Eyes on the Iran Nuclear DealThe removal of Rex Tillerson as secretary of state raises questions over the future of the Iran nuclear deal. There are indications that the 'more hawkish' Mike Pompeo might lead America's exit from the Iran pact if the European allies do not agree to toughen the terms by May 12. This has injected uncertainty into the oil market and can potentially send prices higher.The Iran Nuclear Deal: On Nov 24, 2015, Iran reached a temporary accord with six world powers – the U.S., Great Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany – to restrict its nuclear activities in return for the Persian nation’s relief from international sanctions on oil, auto parts, gold and precious metals. Ultimately, the embargo was lifted in January 2016 after certification from the UN nuclear watchdog.Trump Approves the Pact One Last Time: In October last year, the American administration decertified (but did not withdrew from) the 2015 accord – forged by then-President Barack Obama – on the pretext that the Persian Gulf country is in breach of the spirit of the agreement, which no longer serves U.S. national security interests.On Jan 12 this year, the president gave the agreement a 'final' lifeline, agreeing to waive U.S. sanctions one last time and keeping U.S. in the deal. At the same time, President Trump demanded the European allies and Congress fix the 'disastrous flaws' in the pact within 120 days.Insists on Key Changes to the Multilateral Agreement: For long, Trump has been expressing his opposition to the Obama-era agreement (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA), terming it as 'catastrophic' with bad terms for the U.S. His government now wants to delegitimize the pact in its entirety by asking for additional concessions from Iran on some key portions of the deal. The U.S. President is also trying to curb Tehran's ballistic missile program, cyberattacks and support for terrorist groups - issues mostly outside the purview of the JCPOA.Tillerson’s Successor an Iran Hawk: CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who is set to replace Rex Tillerson, is a known Iran hard-liner sharing the President’s views on the nuclear deal. Unsurprisingly therefore, his appointment raises the specter of U.S. moving out of the historic accord.Scrapping of the Iran Deal Will Affect Energy MarketsRenewed Sanctions Will Amplify Iran’s Struggles to Attract Foreign Capital: The 2015 deal was seen as a big win for Iran with the infusion of tens of billions of dollars into the Middle Eastern nation’s hobbling economy in return for curtailment of its nuclear program and site inspections. However, the country is still struggling to attract foreign investment, which is way short of the level required for it to achieve its economic ambitions. Things may become even tougher if U.S. President Donald Trump follows through with his rhetoric.Trump administration’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal will likely lead to tougher U.S. restrictions against Iran. In particular, the decision could choke off foreign investment the Islamic Republic badly needs to restore the health of its ageing oilfields and boost output following years of crippling earlier sanctions.Following the lifting of sanctions in January 2016, Iran’s crude oil production and exports have been on a rise. As per OPEC’s monthly report, the country’s daily oil output exceeded 3.8 million barrels in January, of which around 2 million barrels were exported.The current statistics marks a considerable jump from an average of around 2.8 million barrels per day in 2013 when Tehran was under international sanctions for its nuclear program. Exports languished at about 980,000 barrels per day.Therefore, it’s quite obvious that the return of sanctions would put pressure on OPEC’s third-largest oil producer’s energy industry and affect the market in general.An American pullout of the nuclear agreement won’t immediately curb the flow of the Gulf country’s swelling crude exports as the U.S. is not a buyer of Iranian oil. Moreover, it is also quite unlikely that Trump will get Europe or China – Iran’s biggest clients – in reinstating the embargo on Tehran.However, the U.S. might threaten the buyers of Iranian crude or any company with major investments in the country’s upstream sector, with financial penalties. This could force some of the companies, especially those with assets in the U.S., scale back purchases/investments out of fear of being kept out of the world’s largest capital markets.A disruption to Iranian oil exports and investments in the country might cut off some of its supplies to the global market, thereby boosting crude prices.These Companies Could be Hurt: With the U.S. still maintaining certain bilateral sanctions, domestic companies can’t enter into physical partnerships with their Iranian counterparts. However, some U.S. firms have been trying to bypass this by approaching the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) – the Treasury Department’s sanctions administrator – for licenses in specific sectors including oil and gas, provided these do not hurt U.S. policy interests.However, there is no such problem for European and Asian companies, who have already started negotiating with local players to expand and fortify their presence in the Iranian market. Biggies from across the pond like Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) and Eni SpA (E  -  Free Report) are among the firms who have been shortlisted for work in the OPEC member’s upstream sector oil and gas projects. Oilfield services behemoth Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report) is also in the fray to potentially develop Tehran’s massive energy resources.But it is French energy giant TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) that stands to be the biggest casualty. In July 2017, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company announced that it has signed an agreement with the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) for the development and production of phase 11 of South Pars (SP11) – the world’s largest gas field. This project will have a capacity to produce 2 billion cubic feet of gas per day or 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day including condensate.(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.)The development contract marked the reentry of TOTAL in this reserve rich Middle-East nation, which it exited in 2006. TOTAL is the first among the global oil and gas major to strike a deal with the Iranian administration and begin work for the development of existing resources of Iran.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

1087,SLB,"Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Jan 22, before market opens.In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.5%, thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America. The world's second-largest oilfield services company, after Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), has an incredible history when it comes to beating earnings estimates. The company posted average positive earnings surprise of 41.23% in the trailing four quarters. Investors should note that Halliburton hasn’t missed earnings estimates since mid-2014.Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise  Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company Quote This Houston, TX-based provider of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells is likely to maintain this trend in the fourth quarter too. Evidently, multiple tailwinds including the recovery in commodity prices have buoyed the entire space.With U.S. activity accelerating and margins set to remain strong, Halliburton is likely to beat estimates in the quarter under review. The positive sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the strong earnings estimate revisions with two estimates going up and none going down over the last seven days for the current quarter.Factors at PlayPrices of oil at the end of the fourth quarter were $60.46 per barrel, up about 19.6% sequentially amid tightening supplies, improving demand outlook and OPEC-deal extension talks.The oilfield service provider is poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices.With the North American land market improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing — particularly for pressure pimping — Halliburton remains optimistic of generating higher earnings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter for Completion and Production revenues is pegged at $3,641 million, higher than $3,537 million and $2,268 million reported in the prior quarter and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively. Sales in the Drilling and Evaluation unit are forecasted to be $1,960million compared with the prior-quarter figure of $1,907 million and $1,753 million in the year-ago quarter.We also appreciate Halliburton’s successful cost-management initiatives amid weak oil prices over a length of time. Last year, the company successfully implemented its plan of cutting annual costs by $1 billion. In fact, Halliburton has used the challenges prevailing in the industry to its advantage, mainly by offering low cost solutions that aids producers in churning out more by investing less.All these positive factors are also reflected in the price movement of the company. Shares of the company have rallied over 6% outperforming the broader industry’s decline of 1.9% in fourth-quarter 2017. What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Halliburton is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for this company is +0.79%. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Halliburton carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) which, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us confident of an earnings beat.Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. On the other hand, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Energy Stocks With Favorable CombinationHalliburton is not the only energy firm looking up this earnings season. Here are some companies from the space which, according to our model, also have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +33.8% and a Zacks Rank #3. The energy equipment maker is expected to release earnings results on Feb 5.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 4.7% to close at $64.30 per barrel, while natural gas prices soared nearly 15% to $3.20 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Hess' Oil Find, Petrobras' $2.95B Settlement & More)Building on its second annual gain in a row, oil prices maintained its solid start to the New Year. The second week of 2018 saw U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest closing since December 2014. The major catalyst was the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded another higher-than-expected weekly draw. On a further bullish note, domestic oil production snapped its steadily rising trend and fell for the second time since October.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 32 of the last 40 weeks and are down almost 114 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 419.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 13.2% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2015.Meanwhile, natural gas – one of 2017’s worst-performing commodities – registered a big jump following a record decrease in supplies. The massive, 359 billion cubic feet (Bcf) withdrawal was blamed on strong demand due to freezing temperatures over bulk of the country.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    In a bid to bolster its renewable energy business, Royal Dutch Shell recently inked a deal to acquire a 43.8% stake in Silicon Ranch Corporation from Partners Group. The deal will help Shell leverage its position as one of the top three wholesale power sellers in the United States along with boosting its New Energies division.Silicon Ranch is a leading solar energy company in the United States and the deal will make Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Shell its largest stakeholder. Silicon Ranch operates around 100 solar facilities across the United States, having about 1.9 gigawatts of solar-based power facilities in its development portfolio. Per the deal, the company will continue to operate under its existing management and retain its brand. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The transaction could be valued up to $217 million in cash, contingent on Silicon Ranch’s performance. Subject to regulatory approvals and satisfactory closing conditions, the deal is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of 2018. Further, the deal also provides Shell an opportunity to increase its stake in Silicon Ranch after 2021.

Houston-based upstream player estimates fourth-quarter production from international operations to miss the prior guidance — provided in October 2017 — owing to weaker-than-expected performance of some of its projects in the North Sea.The company currently expects the fourth quarter production values from international operations to be in the range of 138,000-140,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) compared with its prior forecast levels of 150,000-160,000 BOE/d. Unexpected shutdown of Forties Pipeline System and underperformance of wells in the Beryl area have been the primary factors for the lower forecast. Nevertheless, Apache expects improved realized prices to offer respite amid the declining volumes.As it is, the company has been bearing the brunt of contracting production volumes in all the last three reported quarters. From January to September 2017, Apache’s production averaged 345,495 BOE/d, down 13% from the first nine months of 2016. (Read more Apache Stock Down on Production Guidance Cut for Q4)3.    Shares of Encana moved up around 2.5% to eventually close the day at $13.64 on Jan 9 after the company announced that fourth-quarter production volumes from core assets beat estimates. The upstream operator has successfully repositioned its asset base and shifted focus to four key growth areas namely Montney, Duvemay, Eagle Ford and Permian.On the back of the strength of core assets, Canadian energy behemoth delivered year-over-year production growth of approximately 31% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Further, the output also topped the high end of the company’s guidance range of 25-30%.While the exact total production figures have not been released, an increase of around 31% implies that the output from the core assets jumped to around 310,601 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) in the fourth quarter of 2017 as against the 237,100 BOE/d (or 74% of the total production) recorded in the year-ago quarter. (Read more Encana Gains as Output From Key Assets Tops Estimates in Q4)4.    The Williams Companies, Inc.’s (WMB  -  Free Report) Constitution Pipeline project recently suffered a major setback when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) refused to rescind New York’s denial of a water permit to the project. The ruling has come as a blow to pipeline developers’ endeavors to transport additional natural gas to New England, which relies heavily on pipeline imports from Canada and overseas.Williams Companies applied for the water permit in August 2013. However, the company withdrew and resubmitted the application twice, which led to the resetting of the one-year deadline by New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). In 2016, the DEC announced its decision not to grant the water permit to Williams Companies.From Interestingly, the project had received FERC’s approval in early 2016. However, the DEC denied issuing a water quality permit to the pipeline claiming that the owners of the project and the FERC did not analyze the environmental impacts of the project adequately and the pipeline will possibly impact over 250 streams adversely.

The transaction with an effective date of Oct 1, 2017, is scheduled to close in the first quarter of 2018, and is subject to the fulfillment of the necessary closing conditions. The closure of the transaction may be deferred.The proceeds from the transaction will be used for general corporate purposes, including lowering of debt. The sale is in line with its strategy to focus on development of Midland Basin and Eagle Ford assets. Based on this transaction, as of the end of third-quarter 2017, there will be a likely lowering in net debt by about 20% and net debt to EBITDAX ratio to less than three times.

1091,SLB,"Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) recently announced that the company is considering an opportunity to form a joint venture (JV) with Subsea 7 S.A. (SUBCY  -  Free Report) to provide clients with better subsea installations and oilfield services, derived from their Subsea Integration Alliance's success. Following the news of JV formation, Schlumberger gained 2.4% and Subsea stocks added 7.1% on last Friday.The JV is expected to improve client efficiency and provide cost synergies to the partners, which will in turn, result in increasing total production. It will enable the companies to offer their clients more integrated deepwater services. Per the deal, both the companies in the 50-50 partnership can provide non-integrated products and services individually to their clients.Such JV’s are common in the industry where it operates. At the beginning of last year, TechnipFMC plc (FTI  -  Free Report) came into existence following the merger between Technip and FMC Technologies. It is engaged in the designing, producing and servicing of technologically sophisticated systems and products for subsea, onshore/offshore, and surface projects.

1092,SLB,"Major oilfield service provider Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report its first-quarter 2018 results on Monday, Apr 23, before market opens. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a profit of 41 cents on revenues of $5,760 million.In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 15.2% thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America -- the company’s largest market by sales.On a further encouraging note, the world's second-largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) has an incredible history when it comes to beating earnings estimates. Investors should note that Halliburton hasn’t missed earnings estimates since mid-2014, as you can see in the chart below:Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company QuoteEven pricewise, the stock has done better than the peer group so far this year; it is up 4.5% in 2018 as against 0.2% loss for the Zacks Oil and Gas Field Services industry. Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Houston, TX-based provider of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells surpasses earnings estimate this time too.Unfortunately, as per our model, the trend is likely to be broken in the first quarter. Evidently, multiple headwinds including fracking sand logistics issues have dampened expectations.Thus, while U.S. activity continues to accelerate and margins remain strong, Halliburton’s underlying results are unlikely to come ahead of our expectations. The tepid sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the estimate revision trend has been negative with four downward estimate revisions and none up in the last month.Let’s delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact Halliburton’s third-quarter results.Factors to Consider This QuarterWith U.S. rig count falling to record levels in 2016, oilfield services players (like Halliburton) were hit hard. Unprecedented declines in activity levels and a sharp fall in upstream spending led to lower revenues and pricing headwinds. However, as commodity prices steadily improve and drilling activities pick up, the market for services companies is on the mend.The U.S. oil benchmark wrapped up a strong quarter amid continued declines in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative. With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, the first quarter of the year saw U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014.Consequently, spending on exploration projects have experienced a much-awaited rebound. The energy explorers, buoyed by the jump in commodity prices, are set for improving sales and earnings – a part of which is likely to be pocketed by the oilfield service providers. In particular, the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing -- particularly for pressure pumping.As a proof of the resurgence in activities, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter Completion and Production revenue is pegged at $3,822 million, higher than $3,804 million reported in the previous quarter and way above the first-quarter 2017 sales of $2,604 million. To put things in perspective, the Completion and Production unit makes up around two-thirds of the oilfield service provider’s total revenue and operating income.However, cost inflation triggered by increased fracking sand pricing is likely to drag down the company's bottom line. Rising prices of sand – used to hydraulically fracture new wells – increases the expense associated with the drilling of a new shale well and puts upward pressure on the cost of contractors like Halliburton.As it is, Halliburton had to shell out more to purchase the sand from spot markets to minimize the impact on client completion timelines after extreme weather and rail shut-downs disrupted deliveries.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Halliburton will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -3.42%.Zacks Rank: Halliburton is #3 Ranked. Though a Zacks Rank of 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Halliburton, here are some energy companies you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.33% and a Zacks Rank #3. The firm is expected to release earnings on Apr 26. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.EQT Corporation (EQT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +21.86% and a Zacks Rank #3.

1093,SLB,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report), a GE company, reported an increase in total rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in this Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1008 in the week (ended Apr 13) compared with the prior week’s 1003. Notably, total count increased eight times in the last 10 weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 847.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher offshore and onshore operations. The tally for offshore rigs was recorded at 16 compared with 12. Also, the number of onshore rigs totaled 988, marginally higher than 987.Four rigs operated in the inland waters last week, in line with the figure reported in the week ended Apr 6.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count rose to 815 from 808 for the week ended Apr 6. Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 683. The oil rig count rose eight times in the last 10 weeks.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 192 is lower than 194 for the week ended Apr 6.However, like oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year-ago tally of 162.Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 55 units dropped from 56 units. However, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) rose by six units to 953 units.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 16 units — 15 rigs were oil-directed — higher than the tally of 12 for the week ended Apr 6.ConclusionThe number of total rigs exploring in the United States has increased, courtesy of the addition of two oil rigs in Cana Woodford shale play and three oil rigs in the Eagle Ford.The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is trading above $65 per-barrel-mark, thanks to the intensified middle east tensions. The missile strike in Syria by the United States and allies Britain and France will likely pave the way for America’s strong stance against Iran and Russia. Iran and Russia reportedly backed Syria for conducting the suspected chemical attack on Douma people. Hence, there is considerable room for rally in oil prices which could support the persistent ramp up of drilling activities.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report) and Antero Resources Corporation (AR  -  Free Report). Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 839.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 987, higher than 977.Four rigs operated in the inland waters last week, in line with the week ended Mar 29. The tally for offshore rigs was flat at 12.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count rose to 808 from 797 for the week ended Mar 29. The count of rigs exploring oil in the United States never reached the current mark since March 2015. Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 672. The oil rig count rose eight times in the last ten weeks.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 194 was the same as the count for the week ended Mar 29. With this, the tally increased six times in seven weeks.Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year-ago tally of 165.Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is almost 88% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 56 units declined from 63 units. However, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) rose by 17 units to 947 units.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 12 units — all the rigs were oil-directed — in line with the tally for the week ended Mar 29.ConclusionThe number of total rigs exploring in the United States increased, courtesy of the addition of five onshore rigs in the Oklahoma state and two onshore rigs in Texas.Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the average monthly prices of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude during January and February of 2018 were recorded at $63.70 per barrel and $62.23 per barrel, respectively. Notably, the average monthly WTI crude price has never touched $60 since 2015. Also, throughout March, the commodity traded above the $60-per-barrel mark. Overall, the crude pricing scenario seems healthy which has opened up room for further ramp up of drilling activities.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Continental Resources, Inc.

1096,SLB,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report), a GE company, reported an increase in total rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in this Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 995 in the week (ended Mar 23) — higher than the prior week’s 990. Notably, total count increased seven times in the last nine weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 809.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 979, higher than 973.Three rigs operated in the inland waters last week, down from four for the week ended Mar 16. The tally for offshore rigs was flat at 13.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count rose to 804 from 800 for the week ended Mar 16. Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 652. The oil rig count rose eight times in the last nine weeks.  Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 190 was up from 189 for the week ended Mar 16. With this, the tally increased six times in nine weeks.Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year-ago tally of 155.Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88.2% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 63 units increased from 57 units. However, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) fell by a unit to 932 units.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 13 units — 12 of which were oil-directed — in line with the tally for the week ended Mar 16.ConclusionThe number of total rigs exploring in the United States increased, courtesy of the addition of seven oil rigs in the Permian basin.  West Texas Intermediate crude has crossed the $65-per-barrel mark, thanks to Middle East tensions and the projection of Khalid al-Falih — energy minister of Saudi Arabia — that the production cut accord could get extended till 2019.  Hence, we believe that there is considerable opportunity for U.S. shale players to continue ramping up drilling activities.  Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Continental Resources, Inc.

1097,SLB,"It was a week where oil ended slightly higher but natural gas futures settled down.On the news front, European supermajor Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) decided to end its association in New Zealand by selling its business to Austria's OMV for $578 million, while Norway-based Statoil ASA  announced plans to change its name to Equinor.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged up about 0.5% to close at $62.34 per barrel, natural gas prices decreased 1.6% to $2.688 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Exxon & Chevron's Strategy Updates, Hess' Buyback Plan & More)The U.S. oil benchmark eked out marginal gains in U.S. trading over the week, supported by the International Energy Agency's (IEA) upward revision of its crude demand estimates. The energy consultative body, in its closely watched monthly oil-market report, said that global demand is likely to grow by 1.5 million barrels a day this year to average 99.3 million barrels a day. This projection is 90,000 barrels a day above last month's estimate.However, the Energy Department's inventory release – revealing a massive weekly build in crude stockpiles on the back of record domestic oil production – together with a rising rig count, kept the commodity’s price gains in check.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved lower last week following a smaller-than-expected decrease in supplies. The 93 billion cubic feet (Bcf) withdrawal was also below the five-year average net shrinkage of 97 Bcf for the reported week. A bearish weather outlook and ample production also played spoilsport.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Royal Dutch Shell plc is set to offload its remaining portfolio of energy assets in New Zealand to Austria-based OMV AG in a $578 million deal, moving ahead with its divestment goals. The move marks the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) European oil giant’s exit from the country after having operated there for more than a century. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Per the deal, Shell will sell its 84% interest in the Maui gas field located off the Taranaki coast. The company will also jettison its 48% stake in the Pohokuru field along with Tank Farms. Additionally, it will divest its 61% interest in the Great South Basin venture located off the coast of Otago and Southland, which also includes a drilling commitment of around $50 million.OMV AG already holds 10% and 26% stakes in Maui and Pohokuru, respectively. After completion of the deal, the employees of Shell in its New Zealand’s business will be transferred to OMV AG. Subject to satisfactory closing conditions and regulatory approvals, the deal is set for closure by the fourth quarter of 2018.Shell had announced a strategic review of its operations in New Zealand in 2015. In fact, last April, the supermajor had entered into a deal with Todd Energy to vend 50% interest in the onshore Kapuni oil and gas field in the Taranaki region of New Zealand.The Anglo-Dutch energy giant had been contemplating selling the remaining stakes in the country since then, in order to further streamline its portfolio. (Read more: Shell to Sell New Zealand Holdings to OMV AG in a $578M Deal)2.    Statoil ASA wants to rebrand itself as Equinor. The board of directors of the Norwegian energy major wants to take out the ""oil"" from the name, expecting the move to reflect the company's growing interest and reach beyond petroleum.The first part of the name, ""Equi"", stands for equal, equality and equilibrium, while ""nor"" indicates its Norwegian origin. As the company is trying to be at the front of the energy transition movement from oil and gas to greener sources, it wants to plough in 15-20% of its total spending in renewable energy by 2030, profoundly improving from 5% in 2017.The company's strategy of developing a competitive portfolio, where low-carbon advantage takes a huge part, underpins the name change. Notably, in 2017, the company’s carbon emission reduction per barrel of oil equivalent increased more than 10% from the previous year. Moreover, in the last six months, the company has invested in offshore wind power and solar energy.Statoil expects the rebranding and focusing more on renewables to not change the company's backbone, the Norwegian continental shelf. The fate of rebranding will be decided on May 15, 2018, when the name will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the company. (Read more Statoil to Remove 'Oil' From Name, Rebrand as Equinor)3.    Eni SpA (E  -  Free Report) has released its strategic plan for 2018-2021, signifying a usual progression of the same executed in the previous years and intends to continue boosting all business value. The company has undergone a successful transformation, resulting in a more integrated set-up, well positioned for further growth in the upstream sector. The mid-downstream businesses have also been reorganized, making them financially sounder and prepared to generate worth even in the low oil price scenarios.The capital expenditure for this four-year plan is estimated at less than €32 billion. It will focus on high-value projects with quick returns. Of the total capex, over 80% will be allocated to the upstream, about €3.5 billion is apportioned for the repair and maintenance (R&M) while the chemicals business is anticipated to have about 10% return rate. Moreover, the amount will provide ample flexibility as more than 50% of the investments will not be committed by 2021.Eni intends to increase the dividend for 2018 to €0.83 per share, up 3.75% from 2017, fully payable in cash. Based on Brent price of $60 per barrel, Eni is assumed to realize an operating cash flow of more than €11 billion in 2018, which might further appreciate above €2 billion in 2021 for the same scenario.

(MDR  -  Free Report) and Baker Hughes, a GE company are set to team up to provide integrated energy services for the supermajor BP’s West African gas project, offshore Senegal and Mauritania.McDermott and Baker Hughes will be required to conduct front-end engineering design (FEED) studies for BP’s Tortue/Ahmeyim gas field development. The initial phase of the project will require McDermott to handle the subsea umbilicals, risers and flowlines aspects. Meanwhile, Baker Hughes will concentrate on defining the scope for the subsea production system. The FEED studies are likely to be completed by this year.Later, the partnership agreement between the McDermott and Baker Hughes will be converted to an engineering, procurement, construction and installation (EPCI) contract wherein both the companies will provide optimized and integrated solutions for BP’s project. The agreement marks the first EPCI contract for both McDermott and Baker Hughes in West Africa for BP. (Read more McDermott Collaborates with Baker Hughes for BP Contract)5.    Brazil's state-run energy giant Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) announced fourth-quarter earnings per ADR of 20 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 18 cents on the back of higher oil prices.Petrobras’ free cash flows through 2017 increased almost 12% to $13,850 million, reflecting that the company has sufficient operating cashflow to support investment. During 2017, exports of oil and oil products rose 23%, while imports fell 18%. This helped the company maintain the position of net exporter with a positive balance of 361 thousand barrels per day.During the year ended Dec 31, 2017, Petrobras’ capital investments and expenditures totaled $13,639 million, lower than $14,085 million incurred in the year-ago period. This allowed the world's most indebted oil company to record the lowest debt over the last six years. At the end of December 2017, the company had net debt of $84,871 million, reflecting a decline from $96,381 million as of Dec 31, 2016.

The worst performer was oilfield service majors Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), whose stock fell 4.8%.Longer-term, over six months, the sector tracker is down 0.9%. Oil giant ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) was the major decliner during this period, experiencing a 7.9% price depreciation.What’s Next in the Energy World?As usual, market participants will be closely tracking the regular releases i.e. the U.S. government statistics on oil and natural gas -- one of the few solid indicators that comes out regularly. Energy traders will also be focusing on the Baker Hughes data on rig count.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider.

1098,SLB,"Friday, January 19, 2018For this column, even though there is a chance the U.S. government may shut down today, we will not wade into those waters at this time. Instead, we will let D.C. be D.C. After all, even if the government does shut down, it doesn’t take away the positive results we’ve seen overall so far in Q4 earnings season.Yesterday after the bell we saw good Q4 headlines from companies of diverse industries, from Big Tech play IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) to Transportation’s Canadian Pacific (CP  -  Free Report). Although the devil is in the details for IBM in the quarter just passed, we still see beats on the top and bottom lines and growth year over year.Another transportation firm, Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), has this morning topped the Zacks consensus earnings estimate by 2 cents to $1.38 per share. The railway major narrowly missed the analyst consensus on quarterly revenues, however, to $660.4 million. Operation income was up in the quarter, though operating ratio was slightly down year over year. For more on KSU’s earnings, click here.Oil services giant Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report) beat estimates on its top and bottom line ahead of today’s opening bell: 48 cents per share on $8.18 billion in revenues outpaced the 44 cents per share and $8.12 billion expected, respectively. Year over year, Production was up a whopping 146%, with Drilling up 36% from the year-ago quarter.

The good news here is these banks have performed at least as well as the much larger financial institutions.Birmingham, AL-based Regions Financial (RF  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, posted a one-cent beat to 27 cents per share, even counting a one-time tax write-off amounting to 7 cents per share. Revenues of $318 million easily surpassed the $278 million we had anticipated. For more on RF’s earnings, click here.Providence, RI-based Citizens Financial (CFG  -  Free Report) topped bottom-line estimates by 4 cents to 71 cents per share, on $1.48 billion in revenues which also beat the Zacks consensus and rose 6.3% year over year. This marks at least the fifth straight earnings beat for the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company, with the trailing 4 quarters posting an average positive surprise of 9.1%. For more on CFG’s earnings, click here.Finally, Atlanta, GA-based SunTrust Banks (STI  -  Free Report), another Zacks Rank #2-rated bank, put up $1.09 per share — 4 cents better than the $1.04 expected and +21% year over year — on an in-line $2.31 billion in quarterly revenues. For the full year, SunTrust reports $4.09 per share for a 3-cent beat and +14% growth from the year-ago quarter.

1099,SLB,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported an increase in total rig counts in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count dents demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 931 in the week ended Dec 8 — higher than the prior week’s 929. This marked an increase for five consecutive weeks after the tally fell for five weeks in a row.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 624.   For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore operations. The count of rigs engaged in onshore works rose from 908 to 909. The tally for offshore activities remained in line with the count for the week ended Dec 1.Two rigs operated in the inland waters last week, higher than one rig for the week ended Dec 1.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 751 was higher than 749 in the prior week. Also, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 498.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count — which plunged to its lowest level last August — of 180, was in line with the count for the week ended Dec 1. Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 125.     As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is almost 89% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.        Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 64 units fell from 66. However, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by four units to 867.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count stands at 20 units — 16 of which were oil-directed — in line with the count for the week ended Dec 1.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil in the United States has increased, while the count of rigs searching for natural gas remained the same. Naturally, the total oil and gas rig count has increased, primarily supported by the addition of three rigs in each of Permian basin, Marcellus, Eagle Ford and Haynesville shale plays.A healthy crude price scenario owing to the consistent compliance of the OPEC members with the historical production curb deal have been encouraging U.S drillers to ramp up upstream operations in prospective shale plays.  Two oil stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NOG  -  Free Report) and Approach Resources, Inc. (AREX  -  Free Report). Northern Oil and Gas sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Approach Resources carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Based in Minnetonka, MN, Northern Oil and Gas is primarily engaged in exploration and development activities. We expect the company to see year-over-year revenue growth of 47.3% in 2017.Headquartered in Fort Worth, TX, Approach Resources explores oil and gas resources in the domestic shale plays. The company will likely witness year-over-year earnings growth of 65.4% in 2017.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7% and +90.2%, respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1101,SLB,"Oilfield service providers McDermott International, Inc. (MDR  -  Free Report) and Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) are set to team up to provide integrated energy services for the supermajor BP plc’s (BP  -  Free Report) West African gas project, offshore Senegal and Mauritania.Contract DetailsMcDermott and Baker Hughes will be required to conduct front-end engineering design (FEED) studies for BP’s Tortue/Ahmeyim gas field development. The initial phase of the project will require McDermott to handle the subsea umbilicals, risers and flowlines aspects. Meanwhile, Baker Hughes will concentrate on defining the scope for the subsea production system. The FEED studies are likely to be completed by this year.Later, the partnership agreement between the McDermott and Baker Hughes will be converted to an engineering, procurement, construction and installation (EPCI) contract wherein both the companies will provide optimized and integrated solutions for BP’s project. The agreement marks the first EPCI contract for both McDermott and Baker Hughes in West Africa for BP.The integrated solutions are likely to provide a sound technical solution for BP’s project with higher efficiency and productivity within budget. McDermott values the contract between $500 and $750 million. This is the second deal the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has secured from BP this month after landing a contract for the Cassia C Compression Platform from BP Trinidad & Tobago, LLC. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Sector Consolidation Picks UpThe partnership between McDermott and Baker Hughes will position them better to compete with other biggies like Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) and TechnipFMC. A wave of consolidation has hit the industry in the last couple of years amid the oil slump, in order to take advantages of integrated offerings, increased scale, synergies and new capabilities.Notably, Technip and FMC Technologies completed their merger early last year that has resulted in substantial savings for the combined entity, while offering unique integrated offshore project solutions. Importantly, Schlumberger, which closed its merger with Cameron International Corp. for $14.3 billion in 2016, is set for a joint venture (JV) with Subsea 7 S.A. to provide clients with better subsea installations and oilfield services.As such, Baker Hughes and General Electric also closed their merger last year to create one of the world's largest oilfield service providers in terms of revenues. Further, McDermott’s merger with its onshore peers, Chicago Bridge and Iron is set to close by the second quarter this year.The service providers believe that mergers and acquisitions will help them cut their average costs, and benefit from mutual technical expertise exchange.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

(DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).      DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 984 in the week (ended Mar 9) — higher than the prior week’s 981. Notably, the total count increased for five in the prior seven weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 768.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 967, higher than 963. Four rigs operated in the inland waters last week, in line with the count for the week ended Mar 2.  However, the tally for offshore was 13, down from 14 in the prior week.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 796 was down from 800 for the week ended Mar 2. However, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 617.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 188 was up from 181 for the week ended Mar 2. With this, the tally increased four times in the last five weeks.Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 151.  Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88.3% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 61 units increased from 59 units. Moreover, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by 1 unit to 923 units.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 13 units — 12 of which were oil-directed — compared with 14 units for the week ended Mar 2.ConclusionThe number of total rigs exploring in the United States increased, courtesy of the addition of seven onshore rigs in Texas. Three onshore rigs were also added in North Dakota.Although rigs exploring crude fell last week but the favorable oil pricing scenario could ramp up crude drilling activities in the coming weeks. Oil has been trading mostly over the $60-per-barrel mark since January, after the OPEC members agreed to extend the production curb deal beyond first-quarter 2018.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Continental Resources, Inc.

1103,SLB,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) reported an increase in total rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in this Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count hampers demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).   DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 981 in the week (ended Mar 2) — higher than the prior week’s 978. Notably, the total count increased for four in the prior six weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated with a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 756.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs were 963, higher than 959. Four rigs operated in the inland waters last week, up from the count of two for the week ended Feb 23.  However, the tally for offshore was 14, down from 17 in the prior week.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 800 was up from 799 for the week ended Feb 23. Further, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 609. It should be noted that since 2015, the count of rigs exploring for oil touched 800 for the first time.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 181 was up from 179 for the week ended Feb 23. With this, the tally increased thrice in the last four weeks.Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 146.  Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 89%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 59 units decreased from 67 units. Moreover, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by 11 units to 922 units.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 14 units — 13 of which were oil-directed — compared with 17 units for the week ended Feb 23.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil and natural gas in the United States increased, courtesy of the addition of two gas rigs in the Marcellus shale play.Crude pricing scenario has been healthy after the OPEC members agreed to extend the production curb deal beyond first-quarter 2018. Given that oil has been trading mostly over the $60-per-barrel mark since January, we believe that there is considerable opportunity for U.S. shale players to continue ramping up drilling activities.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Continental Resources, Inc.

1104,SLB,"Major oilfield service provider Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings on Monday, Oct 23, before market opens.In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 21.1%. Moreover, both Halliburton’s segments – Completion and Production, as well as, Drilling and Evaluation – reported revenues slightly better than our estimates thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America.On a further encouraging note, the world's second-largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) has an incredible history when it comes to beating earnings estimates. Investors should note that Halliburton hasn’t missed earnings estimates since mid-2014, as you can see in the chart below:Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise  Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company QuoteImportantly, this Houston, TX-based provider of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells is likely to maintain this trend in the third quarter. Evidently, multiple tailwinds including the recovery in commodity prices have buoyed the entire space.With U.S. activity accelerating and margins set to remain strong, Halliburton’s underlying results are likely to come ahead of our expectations. The positive sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the estimate revision trend has been solid with eight upward estimate revisions and just one down in the last two months.Consequently, the stock has done better than the peer group so far this year; it is down 17.5% in 2017 as against 30.2% loss for the Zacks Oil and Gas Field Services industry. Let’s delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact Halliburton’s third-quarter results.A Likely Positive Surprise?With U.S. rig count falling to record levels last year, oilfield services players (like Halliburton) were hit hard. Unprecedented declines in activity levels and a sharp fall in upstream spending led to lower revenues and pricing headwinds.However, as commodity prices steadily improve and drilling activities pick up, the market for services companies is on the mend. Though we are still not anywhere near the activity highs seen in 2014, spending on exploration projects have experienced a much-awaited rebound. The energy explorers, buoyed by the jump in commodity prices, are set for improving sales and earnings – a part of which is likely to be pocketed by the long-struggling oilfield service providers.In fact, during last quarter’s earnings release, the company also sounded optimistic in its view that the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing - particularly for pressure pimping.As a proof of the resurgence in activities, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter Completion and Production revenue is pegged at $3,430 million, much higher than $3,132 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. Sales in the Drilling and Evaluation unit is forecasted to be $1,888 million, more than the prior quarter figure of $1,825.We also appreciate Halliburton’s successful cost-management initiatives in the midst of weak oil prices over a length of time. Last year, the company successfully implemented on its plan of pruning annual costs by $1 billion. In fact, Halliburton has used the challenges prevailing in the industry to its advantage, mainly by offering low cost solutions that aids producers in churning out more by investing less.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model too shows that Halliburton is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for this company stands at +0.08%. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Halliburton carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) which, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us confident of an earnings beat.Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. On the other hand, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Which Other Energy Companies Have Positive Surprise in Store?Halliburton is not the only energy firms looking up this earnings season. Here are some companies from the space which, according to our model, also have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +10.91% and a Zacks Rank #2. The energy equipment maker is expected to release earnings results on Oct 26. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Suncor Energy Inc. (SU  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +29.60% and a Zacks Rank #2. The Canadian integrated energy company is anticipated to release earnings on Oct 25.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1105,SLB,"Oilfield service behemoth Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 earnings on Oct 20, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 16.67%, courtesy of a rebound in drilling activities in Russia and the North Sea. Moreover, Schlumberger delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 7.58% over the last four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.   Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of analyst opinion on the stock before the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents for the third quarter has been stable in the last 60 days with three firms being bearish sentiments and seven firms being bullish. The estimate reflects a year-over-year improvement of about 67.1%.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $7,910 million for the third quarter, up 12.7% from the year-ago quarter.Factors to ConsiderSchlumberger is the largest oilfield services player in the world with access to every energy market. In all its operating business segments, the company maintains its position as one of the key players.For the Drilling Group segment, The Zacks Consensus Estimate for pretax operating profit is $314 million, significantly higher than $218 million reported in the third quarter of last year.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Production Group business unit is pegged at $345 million, way higher than $98 million last year.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for pretax operating income at the Reservoir Characterization segment is $294 million, lower than $322 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Overall, higher crude price during the third quarter is expected to support oilfield players, involved in the setting up of oil wells.As per macrotrends, The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude saw a 12.2% gain in the third quarter of 2017 after two consecutive quarters of decline this year. Notably, this is the highest quarterly gain since the April-to-June quarter of 2016.  Also, according to The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the average monthly price for the three months of third-quarter 2017 was higher than the year-ago period.Nevertheless, we are concerned about the decline in cash balance over the last six quarters. Also, long-term debt has been on the rise in the same time frame, reflecting a weak balance sheet.  Price Performance in Q3During the quarter, Schlumberger rallied 5.9%, outperforming the industry’s 3.8% gain.  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Schlumberger is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is -0.98% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 41 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is 42 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Schlumberger carries a Zacks Rank #3. We caution investors against the stock going into the earnings announcement, as a Zacks Earnings ESP of -0.98% combined with a Zacks Rank #3, lowers the possibility of an earnings surprise. Stocks to ConsiderAlthough earnings beat looks uncertain for Schlumberger, here are some firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Northern Oil and Gas, Inc (NOG  -  Free Report), headquartered in Wayzata, MN, is an exploration and production company. The company has an Earnings ESP of +33.33% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Tesoro Corporation (ANDV  -  Free Report), based in San Antonio, TX, is involved in the refining and marketing of petroleum products. The company has an Earnings ESP of +10.44% and a Zacks Rank #1.Gulfport Energy Corporation (GPOR  -  Free Report) owns and operates mature oil and gas properties in the Louisiana Gulf Coast area. The company has an Earnings ESP of +6.08% and a Zacks Rank #1.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside? Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1106,SLB,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes reported a decrease in oil and gas rig counts in the United States.    DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 928 in the week ended Oct 13 – lower than the prior week’s 936. This marked a decline in rig count for seven times in the last 10 weeks.   Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 539.For the week in discussion, the fall in rig count can be attributed to lower onshore and offshore operations. The count of rigs engaged in offshore works slipped from 22 to 20, while the tally for onshore activities fell to 907 from 913.However, the tally for inland waters remained the same at one.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count fell by five to 743. It is to be noted that the rigs exploring crude decreased for five times in the last six weeks. But, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 432.  Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – declined by two units to 185. However, like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 105. As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 88.5%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.  Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs decreased by two units to 63, while the horizontal rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) fell by six units to 786.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count stands at 20 units – 17 of which were oil-directed – lower than the prior count of 22.Details of the Weekly Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, acts as a yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count weighs heavily on demand for energy services, drilling, completion, production, etc., provided by companies like Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil and natural gas in the United States has decreased, thanks to the removal of six rigs from the Eagle Ford shale play. Moreover, the Barnett shale saw the removal of four rigs.Declining rig count, helping reducing crude glut, helped oil price to settle above the $50-per-barrel mark again.  Development in this front is likely to prove beneficial for oil and gas exploration and production companies. Two oil stocks that might make valuable additions to your portfolio now are Abraxas Petroleum (AXAS) and Cimarex Energy (XEC). Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Headquartered in San Antonio, TX, Abraxas Petroleum explores oil and gas resources in the United States. The company is expected to witness 317.9% year-over-year earnings growth in 2017.  Cimarex Energy – headquartered in Denver, CO – is primarily involved in exploration and development of oil resources in Oklahoma. We expect year-over-year earnings growth of 498.8% for Cimarex Energy in 2017.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>

1107,SLB,"U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to decide on the fate of the landmark Iran nuclear deal by the close of business this week.As per various reports, the American administration might 'decertify' the 2015 accord – forged by then-President Barack Obama – declaring that the Persian Gulf country is in breach of the spirit of the agreement, which no longer serves U.S. national security interests. A declaration of that sort would then give Congress 60 days to decide on re imposing sanctions on OPEC’s third-largest oil producer.The Iran Nuclear DealOn Nov 24, 2015, Iran reached a temporary accord with six world powers – the U.S., Great Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany – to restrict its nuclear activities in return for the Persian nation’s relief from international sanctions on oil, auto parts, gold and precious metals. Ultimately, the embargo was lifted in January 2016 after certification from the UN nuclear watchdog.What Trump Wants Out of Tehran?For long, Trump has been expressing his opposition to the Obama-era agreement (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA), terming it as 'catastrophic' with bad terms for the U.S. His government now wants to delegitimize the pact in its entirety by asking for additional concessions from Iran on some key portions of the deal. The U.S. President is also trying to curb Tehran's ballistic missile program, cyberattacks and support for terrorist groups - issues mostly outside the purview of the JCPOA.Renewed Sanctions Will Amplify Iran’s Struggles to Attract Foreign CapitalThe 2015 deal was seen as a big win for Iran with the infusion of tens of billions of dollars into the Middle Eastern nation’s hobbling economy in return for curtailment of its nuclear program and site inspections. However, the country is still struggling to attract foreign investment, which is way short of the level required for it to achieve its economic ambitions. Things may become even tougher if U.S. President Donald Trump follows through with his rhetoric.The non-renewal of the nuclear deal will likely lead to tougher U.S. restrictions against Iran. In particular, Trump's decision could choke off foreign investment the Islamic Republic needs to restore the health of its ageing oilfields and boost output following years of crippling earlier sanctions.Scrapping of the Iran Deal Will Affect Energy MarketsFollowing the lifting of sanctions in January 2016, Iran’s crude oil production and exports have been on a rise. As per OPEC’s latest monthly report, the country’s daily oil output reached 3.8 million barrels in September, of which around 2.3 million barrels were exported.The current statistics marks a considerable jump from an average of around 2.8 million barrels per day in 2013 when Tehran was under international sanctions for its nuclear program. Exports languished at about 980,000 barrels per day.Therefore, it’s quite obvious that the return of sanctions would put pressure on Iran’s energy industry and affect the oil market in general. An American pullout of the nuclear agreement won’t immediately curb the flow of the Gulf country’s swelling crude exports as the U.S. is not a buyer of Iranian oil. Moreover, it is also quite unlikely that Trump will get Europe or China – Iran’s biggest clients – in reinstating the embargo on Tehran.However, the U.S. might threaten the buyers of Iranian crude or any company with major investments in the country’s upstream sector, with financial penalties. This could force some of the companies, especially those with assets in the U.S., scale back purchases/investments out of fear of being kept out of the world’s largest capital markets.A disruption to Iranian oil exports and investments in the country might cut off some of its supplies to the global market, thereby boosting crude prices.   Which Companies Stand to Lose?With the U.S. still maintaining certain bilateral sanctions, domestic companies can’t enter into physical partnerships with their Iranian counterparts. However, some U.S. firms have been trying to bypass this by approaching the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) – the Treasury Department’s sanctions administrator – for licenses in specific sectors including oil and gas, provided these do not hurt U.S. policy interests.However, there is no such problem for European and Asian companies, who have already started negotiating with local players to expand and fortify their presence in the Iranian market. Biggies from across the pond like Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) and Eni SpA (E  -  Free Report) are among the firms who have been shortlisted for work in the OPEC member’s upstream sector oil and gas projects. Oilfield services behemoth Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) is also in the fray to potentially develop Tehran’s massive energy resources.But it is French energy giant TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) that stands to be the biggest casualty. In July, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company announced that it has signed an agreement with the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) for the development and production of phase 11 of South Pars (SP11) – the world’s largest gas field. This project will have a capacity to produce 2 billion cubic feet of gas per day or 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day including condensate. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. The development contract marked the reentry of TOTAL in this reserve rich Middle-East nation, which it exited in 2006. TOTAL is the first among the global oil & gas major to strike a deal with the Iranian administration and begin work for the development of existing resources of Iran.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1108,SLB,"The Q3 earnings season is underway with major banks set to report this week. Earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to grow 2.3% from the same period last year on 5% higher revenues, as per the latest Earnings Trends.However, earnings growth is on track to be the lowest this year after double-digit growth in each of the first two quarters and with high single-digit expected earnings growth in the last quarter. This is especially true as twin attacks by hurricanes Harvey and Irma have taken toll on many industries such as insurance, energy, airlines and autos. Per Moody's Analytics, the two storms may lead to $150-$200 billion in damages (read: Hurricanes Impact on Earnings ETFs?).While earnings estimates for Q3 have declined from 6.3% at the start of the period, the magnitude of negative revision is lower than the recent quarters. Of the 16 Zacks sectors, seven are likely to be contributors to earnings growth, with energy leading the way. Like the last reporting cycle, the energy sector has the strongest growth projection of 122.3% for Q3, primarily reflecting easier comparisons. This is followed by earnings growth of 16.1% for conglomerates, 9.7% for technology, 8.7% for industrial products, and 8.3% for construction.Given this, we have highlighted one ETF and one stock from some of these sectors that could make great plays as the Q3 earnings season unfolds. Each of these ETFs and stocks have a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). For stocks, we have added the extra flavor of a positive Earnings ESP.

1109,SLB,"Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter results on Jan 17, kicking off the earnings season for the energy space. Now, oil service companies — providers of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells — are slated to release October-to-December numbers in the coming weeks. These reports are likely to provide a better understanding of the energy sector’s performance this earnings season. In particular, key oil services earnings reports scheduled for release this week and the next are that of Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) and Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report).  The world’s largest oilfield services provider Schlumberger is expected to report on Jan 19, while smaller rival Halliburton will post its fourth-quarter numbers on Jan 22.Here, we take a closer look at which of these stocks is better placed, although both carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The AnalysisWe have assessed the stocks on six parameters.Price PerformanceDuring the fourth-quarter 2017, Halliburton clearly outpaced Schlumberger and the industry in terms of price performance. Halliburton rallied 6.2% against the respective 3.4% and 1.9% declines of Schlumberger and the industry.Free Cash Flow YieldsCompanies with strong operations generally have high free cash flow yield, indicating that the amount of money investors are generating is more than the amount spent on the stock.Our proprietary model shows that free cash flow yield for Halliburton stands at 3.7%, slightly higher than 3.5% of Schlumberger.Earnings History and ESP  Halliburton has an incredible history when it comes to beating earnings estimates. The company has consistently surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings since mid-2014. As far as recent history is concerned, the Texas-based firm delivered an earnings beat in each of the trailing four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 41.2%. Meanwhile, Schlumberger has managed to beat earnings in one of the last four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being a modest 4.2%. Considering Earnings ESP as well, Halliburton is likely to beat earnings in this upcoming quarter. This is because the stock has the right combination of two key ingredients — an Earnings ESP of +0.46% and a Zacks Rank #3.The picture is different for Schlumberger as the stock has an Earnings ESP of -1.87%.Earnings Expectations for 2018The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Halliburton’s 2018 earnings currently stands at $2.19 per share, representing year-over-year growth of 89.1%.For Schlumberger, the same is pegged lower at $2.15 per share, reflecting growth of 47.4%.ValuationHalliburton and Schlumberger are overvalued when compared to the Zacks Oil & Gas–Field Services industry. For this, we have employed the EV/EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio, which is often used to value oil and gas stocks, given their significant debt levels and high depreciation and amortization expenses.  With an EV/EBITDA ratio of 18.37, Halliburton is overvalued compared to the industry’s 10.57, though Schlumberger also looks pricey compared to the industry; its EV/EBITDA ratio of 15.98 lends it an advantage over Halliburton.   Dividend Yield & Debt BurdenSchlumberger’s current dividend yield of 2.6% is significantly higher than 1.4% of Halliburton. Also, over the past year, the dividend yield of Schlumberger has been consistently higher than Halliburton.Schlumberger has a lower leverage as evident by its debt-to-capital ratio of 28.4% compared with Halliburton’s 55.6%.Bottom LineHalliburton clearly scores higher in terms of share price movement, earnings surprise history and free cash flow yield. On top of that, the company has a much higher ESP reading of +0.46% as against Schlumberger’s -1.87%.However, Schlumberger holds an advantage when it comes to dividend yield and valuation. The stock also has less exposure to debt.Overall, our comparative analysis shows that Halliburton has an edge over Schlumberger on most of the parameters.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

1111,SLB,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported an increase in total rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count hampers demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 939 in the week ended Jan 12 — higher than the prior week’s 924. This marked an increase after the tally decreased for two straight weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 659.   For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore and offshore operations. The number of onshore rigs were 919, higher than 906. The tally for offshore was 19, up from 17. One rig operated in the inland waters last week, in line with the count for the week ended Jan 5.  Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 752 jumped from 742 recorded for the week ended Jan 5. Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 522.   Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 187 was up from 182 for the week ended Jan 5. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 136.  Per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 89% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 62 units is in line with the tally for the week ended Jan 5. Moreover, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by 15 units to 877.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 19 units — 16 of which were oil-directed — up from 17 for the week ended Jan 5.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil and natural gas in the United States increased. The addition of three oil rigs in the Permian basin primarily supported the upside.Crude pricing scenario has been healthy after the OPEC members agreed to extend the production curb deal beyond first-quarter 2018. Given that oil crossed the $60-per-barrel mark, we believe that there is considerable opportunity for U.S. shale players to ramp up drilling activities.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG) and EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG). Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.    Headquartered in Houston, TX, Cabot is primarily engaged in exploration and development activities. We expect the company to see year-over-year earnings growth of more than 357% in 2017.Headquartered in Houston, TX, EOG Resources is also an upstream energy player. The company is likely to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 155.3% in 2017.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1112,SLB,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company, reported an increase in crude and natural gas rig counts in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count dents demand for energy services like drilling, completion, production, etc., provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).   DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 929 in the week ended Dec 1 — higher than the prior week’s 923. This marked an increase for four consecutive weeks after the tally fell for five weeks in a row.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 597.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore operations. The count of rigs engaged in onshore works rose from 900 to 908. However, the tally for offshore activities fell to 20 from 22.One rig operated in the inland waters last week. The count remains the same this week.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 749 was higher than 747 in the prior week. Also, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 477.     Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count — which plunged to its lowest levels last August — increased by four units to 180. Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 119.    As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is almost 89% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.      Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 66 units remained in line with the earlier week, while the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by six units to 863.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count stands at 20 units — 16 of which were oil-directed — lower than the prior count of 22.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil in the United States has increased. The count of rigs searching for natural gas also surged. Naturally, the total oil and gas rig count has increased, primarily supported by the addition of four rigs in the Permian basin and three rigs in the Haynesville play.A rise in total rig count, both from the year-ago and prior week figures, were primarily supported by rising oil and natural prices. Recently, crude and gas traded at $58.36 per barrel and $3.06 per million Btu, respectively, higher than last year’s average marks of $43.29 and $2.52 – per The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Investors should know, anticipation by majority of the analysts that the production cut deal between OPEC and non-OPEC crude producers will be extended for another nine months next year, supported the rally in crude price.Recovering commodity prices are likely to prove beneficial for oil and gas exploration and production companies. Two oil stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Denbury Resources Inc. (DNR  -  Free Report) and Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NOG  -  Free Report). Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.   Headquartered in Plano, TX, Denbury explores oil and gas resources in the Gulf Coast areas. The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 125% for the last four quarters.Based in Minnetonka, MN, Northern Oil and Gas is primarily engaged in exploration and development activities.

1113,SLB,"Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Jan 19, before the opening bell.  Last quarter, the company’s earnings of 42 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 4.17% for the last four quarters.  Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Which Way Are Estimates Headed?Let’s look at the estimate revision trend to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents for the fourth quarter has been stable in the last seven days. It reflects growth of about almost 63% from the year-ago quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $8,116 million for the quarter, up 14.2% from the prior-year quarter.Factors to ConsiderThe West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude increased almost 20% in the October-to-December quarter of 2017, per The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Through most of November and the entire December, the commodity traded above the $55-per-barrel psychological mark. The extension of the production cut deal by OPEC players supported the rally in crude. On Nov 30, 2017, OPEC members met non-OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord, first signed in late 2016, beyond the first quarter of 2018. More than 20 oil producers, including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia, participated in the meeting. As expected by most analysts, all crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018-end. Saudi Arabia, Russia, and their allies have pledged to put 1.8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of the market through the end of this year.Improvement in crude price will likely be favorable for Schlumberger as oilfield service businesses are positively correlated with crude price. This is reflected in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for each of the company’s business segments.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Reservoir Characterization segment’s earnings-before-tax stands at $318 million, higher than $316 million recorded in the year-earlier quarter.Moreover, for the Drilling unit, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at $307 million, up from $234 million in the prior-year quarter.The balance sheet looks solid as Schlumberger’s total current assets of $19.9 billion — as of Sep 30, 2017 — is higher than $13 billion of current liabilities. The long-term debt level is slightly discouraging as $15.9 billion is higher than $10.6 billion as of Dec 31, 2014.  Q4 Price PerformanceIn the fourth quarter, shares of Schlumberger underperformed the industry. The stock lost 3.4% compared with the industry’s decline of 1.8%.  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Schlumberger is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -3.01%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 43 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 44 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Schlumberger carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s negative Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. Meanwhile, we caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell Rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.  Stocks to ConsiderThough an earnings beat looks uncertain for Schlumberger, here are a few firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model. These have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Headquartered in Irving, TX, Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) primarily explores oil and gas and hence is an upstream energy player. The company has an Earnings ESP of +2.45% and sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Headquartered in Houston, TX, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) is also an upstream energy player. The company has an Earnings ESP of +2.81% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.Headquartered in Houston, TX, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report)  is a leading integrated energy firm. The company has an Earnings ESP of +8.28% and a Zacks Rank #1.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1114,SLB,"The strong momentum seen in 2017 continues this year with stock markets across the globe  witnessing an upside. MSCI World Index has  risen  in eight of the nine trading sessions so far this year. This is primarily thanks to an uptick in global economic growth, low inflation, tightening monetary stance by major central banks, and increasing oil price.On the Wall Street, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq registered eight record closings  in the first nine trading days of 2018, while the Dow boasted its sixth closing high of the year. Per CNBC, the S&P 500 is enjoying its best 10-day start to a year since 2003, climbing 4.2% buoyed by stronger-than-expected corporate earnings and a slew of upbeat economic data (read: Top-Ranked ETFs Crushing the S&P 500 to Start 2018).Meanwhile, yields are on the rise with two-year U.S. Treasury yields topping 2% for the first time since the financial crisis while the U.S. dollar slumped to a more than three-year low against the euro on speculation that the European Central Bank is preparing to reduce its stimulus. A weak dollar is providing ample strength to the commodities market, which saw a powerful start to the year.  Given this, we have highlighted some ETFs that are off to a good start in 2018 and some that have had a rough start:Best ETFsGlobal X MSCI Nigeria ETF (NGE  -  Free Report)Nigerian stocks are leading the global market rally  in the first two weeks of  the New Year buoyed by a jump in oil prices and the continued strength in the economy, which pulled the country out of recession in the second quarter. Additionally, impressive valuations are making stocks tempting to investors. Nigerian stocks are the cheapest among the major African equity indexes trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 10.2 compared to 14 for the South African index and 13 for the MSCI Emerging Market Index (read: 10 Hottest ETF Themes for 2018).As such, NGE, which offers exposure to the largest and most liquid Nigerian securities, soared 15.9% in the first two weeks of 2018. Holding 23 stocks in its basket, the fund has heavy concentration on the top two firms, which collectively make up for 25.4% share. It has accumulated $86.4 million in its asset base and has 1.10% in expense ratio. Average daily volume is lower at 23,000 shares. However, NGE has a Zacks ETF Rank #5 (Strong Sell) with a High risk outlook.iPath Pure Beta Cotton ETN Cotton continues its stellar run this year after witnessing its best rally since 1998 in 2017. Soaring exports are eating away some of the 2017-18 crop harvest for the commodity, thereby resulting in a spike in cotton prices. The data from the US Department of Agriculture recorded a bumper start to 2018 for cotton export sales as the first week turned out to be its strongest week for shipments since July.This ETN targets the cotton segment of the broad agricultural commodity market by tracking the Barclays Cotton Pure Beta Total Return Index. Unlike many commodity indices, this index offers roll into one of a number of futures contracts with varying expiration dates, as selected, using the Barclays Pure Beta Series 2 Methodology. The product has managed assets of $0.7 million and charges 75 bps in fees per year from investors. Average daily volume is paltry at 1,000 shares. The ETN has gained 15.1% in the initial weeks of 2018 but has a Zacks ETF Rank #5 with a High risk outlook.iShares U.S. Oil Equipment & Services ETF (IEZ  -  Free Report)The energy sector has been stealing the show in the U.S. equity world since the start of the New Year, given that oil price is on a fantastic run, thanks to geopolitical uncertainty, tightening supply, and soaring demand. While most of the energy ETFs are seeing huge spike, IEZ has jumped 12.2% so far this year. This fund offers exposure to 35 U.S. companies that provide equipment and services for oil exploration and extraction. Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report) and Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report) are the top two firms accounting for 17.2% and 10.6% of its assets, respectively.The product has accumulated $268 million in AUM and charges 44 bps in annual fees. It trades in moderate volume of 80,000 shares and has a Zacks ETF Rank #4 (Sell) with a High risk outlook (read: Energy ETFs & Stocks Soaring to Start 2018).Worst ETFsiPath US Treasury Steepener ETN (STPP  -  Free Report)The continuation of the stunning flattening yield curve as measured by the spread between the 10-year and 2-year Treasury yields has been piling up heavy losses for this ETN. This is because the note directly capitalizes on rising interest rates and performs better when the yield curve is rising. The ETN looks to follow the Barclays US Treasury 2Y/10Y Yield Curve Index, which delivers returns from the steepening of the yield curve through a notional rolling investment in the U.S. Treasury note futures contracts.The fund takes a notional weighted long position in 2-year Treasury futures contracts and a weighted short position in 10-year Treasury futures contracts. STPP charges 0.75% in fees and expenses while volume is light at around 3,000 shares. It has AUM of $4.1 million and has shed 11.1% so far this year (read: Yield Curve Flattens: Profit From This ETF).  Rex Volmaxx Long Vix Weekly Futures Strategy ETF (VMAX  -  Free Report)Given the strong complacency in the stock market, volatility has taken a back seat. In particular, VMAX has tumbled 8.7%. It seeks to benefit from a negative correlation between the VIX Index and equity market. The ETF provides long exposure to the VIX Index by holding a combination of VIX futures contracts that are near expiration. It has amassed $2.1 million in AUM and charges 2.90% in fees per year. It sees a meager volume of about 7,000 shares a day (read: Top & Flop Zones of 2017 and Their ETFs).iShares Residential Real Estate ETF (REZ  -  Free Report)Real estate is one of the worst performing sectors to start the year as stronger economic growth and signs of higher inflation have renewed expectation for rising interest rates resulting in sector rotation to more growth-oriented  areas. With AUM of $349.6 million, this ETF provides exposure to the U.S. residential real estate sector, holding 44 stocks in its basket with none accounting more than 9.81% share. It trades in average daily volume of 33,000 shares while charging 48 bps in annual fees. The fund has lost 6.8% in the same time frame and has a Zacks ETF Rank #4 with a Medium risk outlook.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1115,SLB,"It was a week where the price of oil rallied to a three-year high. However, natural gas futures were down sharply.On the news front, energy explorer Hess Corporation (HES  -  Free Report) announced a major oil discovery offshore Guyana, while Brazil’s Petrobras (PBR  -  Free Report) agreed to shell out $2.95 billion to resolve a U.S. shareholder lawsuit over a graft scandal.Overall, the sector started 2018 on a mixed note. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 1.7% to close at $61.41 per barrel, natural gas prices fell 5.4% to $2.795 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Crude's Bullish Year End, SandRidge's Deal Cancellation & More)Building on its second annual gain in a row, oil prices saw a solid start to the New Year. The first week of 2018 saw U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest closing since December 2014. The major catalyst was the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded another higher-than-expected weekly draw.On a further bullish note, political turmoil in Iran has raised the specter of production disruption in OPEC’s third-biggest producer. Data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs falling for a second straight week helped cement those gains.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 31 of the last 39 weeks and are down almost 109 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 424.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 11.4% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2014.Meanwhile, natural gas – one of 2017’s worst-performing commodities – registered another drop following a below-average decrease in supplies. Forecasts of an end to the harsh cold snap and the resultant dip in heating demand added to the bearish sentiment, bringing prices down sharply.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Hess announced that the sixth oil discovery — Ranger-1 exploration well — since 2015 in the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, was a success.The five world class discoveries in the block — Liza, Payara, Snoek, Liza Deep and Turbot —are projected to have total recoverable resources of over 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Further, resources related with the Ranger-1 discovery will raise this estimate.The drilling of the Ranger-1 well was started by partner ExxonMobil Corporation’s associate Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Ltd. on Nov 5, 2017. It hit about 230 feet (70 meters) of high-quality, oil-bearing carbonate reservoir. The well was drilled to a total depth of 21,161 feet (6,450 meters) in water depth of 8,973 feet (2,735 meters). ExxonMobil, the operator of Stabroek Block, holds 45%, while Hess and CNOOC Nexen Petroleum Guyana Limited hold 30% and 25%, respectively.The discovery further validates the significant potential of Guyana. This is likely to attract other oil giants to boost financial returns and create significant value for shareholders.

The payout marks the biggest such payment in the United States by a foreign entity and one of the largest securities class action settlements in the U.S. history. The settlement seeks to put to rest one of Brazil's most notorious cases of fraud.The Brazilian oil giant was at the heart of the massive corruption scandal -- dubbed ""Operation Carwash"" -- which incriminated other industries like banks, construction firms and shipyards along with high-level politicians. Various lawsuits were filed against Petrobras by shareholders to recoup losses triggered by money laundering and bribery schemes.Many senior executives of the company were accused of taking bribes for inflated contract schemes. Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was also charged with corruption and sentenced to an imprisonment term of nearly 10 years. Charges were also pressed against the current President Michael Temer in May 2017, shaking the nation, following which the Brazilian Real fell hard against the dollar -- its worst since the global financial crisis in 2008.Petrobras' involvement in the multibillion dollar corruption case was a major overhang for the company which scarred its credit metrics and turned it into the world's most indebted oil company. The settlement deal comes days after Brazil's securities regulator indicted eight more executives of Petrobras including the former CEOs, Maria das Gracas Foster and Jose Sergio Gabrielli.

Financial details of the transaction have been kept under wraps. Subject to satisfactory closing conditions and regulatory approvals, the deal is set for closure by March this year.Per the deal, Andeavor will acquire Rangeland II’s assets in Midland and Delaware Basins, which include storage tanks and frac sand terminal along with 110-mile Rio Pipeline with throughput capacity of 145,000 barrels per day.Post the acquisition, Andeavor intends to integrate the crude oil infrastructure with its Conan Crude Oil Gathering System, which is currently under construction. The $225 million Conan pipeline is around 130 miles long with a capacity to transport around 250,000 barrels of oil a day.The integration of two pipeline systems will provide producers access to multiple markets and also support Andeavor's development of additional gathering systems in the area. It will also boost the commercial opportunities by providing direct access to the Midland Basin. Eventually, Andeavor intends to drop down the pipeline assets to its midstream spin-off Andeavor Logistics, LP.

The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company had signed the divestment deal with Dansk Olieselskab AS in September 2016, which included the sale of Shell's Fredericia refinery and local trading and supply activities. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The deal was set for closure by the end of 2017, subject to satisfactory conditions. However, the deal was called off as Shell and Dansk Olieselskab could not reach a consensus regarding matters of sales within the stipulated time. As of now, Shell is not looking for other prospective buyers and intends to retain its refinery operations in Denmark.The divestment was part of the company's move to lower its debt arising from the $50 billion mega acquisition of BG Group. It was part of its portfolio optimization strategy and the $30-billion global divestment program set for the 2016-2018 period. The move was also in line with the company's aim to upgrade and streamline its portfolio.However, with Shell already closing more than $23 billion divestment deals, it remains on track to meet its target by 2018. Further, the company announced asset disposals worth around $2 billion and additional $5 billion divestment deals are already in advanced stages of talks for prospective transactions.

(COG  -  Free Report) recently approved a 20% hike in its regular quarterly dividend. The company will now reward shareholders with a dividend of 6 cents per share compared with the previous payout of 5 cents. This translates to a dividend of 24 cents per share on an annualized basis.The increased dividend will be paid to shareholders of record on Feb 7, 2018, as of Jan 24, 2018. The company's dividend hike for the second consecutive year reflects its commitment to create value for its shareholders and underlines its confidence in generating cash. We will like to remind investors that the company’s second-quarter 2017 dividend reflected a 150% quarterly increase.Given a solid capital and liquidity position, the company is expected to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities.Cabot has recently shifted its focus on strengthening its balance sheet. On Dec 20, 2017, the company announced its decision to divest Eagle Ford Shale holdings to a unit of Venado Oil & Gas LLC for $765 million. This will help the company to concentrate on high quality Marcellus Shale assets and achieve better returns.

1116,SLB,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported a decline in total rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count hampers demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report). DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 924 in the week ended Jan 5 — lower than the prior week’s 929. With this, the count fell for two weeks in a row.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 665.For the week in discussion, the fall in rig count can be attributed to decreased onshore, offshore and inland operations. The number of onshore rigs were 906, lower than 909. The tally for offshore was 17, down from 18. One rig operated in the inland waters last week against the count of two for the week ended Dec 29. Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 742 fell from 747 recorded for the week ended Dec 29. However, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 529.  Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 182 was in line with the week ended Dec 29. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 135. Per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is almost 89% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 62 units decreased from 65. Moreover, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) declined by two units to 862.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 17 units — 14 of which were oil-directed — down from 18 for the week ended Dec 29.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring natural gas in the United States remained in line, while the count of rigs looking for oil decreased. Naturally, the total oil and gas rig count fell, primarily due to the removal of five onshore and one offshore rig in Louisiana. Two rigs were also removed from Oklahoma.The crude pricing scenario has been healthy after the OPEC members agreed to extend the production curb deal beyond first-quarter 2018. The fall in U.S drilling rigs also supported the crude rally.Given that oil crossed the $60-per-barrel mark, we believe that the business scenario has been favorable for exploration and production players.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) and Approach Resources Inc. (AREX  -  Free Report). Cabot sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Approach Resources carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.  Headquartered in Houston, TX, Cabot is primarily engaged in exploration and development activities. We expect the company to see year-over-year earnings growth of more than 357% in 2017.Headquartered in Fort Worth, TX, Approach Resources explores oil and gas resources in the domestic shale plays. The company is likely to witness year-over-year earnings growth of nearly 67% in 2017.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

1117,SLB,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported an increase in crude rig count in the United States. The number of rigs exploring natural gas, however, declined from the prior week.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count heavily dents demand for energy services like drilling, completion, production, etc., provided by companies like Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 923 in the week ended Nov 22 — higher than the prior week’s 915. This marked an increase for three consecutive weeks after the tally fell for five weeks in a row.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 593.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore and offshore operations. The count of rigs engaged in offshore works rose from 21 to 22, while the tally for onshore activities jumped to 900 from 893.One rig operated in the inland waters last week. The count remains the same this week.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 747 was higher than 738 in the prior week. Also, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 474.   Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count — which plunged to its lowest last August — fell by one unit to 176. However, like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 118.  As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 89% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs increased by three units to 66, while the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by five units to 857.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count stands at 22 units — 18 of which were oil-directed — higher than the prior count of 21.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil in the United States has increased, while the same for natural gas decreased. Overall total oil and gas rig count has increased, primarily supported by the addition of two rigs in the Permian basin. DJ-Niobrara basin witnessed a rig addition for upstream operations.   A rise in total rig count, both from the year-ago and prior week figures, were primarily supported by rising oil and natural prices. Recently, crude and gas traded at $58.11 per barrel and $2.93 per million Btu respectively, higher than last year’s average marks of $43.29 and $2.52 – per The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Investors should know that lower U.S. oil inventory, owing to ramp up in export and more demand from refinery plants, supported the crude price.Recovering commodity prices are likely to prove beneficial for oil and gas exploration and production companies. Two oil stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Denbury Resources Inc. (DNR  -  Free Report) and Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NOG  -  Free Report). Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.   Headquartered in Plano, TX, Denbury explores oil and gas resources in the Gulf Coast areas. The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 125% for the last four quarters.Based in Minnetonka, MN, Northern Oil and Gas is primarily engaged in exploration and development activities. We expect the company to see year-over-year revenue growth of 47.3% in 2017.  Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1118,SLB,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE), reported a fall in oil and natural gas rig count in the United States.DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 936 in the week ended Oct 6 – lower than the prior week’s 940. This marked a decline in rig count for seven times in the last 10 weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 524.For the week in discussion, the decline in rig count can be attributed to decreased onshore and inland waters operations. The count of rigs engaged in offshore works was reported at 22, in line with the earlier week count.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count slipped by two to 748. It is to be noted that the rigs exploring crude fell four times in the last five weeks. However, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 428.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – declined by two units to 187. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 94. As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 88.4%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.     Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs increased by one unit to 65, but the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) decreased by five units to 871.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count stands at 22 units – 18 of which were oil-directed – same as the prior count.Details of the Weekly Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, acts as a yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count weighs heavily on demand for energy services, drilling, completion, production, etc., provided by companies like Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil and natural gas in the United States has declined, primarily due to the removal of two rigs in each of Marcellus shale play, Permian basin and Cana Woodford shale formation. This signifies that shale drillers are not rushing to the U.S oil resources in the wake of weak commodity prices.           Oil is again trading below the $50-per-barrel mark on fears of lower oil demand from refiners as Hurricane Nate made landfall along the Gulf coast area.Despite weak crude, some energy explorers look attractive. Two oil stocks that might make valuable additions to your portfolio now are Lonestar Resources US (LONE  -  Free Report) and Diamondback Energy (FANG  -  Free Report).

1119,SLB,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported an increase in oil rig count in the United States. However, the number of rigs searching for natural gas has declined.DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 940 in the week ended Sep 29 – higher than the prior week’s 935. This marked an increase in total rig count after the tally declined six times in the last nine weeks.  Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 522.For the week in discussion, the increase in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore and offshore operations. The count of rigs engaged in offshore works rose from 19 to 22, while the tally for onshore activities jumped to 916 from 913.However, the number of rigs for inland waters fell by one unit to two.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count rose by six to 750. It is to be noted that the rigs exploring crude increased after falling for three weeks in a row. Also, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 425.    Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – declined by one unit to 189. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 96. As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 88.2%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.   Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs decreased by four units to 64, while the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by nine units to 876.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count stands at 22 units – 18 of which were oil-directed – higher than the prior count of 19.Details of the Weekly Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, acts as a yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count weighs heavily on demand for energy services, drilling, completion, production, etc., provided by companies like Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring natural gas in the United States has decreased, however, the count for oil has increased. Overall total oil and gas rig count has jumped, primarily supported by the addition of four rigs in Utah. Louisiana witnessed two more rigs for upstream operations.  Weak oil prices led the explorers to lower the number of drilling rigs in the domestic crude resources. But after oil crossed the $50-per-barrel mark, the upstream business seemed lucrative and drillers started gathering in crude patches.Development in this front is likely to prove beneficial for oil and gas exploration and production companies. Two oil stocks that might make valuable additions to your portfolio now are Lonestar Resources US (LONE  -  Free Report) and W&T Offshore, Inc. (WTI  -  Free Report).

(SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 929 in the week ended Dec 29 — lower than the prior week’s 931. This marked a decrease after the tally increased for the week ended Dec 22.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 658.For the week in discussion, the fall in rig count can be attributed to decreased onshore and offshore operations. The number of onshore rigs were 909, lower than 910. The tally for offshore was 18, down from 19.Two rigs operated in the inland waters last week, in line with the count for the week ended Dec 22.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 747 was in line with the count for the week ended Dec 22. Further, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 525. Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 182 was down from 184 for the week ended Dec 22.

Naturally, the total oil and gas rig count fell, primarily supported by the removal of two rigs in Williston basin. One rig, exploring natural gas, was also removed from the Haynesville shale play.   Crude pricing scenario has been healthy after the OPEC members agreed to extend the production curb deal beyond first-quarter 2018. Given that oil crossed the $60-per-barrel mark, we believe that there is considerable opportunity for U.S. shale players to ramp up drilling activities.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Northern Oil and Gas, Inc.

However, the number of rigs searching for natural gas has increased.DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 935 in the week ended Sep 22 – lower than the prior week’s 936. Notably, total rig count has declined six times in the last eight weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 511.For the week in discussion, the fall in rig count can be attributed to decreased onshore operations and lower inland water activities.However, count of rigs engaged in offshore operations rose from 17 to 19.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count slipped by five to 744. It is to be noted that the rigs exploring crude has decreased seven times in the last nine weeks.The current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 418.   Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – increased by four units to 190. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 92. As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 88.2%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.    Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs increased by one unit to 68, while the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) fell by two units to 867.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count stands at 19 units – 15 of which were oil-directed – higher than the prior count of 17.Details of the Weekly Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, acts as a yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count weighs heavily on demand for energy services, drilling, completion, production, etc., provided by companies like Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring natural gas in the United States has increased, while that for oil has declined. Overall total oil and gas rigs decreased as a lesser number of drillers gathered in the U.S. shale resources. Eagle Ford shale play and Williston basin saw the removal of three rigs each. Also, two rigs were removed from the DJ-Niobrara basin.A persistent fall in drilling rigs in U.S. resources helped crude cross the $50-per-barrel mark, significantly higher than the historical low of February 2016.   More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1122,SLB,"The energy sector of the S&P 500 witnessed strong gains as oil prices increased this month. The S&P 500 Energy sector is up 6.5% in September.Crude prices are rising, as global inventories are shrinking, proving that the OPEC cuts have somewhat succeeded in achieving their target. Per the International Energy Agency (IEA), international demand is strengthening and global oil supplies are decreasing. This is expected to drive prices higher (read: ETFs to Watch on Oil Price Rise and Debt Limit Deal).OPEC meetThe OPEC committee meets on Sep 22, 2017 to discuss the progress of the actions. After implementing production cuts amounting to as much as 1.8 million barrels a day, the OPEC is expected to discuss further actions required to ensure that oil prices regain stability.The decrease in global stockpiles is a sure positive for OPEC. Per a Bloomberg article citing IEA, excess inventories have declined 28% against their five-year average so far this year. Moreover, Iraq has extended a proposal to reduce supply by further 1%.Hurricane Impact and DemandOil prices rose as refineries along the Gulf coast reopened after being shut due to the disastrous Hurricane Harvey. The hurricane had led to the blocking of 20% of the oil refining capacity of the United States.Owing to the hurricanes Harvey and Irma aftermath, demand is expected to decline in the near term. However, the IEA stated that global demand is robust and as and when the impacts of the hurricane cool down, the future picture for crude is expected to improve (read: Hurricane Harvey Puts These ETF Areas in Focus).Moreover, the greenback has weakened, making dollar-denominated oil more affordable. This is in turn expected to drive demand.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to energy equities.Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE  -  Free Report)This fund is the most popular ETF traded in U.S. markets providing exposure to energy companies.It has AUM of $15.8 billion and charges a fee of 14 basis points a year.

1123,SLB,"Oilfield service giant Schlumberger Limited’s (SLB  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of 42 cents per share (excluding charges and credits) were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line improved from the year-earlier adjusted figure of 25 cents.The company’s total revenue of $7,905 million improved from the year-earlier level of $7,019 million but failed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,910 million.Third-quarter earnings were driven by solid demand for directional drilling in the land market of North America. This was partially offset by major project completions in Mexico and Iraq.Schlumberger and Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), have reported third-quarter numbers. The other two players – Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) and Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report) – belonging to the “Big Four” oilfield service and equipment providers – will likely report results on Oct 23 and Nov 1, respectively.  Segmental PerformanceEach of the groups – Reservoir Characterization, Drilling Group and Production Group – registered a year-over-year increase in revenues.Drilling Group revenues increased primarily on contributions from the North American market. Demand for directional drilling in the continent’s land market remained strong during the quarter. However, the positives were partially negated by the closure of Mexico and Iraq’s major developments – related to integrated drilling services.Results at the Production Group were driven by higher hydraulic fracturing work in the North American land market. Higher operations in the unconventional plays in the Middle East also led to the improvement.The Reservoir Characterization segment was supported by strong contributions from the international market. Surge in activities related to Wireline and Testing & Process in Russia and Norway led to the improvement in results. However, reduction of sales related to multiclient seismic license hurt the business unit.Reservoir Characterization: This group posted revenues of $1,771 million as against $1,667 million in the prior-year quarter. However, pre-tax operating income was $311 million, down 5% year over year.  Drilling Group: Revenues of $2,120 million rose 5% year over year. Pre-tax operating income was $301 million, up 38% year over year.Production Group: Revenues recorded by this group increased 37% from the year-earlier quarter to $2,876 million. Pre-tax operating income skyrocketed 212% year over year to $283 million.Cameron Group: This segment generated revenues of $1,297 million, down 3% year over year. Pre-tax operating income plunged 10% from the prior-year comparable period to $194 million.FinancialsAs of Sep 30, 2017, the company had approximately $4,952 million in cash and short-term investments and $15,871 million in long-term debt. This represents a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 30%. In the July-to-September quarter, the company bought back 1.5 million shares.  Q3 Price Performance  During the third quarter of 2017, Schlumberger has rallied 6%, outperformed the industry’s 1.7% gain.GuidanceFor 2017, the company projects investments of $2.1 billion, lower than the prior projection of $2.2 billion.Key DevelopmentIn a separate announcement, the company declared the execution of an agreement with Cenovus Energy (CVE  -  Free Report).

1124,SLB,"Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report) has divested U.S. oil-well business to a subsidiary of Schlumberger NV (SLB  -  Free Report) for $430 million in cash, scrapping plan of a joint venture.In March 2017, Weatherford decided to put its North American pressure pumping and well completions operations into a venture with Schlumberger for $535 million in cash and a 30% stake in the new business — OneStim. This was an attempt to be more competitive against market leader Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) and fast-emerging companies such as Keane Group Inc.Weatherford will retain the entire leading multistage completions portfolio, manufacturing capability and supply chain and will continue to take part in the growing completions markets in Canada and the United States as well as globally.Recently, the companies abandoned the joint venture. This was mainly because Weatherford sold U.S. pressure pumping assets to Schlumberger and transferred about 100 employees.Due to the growing demand from shale producers, pressure pumping specialists have been benefiting from higher crude prices. In December, Keane Group announced a $115-million investment to expand fleet, owing to high demand and improving economics.The funds raised from the transaction will be used by Weatherford to start deleveraging balance sheet, which reflects a debt of about $7.9 billion. Due to huge losses, the company has been selling assets. In the first nine months of this year, Weatherford incurred a loss of $875 million on revenues of $4.21 billion.Price PerformanceShares of Weatherford have gained 4.3% compared with the industry’s rally of 0.9% in the last six months. Zacks Rank & Key PicksWeatherford carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1125,SLB,"Though the U.S. stock market has had a spectacular run in 2017 on strong global economic growth and optimism related to President Trump’s pro-business policies, stock trading has been tight in the shortened-holiday week due to low volumes. However, several events led to major positive or negative movements in some corners of the market. Here are a few of the developments:Market MoversThe tech sector has been in the news this week, owing to recent developments relating to Apple’s latest product, the iPhone X. Reports of weaker iPhone X demand led to a sell-off in shares of Apple and its suppliers, driving the tech sector lower. Per a Reuters article citing Taiwan’s Economic Daily’s report, Apple is expected to slash its forecast sales of its flagship phone in the current quarter to 30 million units from the previous estimate of 50 million units.The S&P 500 Technology sub-sector nosedived as a result. Moreover, various market analyses predict that the tech sector will not benefit as much as expected earlier from President Donald Trump’s tax reform that was passed into law last week.Another major sector that was in news was the retail sector. The retail sector saw holiday sales jump to a six-year high. U.S. retail holiday sales increased 4.9% year over year in the Nov 1-Dec 24 period, compared with 3.7% last year. Moving on to the online sales space, Amazon saw a blockbuster season. Moreover, per a Reuters’ report, the online retail behemoth is in talks with authorities to expand into Saudi Arabia, which led to a rally in the company’s share price (read: Holiday Sales At 6-Year High: Best Consumer ETFs & Stocks).Moving on to the energy sector, crude oil prices have been rallying owing to a set of events. Crude breached $60 a barrel this week, the highest since June 2015. This was primarily helped by an extension in supply cuts into late 2018 by OPEC and an explosion in a crude pipeline in Libya. Moreover, per the Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. commercial crude inventories decreased by 4.6 million barrels in the week ended Dec 22 compared with a Wall Street Journal analysis predicting a decline of 3.7 million barrels.On the industrial metal side, strength in commodity prices led to a rally in U.S. equities. Copper prices rallied to a near four-year high on Dec 27, 2017, driven by strong import demand from China. Imports of refined copper increased 19% year over year in November to 329,168 tons.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to the discussed sectors.iShares U.S. Technology ETF (IYW  -  Free Report)This fund provides exposure to the U.S. technology sector.

1126,SLB,"Among the major oilfield services firms, Schlumberger Limited (SLB) and Halliburton Company (HAL) deserve a special mention, given their massive market caps of $86.4 billion and $38.8 billion, respectively. These companies dominate and define the industry to which they belong to.Both of these firms have interesting earnings surprise histories. Halliburton surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the prior four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 41.2%. However, Schlumberger beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in only one of the last four quarters and came up with an average positive earnings surprise of 4.2%.Given that West Texas Intermediate crude recently traded at $60 per barrel– the highest mark since Jun 25, 2015 – we can say the business environment is highly favorable for oilfield services players. The latest rig count report by Houston-based Baker Hughes (BHGE) clearly shows that the number of rigs exploring for oil and gas in the United States has increased from 665 to 931, year to date. Ramping up drilling activities should call for more oilfield service contracts. Although both the stocks are attractive picks for investors based on their earnings reports and favorable business scenario, our research shows Halliburton is a better choice than Schlumberger for 2018. The AnalysisWe have employed three parameters for an in-depth comparative analysis.Positive Earnings Estimate RevisionsEarnings estimate revisions are at the heart of the Zacks investment philosophy. Stocks that have recently had their estimates revised upward by analysts tend to outperform the market in the next 9-12 months.In the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Halliburton’s 2018 earnings has risen from $2.11 per share to $2.16 per share. Moreover, for 2018, we expect the company to report year-over-year earnings growth of 86.5%.However, the story is different for Schlumberger. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has been revised downward, from earnings per share of $2.25 to $2.14 in the last 60 days. Also, for 2018, we anticipate the company to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 46%.Strong Potential to Generate Cash FlowInvestors often look for indicators that help them determine the ability of a company to generate free cash flow from investments. For this purpose, we have employed the free cash flow yield ratio. Companies with strong operations generally have high free cash flow yield.Our proprietary model shows that free cash flow yield for Halliburton is 3.7%, higher than 3.5% for Schlumberger.  Sufficient Funds to Meet Capital ExpenditureA company’s free cash flow is calculated after deducting capital spending from operating cash flow. In the last four quarters, free cash flow for Halliburton came in at $1.566 billion, indicating that the firm has sufficient cash flow to fund capital spending.In other words, Halliburton generated $2.516 billion in net cash from core operations, while its capital spending amounted to $950 million. Most importantly, its trailing twelve-month free cash flow for 2017 has turned positive from negative free cash flow of $2.279 billion in 2016, reflecting massive improvement in the company’s operations. Although Schlumberger’s free cash flow of $3.289 billion is higher than that of Halliburton, it has been decreasing steadily since 2015. If the trend continues, Schlumberger’s reliance on debt capital for financing future operations will increase.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that the returns from investment at Halliburton are higher than Schlumberger. On top of that, earnings estimate revision trends are also in favor of Halliburton.This is reflected in Halliburton’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which suggests that the stock could outperform the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months. Meanwhile, Schlumberger carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1127,SLB,"Per Reuters, Weatherford International (WFT  -  Free Report) has appointed advisors, including Morgan Stanley, to ease the high debt burden of $7.9 billion by disposing some units. The asset divestment will begin in the first quarter of 2018.The assets to be sold off include the company’s drilling tools and wellheads units, the international pressure pumping business and the artificial lift business. Some of the potential bidders for the pressure pumping assets will include domestic company Superior Energy Services and Canada’s Calfrac Well Services, as well as energy funds backed by private equity firms.Per another source, oilfield services firms functioning in the Middle East and North Africa — core areas of Weatherford’s operations — can also be potential bidders.In 2016, Weatherford put up its land drilling business for sale at an estimated cost of below $1 billion but failed to strike a deal. Currently, the company plans to sell the business in parts based on regional operations.Though oil prices have touched pre-2014 levels, Weatherford projects about $500 million in additional proceeds from assets divested over the next one year.With crude prices down from June 2014 levels, most drillers have significantly curbed their capital expenditures. This is expected to hamper Weatherford’s business to assist the drilling firms in setting up oil wells. As a result, the company has also resorted to downsizing. Analysts expect consolidation in the oilfield services industry to continue.  In March 2017, Weatherford and Schlumberger Ltd (SLB  -  Free Report) inked an agreement to form a joint venture aiming at North America’s unconventional resource development. Weatherford considers the transaction to deleverage balance sheet, while it can receive considerable exposure to the unconventional market.Price PerformanceShares of the company have declined 11% against the industry’s rally of 6.8% in the last three months. Zacks RankWeatherford currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked players in the energy sector include ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) and Northern Oil and Gas Inc (NOG  -  Free Report). Both these stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.ConocoPhillips, based in Houston, TX, is a major global exploration and production (E&P) company. It delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 152.34% in the last four quarters.Northern Oil and Gas, based in Minnetonka, MN, is an independent energy company. The company delivered an average earnings surprise of 175.00% in the last four quarters.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?                                                                                                                                                            Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

1128,SLB,"Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) recently sealed the second and final phase of the $1.7-billion joint venture (JV) deal with state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (‘’NNPC’’).The JV project, which is almost 92% complete, is financed in two stages with $780 million funded by third parties. In the first stage of the deal (which closed on Aug 1, 2017), $400 million was funded by the Nigerian Commercial Banks, while $380 million will be provided by International Commercial Banks for the second stage of the deal. Chevron is set to contribute $312 million for the project whereas NNPC will spend $468 million.The project involves the production of natural gas liquids and condensate from Sonam and Okan fields in the Niger Delta. Per the deal, the companies will complete the construction of Sonam pipeline and living quarters platform along with non-associated gas (NAG) well platform. The agreement also involves the development of Okan pig receiver platform and other associated facilities. The companies will also be required to complete the drilling of seven wells in the Sonam Field along with the Okan 30E NAG well. Currently, while the facilities are fully completed, the wells are 40% executed.Nigeria — being one of the biggest oil producing countries in Africa — represents a very significant portion of the total upstream production volumes of Chevron. It accounts for a major portion of the company’s international asset base with Chevron holding 40% interest in the Escravos Gas Plant and Sonam field. Notably, Agbami oilfield contributes maximum to Chevron’s Nigerian upstream volumes. The U.S. supermajor also holds stakes in Escravos Gas-to-Liquids plant, West African Gas Pipeline Usan and Owowo oil prospects among many others. Chevron’s development projects in Nigeria are aimed at boosting output growth and exports.Plummeting oil prices along with rising militantism has lowered the production and revenues of the country and posed risk to Chevron’s operations in the region. However, the ongoing government peace talks have eased the situation to a considerable extent.  Last year, Chevron’s Nigerian operations accounted for 235,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.The deal is also in line with Nigeria’s energy sector reform initiatives and aims at enhancing the country’s oil and gas production by 39,000 barrels per day and 283 million standard cubic feet per day, respectively. Nigeria currently produces 1.7 million barrels of oil per day (Bpd) which is expected to rise to 2.2 million Bpd by 2018 and 4 million Bpd by 2020. In a bid to bolster its reserves, production and daily revenues, Nigeria is currently focusing on inking deals with foreign companies including Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report), Chevron and Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) to develop oil fields. Zacks Rank and Key PickChevron is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world, based on proved reserves. It is engaged in oil and gas exploration and production, refining and marketing of petroleum products, manufacturing of chemicals, and other energy-related businesses.

1129,SLB,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported a fall in oil and natural gas rig count in the United States.DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 936 in the week ended Sep 15 – lower than the prior week’s 944. Notably, total rig count has declined five times in the last seven weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 506.For the week in discussion, the fall in rig count can be attributed to decreased onshore operations and lower inland water activities.However, count of rigs engaged in offshore operations rose from 16 to 17.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count slipped by seven to 749. It is to be noted that the rigs exploring crude has decreased six times in the last nine weeks.The current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 416.    Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – fell by one unit to 186. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 89. As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 89%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.     Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs slipped by eight units to 67, while the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) was in line with the prior week’s 869.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count stands at 17 units – 14 of which were oil-directed – higher than the prior count of 16.Details of the Weekly Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, acts as an important yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count weighs heavily on demand for energy services, drilling, completion, production, etc., provided by companies like Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).ConclusionThe number of rigs searching for crude and natural gas in the United States has declined. Three rigs were removed from Cana Woodford, a liquid rich shale play. Also, Permian basin and Eagle Ford shale play saw the removal of two rigs each.A persistent fall in drilling rigs in U.S. resources helped crude to reach near the $50-per-barrel mark, significantly higher than the historical low of February 2016.    Development in this front is likely to prove beneficial for oil and gas exploration and production companies.

1130,SLB,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported an increase in natural gas rig count in the United States. The number of rigs exploring oil remained in line with the prior week.DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 915 in the week ended Nov 17 — higher than the prior week’s 907. This marked an increase in total rig count for two consecutive weeks after the tally fell for five weeks in a row.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 588.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore and offshore operations. The count of rigs engaged in offshore works rose from 18 to 21, while the tally for onshore activities jumped to 893 from 888.The number of rigs for inland waters remains flat with the previous week.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 738 is in line with the prior week mark. Also, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 471.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – increased by eight units to 177. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 116.As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is almost 89% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs increased by six units to 63, while the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by two units to 852.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count stands at 21 units — 17 of which were oil-directed — higher than the prior count of 18.Details of the Weekly Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count weighs heavily on demand for energy services like drilling, completion, production, etc., provided by companies like Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring natural gas in the United States has increased, while the count for oil remains the same as last week. Overall total oil and gas rig count has increased, primarily supported by the addition of five rigs in the Permian basin. Haynesville shale play witnessed two more rigs for upstream operations.  A rise in total rig count, both from the year-ago and prior week figures, were primarily supported by recovering oil and natural prices. Recently, crude and gas traded at $56.09 per barrel and $3.05 per million Btu respectively, higher than last year’s average marks of $43.29 and $2.52 – per The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).Recovering commodity prices are likely to prove beneficial for oil and gas exploration and production companies.

In November, Ecuador had agreed to discharge its debt with the oil company in tranches but failed to fulfill its obligation. Petroamazonas, a state oil company, was supposed to make the payment.Earlier, Petroamazonas had paid the debt in installments following a series of postponement. However, it decided to pay the remaining amount in November, from funds raised via issuance of bonds in the international market.The recent volatility in oil prices has raised liquidity problems for Ecuador. The government is contemplating over various sources to raise funds in order to cover payments to international and local contractors.Even the analysts are of the view that the delay in the fulfillment of the payment may further complicate Schlumberger’s operations in the region.Schlumberger is the operator of a consortium in the Shushufindi field.

1132,SLB,"Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE  -  Free Report) recently agreed to divest its carbon dioxide enhanced oil recovery operation, Weyburn oil facility in Saskatchewan for C$940 million ($738.53 million) to Whitecap Resources Inc, based in western Canada. The sale of the oil facility, whose current production capacity is 11,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2017.The sale is in line with the company's divestment program targeted to support the acquisition of oil sands assets from ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) for C$16.8 billion earlier this year. The Weyburn asset sale is the last of the company's four major divestitures that it targeted to raise proceeds of up to C$5 billion.As part of this plan, the company sold its  Pelican Lake assets to Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNQ  -  Free Report) in September. Later in the month, Cenovus agreed to divest its Suffield crude oil and natural gas operations to International Petroleum Corporation.  In October, the company agreed to sell Palliser crude oil and natural gas assets to Torxen Energy and Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) for cash proceeds of C$1.3 billion. So far, Cenovus’ asset sales have generated C$3.74 billion. Cenovus also intends to use the proceeds to reduce its huge debt burden, optimize its asset portfolio and strengthen its balance sheet.

1133,SLB,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported a rise in natural gas rig count in the United States.DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 944 in the week ended Sep 8 – higher than the prior week’s 943. This shows an increase in total rig count for two weeks in a row after four straight weeks of a decline.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in the U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 508.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased activity in inland waters.Rig count in both onshore and offshore operations is in line with the prior week. The respective rig counts for onshore and offshore drilling are 923 and 16.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count slipped by three to 756. It is to be noted that the rigs exploring crude has decreased five times in the last eight weeks.The current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 414.     Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – jumped four units to 187. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 92. As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 89%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.      Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs rose by seven units to 75, while the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) was down by six to 869. Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count stands at 16 units – 13 of which were oil-directed – in line with the prior count.Details of the Weekly Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, acts as an important yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count weighs heavily on the demand for energy services, drilling, completion, production, etc., provided by companies like Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).ConclusionThe number of rigs searching for natural gas in the United States increased, while that for oil decreased. Overall, total oil and gas rigs increased as the drillers gathered in the U.S. shale resources. Two rigs were added in each of the respective shale plays of Marcellus, Permian and Haynesville.We are expecting more rigs to come online as refiners along the gulf coast, hit by Hurricane Harvey, are gradually restarting operations. In other words, more demand for raw crude from the GoM refiners – accounted for more than 45% of domestic oil refining capacity, per The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) – might drive commodity prices and call for more rigs in the oil and gas patches.Development in this front is likely to prove beneficial for oil and gas exploration and production companies.

1134,SLB,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes reported an increase in rig count in the United States.Rig Count DetailsBaker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in this Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1059 in the week (ended May 25) compared with the prior week’s 1046. Notably, total count increased 13 times in the last 14 weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 908.  For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 1036, higher than 1023. Four rigs operated in the inland waters last week, in line with the count for the week ended May 18. The tally for offshore rigs was 19, also in line.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count was 859, up from 844 for the week ended May 18. Notably, for the first time since the week through Feb 9, the market witnessed such a jump in weekly rig count.Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 722. The oil rig count rose 11 times in the last 14 weeks.   Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 198 is lower than 200 for the week ended May 18. However, like oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year-ago tally of 185.Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 66 units increased from 61 units. Moreover, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) rose by eight units to 993 units.    Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 18 units — 15 rigs were oil-directed — same as the tally for the week ended May 18.ConclusionThe number of total rigs exploring in the United States has increased, courtesy of the addition of 10 oil rigs in the Permian Basin. With this, rigs exploring oil in the region increased for four weeks in a row. It seems that drillers have been gathering in Permian despite the basin suffering from midstream infrastructure bottleneck.The leading crude producers in the world — Saudi Arabia and Russia —  were in talks to boost daily oil production by roughly 1 million barrels, per media reports. This created a panic in the energy market, leading crude prices to fall below $70 a barrel through the week ended May 25.However, the oil drilling market scenario is still favorable in U.S. shale plays. Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC  -  Free Report) and Comstock Resources, Inc. (CRK  -  Free Report).

1135,SLB,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported a decline in rigs searching for crude and natural gas in the country. DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 943 in the week ended Sep 1 – higher than the previous week’s 940. This shows that the total rig count in the country has increased again after four straight weeks of a decline.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in American shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 497.For the week in discussion, the improvement in rig count can be attributed to higher onshore activities.Rig count in the onshore business increased by three units, while units engaged in offshore operations fell slightly to 16 from 17 in the prior week.  Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count was in line with the count of 759 recorded in the previous week. It is to be noted that the rigs exploring crude has decreased four times in the last seven weeks.The current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 407. Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – jumped three units to 183. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 88. As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 89%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs rose by four units to 68, while the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) was down by one to 875.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count went down to 16 units – 14 of which were oil-directed – from 17 counts.Details of the Weekly Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, acts as an important yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count weighs heavily on the demand for energy services, drilling, completion, production, etc., provided by companies like Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report)            .ConclusionThe number of rigs searching for natural gas in the United States increased, while that for oil remained flat. This shows that Hurricane Harvey, which was responsible for heavy downpour in the Texas and Louisiana states of the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) area, failed to lower exploration activities.Although rig count in Texas fell by one unit and the count in Louisiana was flat as compared to the prior week, it seems that the storm has not been felt as much as apprehended.However, the counts might not be exact as the storm kept Baker Hughes from confirming the increase or decrease in the number of rigs in almost 47 counties of South Texas.After Harvey, some refiners are restarting their operations which led to a rally in the price of black gold. This is likely to prove beneficial for oil exploration and production companies.

1136,SLB,"It was a week where the price of oil spiked to its highest mark in nearly eight months. However, natural gas futures fell sharply.On the news front, integrated majors ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) came up with stronger-than-expected earnings reports, driven by higher oil prices.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 4% to close at $53.90 per barrel, natural gas prices slumped 5.6% to $2.752 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: SLB & HAL's Q3, RIG's New Contract & More.)The U.S. oil benchmark rallied on expectations that OPEC and other major producers will agree to expand their output-cut deal beyond March. The agreement, already renewed once, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut.Further support came from the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release, which showed steep declines in domestic gasoline and distillate inventories on rising exports.Upbeat third-quarter U.S. GDP data and signs of recovery in global demand growth was also bullish for oil prices.Meanwhile, natural gas futures finished the week down despite a smaller-than-expected increase in supplies. Unfavorable weather forecasts and strength in the commodity’s production, induced the drop in prices.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Energy giant ExxonMobil Corp. posted strong third-quarter 2017 results, courtesy of increased price realizations from liquids and gas and improved margins at the refinery business.Production averaged 3.878 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MMBOE/d), marginally higher than 3.811 MMBOE/d in the year-ago quarter. Ramp up in Australian projects supported the upside.ExxonMobil’s downstream segment recorded profits of $1.5 billion, $303 million higher than the July-September quarter of 2016. This improvement was backed by improved margins from refining activities.During the quarter under review, ExxonMobil generated cash flow of $8.4 billion from operations and asset sales. The energy giant returned $3.3 billion to shareholders through dividends. Capital and exploration spending increased 43% year over year to almost $6 billion. (Read more: ExxonMobil Earnings Beat Estimates in Q3, Rise Y/Y.)2.    Smaller rival Chevron Corp. reported strong third-quarter results amid the recovery in commodity prices, production gains and robust refining profits. The company reported earnings per share of $1.03, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 99 cents and the year-ago profit of 68 cents.Chevron’s total production of crude oil and natural gas increased 8.1% compared with last year’s corresponding period to 2,717 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (MBOE/d). The U.S. output decreased 2.4% year over year to 681 MBOE/d but the company’s international operations (accounting for 75% of the total) was up 12.2% to 2,036 MBOE/d.Exploration costs fell from $258 million in the third quarter of 2016 to $239 million. The company spent $4,456 million in capital expenditures during the quarter, a considerable decline from the $5,175 million incurred a year ago. Roughly 88% of the total outlays pertained to upstream projects.Importantly, Chevron delivered a good cash flow performance this quarter – an important gauge for the oil and gas industry – with $5,370 million in cash flow from operations, up from $5,311 million a year ago. (Read more Refining, Higher Oil Power Chevron's Q3 Earnings Beat)3.    France-based supermajor TOTAL S.A. reported third-quarter 2017 operating earnings of $1.04 per share (€0.88 per share), beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 99 cents by 5%. The outperformance was due to good operational performance, steadily decreasing breakeven production costs, improvement in the realized prices of commodities and new projects ramp ups, boosting production.Despite the impact of Hurricane Harvey on its American operations, favorable refining margins resulted in 18% sequential growth of its Downstream business. The cost reduction initiatives will result in savings in excess of $3.6 billion in 2017.Through its ongoing initiatives to lower operating costs, TOTAL aims to reduce costs by $5 billion by 2020.Cash and cash equivalents as of Sep 30, 2017 were $28.58 billion compared with $24.80 billion as of Sep 30, 2016.

1137,SLB,"With reports from 32.8% of the S&P 500 companies out, we are in the thick of Q3 earnings. Meanwhile, only 19.4% of the energy companies belonging to the index have reported their Q3 numbers. According to the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these energy firms are up 253.9% from the same period last year on 33.5% higher revenues; 50% of the companies have reported positive earnings surprises so far; with 50% beating revenue estimates.Moreover, our report shows that energy is the only sector among the 16 representing the S&P 500 index to witness triple-digit earnings growth in Q3.Hence, it is time for investors to add energy stocks with strong growth potential to their portfolio.Crude Turns Around in Q3As per macrotrends, The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude saw a 12.2% gain during the third quarter of 2017 after two consecutive quarters of decline this year. Notably, this is the highest quarterly gain since the April-to-June quarter of 2016.According to The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), average monthly prices for each month of Q3 2017 were higher than the year-ago comparable period. Lower global crude inventory helped ease the crude supply glut concern which primarily supported the oil price rally in the third quarter.Oversupply Concerns Ease in Q3Per the EIA, during the July-to-September quarter of this year, worldwide oil inventories declined by 500,000 barrels per day (B/D). With this, the inventory level fell for three quarters in a row.According to The Oil & Gas Journal, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) produced an average of 32.9 million B/D in the third quarter as compared to last November’s 33.4 million B/D. Thus, it can be safely concluded that the leading crude exporter’s landmark production cut deal primarily supported the draws in global crude inventory.Oil Rebound Drives Performance   Major oilfield service firms have reported healthy Q3 numbers so far. Schlumberger Limited’s (SLB  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of 42 cents per share (excluding charges and credits) were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line improved from the year-earlier adjusted figure of 25 cents.Another leading oilfield service player, Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), reported better-than-expected profit in the third quarter. The company’s income from continuing operations came in at 42 cents per share, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents — the thirteenth consecutive quarter of outperformance. Moreover, revenues of $5,444 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,318.9 million.On top of that, key upstream energy player Range Resources Corporation (RRC  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 5 cents per share which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2 cents. Notably, the company had incurred a loss of 6 cents in the year-ago quarter.Hence, it is clear that the promising Q3 crude pricing environment supported the top and bottom-line performance of key energy companies.Let’s Focus on Growth Energy StocksSince crude determines the fate of energy companies, the favorable oil price scenario will support Q3 numbers for energy firms that are yet to report results.However, choosing the right stocks is quite an uphill task. With the help of our proprietary screening criteria, we have shortlisted four energy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). These stocks have a Growth Style Score of A or B.Growth stocks, as the name suggests, offer higher growth potential to investors compared to other stocks in the same category. A primary attribute of growth stocks is that these prefer to invest profits in capital growth projects to develop products and technologies rather than paying dividends.In particular, our Growth Style Score condenses all the essential metrics from a company’s financial statements to get a true sense of the quality and sustainability of its growth. Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B, when combined with a favorable Zacks Rank, offer the best investment opportunities in the growth investing space.Headquartered in Irving, TX, Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) is the world’s largest publicly traded oil company. The company, set to report third-quarter results on Oct. 27, has a Growth Style Score of B.Our proven model shows that Exxon Mobil is likely to beat third-quarter earnings because it has an Earnings ESP of +1.91% and a Zacks Rank #2. Our research shows that for stocks with a combination of positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2, or 3 (Hold), the chance of delivering a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.  Also, we expect Exxon Mobil to witness year-over-year earnings growth of almost 39% for the July-to-September quarter.Newpark Resources, Inc. (NR  -  Free Report), based in The Woodlands, TX, is a leading provider of drilling fluids products that are used in oil fields.Scheduled to report third-quarter results on Oct. 30, Newpark has an Earnings ESP of +33.33%. The company has a Growth Style Score of B and carries a Zacks Rank #2.The company’s earnings surprise history looks impressive. Newpark managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters, the average positive surprise being 70.46%.We also expect the firm to see year-over-year earnings growth of 123.1% in the quarter.Ecopetrol SA (EC  -  Free Report), based in Bogotá, Colombia, operates as an integrated energy player. The company is expected to report quarterly earnings on Nov. 24.The firm has a Growth Style Score of A and sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Also, per our expectations, the company will record year-over-year quarterly earnings growth of 425%.Headquartered in Denver, CO, Cimarex Energy Co. (XEC  -  Free Report) is a major upstream energy company. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2 and Growth Style Score of B.Cimarex, with Earnings ESP of +0.29%, is set to report third-quarter results on Nov. 7. Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the prior four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 11.90%.For the third quarter, Cimarex is expected to post year-over-year earnings growth of 137.2%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1138,SLB,"In a landmark deal, President Donald Trump sided with the Democrats to increase the debt limit and fund the government till mid-December. Republicans had earlier rejected this proposal by the Democrats. Trump unexpectedly agreed to the deal disappointing fellow Republicans, who were pushing for a longer extension.Debt Limit DealIn a meeting with Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Trump passed the deal to back a short-term debt ceiling extension to fund the government till Dec 15, 2017 and bundle a relief package for Hurricane Harvey victims.House speaker Paul Ryan accused the Democrats of playing “politics” with the debt ceiling and stated that a short-term extension would provide them with immense leverage over the Republicans. He also said that a faster recovery from Harvey would be doubtful with such a deal.Trump’s dealmaker title is being doubted by the markets now. Not only did he accept the short-term, debt-ceiling plan proposed by the Democrats, he also stated that he wanted to legalize the DACA program working closely with the opposition. The DACA program, which the Trump administration aims to phase out in six months, protects young immigrants who were brought to the United States by their parents and allows them to work in the United States.Energy Stocks RallyThe energy sector of the S&P 500 saw strong gains as oil prices increased. Oil prices rose as refineries along the Gulf coast reopened after being shut due to the disastrous Hurricane Harvey. The hurricane had led to blocking 20% of the oil refining capacity of the United States (read: ETFs to Watch in Harvey Aftermath & New Hurricane Irma).Even before any respite could be felt from Harvey, Hurricane Irma made a landfall on the Caribbean and Hurricane Jose started forming in the Atlantic, threatening Americans of a double whammy.

1139,SLB,"The energy sector is garnering a lot of investor attention lately. With increasing geopolitical tensions, talks of further OPEC cuts and decreasing production, oil prices are having a good time.Reason Behind the AppealOPEC is scheduled to meet on Nov 30, 2017 to decide on the future of oil production cuts. The markets believe that the OPEC will be extending the output cut deal to 2018 to further stabilize oil prices. Investors breathed a sigh of relief as they appear convinced that member countries are adhering to the OPEC deal (read: Here's Why Energy ETFs are Rallying).The impact of hurricanes in the United States led to a decline in U.S. oil production. Declining U.S. drilling activity has provided support to prices. U.S. oil rigs drilling for new production fell to 736 in the week ending Oct 20 compared with 743 in the previous week, per an Economic Times article citing Baker Hughes data.Moreover, clashes between government forces and Kurdish groups in Iraq have led to supply problems in the world’s second-largest oil producing country. Adding to the agony, President Donald Trump proposed new sanctions on Iran and accused the Middle Eastern country of not adhering to the landmark nuclear deal which imposed curbs on Iran’s nuclear capacity in exchange for freeing assets and easing international trade restrictions. Although still uncertain, oil prices have been rallying on risks of new sanctions on Iran.Let us now discuss two ETFs focused on providing exposure to energy equities.Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to energy stocks and tracks the Energy Select Sector Index. It has AUM of $16.5 billion and charges a moderate fee of 14 basis points a year. It has 32 holdings and bears significant concentration risk as over 72% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings.From a sector look, the fund has exposure to Oil, Gas & Consumable Fuels and Energy Equipment & Services, with 85.4% and 14.6% exposure, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corp (CVX  -  Free Report) and Schlumberger Ltd (SLB  -  Free Report) with 23.9%, 17.5% and 6.8% allocation, respectively (as of Oct 23, 2017).  The fund has lost 4.0% in a year and 10.5% year to date (as of Oct 23, 2017). XLE currently has a Zacks ETF Rank #4 (Sell) with a High risk outlook.Vanguard Energy ETF (VDE  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to energy stocks and tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Energy 25/50 Index. It has AUM of $3.9 billion and charges a fee of only 10 basis points a year. It has 134 holdings and bears significant concentration risk as over 65% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings.From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Integrated Oil & Gas, Oil & Gas Exploration & Production and Oil & Gas Equipment & Services, with 40.1%, 26.7% and 14.2% exposure, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp and Schlumberger Ltd with 21.8%, 15.0% and 6.6% allocation, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017). The fund has lost 5.9% in a year and 12.6% year to date (as of Oct 2, 2017). VDE currently has a Zacks ETF Rank #4 with a High risk outlook.Bottom LineXLE is more popular than VDE, as is evident from its higher AUM. However, VDE may be more appealing to investors, owing to its cheaper expense ratio.  VDE also has a more diversified exposure in terms of number of holdings.However, XLE has clearly outperformed VDE, both in the year-to-date frame and in a year. With growing optimism about production cuts and relatively less volatility in oil prices, these ETFs might be an attractive bet. However, since the factors driving growth in this sector are still quite uncertain, a more popular ETF like XLE might help alleviate some of the uncertainties prevailing in the sector.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1140,SLB,"Picture Thus FarThe Q3 earnings cycle is in full swing with 138 S&P 500 members that account for 32.9% of the index’s total market capitalization having reported their numbers. Per the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these companies are up 7.3% from the same period last year on 4.9% higher revenues, with 70.3% positive earnings surprises and 68.1% beating revenue estimates.As of now, very few energy companies have reported their third-quarter results. Notably, just two energy companies on the S&P 500 index have reported their Q3 numbers. These include the major oilfield services players Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) and Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report). Schlumberger reported third-quarter 2017 earnings of 42 cents per share (excluding charges and credits), in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and higher than the year-ago figure of 25 cents.(Read more: Schlumberger Posts In-Line Q3 Earnings, Revenues Miss)Halliburton Co. reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America. Halliburton’s income from continuing operation came in at 42 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents. Notably this is the 13th consecutive earnings beat recorded by the company. Moreover, revenues of $5,444 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,318.9 million.(Read more North American Strength Drives Halliburton Q3 Earnings)Q3 Report Card: Oil and Gas Prices End on a Positive NoteOil: Prices of oil at the end of the third quarter improved amid continued decline in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative. With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, price of oil at the end of the third quarter was $51.67 per barrel, up about 10.5% sequentially. A year ago, crude prices lingered around $45 per barrel.Natural Gas: Prices of natural gas dropped about 3.5% in the July-September period owing to the fuel’s tepid demand due to mild weather conditions and hurricane-related power outages. Despite the sequential fall, natural gas prices remain favorable when compared with the corresponding period of 2016. The commodity futures ended the quarter at $3 per MMBtu, up more than 3% from the Sep 30, 2016 settlement of $2.9 per MMBtu.Energy Companies to Gain from Higher Prices: As we know, the profitability of energy companies is directly affected by fluctuations in oil and gas prices. Therefore, all oil/gas-related stocks are poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices as they will be able to extract more value for their products.Year-over-Year Gain Leads to Bullish ExpectationsA look back at the Q2 earnings season reflects that earnings for the sector recorded a massive 252.7% jump from the same period last year — by far the highest growth among all sectors — on 16.8% higher revenues.The energy sector is poised to see the strongest growth in Q3 again. Per our expectations, earnings for the sector are expected to jump 122% from third-quarter 2016, while the top line is likely to witness an improvement of 16.3% from the year-ago levels.Energy Stock Reporting Q3 Earnings on Oct 26Let’s see what’s in store for four energy companies that are slated to release their quarterly numbers.Texas-based leading refinery player Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) is slated to report results before the opening bell.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 13.89%, courtesy of higher throughput margin. Moreover, Valero surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters, with an average of 18.24%.Valero Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Valero Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Valero Energy Corporation QuoteValero is expected to keep its earnings streak alive this quarter also as it has the right combination of the two ingredients. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.27% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s refining segment earnings is $1,372 million, higher than $990 million recorded in the year-ago quarter and $959 million in the prior quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $20,183 million for the third quarter, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.Our model predicted earnings beat earlier too. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an Earnings ESP of +0.27% and carried a Zacks Rank #2.Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) an independent oil refiner and marketer is set to release results before the market opens.The Findlay, OH-based downstream operator has a mixed earnings surprise history. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the last four quarters. In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 0.96% on lower gross margins and elevated costs.Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Marathon Petroleum Corporation QuoteHowever, our model indicates that Marathon Petroleum is likely to beat on earnings estimates this time, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.09%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s revenues from refining and marketing is pegged at $419 million, 36.9% higher than the reported figure in third-quarter 2016. We also expect profitability in its midstream (or pipeline transportation) segment to be 62.8% higher than the year-ago quarter to stand at $420 million. Earnings are likely to be driven by solid process and fractionation volumes, along with contribution from investments in new projects.Our model predicted earnings beat earlier too. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an Earnings ESP of +0.14% and carried a Zacks Rank #3.Energy equipment supplier National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) will report its results after the closing bell.National Oilwell Varco has a good track record of earnings surprise history, courtesy of its cost-reduction initiatives and improved efficiencies. The company delivered average positive earnings surprise of 10.46% in the trailing four quarters.National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | National Oilwell Varco, Inc. QuoteBased on our model, National Oilwell is likely to beat on earnings even this time, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +13.04%.Rising momentum in the U.S. markets and modest improvement in international markets along with increasing consumer demand are likely to improve the revenues of the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of the Wellbore Technology segment is $672 million compared with $614 million reported in second-quarter 2017 and $526 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.Our model predicted earnings beat earlier too. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an earnings ESP of +10.91% and carried a Zacks Rank #3.Upstream energy player EQT Corporation (EQT  -  Free Report) is set to report results before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 6 cents per share surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents. EQT delivered average positive earnings surprise of 102.17% in the trailing four quarters.EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | EQT Corporation QuoteHowever, our proven model does not show that EQT is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of -31.31% and a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the average daily sales volume for the current quarter is estimated at 2,303 million cubic feet equivalent per day (MMcfe/d), which is higher than 2,177 MMcfe/d recorded in the preceding quarter and 2,131 MMcfe/d in the year-ago quarter. The company is poised to benefit as the midstream business might rake more profits for EQT given the fact that U.S. drillers continue to bank on shale plays.However, we are concerned by the increased spending of the company. EQT is expected to spend $1.5 billion in 2017.  During first-half 2017, EQT’s operating expenses related to transportation and processing activities surged more than 66%. If the trend continues, it might hurt EQT’s earnings.Even earlier, our model did not indicate that EQT will beat on earnings this season. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an Earnings ESP of -163.91% and carried a Zacks Rank #3.Zacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

(See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: RDS.A Buys EV Charging Network, CVX Cancels Australia Drilling Plan.)The U.S. oil benchmark registered a modest climb after the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles fell for the fourth straight week.The bullish impact from the crude inventory draw was supported by other developments including mounting tensions between Iraq and Kurdistan near the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, President Trump’s decision not to certify Iran’s compliance with the nuclear deal, and a falling U.S. rig count.However, the gains were kept in check by concerns over a new wave of domestic shale oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.Meanwhile, natural gas futures finished higher following an in-line increase in supplies. Current stocks – at 3.646 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) – are now 35 Bcf (1%) under the five-year average, while dropping 179 Bcf (4.7%) below the year-ago figure.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    The world’s largest oilfield services provider, Schlumberger Ltd., reported third-quarter 2017 earnings of 42 cents per share (excluding charges and credits), in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and higher than the year-ago figure of 25 cents.The strong results were driven by solid demand for directional drilling in the North American land market. This was partially offset by major project completions in Mexico and Iraq, where the company wrapped up major service contracts.The oilfield service player expects activity in North America – where Schlumberger has a significant client base – to continue growing but cautioned that the rate might slow down from previous quarters on account of flattening rig count.As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had approximately $4,952 million in cash and short-term investments and $15,871 million in long-term debt. This represents a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 30%. In the July-to-September quarter, the company bought back 1.5 million shares.

Halliburton’s income from continuing operation came in at 42 cents per share, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents – the thirteenth consecutive quarterly outperformance. Moreover, revenues of $5,444 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,318.9 million.Along the results, Halliburton also sounded optimistic in its view that the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing - particularly for pressure pumping. As it is, rig counts have generally been rising during the last one and half years since plunging to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, with the addition of a flood of new units. As a proof of the recovery, Halliburton grew its domestic land revenue by 14% sequentially, well ahead of the U.S. land rig count growth of 6%.Additionally, Halliburton’s international market proved resilient in the face of challenging circumstances. The company’s impressive expense management for the last several quarters helped regional sales rising more than 4% from the second quarter.

Per Transocean, the contract will begin in the second quarter of 2018.The contract for Deepwater Invictus, which joined Transocean's fleet in 2014, includes three one-year priced options. Transocean expects the backlog related to the contract to be around $106 million. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is yet to declare the exact dayrates for the rig. In this context, we would like to remind investors that Deepwater Invictus’ first contract with BHP in 2014 had a dayrates of $595,000. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Built in Korea's DSME shipyard, Invictus can operate in water depth of up to 12,000 feet. It can drill 40,000 feet deep wells. The drillship worked for BHP in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Trinidad. Invictus is presently in the Gulf of Mexico, south of Louisiana.

(CLB  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 48 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents. The figure also compared favorably with the prior-year quarter adjusted earnings of 38 cents.Although the company’s operations in the third quarter were affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, it surpassed its updated guidance. Damages to Core Laboratories’ facilities were minor. Despite the unfavorable situations faced by the company and its clients due to flooding, power outages and wind damages caused by the hurricanes, its results were better than the year-ago quarter, thanks to the rising demand for the company’s products.As of Sep 30, 2017, Core Laboratories had cash and cash equivalents of $13.8 million and long-term debt (including lease obligations) of around $233.9 million. The debt-to-capitalization ratio of the company was 60.4%. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $4.9 million.Importantly, the company generated free cash flow of approximately $25 million in third-quarter 2017.

This will lead to a collaboration between the two companies’ subsidiaries in order to upgrade Plexus’ technology.Per the deal, TechnipFMC will give £15 million ($19.8M) initial gross cash consideration to Plexus. Depending on the future performance of the jack-up business during an earn-out period of three years, TechnipFMC will give up to £27.5 million ($36.3 million) more. The earn-out can potentially raise the total cash consideration to £42.5 million ($56.1 million).The acquisition will expand TechnipFMC’s portfolio in the field of high pressure high temperature (HPHT) and in the mudline. It will help the company to serve better in the global jack up exploration drilling market. With contracts raining for TechnipFMC, we believe this move will help the company to serve its clients more efficiently. It will improve the quality of the products and services it offers. Since June 2017, the company won four contracts from different energy companies.

1143,SLB,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported a decline in rigs searching for crude and natural gas in the country.  DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 940 in the week ended Aug 25 – lower than the previous week’s 946. This shows that the total rig count in the country has declined for four weeks in a row.Since it hit an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in American shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 489.For the week in discussion, the decline in rig count can be attributed to lower onshore activities.Rig count in the onshore business fell by seven units, while units engaged in offshore operations increased slightly to 17 counts from 16 in the prior week.   Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count fell by four to 759. This emphasizes that the rigs exploring for crude has decreased four times in the last six weeks. However, the current tally, though far off from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 406.  Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – fell by two units to 180. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 81. As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 89%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs fell by two units to 64, while the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) was down by four to 876.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count went up to 17 units – 15 of which were oil-directed – from 16 counts.    Details of the Weekly Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, acts as an important yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count weighs heavily on the demand for energy services – drilling, completion, production, etc. – provided by companies like Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report). ConclusionThe number of rigs searching for oil and natural gas in the United States slipped from the prior week. This shows that oil and gas explorers have started lowering capital spending with an aim to combat crude glut. Two prospective oil stocks that could be included in your portfolio include Range Resources Corporation (RRC  -  Free Report) and Lonestar Resources US (LONE  -  Free Report).  Both the companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1146,SLB,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Schlumberger N.V. (SLB  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 6% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Schlumberger Q2 Earnings Beat on Increased DrillingSchlumberger’s second-quarter 2017 earnings of $0.35 per share (excluding charges and credits) beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.30 and the year-ago figure of $0.23.The company reported total revenue of $7,462 million, which improved from the year-earlier level of $7,164 million and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,258 million.The strong results were driven by a rebound in drilling activities in Russia and the North Sea. Higher demand for directional drilling techniques, especially in the domestic onshore market, also supported the numbers.Segmental PerformanceEach of the groups – Reservoir Characterization, Drilling Group and Production Group – registered a year-over-year increase in revenues.Drilling Group revenues increased primarily on contributions from the international market. Rebound in seasonal works in Russia and the North Sea contributed to growth. Higher demand for directional drilling techniques, especially in the domestic onshore market, also supported the top line. However, the positives were partially negated by reduced operations related to the offshore market in the Gulf of Mexico.Results at the Production Group were positively impacted by higher hydraulic fracturing work in the domestic land market. Pricing recovery in the North American land areas, improved unconventional land works in Argentina along with higher activities in China and Russia were also led to the improvement. Meanwhile, a decrease in production at the SPM Shushufindi development partially offset the positives.The Reservoir Characterization segment was supported by strong contributions from the international market. Surge in sales of WesternGeco multiclient seismic license along with higher contributions from drillstem test operations in the UAE led to better results. Higher wireline revenues from the North Sea and Russia also favored the business unit. Reservoir Characterization: This group posted revenues of $1,759 million as against $1,586 million in the prior-year quarter. Pre-tax operating income was $299 million, up 12% year over year.Drilling Group: Revenues of $2,107 million rose 4% year over year. Pre-tax operating income was $302 million, up 77% year over year.Production Group: Revenues recorded by this group increased 18% from the year-earlier quarter to $2,496 million. Pre-tax operating income skyrocketed 170% year over year to $221 million.Cameron Group: This segment generated revenues of $1,265 million, down 17% year over year. Pre-tax operating income plunged 30% from the prior-year comparable period to $174 million.FinancialsAs of Jun 30, 2017, the company had approximately $6,218 million in cash and short-term investments and $16,600 million in long-term debt. This represents a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 32%. In the April-to-June quarter, the company repurchased 5.5 million shares.GuidanceDuring 2017, the company reaffirmed its decision to invest $2.2 billion, slightly higher than $2.1 billion spent in 2016.The oilfield service player expects healthy activity in North America during the second half of this year. Also, in some of the international markets, Schlumberger anticipates projects and drilling activity to pick up pace.Key DevelopmentIn a separate announcement, the company declared its intention to buy a 51% equity stake in Eurasia Drilling Company Limited.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been eight revisions higher for the current quarter compared to two lower.Schlumberger N.V. Price and Consensus  Schlumberger N.V. Price and Consensus | Schlumberger N.V.

1147,SLB,"As per North Dakota’s oil regulator, the state’s daily crude output fell 0.8% in Jun after dropping 0.9% in the previous month. The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources’ (‘DMR’) latest data said that oil production in Jun averaged 1,032,495 barrels a day, down 8,500 barrels a day from May.Along with Oil, Gas Production Falls TooWhile daily output remained above 1 million barrels for the fifth month in a row, the small decline reflected in the newest numbers confirm the slowdown in the amount of oil extracted from North Dakota, centered on the Bakken Shale formation. Interestingly, it must be noted that at the end of June, the state’s total number of producing wells tallied 13,915, a new all-time high.With crude, natural gas output came down too – from May’s record 1,853,528 thousand cubic feet per day to 1,849,807 thousand cubic feet per day. As operators scramble to the core areas of the Bakken, wells here tend to produce more gas along with crude (present gas flare rate of around 12%).Current Production a Shadow of Earlier HighsChurning out as high as 1,227,483 barrels/day in Dec 2014, the current production statistics highlight oil’s horror show that has seen prices come down from $110 per barrel in mid-2014 to around $47 now, in between falling to a 12-year low of $26.21 in Feb 2016. The commodity’s collapse has fueled spending cuts and layoffs while threatening the industry’s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows, drying up liquidity and narrowing profit margins.Rig Count Clawing Back Steadily but Unlikely to Rise FurtherSome 55 drilling rigs were active in the state in Jun, up from 50 in May and Apr. The all-time low of 27 was set in May 2016, while a year ago, North Dakota had just 28 rigs operating. A closely watched yardstick of oil industry's strength, the steady rise in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates increase in drilling activities and essentially steady production.Notwithstanding recent gains, the rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling. Moreover, with oil prices tumbling some 19% year-to-date, the number of rigs are unlikely to ramp up beyond 55 this year. It’s because the current crude levels just won’t support any more drilling rigs.Increase in Wells, Rig Count Offset by Lack of Fracking CrewsEven as the rig count in North Dakota continues to rise and the number of producing wells in the state reach record highs, production is being stymied by the lack of hydraulic fracturing crews. At present, there are just around 22 frack crews in the state, not even half of the number of rigs. In particular, major oilfield service providers like Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) and Halliburton Co. (HAL  -  Free Report) are struggling to get experienced, qualified workers following mass layoffs triggered by the three-year crude slump. The ongoing labor shortage is primarily responsible for the recent drops in North Dakota’s oil production numbers.Shale Industry Caught in a “Catch-22” SituationWhile more rigs in operation and stable production could be construed as positive developments for the state of North Dakota, the current sub-$50 oil prices will render a lot of drilling as unprofitable. And at the crux of the matter is the rising flood of U.S. shale-driven production.Now at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques.With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50 oil reality and even thrive at those prices. In other words, while OPEC's moves to trim output and rebalance the demand-supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent, in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more.In other words, the U.S. shale (including the likes of North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas) is perhaps the biggest reason why crude prices are floundering again.What Lies Ahead?The fall in Jun production assumes greater significance considering that the oil bust is now anticipated to last through this year and well into 2018. In fact, with Jun production levels barely above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark, there are chances that output in the second-largest oil producing state after Texas could fall below that figure toward the end of 2017 if prices fall under $45 a barrel and stay there for an extended period. But as of now, output should remain steady for at least the next two months.Dakota Access Pipeline: Can It Revive Production?While the oil weakness is expected to persist at least till the first half of 2018, there is one factor that might speed up the revival of Bakken output – the 1,100-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline.Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending, President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and signed executive order to smooth the way for Energy Transfer Partners L.P.’s (ETP  -  Free Report) $3.7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new Administration. As a result, disregarding the censure from environmental groups and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the sponsor brought the controversial conduit online in early Jun.With the project’s arrival, operators have scrambled to use the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their product to market. In fact, around 78% of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines, with the costly railroad share dropping from over 24% earlier in 2017 to less than 10%.Market players believe that the pipeline has helped in bettering the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators. Set to carry about 500,000 barrels of oil daily, or more than 50% of North Dakota’s output, the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline has bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil producing areas like the Williston and Permian basins.This, industry observers hope, will set the ball rolling for Bakken’s production revival and help producers like Continental Resources Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report) and EOG Resources Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report).Still Interested in Oil Stocks?Given the bearish oil pricing scenario, it shouldn't come as a surprise that most of the companies from this space are set to underperform in the near term. Furthermore, the Oil-Energy sector has a Zacks Sector Rankin the bottom 6% (15 out of 16), so there is little hope for a turnaround soon. (To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.)But if you are still looking to stay in this industry for a near term play, Range Resources Corp. (RRC  -  Free Report) may be a good selection. This company actually has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1148,SLB,"Oilfield service giant Schlumberger Limited’s (SLB  -  Free Report) recent decision to acquire 51% stake in Russian drilling service provider, Eurasia Drilling Company Limited, might hit a rough patch due to the political turmoil between US and Russia. The tensions erupted after new sanctions were imposed by the U.S.  government.About the SanctionsThe latest sanctions against Russia are the result of Moscow’s alleged interference in U.S. elections and target Russian energy export pipelines. The bill of the sanctions received major support from the Congress before it was signed by President Trump in Aug 2017. It bans U.S. entities from providing goods, information, services, technology and support to energy export pipelines of Russia.Their ImpactSchlumberger applied to the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) of Russia seeking approval for the purchase in Jul 2017, after shareholders of Eurasia Drilling agreed to sell Schlumberger 51% of the total issued shares. However, the new sanctions may create a trade war and affect Schlumberger’s future in Russia.In this context, we would like to remind investors that several other U.S. oil companies are also facing the uncertainty due to their link with Russia. For example, Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) have $37 billion investment lined up for the Tengiz oilfield in Kazakhstan, which uses a Russian pipeline.The Failed First AttemptWe note that the latest deal is Schlumberger's second attempt to invest in Eurasia Drilling. The company tried to buy 45.65% of Eurasia Drilling's stake for $1.7 billion in 2015. However, FAS objected to the same as the watchdog thought that the deal could help Schlumberger gain control of Russia's biggest oilfield service providing company. What’s Next?In the current scenario, Schlumberger will require a special approval from the U.S. Treasury. It’s only after the approval from the U.S. government that FAS will consider the deal. Even if the deal sees the green signal from the U.S. Treasury, Russia's Natural Resources Ministry is likely to impose limits on Schlumberger's ownership due to the industry's strategic importance for Russia. We note that a clause in the deal indicates that Schlumberger will receive full control of Eurasia Drilling after three years of operation.Importance of the Deal for SchlumbergerAlthough expanding shale production in North America is driving revenues, Schlumberger is facing pressure in international and offshore operations due to weak oil prices. Low oil price is acting as a hurdle for the company in Europe and Asia. The deal will help Schlumberger to penetrate these markets as it will renew the strategic alliance between Schlumberger and Eurasia Drilling that started in 2011.Completion of the deal will give Schlumberger access to Russia’s hydrocarbon industry, which has witnessed sustainable capital spending even in a low oil price environment. Also, Schlumberger can receive benefits from Eurasia Drilling's operations that include over 650 offshore and onshore rigs. In the second quarter of 2017, the Russian company had drilled 421 wells.About the CompanyHouston, TX-based Schlumberger is a leading oilfield services company, providing technology, project management and information services to the global oil and gas industry. Schlumberger’s reporting segments can be categorized under four segments: Reservoir Characterization, Drilling, Production and Cameron.The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Price Performance Schlumberger has lost 21% of its value in the last six month compared with 29.9% decline of its industry.

1149,SLB,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) reported a rise in rigs searching for crude in the country while rigs for natural gas declined.  DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the U.S. totaled 949 in the week ended Aug 11 – lower than the previous week’s 954. This shows that the total rig count in the country has declined for two weeks in a row.Since it hit an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in American shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 481.For the week in discussion, the decline in rig count can be attributed to lower onshore activity (now at 928 compared to last week’s 934). However, units engaged in offshore operations increased slightly to 18 counts from 17 in the prior week.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count jumped by three to 768. This emphasizes that the rigs exploring for crude rose again after last week’s fall. Also, the current tally, though far off from the peak of 1,609 attained in Oct 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 396.   Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – inched down for the seventh time in 14 weeks to 181 (a fall of eight rigs from the previous week). Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 83. As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 89% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs fell by one unit to 72, while the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) was down by six to 801.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count went up to 17 units – 15 of which were oil-directed – from 16 counts.Details of the Weekly Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, acts as an important yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count heavily weighs on the demand for energy services – drilling, completion, production, etc. – provided by companies like Halliburton Co. (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).ConclusionAlthough the number of rigs searching for natural gas in the U.S. declined from the prior week, the rig exploring for crude rose despite persistently weak oil prices. In other words, debt-laden shale drillers have proved that their operations are still profitable despite crude trading below the $50-per-barrel threshold.Let’s analyze the broader macro scenarios supporting shale players. OPEC and 11 non-OPEC players, including Russia, decided in the Vienna meeting on May 25, to extend the production cut deal until Mar 2018. Also, according to Saudi Arabia, there is a possibility of deeper production cut, if required, in the 173rd OPEC meeting on Nov 30, 2017. Thus, it is an ideal time for shale players to increase production at the expense of OPEC, especially because oil is trading way above the historical low of mid-February last year. No wonder, U.S. shale producers have again started gathering to oil patches as they aim to sell the commodity at higher prices.We should consider President Trump’s exit from Paris Climate accord as a factor encouraging drillers to continue pumping more oil. Now, it will be prudent to wait and watch whether shale drillers will continue to add rigs in oil resources.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1151,SLB,"We are entering the heart of the Q3 earnings season, with a host of S&P 500 members expected to come out with results by the end of next week.Picture Emerging Thus FarWe now have Q3 results from 52 S&P 500 members that combined account for 16.7% of the index’s total market capitalization. According to the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these companies are up 13.3% from the same period last year on 6.9% higher revenues, with 76.9% positive earnings surprises and 73.1% beating revenue estimates.At this stage, we don’t have any results from the ‘Energy’ sector. However, quite a few companies have earnings lined up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.Q3 Report Card: Oil and Gas Prices End on a Positive NoteOil: The U.S. oil benchmark wrapped up a strong quarter amid continued declines in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative.The rapid decline of oil inventories in recent months has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. Moreover, energy bodies OPEC and IEA both recently raised global oil demand forecasts for this year. Also, supply from the 14-member OPEC cartel is set to remain constraint for at least the next six months, helping to tighten the market significantly. Adding to the positive momentum, OPEC and Russia claimed to be on the right track in clearing the global oil glut with half the job done.With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, oil ended the third quarter at $51.67 per barrel, up about 10.5% sequentially. A year ago, crude futures hovered around $45 per barrel.Natural Gas: Natural gas fared badly, dropping about 3.5% in the July-September period, thanks to the fuel’s tepid demand on the back of mild weather conditions and hurricane-related power outages.Despite the sequential fall, natural gas prices are in a sweet spot compared to the corresponding period of 2016. The commodity futures ended the quarter at $3 per MMBtu, up more than 3% from the Sep 30, 2016 settlement of $2.9 per MMBtu.Energy Companies to Gain from Higher Prices: As we know, the profitability of energy companies is directly affected by fluctuations in oil and gas prices. Therefore, all oil/gas-related stocks stand to benefit from recovering commodity prices as they will be able to extract more value for their products.Year-over-Year Gain Leads to Bullish ExpectationsA look back at the Q2 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector were spectacular, driving the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index. The April-June 2017 period turned out to be a rather good one with earnings for the sector recording a massive 252.7% jump from the same period last year -- by far the highest growth among all sectors -- on 16.8% higher revenues.The picture looks rather encouraging for the Q3 earnings season as well. This is not surprising, considering that oil and gas are both averaging higher compared to the third quarter of 2016 when the energy companies reported unusually low bottom line.In fact, the strongest growth in Q3 is again set to come from the Energy sector. As per our expectations, earnings for the sector are expected to jump 122% from the third quarter of 2016, while the top line is likely to show an improvement of 16.3% from the year-ago levels.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Oct 23Let’s see what’s in store for three energy companies expected to come up with September-quarter numbers on Monday, Oct 23.First, we have major oilfield service provider Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), which is expected to report before the opening bell.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.As it is, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.In the previous quarter, Halliburton delivered a positive earnings surprise of 21.1%. Moreover, both Halliburton’s segments, Completion and Production as well as Drilling and Evaluation, reported revenues slightly better than our estimates thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America.When it comes to earnings surprises, the world's second-largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) has an incredible history. Investors should note that Halliburton hasn’t missed earnings estimates since mid-2014. And our model indicates that the company is likely to beat on earnings this time around too.For the quarter to be reported, this Houston, TX-headquartered company has an Earnings ESP of +0.18% and a Zacks Rank of 3, the right combination of the two key ingredients.Evidently, multiple tailwinds including the recovery in commodity prices have buoyed the entire space. With U.S. activity accelerating and margins set to remain strong, Halliburton’s underlying results are likely to come ahead of our expectations.As a proof of the resurgence in activities, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter Completion and Production revenue is pegged at $3,430 million, much higher than $3,132 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. Sales in the Drilling and Evaluation unit is forecasted to be $1,888 million, more than the prior quarter figure of $1,825.Our model predicted earnings beat earlier too. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an earnings ESP of +0.18% and carried a Zacks Rank #3.Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise  Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company QuoteHeadquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands, Core Laboratories N.V. (CLB  -  Free Report) is also set to report third-quarter 2017 results, after the closing bell. The company, which provides reservoir management and production enhancement services to the oil and gas industry on a global basis, has a good track of outperforming estimates in the last two quarters.But our model does not indicate that Core Laboratories is likely to beat on earnings this time around, as it has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.We note that the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 44 cents, which is 6 cents (or 15.8%) above from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $161 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 12.6%. However, we notice that the rate of growth may decelerate from the preceding quarter that saw 48.6% jump in the bottom line, while sales were up 10.8%. This could be attributed to the impact of Hurricane Harvey on the company’s Gulf Coast facilities.Core Laboratories N.V. Price and EPS Surprise  Core Laboratories N.V. Price and EPS Surprise | Core Laboratories N.V. QuoteThen there is Houston, TX-based Superior Energy Services Inc. (SPN  -  Free Report) coming up with July-September operational results Monday evening.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, Superior Energy Services – one of the largest diversified global oilfield service provider, offering drilling, completion and production-related services – has a good history. It went past the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four reports.But our model does not indicate that Superior Energy Services is likely to beat on earnings this time around, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -1.14%.With offshore exploration and drilling demand remaining muted, especially in international markets, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter Drilling Products & Services adjusted loss is $14.7 million, wider than the $12.4 million loss expected in the second quarter of 2017.Superior Energy Services, Inc.

1152,SLB,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported an increase in total rig counts in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count dents demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd.

(RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 931 in the week ended Dec 22 — higher than the prior week’s 930. This marked an increase after the tally declined for the week ended Dec 15.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 653.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs were 910, higher than 909. The tally for offshore and inland activities remained in line with the count for the week ended Dec 15.Two rigs operated in the inland waters last week, while 19 rigs worked offshore.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 747 was in line with the count for week ended Dec 15. Further, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 523.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count — which plunged to its lowest level last August — of 184, was up from 183 for the week ended Dec 15. Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 129.Per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 89% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 64 units increased from 60.

Naturally, the total oil and gas rig count has increased, primarily supported by the addition of four rigs in Cana Woodford shale and two rigs in the Barnett shale play. One rig was added in each of Permian and Williston basins, respectively.Overall crude pricing scenario has been healthy after the OPEC members agreed to extend the production curb deal beyond first-quarter 2018. Also, natural gas price recovered from historical low mark, touched last year.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NOG  -  Free Report) and Approach Resources, Inc. (AREX  -  Free Report). Northern Oil and Gas sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Approach Resources carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1153,SLB,"The energy sector has been attracting a lot of investor attention lately. Oil prices have been relatively stable lately, owing to the recent supply cut extension by OPEC.What Lies Ahead for Crude?OPEC recently extended its production cut till late 2018, in order to drive crude prices. Moreover, talks of OPEC working on an exit strategy for its supply cut have provided support to crude prices. Fading prospects of an abrupt end to the production cut deal when the excess inventories are cleared out led to a rally in crude prices.Moreover, crude inventories in the United States fell 6.5 million barrels in the week ending Dec 15, compared with analyst expectations of a decrease of 3.8 million barrels.However, there are increasing headwinds related to the future of crude oil. U.S. inventories have been extremely volatile and whether it will be able to stabilize the prices is still uncertain. Moreover, the U.K. North Sea pipeline is scheduled to restart in January. The North Sea pipeline carries around 450,000 barrels of crude per day to Britain and was closed after an inspection revealed a crack in an onshore section of the pipeline. This weighed on crude prices.Let us now discuss two ETFs focused on providing exposure to the sector.Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to energy stocks and tracks the Energy Select Sector Index.

The fund has lost 7.1% in a year and 5.2% year to date (as of Dec 21, 2017). IYE has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a High risk outlook.Bottom LineXLE is more popular than IYE, as is evident from its higher AUM. Moreover, XLE may be more appealing to investors owing to its cheaper expense ratio.  However, IYE has a more diversified exposure in terms of a number of holdings.At the same time, both the funds have had relatively similar performance. IYE has lost 0.5% more than XLE so far this year, whereas in a year, it lagged XLE by 1%. Although the future for this space is still uncertain, prices seem to be gaining some stability on latest developments in the sector. Although U.S. inventories continue to bother the markets, investors are optimistic about OPEC’s plans to avoid a sudden exit from its production cut plan.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1154,SLB,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported a decline in total rig counts in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count dents demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 930 in the week ended Dec 15 — lower than the prior week’s 931. This marked the decrease for the first time after the tally rose for five weeks in a row.Since the all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 637.For the week in discussion, the fall in rig count can be attributed to decreased offshore operations. The count of rigs engaged in offshore works fell from 20 to 19. The tally for onshore and inland activities remained in line with the count for the week ended Dec 8.Two rigs operated in the inland waters last week, while 909 rigs worked onshore.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 747 was lower than 751 in the prior week. However, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 510.       Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count — which plunged to its lowest last August — of 183, was up from 180 for the week ended Dec 8. Moreover, like oil, the rig count for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 126.        As per the latest report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is almost 89% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 60 units fell from 64.

The present count shows a decline from 20 units recorded in the week ended Dec 8.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil in the United States has decreased, while the same for natural gas went up. The total oil and gas rig count slipped, thanks to the removal of four rigs from Cana Woodford shale and three from the Permian basin.Rig counts have recently snapped a five-week streak of gains. However, it is difficult to say whether the tally will continue to fall in the coming weeks. This is because the crude pricing scenario is healthy and OPEC’s November production has touched a six-month low, per the monthly oil market report of the cartel.Two oil stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Northern Oil and Gas, Inc.

1155,SLB,"Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) will likely enter an agreement with Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) to explore prospective resources located off the coast of Brazil, per Reuters.Oil field service giant Schlumberger is expected to assist Chevron in the drilling of six wells in the Frade field, situated in the Campos basin. According to the source, the drilling operations will likely commence by early 2019 and will continue for 18 to 24 months.  The drilling activities will help the integrated energy player boost oil production in Brazil. In the country, the 2011 oil spill incident had forced Chevron to cut crude output from 36,400 barrels per day (bpd) to 12,500 bpd. Per the source, following the spill, almost 2,400 barrels of oil was released offshore Rio de Janeiro.San Ramon, CA-based Chevron, belonging to the Zacks Oil International Integrated industry, is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world, based on proved reserves.

1157,SLB,"Oil price worries have been rife this year despite the ongoing OPEC output cut. The prolonged travails of the commodity oil saw a short-lived reversal following the OPEC output cut deal signed late last year and the extension of the same this year. Against this backdrop, a close monitoring of the energy space that deals with the extraction of oil is warranted.Presently, the Zacks Industry Rank for oil service companies is in the bottom 17%. Thanks to a downbeat industry rank, energy investors should be on high alert this earnings season as everyone is keen on finding out where the space is heading. Let’s delve a little deeper into the earnings picture and see how things are shaping up for the space.In this piece, we have considered two stocks, namely – Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) and Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report). Among the duo, Halliburton reported earnings results on July 24 before the market opened while Schlumberger reported on July 21 (read: 7 ETF Areas to Hog the Limelight in 2017).Results in DetailHalliburton – the second largest oil service company – beat on both lines. Its adjusted income per share from continuing operations (excluding special items) came in at $0.23, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.19. Continued and effective cost management led to the outperformance. Halliburton posted revenues of $4.957 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.856 billion.Schlumberger – the world’s largest oilfield services provider – came up upbeat Q2 results. Earnings of $0.35 per share (excluding charges and credits) beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.30 and the year-ago figure of $0.23. Total revenue of $7.462 billion improved from the year-ago level of $7.164 billion but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.227 billion.Market ImpactThe space got mixed signals thanks to decent performances by industry bellwethers were outweighed by long-standing oil price worries. We would like to note that in the OPEC and non-OPEC meeting held this week, Saudi Arabia announced its plans to take further action to boost waning oil prices. The Saudi oil minister also noted that the country’s oil exports would be fixed to 6.6 million bpd, which reflects a decline of almost a million bpd from last year’s export level. With this, things might turn positive in the days to come, though we believe it is likely to take time.Still, investors might want to know the impact on ETFs that are heavily invested in these popular oil service companies. Below we highlight three oil-services ETFs with considerable allocation to SLB and HAL that could be in focus following oil-service earnings (see all energy ETFs here):iShares US Oil Equipment & Services ETF (IEZ  -  Free Report) This ETF invests about $195.3 million of assets in 35 securities, focusing solely on the energy world. The in-focus SLB takes up the first position here with 15.87% of holdings. Generally, when one stock accounts for as much as 20% of an ETF's weight, its individual performance decides much of the fund’s price movement. HAL takes up the second position with about 9.89% of total assets (read: Oil Refiner ETF (CRAK): A Star Pick Amid Weak Oil Price).VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF (OIH  -  Free Report) OIH invests $1.0 billion of assets in 26 holdings and devotes as much as 19.54% of the portfolio weight to SLB, followed by 14.70% in HAL.Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE  -  Free Report) XLE invests $15.4 billion of assets in 36 stocks. The fund puts 7.51% of the portfolio weight in SLB, followed by 3.09% in HAL.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

1158,SLB,"Shares of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) rose nearly 3% in pre-market trade, after the oilfield services behemoth reported better-than-expected second quarter profit thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America.Halliburton’s adjusted income per share from continuing operation (excluding special items) came in at 23 cents, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents – the twelfth consecutive quarterly outperformance. Moreover, revenues of $4,957 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,844 million.Oil services companies (like Halliburton) – providers of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells – are generally the first of the U.S. energy firms to kick off an earnings season. While the world’s biggest oilfield services company Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) came out with Jun numbers on Friday, Jul 21, the remaining two of the so-called Big Four oilfield service and equipment providers – Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) and Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report) – report second quarter earnings over the next few days.Halliburton Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Halliburton Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company QuoteNorth American Market Continues to Gather StrengthAlong the results, Halliburton also sounded optimistic in its view that the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing - particularly for pressure pimping. As it is, rig counts have generally been rising during the last one year since plunging to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, with the addition of a flood of new units. As a proof of the recovery, Halliburton grew its domestic land revenue by nearly 25% sequentially, ahead of the U.S. land rig count growth of 21%Additionally, the international market seems to have bottomed out, with regional sales rising 7% from the first quarter on heightened Latin American activity, together with increased well completion and drilling services in Europe and Africa. However, pricing pressure continued with the slowdown in Middle East stimulation services. Segmental PerformanceOperating income from the Completion and Production segment was $397 million, turning around from the year-ago loss of $32 million and the previous quarter’s income of $147 million, helped by strong pressure pumping activity and improved pricing in the U.S. land market.But Halliburton’s Drilling and Evaluation unit profit dropped – from $154 million in the second quarter of 2016 to $125 million this year and was only marginally ahead of the $122 million earned in the Mar quarter. The setback was on account of pricing pressure, partly offset by higher drilling activity in Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia, a seasonal rebound in the North Sea and Russia, plus increased fluid services in Asia Pacific.Balance SheetHalliburton’s capital expenditure in the second quarter was $327 million.As of Jun 31, 2017, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company had approximately $2,139 million in cash/cash equivalents and $10,816 million in long-term debt, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 54.7%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Stock PerformanceHalliburton has seen its shares fall 18.0% year to date after gaining more than 50% for 2016. Nevertheless, the company has managed to outperform the industry across the past six months- and 1-year periods.Let’s wait and see if the latest earnings beat can help the stock break out of sluggishness.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1159,SLB,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices logged handsome gains.On the news front, global energy provider Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) agreed to buy electric car charging network owner NewMotion, while American supermajor Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) dumped plans to drill in the Great Australian Bight.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures jumped about 4.4% to close at $51.45 per barrel, while natural gas prices gained 4.8% to $3 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: CVX Starts Wheatstone Production, PSX Approves $3B Buyback.)The U.S. oil benchmark registered its best close of the month after the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles fell unexpectedly as refinery throughput rose.The bullish impact from the surprise crude inventory draw was supported by other developments including strong Chinese data, mounting tensions between Iraq and Kurdistan near an oil-rich region, President Trump’s decision not to certify Iran’s compliance with the nuclear deal, and a falling U.S. rig count.Meanwhile, natural gas futures finished higher following an in-line increase in supplies. Current stocks, at 3.595 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), are now 8 Bcf (0.2%) under the five-year average, while dropping 153 Bcf (4.1%) below the year-ago figure.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    European oil giant Royal Dutch Shell plc recently inked a deal to acquire NewMotion, one of Europe's largest electric vehicles charging networks.Per the deal, NewMotion will retain its brand and operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Shell. NewMotion has around 30,000 private electric charge points in the Netherlands, Germany, France and UK. It also runs around 50,000 public charge points in various countries in Europe for over 100,000 customers.With this deal, Shell wants to cash in on the wide acceptance of the electric cars and thereby increase its customer base and revenues. Shell believes that the deal will provide customers range of re-fueling choices in future and bring diversification to its asset portfolio.By 2025, Shell aims to attain 20% of its global fuel station sales from electric vehicles recharging and alternative and low carbon fuels like biofuels, battery recharging and liquefied natural gas. The company will invest approximately $1 billion per year till 2020 in its New Energies division as it intends to shift its focus on cleaner and renewable energy sources. (Read more Shell Clinches Maiden EV Deal, Acquires NewMotion)2.    U.S. oil and gas biggie Chevron Corporation recently announced plans to discontinue the exploration drilling program in the Great Australian Bight (GAB). The company purchased two deepwater exploration permits in 2013 with the acreage spanning more than 32,000 square kilometers. Chevron intended to drill four wells but has decided not to proceed with the plans owing to weak oil price environment.The supermajor’s decision to exit the region is not based on waning prospects or regulatory and environmental concerns but has been guided by commercial factors. Deepwater/ultra deepwater drilling — with its associated risks and steep costs — requires much higher oil prices than the current rates. Thus, with oil rates unable to stay above the psychologically-critical $50 threshold for a sustained period, the project did not seem to be a viable one.The move underscores Chevron’s strategy of balancing its global portfolio with its long-term business priorities. It will help the company to slash costs and streamline business models. The company wants to focus on the development of offshore natural gas resources in Western Australia. It recently increased its North-West gas acreage by acquiring three exploration blocks spanning 23,170sqkm in the Northern Carnarvon Basin off Dampier. Chevron invested billions of dollars in Western Australia to commercialize its large gas resource base through its two mega projects — Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG project — in the region. (Read more Chevron Calls Off Great Australian Bight Drilling Program)3.    Cheniere Energy Partners, L.P. (CQP  -  Free Report) — a subsidiary of liquefied natural gas exporter Cheniere Energy, Inc. (LNG  -  Free Report) — recently announced the completion of its fourth liquefaction train at Louisiana facility.Construction of the Train 4 of the Sabine Pass liquefaction project was completed by the contractor Bechtel Oil, Gas and Chemicals, Inc. On completion, Bechtel handed over custody of the train to Cheniere Energy Partners which is ready to operate. Train 4 is set for first commercial delivery in March 2018 under a 20-year sale and purchase contract with GAIL (India) Limited. With the completion of Train 4, revenues of the partnership are likely to benefit from increased LNG sales.Cheniere Energy Partners intends to construct six liquefaction trains at Sabine Pass. Each train has an estimated nominal production capacity of 4.5 million tons per annum of liquefied natural gas. Construction of the Trains 1, 2 and 3 had been completed in March. First commercial delivery for Train 3 took place in June under a 20-year supply contract with Korea Gas Corporation.The partnership’s request for regulatory approvals in March to commence commissioning activities at Train 4 has been granted.  With the completion of the Train 4 on Oct 9, the total capacity at the export terminal has risen from 13.5 million tons per annum (Mtpa) to 18 Mtpa. Train 5 is under construction and is expected to begin exporting in the second half of 2019. Train 6 is being commercialized and has secured the necessary regulatory approvals. (Read more Cheniere Energy's Sabine Pass Train 4 Comes Online)4.    A cloud of uncertainty looms over Brazilian energy giant Petrobras’ (PBR  -  Free Report) divestment agreement with France-based TOTAL S.A. The Brazilian federal court has put a partial hold on the $2.2-billion deal signed in March.Per the deal, Petrobras was to sell some of its upstream and downstream assets to TOTAL. On the upstream front, TOTAL was to purchase stakes in the Lapa and Lara offshore prospects in the Santos Basin. The company was to acquire a 35% interest in the Lapa field and a 22.5% stake in Lara field. On the downstream end, TOTAL was to acquire a 50% interest in two thermal co-generation plants in the Bahia area and a re-gasification unit in the LNG terminal.However, a federal court in Brazil has blocked the sale of Petrobras’ stakes in the Lapa and Lara oilfields. The judge granted a ruling in favor of members of a local oil workers union who raised anti-competitive concerns pertaining to the sale. The members of the union were of the opinion that the company should have opted for a public tender instead of a private negotiation.Petrobras announced that it has not received any notice regarding the same. The company declared that it will take necessary legal steps to protect the interest of shareholders only after receiving an official statement from the court. (Read more Petrobras' $2.2B Asset Sale to TOTAL Shelved on Court Order)5.    London-based oil and gas producer Tullow Oil plc (TUWOY  -  Free Report) recently declared that it has bought a 90% stake in Ivory Coast's four onshore blocks. These are located on the coastline to the west of Abidjan. The rest 10% of the onshore blocks are held by Petroci, the national oil company of the country.The acquisition is in line with the company's strategy of focusing on value-enhancing growth. Tullow bought stakes in CI 518, CI519, CI301 and CI302 blocks spreading over 5,035 square kilometers. The Anglo-Irish firm has plans to start work in the blocks shortly so that a full tensor gradiometry survey process can begin by early 2018. The result from the survey will help the company to determine the potential of the acquired blocks. In addition, Tullow expects the cost of production from the blocks to be low and will enrich the company's existing exploration portfolio.The company has a 20-year presence in Ivory Coast. We would like to remind investors that the company currently has non-operating stakes in Ivory Coast's offshore Espoir field, where Canadian Natural Resources Limited) is the major shareholder and operator. Tullow receives net production of 4,000 barrels of oil per day from Espoir. (Read more Tullow to Gain from Ivory Coast Onshore Block Acquisition)Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of some the major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last six months.CompanyLast Week Last 6 MonthsXOM+0.5%+1.7%CVX+0.5%+13.2%COP-0.6%+1.6%OXY+0.6%+1%SLB-2.5%-15%RIG+3%-8.4%VLO+1.1%+19.1%ANDV0%+31.6%Notwithstanding the bullish oil market sentiment, the Energy Select Sector SPDR, a popular way to track energy companies, failed to keep up and generated -0.7% returns last week. The worst performer was oilfield services behemoth Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), the stock of which fell by 2.5%.Longer-term, over the last six months, the sector tracker is down 1.6%. It was again Schlumberger that was the major laggard during this period, experiencing a 15% price decline.What’s Next in the Energy World?As usual, market participants will be closely tracking the regular releases i.e. the U.S. government statistics on oil and natural gas, one of the few solid indicators that comes out regularly. Energy traders will also be focusing on the Baker Hughes data on rig count.Finally, the 2017 Q3 earnings will remain under scrutiny this week, with the oil services companies, providers of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells, kicking off what is expected to be a good earnings season for U.S. energy firms.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2%, respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1160,SLB,"Oilfield service giant Schlumberger Limited’s (SLB  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings of 35 cents per share (excluding charges and credits) beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 30 cents and the year-ago figure of 23 cents.  The company reported total revenue of $7,462 million, which improved from the year-earlier level of $7,164 million and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,258 million.The strong results were driven by a rebound in drilling activities in Russia and the North Sea. Higher demand for directional drilling techniques, especially in the domestic onshore market, also supported the numbers.Schlumberger is the first among the “Big Four” oilfield service and equipment providers to release its quarterly results. The other players – Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) and Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report) – will report second-quarter results next week.Segmental PerformanceEach of the groups – Reservoir Characterization, Drilling Group and Production Group – registered a year-over-year increase in revenues.Drilling Group revenues increased primarily on contributions from the international market. Rebound in seasonal works in Russia and the North Sea contributed to growth. Higher demand for directional drilling techniques, especially in the domestic onshore market, also supported the top line. However, the positives were partially negated by reduced operations related to the offshore market in the Gulf of Mexico.Results at the Production Group were positively impacted by higher hydraulic fracturing work in the domestic land market. Pricing recovery in the North American land areas, improved unconventional land works in Argentina along with higher activities in China and Russia were also led to the improvement. Meanwhile, a decrease in production at the SPM Shushufindi development partially offset the positives.The Reservoir Characterization segment was supported by strong contributions from the international market. Surge in sales of WesternGeco multiclient seismic license along with higher contributions from drillstem test operations in the UAE led to better results. Higher wireline revenues from the North Sea and Russia also favored the business unit.  Reservoir Characterization: This group posted revenues of $1,759 million as against $1,586 million in the prior-year quarter. Pre-tax operating income was $299 million, up 12% year over year. Drilling Group: Revenues of $2,107 million rose 4% year over year. Pre-tax operating income was $302 million, up 77% year over year.Production Group: Revenues recorded by this group increased 18% from the year-earlier quarter to $2,496 million. Pre-tax operating income skyrocketed 170% year over year to $221 million.Cameron Group: This segment generated revenues of $1,265 million, down 17% year over year. Pre-tax operating income plunged 30% from the prior-year comparable period to $174 million.FinancialsAs of Jun 30, 2017, the company had approximately $6,218 million in cash and short-term investments and $16,600 million in long-term debt. This represents a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 32%. In the April-to-June quarter, the company repurchased 5.5 million shares. Q2 Price Performance   During second quarter of 2017, Schlumberger’s decline of 15.7% is in-line with the industry it belongs to.GuidanceDuring 2017, the company reaffirmed its decision to invest $2.2 billion, slightly higher than $2.1 billion spent in 2016.The oilfield service player expects healthy activity in North America during the second half of this year. Also, in some of the international markets, Schlumberger anticipates projects and drilling activity to pick up pace. Key DevelopmentIn a separate announcement, the company declared its intention to buy a 51% equity stake in Eurasia Drilling Company Limited.Zacks RankSchlumberger currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1161,SLB,"To finish off this first busy week of Q2 earnings season — and with a lack of new economic headlines and/or tweets from the President this morning — perhaps we’re best served with a quick run-down of earnings reports ahead of today’s opening bell. We also look for an 11th straight day of gains on the Nasdaq, which would be the longest such stretch in 8 years.General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) posted beats on its Q2 top and bottom lines this morning, with 28 cents per share topping the Zacks consensus by 3 cents, and revenues of $29.56 billion surpassing the $29.13 billion expected. This marks the 4th earnings beat in the last 5 quarters for GE (that 5th quarter was a meet, not a miss), and the company has reiterated its fiscal 2017 guidance. GE also announced that incoming CEO John Flannery will be taking over for Jeff Immelt as of August 1st, and will secure the reins to the Chairmanship as of the first of the year.Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated Honeywell (HON  -  Free Report) modestly beat estimates on the bottom line to $1.80 per share. $10.08 billion in quarterly sales also topped expectations. The New Jersey-based industrial major raised its fiscal 2017 guidance, and this Q2 earnings report also represents the 4th beat in the last 5 quarters (the 5th quarter was also a meet, not a miss).Oil & gas services major Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report) handily outperformed estimates on both top and bottom lines, with 35 cents a share beating the Zacks consensus by 5 cents and revenues of $7.46 billion surpassing the $7.26 billion expected. The company’s Drilling business was up 77% in the quarter, and its Production Group income rose 170% year over year.Fifth Third Bank (FITB  -  Free Report) put up mixed Q2 results this morning, topping estimates by 4 cents to 46 cents per share but with a miss on the top-line: $1.50 billion in revenues compared with the $1.53 billion expected. Higher net interest income and lower provisions for loan and lease losses — down 43% — were the quarterly highlights. Fifth Third has beaten earnings estimates in 3 of its last 4 quarters.Railroad major Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) posted a strong Q2 before today’s opening bell, with earnings of $1.45 per share beating the Zacks consensus by 8 cents — +24% year over year — on quarterly sales of $5.25 billion that outpaced the estimate of $5.16 billion. Freight revenues grew 11% overall, with Operating Income up 21% to $2 billion. The company also bought back $850 million in KSU shares in the quarter.Posting a real blow-out quarter this morning is Encana (ECA  -  Free Report), the Calgary, Alberta, Canada-based natural gas E&P firm, which blew away expectations on both top and bottom lines. Its 18 cents per share more than quadrupled the 4 cents anticipated, on sales of $1.08 billion that easily topped the $773 million in the Zacks consensus. This revenue beat represents 197.5% growth year over year. Operating costs fell 16% since this time a year ago. We expect an upgrade to its current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) based on this stellar quarterly performance.

We also look for an 11th straight day of gains on the Nasdaq, which would be the longest such stretch in 8 years.General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) posted beats on its Q2 top and bottom lines this morning, with 28 cents per share topping the Zacks consensus by 3 cents, and revenues of $29.56 billion surpassing the $29.13 billion expected. This marks the 4th earnings beat in the last 5 quarters for GE (that 5th quarter was a meet, not a miss), and the company has reiterated its fiscal 2017 guidance. GE also announced that incoming CEO John Flannery will be taking over for Jeff Immelt as of August 1st, and will secure the reins to the Chairmanship as of the first of the year.Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated Honeywell (HON  -  Free Report) modestly beat estimates on the bottom line to $1.80 per share. $10.08 billion in quarterly sales also topped expectations. The New Jersey-based industrial major raised its fiscal 2017 guidance, and this Q2 earnings report also represents the 4th beat in the last 5 quarters (the 5th quarter was also a meet, not a miss).Oil & gas services major Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report) handily outperformed estimates on both top and bottom lines, with 35 cents a share beating the Zacks consensus by 5 cents and revenues of $7.46 billion surpassing the $7.26 billion expected. The company’s Drilling business was up 77% in the quarter, and its Production Group income rose 170% year over year.Fifth Third Bank (FITB  -  Free Report) put up mixed Q2 results this morning, topping estimates by 4 cents to 46 cents per share but with a miss on the top-line: $1.50 billion in revenues compared with the $1.53 billion expected. Higher net interest income and lower provisions for loan and lease losses — down 43% — were the quarterly highlights. Fifth Third has beaten earnings estimates in 3 of its last 4 quarters.Railroad major Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) posted a strong Q2 before today’s opening bell, with earnings of $1.45 per share beating the Zacks consensus by 8 cents — +24% year over year — on quarterly sales of $5.25 billion that outpaced the estimate of $5.16 billion. Freight revenues grew 11% overall, with Operating Income up 21% to $2 billion. The company also bought back $850 million in KSU shares in the quarter.Posting a real blow-out quarter this morning is Encana (ECA  -  Free Report), the Calgary, Alberta, Canada-based natural gas E&P firm, which blew away expectations on both top and bottom lines. Its 18 cents per share more than quadrupled the 4 cents anticipated, on sales of $1.08 billion that easily topped the $773 million in the Zacks consensus. This revenue beat represents 197.5% growth year over year. Operating costs fell 16% since this time a year ago. We expect an upgrade to its current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) based on this stellar quarterly performance.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author? Click here>>

1164,SLB,"Analysts have made their predictions. Now it’s time for the actual results. Energy infrastructure provider Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) kicked off the energy earnings season when it reported second quarter results yesterday after the market close.Now, it’s the turn of the oil services companies – providers of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells – to come out with Apr-Jun numbers, which are likely to provide a better understanding of the sector’s prospects in the near future. In particular, key oil services earnings scheduled for release over this week and the next, including Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) and Halliburton Co. (HAL  -  Free Report), assume greater significance.The world’s largest oilfield services provider Schlumberger is scheduled to report on Jul 21, while smaller rival Halliburton will release its second quarter earnings report on Monday, Jul 24. As such, this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock. Both of them carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Let’s dive in.Schlumberger and Halliburton are both major players in the Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, which is ranked a lowly 208 out of the 256 industries in our coverage (bottom 19%). The broader Oil-Energy sector of which it is a part, is also staring down the barrel - currently sitting at the bottom of the Zacks Sector Rank (16 out of 16). (To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.)Price PerformanceSchlumberger and Halliburton shares have suffered this year, as have shares of all oil-related companies, to reflect the commodity's price slide and uneven outlook. That said, both have done better than their peers. While the Zacks Oil and Gas – Field Services Industry has lost -28.4%, Halliburton is down by just -15.7% year to date and Schlumberger has witnessed its share price decrease by -19.7% since Jan.Earnings History and ESPHalliburton has an incredible history when it comes to beating earnings estimates. Investors should note that Halliburton hasn’t missed earnings estimates since mid-2014. As far as recent history is concerned, the TX-based firm delivered earnings beat in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 68.49%. On the other hand, Schlumberger has delivered positive surprises in just two of the prior four quarters with an average earnings surprise of a modest 4.55%.The situation does not change when considering Earnings ESP values as well, with Halliburton clocking in at +15.79% while Schlumberger’s reading stands at +3.33%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Dividend YieldSchlumberger’s dividend yield over the last one-year period is 2.97%, higher than the broader industry’s figure of 2.12%. With a dividend yield of 1.58% Halliburton shareholders earn significantly lower dividend yield than Schlumberger as well as the industry at large.ValuationCompared with the S&P 500, the Oil and Gas – Field Services industry is undervalued. This implies that the industry has the potential to gain in the near future. The industry has an average trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio – which is often used to value oil and gas stocks, given their significant debt levels and high depreciation and amortization expenses – of 8.56, which is below the S&P 500 average of 11.01. Hence, it might be a good idea not to stay away from stocks belonging to this industry.Coming to the two stocks under consideration, with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 34.16 Halliburton is overvalued compared to the S&P 500 and the industry. However, though Schlumberger also looks pricey compared to the industry and the S&P 500, with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 11.69, it defeats Halliburton decisively.Investment StyleAccording to the Zacks style score system, Halliburton has a Value Score of D, Growth Score of A and Momentum Score of A. This stock is therefore most suitable for growth and momentum investors.Schlumberger has a Value Score of D, Growth Score of C and Momentum Score of F, which means that the stock is best avoided.Other MetricsSchlumberger’s expected EPS growth for (3–5 years) is 16.10%. This is better than Halliburton’s growth rate of 8.00%.Also, beta for Schlumberger is 1.02, which shows marginally less volatility than Halliburton’s beta of 1.04.Net profit margin for Schlumberger is 4.95%. This is way better than Halliburton’s net profit margin of -0.29%.Also, Schlumberger has a lower leverage as evident by its debt-to-equity ratio of 0.40 compared with Halliburton’s ratio of 1.20.ConclusionThe comparative analysis shows Halliburton has witnessed a more favorable share price movement throughout the year, possesses a fantastic surprise history, which means it is more predictable, and boasts of a better style score. Additionally, it carries a much higher ESP reading of +15.79%, as against Schlumberger’s figure of +3.33%However, Schlumberger is superior when considering dividend yield and valuation. Moreover, when considering EPS growth, profit margin and debt load, Schlumberger is clearly a better stock.3 Top Picks to Ride the Hottest Tech TrendZacks just released a Special Report to guide you through a space that has already begun to transform our entire economy...

1165,SLB,"The Q2 earnings season is slowly picking up pace, with results from 54 S&P 500 members, that account for more than 16.9% of the index’s total market capitalization, already out.The Picture So FarAs per the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these companies rose 11.9% from the same period last year on 5.5% higher revenues, with 79.6% beating earnings and 72.2% trumping revenue estimates.Energy to Outshine Other SectorsWe have divided the S&P 500 Index into 16 Zacks Sectors. As per our report, among all the sectors, Oil/Energy is likely to be the biggest growth driver. While six of the sectors are projected to report a drop in year-over-year earnings, many are expected to see a slight hike. Meanwhile, the energy sector is likely to outperform the rest with year-over-year earnings growth of 276.2%. This will also mark a massive improvement from the last quarter‘s staggering earnings decline of 654.8%.Research shows that during Q2, the Oil/Energy sector will likely generate quarterly earnings of $10.7 billion, much higher than $4.4 billion recorded during the April-to-June quarter of 2016. Overall, the sector has been showing a steady improvement in the bottom line since 2016.Healthy Oil & Gas Performance in Q2The oil and gas pricing scenario in second-quarter 2017 was much better than the year-ago comparable period.Hopes of OPEC’s production cut deal extension was the prime factor driving the year-over-year hike in prices during April and almost the entire of May. Market anticipations proved somewhat correct as OPEC and 11 non-OPEC players, including Russia, decided to extend the production cut deal until Mar 2018 in the Vienna meeting.Natural gas also made a modest recovery in Q2 after the commodity hit its lowest annual average price in 2016 in almost 20 years.Oilfield Service & Energy Explorers to Watch for Earnings Let’s see what’s in store for two such companies expected to come up with second-quarter numbers on Jul 21. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up at their end.The world’s largest oilfield services company, Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) is expected to report results before the opening bell. Other major oil services firms like Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report) and Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), will report their earnings next week. Together, the firms are called the ‘big 4 oil service companies’.In the first quarter of 2017, this Houston, TX-based oilfield service provider reported in-line earnings, which was supported by improvement in production of the Kuwait and Egypt developments and increase in directional drilling works in North America.Our proven model shows that Schlumberger is likely to beat earnings because it has the combination of a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and Earnings ESP of +3.33%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Schlumberger N.V. Price and EPS Surprise  Schlumberger N.V. Price and EPS Surprise | Schlumberger N.V. QuoteBased in Calgary, Alberta, Encana Corporation (ECA  -  Free Report) is a focused pure-play natural gas exploration and production (E&P) company. It is the second largest gas producer in North America and holds a highly competitive land and resource position in a number of the region's most promising shale and tight gas resource plays.The company will also likely report its results before the opening bell. Last quarter, the explorer reported better-than-expected results following higher realized prices and reduced costs.However, an earnings beat is uncertain for Encana this time as it has an Earnings ESP of -25.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. While a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.

1166,SLB,"We have already seen a few releases from S&P 500 companies in the Q2 earnings season. Major oilfield services companies will start reporting results starting Jul 21. Although our report shows that the Oil/Energy sector might post the healthiest earnings performance among all the 16 Zacks sectors, the story for the Zacks categorized Oil & Gas-Field Services industry is somewhat different.The industry has been grappling with huge debt and low cash balances. On top of that, cash flow from core operations is getting weaker by the day. The April-to-June quarter of 2017 has not been able to reverse the unimpressive performance of the Oil & Gas-Field Services industry over the last few quarters. Most importantly, during Q2, the industry underperformed the S&P 500 index.About the Oil & Gas Field Services IndustryCompanies belonging to this industry primarily support drilling players in efficiently setting up oil and gas wells. These firms are mainly engaged in manufacturing, repairing and maintaining equipment required for pumping oil.Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) and Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report) are four premier oil field services companies. These companies are often referred to as the ‘Big Four.’Schlumberger, the largest player in the oilfield services industry, is expected to report Q2 earnings on Jul 21, while Halliburton – the second largest player in terms of market capitalization – will likely report on Jul 24. The companies carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) while the Earnings ESP for the respective firms are + 6.67% and +15.79%, respectively. Hence, our proprietary model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for the firms this quarter.Past Performances Lack LusterDeclining Cash Flow: The industry has not been performing well since the beginning of 2015. Our proprietary model shows that net cash flows from core operations in the industry has declined nearly 55% over the last two years.Huge Debt Load: The industry is faced with a high debt level. From $6000 million in long-term debts at the end of 2013, the level scaled to $8,500 at 2016-end. Also, cash balance declined substantially last year to slightly above $4,500 million.Industry Lags S&P 500 Pricing chart is generally referred to for analyzing the performance of any stock or industry over a period of time. The price chart clearly shows that the Oil & Gas-Field Services industry has underperformed the S&P 500 index throughout the second quarter.During the aforesaid period, the index rose 2.7% while the industry declined 15.6%. It is to be noted that in terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, the Oil & Gas-Field Services industry is among the weak performing industries. The industry is ranked #205 and lies in the bottom 20% of industries.What’s Behind the Bleak Scenario?Oil & Natural Gas Prices WeakOil and gas prices have been low for almost three years now and during second-quarter 2017, the prices of both the commodities slipped further. The prolonged weakness is owing to a persistently oversupplied commodity market.During the April-to-June quarter of this year, oil and natural gas prices fell 8.4% and 5%, respectively. Also, OPEC’s historical production cut extension deal until Mar 2018 has failed to drive oil.Natural gas is also an oversupplied commodity as is reflected by its inventory level of 2.816 tcf – as of Jun 23 – almost 7% higher than the five-year average mark (as per The U.S. Energy Information Administration).Oilfield Services Players at a DisadvantageDeclining oil and gas prices act as a deterrent for exploration and production companies as it affects the cashflow. In fact, many upstream companies are cutting down on their capital investment for exploitation activities which has led to a decline in proved reserves.These developments might reduce contracts for oilfield service companies.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

1167,SLB,"Major oilfield service provider Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 24.In the preceding three-month period, the Houston, TX-based company reported better-than-expected operating earnings on improved utilization from growing North American rig count.The world's second-largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) has an incredible history when it comes to beating earnings estimates. The company posted a positive earnings surprise in each of the last four quarters, the average being 68.49%. Investors should note that Halliburton hasn’t missed earnings estimates since mid-2014.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise  Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company QuoteFactors to Consider This QuarterDrilling activities have increased of late due to an improvement in North American land market. This is likely to help Halliburton witness higher revenues in the domestic markets. During the second quarter, the count of U.S. rigs have increased around 15% to 940. Over the last one year the U.S. rig count has increased around 116%. This increased rig count bodes well for the oilfield service player Halliburton. During the quarter, the international rig counts also rose by about 2%. Halliburton, which generated 48% of its total revenue from international operations in the last quarter, is likely to benefit from the higher international rig count.  President Trump’s exit from Paris Climate accord also provided an impetus to drilling activities.Moreover, the company’s new CEO, Jeff Miller, is contemplating about raising the company’s various services rates, which are likely to boost the revenues of the company. Halliburton expects the prices to increase by at least 10% and in some cases 20% or more this year.During the quarter, the company acquired the Tulsa-based Summit ESP. We expect Halliburton to gain from this acquisition given that devices manufactured by Summit ESP are in high demand and are being utilized by upstream energy players for extending the life of shale wells. The development is likely to help the company to earn significant cash flow for stockholders. However, the cost of acquisition may weigh on the financials of the company in the quarter. As it is, the company has weak financials with high debt and low cash reserves.We appreciate Halliburton’s successful cost-management initiatives in the midst of weak oil prices. However, with the rise in North America’s shale oil patch activities, the company is actively engaged in increasing its headcount. Halliburton has increased its active fleet by 30%, which required the company to increase employment by more than one-third of its workforce to 2,700 workers in the Permian Basin. The increased costs on this account might adversely effect earnings.Further, weaknesses in oil and gas prices could mar demand for oilfield services. During the second quarter, oil and natural gas prices fell 8.4% and 5%, respectively. Lower commodity prices might lead to reduced exploration and production activities. This could lead to lower investments by oil majors which will impact revenues of the oilfield services companies. This is also reflected in the share price of Halliburton which witnessed a decline of around 14% in the second quarter.Halliburton Company Price  Halliburton Company Price | Halliburton Company QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Halliburton is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +15.79%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 22 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 19 cents.Zacks Rank: Halliburton, under the Zacks categorized Oil and Gas - Field Services  industry, currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Please note that we caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Halliburton, here are some energy firms in the same industry you can consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to beat estimates this quarter:ProPetro Holding Corp.(PUMP  -  Free Report) is anticipated to release earnings on Aug 8.

1168,SLB,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services Baker Hughes Inc. reported a record high for rigs searching for crude in the country while rigs for natural gas declined.  DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production in the U.S. totaled 952 for the week ended Jul 14, 2017. The count is in line with the previous week’s count. Last week, the count increased after the number of rigs in the country fell – following 23 successive increases – during the week ended Jun 30, 2017.Since plunging to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in American shale production. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 447.For the week in discussion, the in-line rig count could be attributed to higher onshore activity (now at 928 compared to last week’s 927), while units engaged in offshore operations remained flat at 21. However, rigs involved in inland waters fell by one unit.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count jumped by two to 765. Most importantly, this emphasizes the highest mark for oil rig count since Apr 2015. Also, the current tally, though far off from the peak of 1,609 attained in Oct 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 357. Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – inched down for the fifth time in 14 weeks to 187 (a fall of two rigs from the previous week). Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 89. As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is languishing nearly 89% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs rose by two units to 76, while the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) was down by two to 876.   Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count was flat at 21 – 18 of which were oil-directed.Details of the Weekly Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, acts as an important yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count heavily weighs on the demand for energy services – drilling, completion, production, etc. – provided by companies like Halliburton Co. (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).ConclusionAlthough the number of rigs searching for natural gas in the U.S. fell from the prior week, the rig exploring for crude reached a historical high despite persistently weak oil prices. In other words, shale drillers have proved that their operations are still profitable despite crude trading slightly above the $45-per-barrel level. Let’s analyze the broader macro scenarios supporting the shale players. OPEC and 11 non-OPEC players, including Russia, decided in the Vienna meeting on May 25, to extend the production cut deal until Mar 2018. Thus, it is an ideal time for shale players to increase production at the expense of OPEC, especially because oil is trading way above the historical low of last February. No wonder, U.S. shale producers have again started gathering to oil patches as they aim to sell the commodity at higher prices.We should consider President Trump’s exit from Paris Climate accord as a factor encouraging drillers to continue pumping more oil. Now, it will be prudent to wait and watch whether shale drillers continue to add rigs in oil resources.Till then, in case you are looking for energy names for your portfolio, one could opt for Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ  -  Free Report). It has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Calgary, Alberta-based Canadian Natural Resources is engaged in the acquisition, development and exploitation of crude oil and natural gas properties.

Price and EPS Surprise  Schlumberger N.V. Price and EPS Surprise | Schlumberger N.V. QuoteFactors to ConsiderSchlumberger is the largest oilfield services player in the world and is present in every energy market across the world. In all its operating business segments, the company maintains its position as one of the players. Given its size, attractive reservoir and well-established technology, the company is likely to outperform peers. We appreciate the company’s greater reliance on international market where operations are expected to get a boost in late 2017 to 2018. Although, activities outside the U.S. have hit fresh lows in the first quarter but in the long run, Schlumberger is expected to gain from its international operations.However, weaknesses in oil and gas prices could mar demand for oilfield services by upstream energy companies. During the April-to-June quarter of this year, oil and natural gas prices fell 8.4% and 5%, respectively. Lower commodity prices might lead to reduced exploration and production activities. This could call for lower investments by oil majors which will impact revenues of the company.Price Performance in Q2During the quarter, Schlumberger’s share price have lost 12.6% compared with the 15.1% decline of the Zacks categorized Oil and Gas – Field Services industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Schlumberger is likely to beat earnings this quarter.
