1,BAX,"Motivated by a goal to create meaning in his work, Edwards Lifesciences (EW) CEO Mike Mussallem pushed boundaries to follow his passion for helping people live their best lives.In the process, Mussallem and his team have transformed Edwards into the global leader in patient-focused innovations for structural heart disease, as well as critical care and surgical monitoring.Mussallem believes the key to a leader's success is finding meaning in work.""When I talk to folks that are developing leaders, I strongly encourage people to find meaning in their work because it allows you to be your best and might even surprise you in terms of how much impact you can have,"" Mussallem told IBD.For Mussallem, the meaning in his work is ""to impact individual patients with life-changing and lifesaving technologies.""Such thinking has been the driving force behind Edwards' ""patient first"" culture and innovation strategy. And it's led to Edwards' introduction of lifesaving and life-sustaining therapies such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), rapid-deployment surgical heart valve replacement and noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring.But it took Mussallem some soul searching to identify his true calling.""Early on I worked to try to pull myself up; I helped to pay for my education by working in the steel mills,"" he said. ""At that time in my younger years, I was probably more focused on how big my paycheck was and how good the benefits were. It probably wasn't until I joined health care in 1979 that I started thinking about doing something that really mattered to people's lives.""Mussallem's leadership role at Edwards traces back to his career at Baxter International (BAX), where he started working in 1979. He held a number of posts there, including group vice president of its cardiovascular division from 1994 to 2000.Mussallem was part of a group at Baxter that in the 1990s proposed the cardiovascular division could innovate faster and better serve patients if it spun out as an independent company. That happened on April 3, 2000, when Edwards Lifesciences was established and began life as a public company. Mussallem is the first and only chairman and CEO Edwards has had as a stand-alone company.Thanks to ongoing innovation, guided by Mussallem's passion for helping improve and save patients' lives, Edwards' position in the medical technology industry has skyrocketed. Edwards is the leader in surgical and transcatheter heart valves, says Glenn Novarro, an analyst and managing director at RBC Capital Markets.The reasons: ""They have the best technology, and they invest the most of any med tech company in heart valves,"" Novarro told IBD. ""And they're always first to market.""Edwards and his team have propelled impressive financial growth and gained the attention of investors.In each of the last 10 years, Edwards' top line has grown more than 10%. Its stock price has gone from 3.438 (split-adjusted) at its IPO on April 3, 2000, to 136.67 on April 3, 2018, a gain of 3,875.3%.""I learned a lot over the years by doing,"" he said. ""More and more I found that having a great culture is what first and foremost underpins the success of the company, especially when the culture drives the real purpose of the company. I feel like it's the driver of a lot of our success, and it gives me great comfort that we are all aligned.""Edwards' culture is grounded in a patient focus, says Mussallem. Edwards has an opportunity to be close to patients. Each one of its heart valves has a unique serial number that Edwards can trace back to the people who handmade and inspected the valve. Edwards often has reunions for the patients and the teams who made their individual valves.""You can imagine what that does for our team,"" he said. ""It reinforces the importance of people's work.""Adds Novarro: ""This is his passion. He puts everything into this company. That's why he is a great leader. Most successful CEOs are passionate. Mike takes it to another level. It's not just Edwards that is his passion. What Edwards does for patients (also) is his passion.""Mussallem says the company doesn't try to solve every health care problem. ""We stay very focused on structural heart disease and critical care medicine. We feel like these patients could be better served than they are today, and there are big opportunities to apply technology to improve their care.""We like to focus on bold innovations, literally breakthrough technologies that are transformative to existing care. And when we get that right, we can add a lot of value for patients.""For Edwards, the big groundbreaker has been its pioneering efforts to bring transcatheter aortic valve replacement to market, which in turn, has led to a major transformation of the company.""It's abundantly clear that in the 18 years that Edwards has been a public company, Mike not only has thoughtfully reshaped the company's post spinoff portfolio by divesting and acquiring, but also has clearly demonstrated visionary insight about how and where to innovate — brilliantly — in the complex medical device space with the company's TAVR/structural heart initiatives."" Rick Wise, senior medical technology analyst and a managing director at Stifel, told IBD.Mussallem saw a big opportunity with TAVR, despite the fact it might cannibalize the company's existing leading products.""We were, and continue to be, the leader in surgical heart valves, and TAVR was such a radical idea and most of our customers would discourage us,"" said Mussallem. ""The rationale was that if someone was going to disrupt our core business, my feeling was that it must be us. We had to be the ones. No one else could pursue this radical idea.""We worked very hard to develop this therapy. It was not simple or linear. But we persisted because the promise for patients was so powerful. It was the first time in my career I had a chance to experience in a significant way what I call a triple win — improve mortality, improve the quality of life for patients and improve economics for the health care system.""The Edwards SAPIEN family of transcatheter aortic heart valves and their delivery systems are used to treat heart valve disease using catheter-based approaches for certain patients for whom traditional open-heart surgery isn't optimal, the company says. Delivered while the heart is beating, these valves can enable patients to have a better quality of life sooner than those receiving traditional surgical therapies.To motivate and guide employees, Mussallem and his team have developed a ""secret sauce,"" of principles. With an eye always on patient needs, Mussallem encourages his team to dream big, not be afraid of failure and learn from mistakes.Mussallem developed his leadership and management principles from many sources. While at Baxter, Mussallem gained confidence in his skills.""One of the lessons I learned was not to be afraid of difficult jobs,"" he said. ""Often if a job is not high profile or involves taking over an underperforming business or function, it isn't seen as glamorous. But it is an opportunity for someone to get significant responsibility and demonstrate their own ability to add value.""That lesson helped Mussallem support the decision to spin off as an independent company the cardiovascular division of Baxter, for which Mussallem was responsible. At the time, the cardiovascular business was the poorest performer in the Baxter portfolio, he says. It had a low growth rate, low profitability and an uncertain future.""We had a lot of hard work to do in those early years,"" he said. ""But the team stayed optimistic. And over time we were able to sharpen our strategy and seriously invest in new innovation. We were able to completely change the profile of the company.""Another element of the strategy that has been a priority is leadership.""We feel like we should try and be the best in what we do,"" he adds. ""I'm proud that over 98% of what Edwards sells is in the No. 1 global position.""Mussallem, 65, was born and grew up in Gary, Ind. He earned a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 1974.After graduation, he worked at Union Carbide as a chemical engineer making Prestone antifreeze. But over time he realized he could be doing something more fulfilling — changing people's lives — and then went into health care.He developed many of his personal values and passion for innovation in his younger years.""I've never been one to be afraid to take on a challenge,"" he said. ""I was fortunate to have loving parents who, like others, lived their life to give their children a better life. I always felt a responsibility to do my best. I believe our company has many of those same ideas.""Transformed Edwards into the global leader and innovator for structural heart diseaseOvercame: Risky business decision to spin off Edwards from Baxter to develop complex therapies.Lesson: Find meaning in your work ""because it allows you to be your best and might even surprise you in terms of how much impact you can have.""

5,BAX,"Medical supplier stocks collectively toppled to a 10-month low intraday Tuesday with Becton Dickinson (BDX) among the biggest losers after reports emerged that Amazon.com (AMZN) is planning to sell supplies to hospitals.X But analysts largely doubted Amazon could put pressure on manufacturers of ""higher tech"" products, including implantable devices.This would insulate companies like Medtronic (MDT), Stryker (SYK), Cantel Medical (CMD), Conmed (CNMD) and Teleflex (TFX), Needham analyst Mike Matson wrote in a note to clients. In other industries, Amazon has typically disrupted the middlemen more than the manufacturers, he said.""In our view, Amazon's model may work for 'lower tech' products but is unlikely to work with 'higher tech' products,"" Matson said.Among lower-tech products he lists lower-priced single-use items that don't require service and are typically used without a sales representative present. Higher-tech items are often implantable, need service and require a sales rep present during their use.""Perhaps not surprisingly, lower-tech products are already typically sold through distributors such as Owens & Minor (OMI), while higher-tech products are typically sold directly by the manufacturer,"" he said. ""In our view, Amazon would simply represent another distribution channel for lower-tech products.""IBD'S TAKE: The stock market remains off its 2018 high. With the market still in the throes of a correction, it's important to keep tabs on key action by visiting The Big Picture.Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar says Amazon could be a ""formidable player"" in the basic medical supplies category, which includes plastics, gloves, drapes and simple catheters. Two companies he covers in that group are Becton and Baxter (BAX).But Becton and Baxter are likely ""happy supplying to Amazon as well as other distributors,"" he said in a report to clients.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Becton sank 1.6% to finish at 215.40, after earlier falling as much as 2.5%. Collectively, medical supplier stocks toppled as much as 3.9% to a low last seen in April 2017. The group ended the day down 1.7%.Baxter, which trades in the medical products group, dipped 0.6% to 64.63. Medical product stocks broadly fell as much as 1.9% but were down marginally at the close.RELATED:Why Payers Won't Balk At $292,000 Price Tag For Vertex's New DrugIs Teva's Pharma's Restructuring Plan Actually 'More Reasonable'?Regeneron Could Benefit From 'Lackluster' Data Presented By These Rivals

25,BAX,"Sales growth is picking up for medical-device and pharmaceuticals giant Baxter International.The Deerfield, Ill.-based Baxter (BAX) has put in double-digit revenue gains during the latest two quarters after nine straight periods of flat to single-digit growth.Revenue grew 16% in the fourth quarter and 15% in the first quarter. Earnings were flat in Q4 and up 9% in Q1.Strong demand for Baxter's hemophilia drugs and last year's buyout of Sweden's Gambro AB, which specializes in dialysis products, are helping lift growth.In 2013, 52% of Baxter's sales came from hemophilia treatments, which include its flagship drug Advate as well as Recombinate and Rixubis. The company recently won regulatory clearance for Advate in Russia and Turkey. Advate is now available in 62 countries.Gambro, which Baxter bought for nearly $3.9 billion, contributed $413 million to sales in the fourth quarter and $400 million in the first quarter.In late March, Baxter said that it plans to split itself into two companies by the middle of next year. One firm will focus on drugs and the other on other medical products.Baxter's Q2 results are due June 17. Profit is expected to rise 5% to $1.22 a share. Revenue is slated to grow 12% to $4.12 billion.Like many companies, Baxter slashed its shareholder dividend during the financial crisis of 2007 through 2009. But the company has been bringing it back up.In May, Baxter raised its quarterly payout by 6% to 52 cents a share. Its quarterly dividend has more than doubled since 2008.At the new rate, Baxter's annualized dividend yield works out to about 2.8%.

Martin Mackay, executive vice president and head of research and development, will retire at the end of 2017. Clare Carmichael, executive vice president and chief human resources officer, will leave June 1 to seek new opportunities.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges notes that the leadership changes will completely wipe out the management team that built Alexion's Soliris franchise and presided over the ""value-destroying"" acquisition of Synageva in 2015. Soliris is an immunosuppressant approved for two rare disorders.IBD'S TAKE: Alexion stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 72, meaning it has outperformed 72% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. The biotech group is led by Corcept Therapeutics which has a CR of 97 out of a best-possible 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for the top-five-rated biotechs.""These changes are not a complete surprise, given the signals that have been coming from the new CEO, but will alarm many investors given the concern that there may be other 'shoes to drop' in terms of disclosure of additional underlying issues with the core business and operations,"" he said.In the past, Hantson has commented that he doesn't have much ""excitement"" for anything in Alexion's pipeline beyond ALXN-1210, a treatment for patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, an immune disorder that results in the destruction of a patient's red blood cells.Still, the departure of Anderson is surprising given that his position was permanent and he was expected to remain in place for at least one to two years amid the transition. Many of his goals of strengthening the financial reporting system and improving operating margins are still underway, Porges said.""Many of these initiatives will continue to be implemented, although the company's commitment to margin improvement goals would seem to now be in question,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Importantly, Alexion didn't see any turnover at the midlevel management or within the sales force, Porges noted. Hantson believes ""the morale and commitment to patient dedication are still there,"" he wrote. All are committed to absorbing the widespread change, the company says.Porges maintained his outperform rating on Alexion stock.RELATED:Amgen, Gilead, Biogen Won't Lead The Biotech Boom — So Who Will?Alexion Beats On First-Quarter Sales; Profits Top By 15 Cents

36,BAX,"Baxter (BAX) stock fell Monday on worries related to a Department of Justice investigation into potential price fixing of intravenous fluids — allegations an analyst deemed ""extraordinary.""On the stock market today, Baxter stock fell 0.8% to 52.82 after the Justice Department sent a grand jury subpoena to one of Baxter's employees.The subpoena was received Friday and relates to a criminal investigation by the Justice Department's antitrust arm. It asks for documents and testimony related to manufacturing, pricing, selling and shortages of intravenous solutions, and Baxter's communications with rivals.Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar noted that the price-fixing allegation isn't new. It stems from a 2-year-old investigation that began in New York and an ongoing class-action suit in the Northern District of Illinois related to supply shortages.The shortage was triggered by the flu season in 2013-14 and benefited manufacturers like Hospira, which in the third quarter of 2014 saw 43% growth in its unit that produces intravenous fluids, Kumar said. Hospira was acquired by Pfizer (PFE) in 2015.But the class action lawsuit alleges that manufacturers of intravenous fluids falsely created the shortage to justify spiking prices in 2014. Baxter, which has filed for a motion to dismiss the suit, called the allegations extraordinary.""The idea of a public company voluntarily creating supply shortage in the hopes competitors would similarly restrict output in order to raise prices seems a stretch,"" Kumar told clients in a note.IBD'S TAKE: Baxter stock trades in IBD's 120-company Medical-Products industry group which is led by Medtronic (MDT), Stryker (SYK) and Boston Scientific (BSX) in terms of market cap. Medtronic, Boston and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) compete in the heart-valve replacement market. Check out this edition of Sector Leaders to see how they stack up.FDA regulators regularly inspect manufacturing facilities, he noted. The class action lawsuit seems to imply that Baxter and other intravenous-fluid manufacturers were able to ""hoodwink"" inspectors to post shortage notices, he said.Baxter said in 2015 that it incurred about $150 million in costs to comply with increased FDA regulatory requirements and meet supply constraints. Meanwhile, price increases only contributed $70 million to $90 million in 2016 growth, Kumar said.In 2016, intravenous-fluid solutions contributed two-thirds of that segment's growth, implying that pricing was up 6% on average, Kumar said. Assuming a bag of intravenous fluid costs $1.50 to $2, this equates to increases of 15 to 20 cents per bag.Apart from price collusion, prosecutors will have to argue whether Baxter's earnings on increased intravenous fluid prices were reasonable. Kumar estimates that after hiking prices on intravenous fluids Baxter had 15%-16% margins on its earnings before interest and taxes.RELATED:Boston Scientific Makes Acquisition To Battle Medtronic, EdwardsMedtronic, Edwards Among Five Best 'Stocks To Own': Analyst

38,BAX,"Specialty drugmaker Shire (SHPG) closed its $32 billion buyout of Baxalta early Friday, and got a price-target increase from an analyst who sees the deal boosting Shire's long-term growth rate.Shire, whose 12-month sales total $6.6 billion, said the combined company should bring in $20 billion in 2020, with 65% coming from rare-disease treatments. Baxalta's dominant position in treating the rare disease hemophilia, which it inherited when it was spun off of Baxter International (BAX) last July, was its chief attraction for Shire.It is, however, facing increasing competition from the hemophilia arm of Biogen (BIIB), which is in the process of being spun off, and potentially from experimental gene therapies from BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) and Spark Therapeutics (ONCE).""Shire is now the global leader in rare diseases, with the number-one rare-diseases platform based on both revenue and pipeline programs,"" Shire CEO Flemming Ornskov said in a statement.Jefferies analyst David Steinberg raised his price target on Shire stock to 262 from 232, writing that the addition of Baxalta lifted his annual EPS growth-rate estimate to 15.5% from 14%, with a revenue growth rate of 25%.He added that there are a few potential upsides as well, such as cost savings greater than the $500 million Shire projected, higher sales of Shire's other products thanks to its newly expanded global presence, and further acquisitions.Shire stock rose 1.1% to 192.09 on the stock market today, in high trading volume. Its IBD Relative Strength Rating has been improving, but still scores only 36.
"
39,BAX,"Big biotech Biogen (BIIB) said Tuesday that it will spin off its hemophilia business into an independent company in a move much anticipated by Wall Street.Biogen, which focuses mainly on neurological diseases, got into hemophilia with the 2014 launch of its two long-acting infusion treatments, Eloctate and Alprolix, for hemophilia A and B, respectively. It carved out some market share from leader Baxter International (BAX), but in mid-April press reports relayed rumors that Biogen was thinking of selling or spinning off the business.Baxter had already made a similar move when it spun off its hemophilia-focused biopharma arm as Baxalta (BXLT) last July. Baxalta was quickly snapped up by Shire (SHPG) in a $32 billion deal.Both Baxalta's and Biogen's infusion therapies are under potential threat from new gene therapies that might be able to cure the disease with a one-time treatment, or at least manage it with far fewer treatments. BioMarin Pharmaceutical's (BMRN) early-stage trial results for its hemophilia gene therapy, reported last month, supported the method's potential.Biogen's press release mentioned that investment in research was one rationale for the spinoff.""The new company, to be named at a later date, will focus on the discovery and development of therapies for the treatment of hemophilia,"" said the release. ""The new company plans to bring longer-acting therapies utilizing the XTEN technology into clinical development in the first half of 2017 and to accelerate the development of bispecific antibodies and hemophilia-related gene therapy programs.""It added that the spinoff will also enable the remaining portion of Biogen to focus on its core multiple-sclerosis business, which has been struggling lately as shown in Biogen's Q1 earnings last month.Still, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee found the decision a bit puzzling.""Why would Biogen want to remove a growing and profitable, long-IP-duration biologics business that diversifies Biogen and 'dilutes' the EPS when it's removed?"" he asked in a research note. ""In addition, Biogen is not selling the business and bringing in cash (approximate $4 billion to $6 billion valuation), and prior to today, the question was what would they do with that cash and who would they buy (they aren't getting cash in this deal). So this seems odd and perhaps implies the valuation is not what the Street perceives if a buyer was not willing to pay up.""Biogen stock was up a fraction in early trading on the stock market today, near 275. The stock has found support above its 50-day line.
"
40,BAX,"Stocks struggled a bit and moved lower yesterday - while remaining in the range that I pointed out in yesterday's note....2080/2100 - Late morning we tested the 2080 level before finding some support and rally into the closing bell.... Trading was light as investors/traders appeared unwilling to commit to the market ahead of the onslaught of earnings today - think Apple (AAPL),  Facebook (FB),  Procter & Gamble (PG), EXXON Mobil (XOM), BAXTER (BAX), 3M (MMM), Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), Corning (GLW), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Eli Lilly (LLY) (Revenues beat, but EPS missed by 0.02 cts) & Whirlpool (WHR) (missed on the top line - revenues - and missed on the bottom line. reported $2.63 vs. exp of $2.68) that are all announcing today and ahead of tomorrow's FOMC announcement.Remember - today begins the two day FED meeting and there is a lot of anticipation and paralysis about what they will say tomorrow. Again - the mkt does not expect a change in rates at all...but it does expect some clarification in terminology concerning June and the next expected hike......Recall that the last hike in December, sent the mkts into a tailspin.....causing the FED to become a bit more 'dovish' as she searched for a reason to calm the mkts.....this time citing unstable global mkts as the culprit...but since then - the mkts have come roaring back - with the S&P now up 2.1% and the Dow up 3.74% - off of what looked like a disastrous year.....As a result of the strength - expect Janet to intimate a return to a path to higher rates......not necessarily faster, just a bit higher.....Expect every word to be parsed and every sentence to be deconstructed as everyone looks for the next 'clue'.Now why the low volumes? Well there are a number of reasons really - never mind the current regulatory environment, and the abuse suffered by so many managers during the 1Q - but yesterday - there was no 'news', right? No eco reports, no significant earnings, no speeches, no big international events, no nothing.....so why do anything? The mkt held in tight - giving no reason to deviate from the plan.....and so the only ones really playing yesterday were the HFT guys and - and asset managers that were tweaking core positions....but tweaking does not mean a change of investment strategy at all...it just means tweaking.....Now oil did come under a bit of pressure yesterday - falling by 2.4% to end the day at $$42.64- but all that tells me is that the recent run up in oil was a bit premature given the current glut and lack of a deal between the OPEC nations etc. So if oil trades within the current band - $39.50/$44 - it's all good.....Why should it break down or surge higher just yet? This morning we see oil up small as the dollar appears a bit weaker......(think no rate hike). Remember - we will get the weekly API (American Petroleum Institute) report this afternoon.Now yesterday we did get a broad measure of the housing mkt.....- but again - these stats are no longer the mkt moving events that they were......although - that could change...you see - yesterday was NEW HOME SALES....and typically this is good barometer of the state of the broader US economy...and guess what? Another disappointment.....New Home Sales FELL 1.5% vs. the exp of a rise of 1.6%.......and why should we be a bit concerned?Well - This is the time of the year when new home sales should be strong....so is this disappointment just another barometer of a weakening economic picture? What is really mind boggling is that we are now a decade into the housing collapse....a decade - that is 10 yrs of an incomplete recovery...as pockets of single family housing continue to stall..... New Home Sales on a total unit basis came in at 511k units - significantly below the 50 yr average of more than 650,000 units. During the Greenspan era - Subprime loans/mortgages propelled sales of New Homes into the stratosphere - sending them as high as 1.28 million units in 2005, - the yr before the beginning of the crash.......a crash created by the adjustable rate mortgages that managed to destroy so many people - triggering waves of foreclosures that then ignited the Great Financial Crisis of 2007 - 2010 (some say the crisis is still ongoing.....I'll leave that up to you...).US futures are up 2 pts in early trading...as the mkt gets ready to react to the slew of those earnings reports noted above. Whirlpool - which we noted missed the numbers is quoted down about $10 bucks in pre-mkt trading....quoted NOT trading just yet....so let's see what investors/traders think about that.....Today is also a big economic day...lots of macro data to consider....Durable Goods exp of +1.9%, ex trans of 0.5%, Cap Good Orders of +0.6%, Cap Goods Shipped of +0.9%, Markit US PMI of 52 and the Richmond Fed Survey of 12. The earnings will all be happening prior to the open while the macro data begins at 8:30 and goes until 10 am. This will create a lot of noise in early trading...but once it settles in after 11 am....then expect the discussion to revolve around the FED once analysts consider the implications of whatever today's macro data reveals.Again - I expect the broader mkt to hold tight within the 2080/2100 range until tomorrow. (Think FED paralysis). Individual names today will get rewarded or punished depending on what they reported and what they say about the future....All in a day's work.....Take Good Care

42,BAX,"Big biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) beat analysts' Q4 estimates Tuesday but its guidance was soft, sending the stock up more than 1% in after-hours trading, in a day when several large drugmakers reported.Gilead's earnings rose 37% over the year-earlier quarter to $3.32 per share, topping analysts' EPS consensus by 32 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue increased 16% to $8.51 billion, vs. analysts' expectation of $8.13 billion.For the full year, EPS rose 56% to $12.61 while revenue gained 31% to $32.64 billion.Gilead guided 2016 product sales, which covers nearly all revenue, at $30 billion to $31 billion. Analysts had expected $30.68 billion in product sales and total revenue of $31.68 billion. Gilead does not provide total revenue or EPS guidance, but it did provide guidance on expenses, which were slightly above expectations on the R&D and sales, general and administrative lines. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum calculated that the implied EPS guidance for 2016 is $10.48 to $11.92, which would miss consensus of $12.23.In Q4, the hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni both beat estimates, though entirely due to sales outside the U.S., where analysts have less visibility. Next year's expected revenue decline is due to an anticipated decline in U.S. HCV market, which had an enormous lift-off when the two drugs were approved but has flattened as ever-larger numbers of patients have been cured of the disease.On the conference call with analysts, commercial-operations chief Paul Carter said that they could expect the HCV market in 2016 to behave similarly to how it did in the second half of 2015, essentially flat in the U.S. while growing in foreign markets where it is still being launched. He said that it might see some growth as payers seem to be loosening their restrictions on the drugs, which initially strained their finances due to their high prices and the enormous volume of patients. However, he acknowledged that revenue per patient was likely to fall as less-sick patients came aboard, requiring shorter treatments.Carter also sounded confident about Gilead's ability to fend off competition, which got a new entrant last week when Merck's (MRK) Zepatier was approved last week and priced well below both Gilead's and AbbVie's (ABBV) HCV drugs.""We're confident our label is very strong, and we're very much supported by the real-world data we've seen since the launch of Harvoni,"" Carter said.Earlier in the day, big pharma Pfizer (PFE) said Q4 revenue rose 7% over the year-earlier quarter to $14.05 billion, beating analysts’ consensus by about $45 million. Earnings, excluding one-time items, slipped 2% to 53 cents a share, beating estimates by a penny.For the year, EPS declined 3% to $2.20, while sales slid 2% to $48.85 billion.However, Pfizer’s 2016 profit guidance missed Wall Street’s expectations of $2.20 to $2.30 a share. Analyst Schoenebaum blamed foreign-exchange headwinds.“Excluding a roughly negative $2.3 billion top line ($0.8 billion of top line FX impact due to Venezuela currency impact alone) and $0.16 bottom line impact due to FX, both 2016 top and bottom line guidance would have bracketed the Street,” Schoenebaum wrote in an email. “We spoke with Pfizer, and they believe that the Street underestimated the FX impact in 2016.”S&P Capital IQ analyst Jeffrey Loo raised his rating on Pfizer to buy from hold, saying the valuation has become attractive after it, like almost every other drug stock around, has sold off in recent months.""We view growth within its Global Innovative Products unit positively, driven by Prevnar 13 and Ibrance,"" Loo wrote in a research note. ""We expect its pending acquisition of Allergan (AGN) to be completed in the second half of 2016.""Pfizer stock closed down 0.1% at 30.14.Mallinckrodt (MNK) rose 5.7% to close at 65.71, after the specialty drugmaker reported fiscal-first-quarter earnings of $2.09 a share, up 17% from the year-earlier quarter and topping consensus by 31 cents. Sales climbed 19% to $914.8 million, some $25 million above the Street’s average estimate.Mallinckrodt raised its full-year EPS guidance to $7.85 to $8.30, up from $7.70 to $8.20.Baxter International (BAX), a leader in dialysis products, also beat expectations in the most recent quarter, pulling off a sharp increase in earnings despite a decline in sales. Fourth quarter profit from continuing operations jumped 54% to 43 cents a share, 11 cents past Wall Street’s consensus. Revenue dropped 7% to $2.6 billion. Baxter stock rose 1.8% Tuesday to close at 37.95.Baxter said it expects EPS this year of $1.46 to $1.54, beating consensus of $1.42. Its forecast for the current quarter was below the Street, however, at 28 to 30 cents.

43,BAX,"Medical stocks Pfizer (PFE), Mallinckrodt (MNK) and Baxter International (BAX) were all on the move Tuesday after early quarterly reports and guidance.Pfizer said Q4 revenue rose 7% over the year-earlier quarter to $14.05 billion, beating analysts' consensus by about $45 million, according to Thomson Reuters. Earnings, excluding one-time items, slipped 2% to 53 cents a share, beating estimates by a penny.For the year, EPS declined 3% to $2.20, while sales slid 2% to $48.85 billion.However, Pfizer's 2016 profit guidance missed Wall Street's expectations of $2.20 to $2.30 a share.

""We spoke with Pfizer, and they believe that the Street underestimated the FX impact in 2016.""Pfizer stock was down0.7% to 29.97 in afternoon trading on the stock market today.Pfizer also said that it had ended a midstage trial of an experimental Alzheimer's disease drug in October after an independent data-monitoring committee said that it would be futile to continue. The drug, PF-05212377, targeted a brain receptor called 5HT6, similar to another drug, RVT-101, currently in late-stage testing by Axovant Sciences (AXON). Since RVT-101 is one of only two drugs in Axovant's pipeline, Axovant stock was down 23% intraday, hitting a three-month low.Mallinckrodt, meanwhile, was up 5.5% Tuesday afternoon, after the specialty drugmaker reported fiscal-first-quarter earnings of $2.09 a share, up 17% from the year-earlier quarter and topping consensus by 31 cents. Sales climbed 19% to $914.8 million, some $25 million above the Street's average estimate.Mallinckrodt raised its full-year EPS guidance to $7.85 to $8.30, up from $7.70 to $8.20.Leerink analyst Jason Gerberry wrote that the beat looked ""high quality"" given its reasons, and he said selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were less than expected.""(1) biggest driver was low SG&A spend of 24.9% of sales vs. our/Street assumption for spend in the 28% range,"" Gerberry wrote in a research note. ""This was partially offset by higher R&D spend in the quarter; (2) followed by sales mix which drove higher gross margin on the quarter (74.3% vs. our 72.6%); and (3) a top-line beat driven by specialty brands.""Baxter also beat expectations in the most recent quarter, pulling off a sharp increase in earnings despite a decline in sales. Q4 profit from continuing operations jumped 54% to 43 cents a share, 11 cents past Wall Street's consensus. Revenue dropped 7% to $2.6 billion.Baxter said it expects EPS this year of $1.46 to $1.54, beating consensus of $1.42. Its forecast for the current quarter was below the Street, however, at 28 to 30 cents.Baxter's comparisons were somewhat complicated by the fact that in July it spun off its biopharma arm as Baxalta (BXLT), leaving a business comprised mostly of dialysis and hospital products that accounted for 60% of the previous company. But Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy wrote that its path as an independent company is becoming clearer.""Now post-split, Baxter is a margin expansion story as the company works down dis-synergies, implements broader cost controls, and executes on new product launches,"" Antalffy wrote in a research note. ""With two quarterly data points now in hand, it seems clear that Baxter is on track to exceed its margin expansion trajectory that the company laid out at the May analyst meeting -- adjusted operating margin expansion from 9% immediately post-split to 10% in 2016, ramping to 14% in 2020.""Baxter stock was up 1% in afternoon trading.

Nasdaq 100 futures dived 86.8 points. S&P 500 futures swooned 33.7 points, and Russell 2000 futures tumbled 21.5 points.A tough day in China appeared to ripple across international markets. In Shanghai, stocks fell 6.9% — reportedly after weak December manufacturing data fueled concerns for yet another downshift in economic output.Chinese investors were already on edge regarding next week's expiration of a selling moratorium on certain stocks put in place during last summer's market correction. New rules had automatically halted trading twice, with the market remaining closed after the second shut down.Global markets were already on edge after weekend protests in Iran, after Saudi Arabia's execution of a Shiite cleric caused the Saudis to close its embassy and cut its diplomatic ties with Iran.The combination sent Hong Kong to a 2.7% loss. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 dropped 3.1%.Europe's markets dropped hard, with Frankfurt's DAX down more than 4% and the CAC-40 in Paris and London's FTSE 100 trading nearly 3% lower at midday.Bonds and the dollar slipped. Commodities were all over the map. Oil rose, with Brent crude up almost 2% to near $38 a barrel. Natural gas fell 2%. Gold rose 1%. Copper and platinum fell 2% each.The U.S. economic calendar gets rolling at 9:45 a.m. ET on the stock market today, when researcher Markit releases its final manufacturing purchasing managers index tally for December. The Institute for Supply Management delivers its December manufacturing index at 10 a.m., and the Commerce Department reports November construction spending data.Premarket action showed most Dow stocks trading lower, led by JPMorgan (JPM) and American Express (AXP), down more than 2% apiece.Among the few gainers on the S&P 500, Baxalta (BXLT) shot up 5% on news it was partnering with Symphogen to develop therapies designed to help immune systems fight cancer.The deal includes an initial $175 million payment from Baxalta to Symphogen, giving it exclusive rights to six targeted treatments. Baxalta spun out from Baxter International (BAX) last July. The stock ended Thursday in a cup-with-handle base with a 40.34 buy point.At the weak end of the S&P 500, FMC (FMC), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Netflix (NFLX) and Red Hat (RHT) were among the stocks posting deeper-than-4% declines.Tesla Motors (TSLA) dropped 4% after announcing on Sunday its 2015 deliveries hit 50,000, the low end of the company's reduced guidance.Among leaders, China-based stocks were taking some serious beatings before the starting bell.On the IBD 50 list, Noah (NOAH) dropped 9% and Alibaba (BABA) tumbled 4%.Noah ended Thursday in a test of support at its 200-day moving average. A drop below that line would complicate its current base-building effort.Alibaba has been trading in a fairly neat flat base with an 86.52 buy point. It ended Thursday just a few pennies below its 50-day moving average.Red Hat, also an IBD 50 stock, had been struggling to clear an 83.10 buy point in a flat base. It briefly cleared the mark twice since mid-December before retreating back below the buy marker.Early gains on the IBD 50 list were less than 0.5%.
"
59,BAX,"2015 was a year with two distinct parts for drug stocks: The first seven months continued the bull run of the last four years, while the sudden resurfacing of the drug-pricing debate led to a rocky five months after that.But overall, the group came out ahead — and these top-performing big caps show that a solid story can make up for political worries in the eyes of investors.•Incyte (INCY) is up 49% — as of Wednesday's close — after a year of steady gains for its lone marketed product, Jakafi, as well as its pipeline of potential blockbusters. In March, Jakafi won EU approval in the blood cancer polycythemia vera, for which it is already approved in the U.S., along with another blood cancer, myelofibrosis. Both those diseases are rare, but Incyte is shooting for much bigger markets with its late-stage candidates baricitinib and epacadostat.Baricitinib, which Incyte is developing in partnership with Eli Lilly (LLY), tested successfully in phase-three trials in rheumatoid arthritis against a placebo, methotrexate and the current market leader, AbbVie 's (ABBV) Humira. In his Nov. 18 initiation report on Incyte, Goldman Sachs analyst Salveen Richter estimated peak annual sales of more than $2 billion after an expected 2017 launch.Richter added that a more important future driver of shares will likely be Incyte's entries into the budding field of immuno-oncology. Incyte has been testing its lead candidate in the field, epacadostat, in combination with Merck's (MRK) Keytruda in a variety of cancers. In early November, Incyte's stock fell after a small study of the combo in patients with advanced cancers disappointed Wall Street, but Richter wrote that 2016 will likely bring more clarity as more results come out.Incyte has been operating at a loss due to all this research spending, but analysts expect it to turn its first annual profit next year. The stock's current IBD Composite Rating is 60.•Danish diabetes giant Novo Nordisk (NVO) is up 39% as it ends the year with a flat base following early gains. In March, the stock rose sharply after Novo said it would refile for U.S. approval of its long-acting insulin analogue Tresiba, along with its shorter-acting sister drug Ryzodeg. The two drugs suffered a surprise rejection in 2013 as the FDA sought more data on their possible risks to the heart. This time around, the agency was convinced, and it approved them on Sept. 25.Also boosting the stock early in the year was Novo's February release of positive clinical-trial data on its latest glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, OG217SC. Novo has been selling its earlier GLP-1 agonist Victoza since 2010, but the market has gotten more competitive in the last couple years with new GLP-1s launching from Sanofi (SNY), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Eli Lilly. Those drugs are all injectable, however, while Novo's new candidate is oral. Novo announced further positive results for the drug in July and September.Novo's financial results in U.S. currency suffered from the foreign-exchange headwinds that hit all global drugmakers this year, but it still managed a solid IBD EPS Rank of 85 and a Relative Strength rating of 87.•Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) continued its multiyear run on the stock market, hitting a lifetime high of 605.93 on Aug. 4 before getting caught in the larger biotech sell-off. It's still up 34% for the year.Regeneron's flagship eye drug Eylea continued to perform well, aided by a new approval for diabetic retinopathy in March. But drawing more attention was the launch of its cholesterol drug Praluent in July.Praluent was not only the first of a new class of cholesterol drugs — though it was followed shortly to the market by Amgen 's (AMGN) Repatha — it's also the first of a number of novel monoclonal antibodies that Regeneron has been developing in a partnership with Sanofi. The next entry, dupilumab, is in late-stage testing for asthma and eczema and is also expected to attain multibillion-dollar annual sales.Regeneron is also the highest-rated stock on this list, with the highest-possible Composite Rating of 99.• Eli Lilly is the top-performing traditional big pharma of the year, with a 25% gain. While its sales growth has been flat due to its aging drugs, as well as currency headwinds, the company has improved profit margins through cost controls and gotten a lot of investors excited about its pipeline. As noted above, its partnership with Incyte has borne fruit in the baricitinib trials. Lilly doesn't have much of a presence in rheumatoid arthritis or other immunology diseases, but Lilly is planning to change that not only with baricitinib but with ixekizumab, a psoriasis treatment it's planning to launch next year that is expected to sell in the billions eventually.Lilly's already-launched diabetes drug Jardiance yielded one of pharma's biggest upside surprises this year, when a giant study of its effects on cardiovascular health showed that it reduced death from heart failure by 32%. That drove the stock to a 14-year high of 92.85 in September, which turned into a cup-with-handle base.The stock holds a 72 CR.• Baxalta (BXLT) is up 23% since it started trading July 1 in a spin-off from Baxter International (BAX), which sought to unlock the shareholder value of its biopharma arm. Just 10 days later, the company received an unsolicited $30 billion buyout offer from British drugmaker Shire (SHPG), which saw Baxalta's hemophilia franchise as an ideal addition to its rare-disease portfolio.Baxalta rejected the offer, but the situation remains unresolved. Last week, rumors were buzzing that Shire would up its bid, though it hasn't yet. Baxalta's financials have been slow and steady, leading to an EPS Rank of 62, but the acquisition hopes have lifted the stock's RS Rating to 94.

"
79,BAX,"To best lead and influence, first be clear on who you are and what you stand for. That suggestion comes from Harry Kraemer, author of ""Becoming the Best"" and the former CEO of Baxter International (BAX), a multibillion-dollar medical-products firm. He's now an executive at Madison Dearborn Partners, a private equity firm.Tips on becoming your best self: Take stock. Kraemer believes that self-reflection is crucial and best done at the end of the day.He suggests asking yourself:""Did I act in a self-reflective manner, or did I get caught up in the emotions and the urgency of the day? Did I do what I said I was going to do — and if not, why not? Did I fall short of expectations? How did I treat people, lead people and follow people? If I had the day to live over again, what would I do differently?""He noted: ""The more self-reflective I am, the better equipped I am to become my best self every day."" Pursue balance. See all sides to gain better perspective and improve decisions. ""You don't just rely on what you think or what you know; you purposefully seek a broader perspective by engaging others,"" Kraemer told IBD.He added that as a leader, ""you recognize that you have a moral responsibility to develop every person on the team to their fullest potential. Feedback for each team member is not given once a year on an HR form. It's continuous feedback through open, honest conversation so that each person understands strengths and areas that need to be developed."" Lock on objectives. Pick one or two at a time, suggests Joel Fotinos, a publisher and the author of ""My Life Contract."" He says that having too many objectives at a time means that we can spend only a small amount of time on each. Strive for consistency. When you're haphazard in effort, you probably won't see much movement toward major objectives. ""Daily positive actions will create more positive results,"" Fotinos said. He compares it to going to the gym regularly. ""You'll not only see results more quickly, but seeing the results will propel you further."" Exercise modesty. It helps to believe everyone deserves respect.""No matter what your title is now, genuine humility also reminds you where you came from,"" Kraemer said. He often asks senior leaders to recall when they were junior people in a cubicle. ""Back then, there were people who reached out and made them feel part of the organization. Having experienced that, they vowed that if they ever became the boss or a leader, they would act the same way.""Now, they often realize that they haven't fulfilled that promise because they forgot where they came from, he says. ""'Remember the cube' is my mantra for genuine humility,"" he added. ""It shifts the focus to others, helps me see where I can lend a hand and reminds me to always put the spotlight on the team and their contributions."" Act. Stop waiting for permission. ""Sometimes we wait until a boss, a parent, a spouse or someone else gives us an indication that it's time to move forward,"" Fotinos said. ""But we can waste a lot of time waiting for this external permission when, really, we can move forward at any time ... so why not now?""

The goal is to avoid rising drug prices and medicine shortages.On the stock market today, generic stocks collectively dipped 1.3% after falling 2.7% in earlier trades.

"
117,BAX,"In business, it pays to follow the path of least resistance. When consumers demand a product and you don't offer it, you may want to change your strategy.This is what happened with some durable medical equipment (DME) companies whose business model usually focuses on delivering stationary oxygen concentrators and cylinders to patients.The arrival of Inogen's (INGN) portable oxygen concentrators (POCs) on the market changed all that. Not only did the California-based company create lighter, quieter and more efficient products, it also chose to distribute directly to customers, bypassing the DME firms as the ""middleman.""Its POCs work in real-time by removing nitrogen from the air and directly provide oxygen to patients via inhalation. There is no need to have to carry or move around heavy oxygen tanks that only provide a finite amount of oxygen before needing a recharge.Inogen's strategy proved to be a great success. So much so that patients started asking for POCs from conventional DME companies. Despite the initial resistance, DMEs finally came to view offering Inogen's POCs as key to addressing increased demand from customers.All the better for Inogen, which saw sales in the U.S. business-to-business segment jump 86% to $14.5 million for the first nine months of 2014 vs. a year earlier. International B2B sales advanced 35% to $17.4 million.Resellers Ride BrandwagonDomestic B2B growth was mostly driven by resellers who jumped on the opportunity of providing Inogen's POCs via online stores and other means directly to customers. In addition, several DMEs partnered with Inogen to get its products to their client base.""A significant portion of that is really driven by our pull-through demand from consumers,"" said Inogen Chief Financial Officer Alison Bauerlein. ""As we ramped up our direct-to-consumer advertising, we saw significant pull-through in those business-to-business domestic sales, as patients have really started to see us as a brand name and a name that they're requesting from other businesses.""While the B2B area has grown significantly, to Inogen's surprise, the company's direct-to-consumer segment is still the largest revenue contributor at 62% of sales for the first nine months of 2014, which are its first three quarters of the year.Inogen's gross margins have been impressive, 54% for oxygen machine rentals and 48% for sold units in the third quarter.""They are taking share in the home oxygen market,"" said Mike Matson, an analyst at Needham & Co. ""They're offering a more attractive solution to the patient than some of the other companies that are out there. And they've gone direct to the patient, they are marketing through TV ads and magazine ads and Internet sites to try to attract patients that are on Medicare or have insurance — or they'd even be willing to pay for one of these units out of their own pocket.""The U.S. oxygen therapy market opportunity is $3 billion to $4 billion, Inogen says, and it notes that POCs now in use represent less than 5% of that.New Home Oxygen MachineIn October, Inogen released a home oxygen concentrator called the Inogen At Home. It is the lightest five-liter-per-minute continuous-flow oxygen concentrator currently available. It weighs just 18 pounds vs. the typical home oxygen machine weight of 40-50 pounds.It is meant to be used mostly at night by patients who do not yet require a portable solution. Those patients represent about 30% of total oxygen patients in the U.S. It also uses less power, providing up to $20 in monthly electricity savings.""It's still very early in the process,"" said Bauerlein. ""We're really trying to optimize what is the right selling price, what is the right selling strategy, so it's still very early. This is a new market for us and there really isn't a retail market for stationary oxygen concentrators at this point.""She said that the firm will need at least another quarter to determine what the best strategy is for Inogen At Home. However, because the concentrator is less complex, pricing will most likely be cheaper than Inogen's other machines.The company's portable concentrators include the Inogen One G2 and G3. The latter is the latest and lightest of the machines at 4.8 pounds. Its retail price starts at $2,495. The company is working on an even smaller and lighter model, the Inogen One G4, expected to be released in the first half of 2016. The goal with the G4 is to offer a product that is less expensive to manufacture, said Bauerlein.Inogen went public in February 2014 at $16 a share and its stock nearly doubled from the IPO price by the end of the year.With a market cap approaching $600 million, Inogen ranks 50th in size among 108 names in IBD's Medical-Products industry group, which is dominated by the likes of Medtronic (MDT), Covidien (COV) and Baxter International (BAX).The group ranks No. 27 in performance of 197 that IBD tracks. Inogen's outsized stock gain of 37% for the second half of 2014, vs. the group's 6% rise, is among factors lifting the medical products group from 65th place half a year ago.Inogen's largest competitors are Invacare (IVC), Inova Labs and Respironics, a unit of Philips (PHG). Analyst Matson says one risk is that a rival will try to improve on Inogen products. But the trajectory to market is pretty long. Plus, Inogen holds 27 U.S. patents with at least eight years remaining, which should provide a buffer zone.The company has been generating positive cash flow, finishing the third quarter with $56.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. It also secured access to a credit facility from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the bank that led Inogen's IPO.At its Dec. 15 analyst day event, Inogen reaffirmed revenue guidance it raised in November. It expects $106 million to $110 million for 2014 and $130 million to $135 million in 2015, or 20%-25% growth this year.The consensus opinion of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters calls for a 36% earnings per share gain to 30 cents for 2014 and a 40% gain this year to 42 cents.

Also curious was the fact that only a few stocks were up in heavy volume.Homebuilders continued to provide some interesting charts. D.R. Horton (DHI) was trying to break out past the 34.15 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. But both the price and volume activity was insufficient to view today's move as a rush of institutional buying.

123,BAX,"Drugmakers on Tuesday continued to turn in solid Q2 earnings reports, with beats from Pfizer (PFE), Mallinckrodt (MNK) and Shire (SHPG) getting a mixed reaction from investors.Specialty-drug and hospital-products company Mallinckrodt made the biggest move, jumping more than 14% to 76.91 after it both beat analysts' second-quarter estimates and raised guidance. Earnings of $2.20 a share were more than 9% above a Thomson Reuters survey consensus, while revenue of $971 million was more than 5% over Wall Street's number.Growth did decelerate somewhat from the recent quarter, at 11% on the top line and 9% on the bottom line vs. the prior year. But Mallinckrodt also said it expects full-year EPS ""at the high end"" of its previously guided range of $8.15 to $8.50, which would put annual earnings growth at 15%.Acthar, the immunology drug that Mallinckrodt acquired when it bought Questcor a couple of years ago, shrugged off the critique that its business depends on sky-high pricing.""Acthar sales of $298.3 million beat consensus estimates of $282 million, and the brand grew 11% year over year (all attributed to volume, with some negative impact of price, which may hurt the bear thesis),"" wrote Mizuho Securities analyst Irina Koffler in a research note.British rare-disease company Shire climbed more than 4% to 202.24 on the stock market today after it also delivered a beat and raise. In contrast to Mallinckrodt, its growth has been accelerating, with a sales gain of 56% vs. just 4% a year ago. Much of that came from the recent acquisition of Baxalta, the hemophilia-focused company spun off of Baxter International (BAX), but Shire said its own legacy products grew 19%, while Baxalta's rose 12%.Profit jumped 29% to $3.38 a share. Both the top and bottom line beat consensus estimates.Shire's new full-year sales guidance was in line with consensus, but its EPS guide was on the upside. At the midpoint, it would represent 10% growth over last year.IBD'S TAKE: Shire and Pfizer both rank among the top 5 stocks in IBD's Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group. Shire's is No. 1 in EPS Rank, though its stock performance this year has been weaker than Pfizer's. For more info, see Shire's Stock Checkup.U.S. pharma giant Pfizer dropped 2.5% to 36.39 despite also notching a quarterly beat. The stock hit a 12-year high on Monday, suggesting that expectations were pretty bullish, and the company did not raise its guidance for the year.Investors have been waiting impatiently for Pfizer to decide whether it's going to split into two or three companies in the near future. Pfizer has promised that it will make an announcement before year-end, but that didn't happen Tuesday.New breast-cancer drug Ibrance showed its blockbuster potential by selling $514 million vs. $140 million a year earlier, beating analysts' expectations.""Prevnar vaccine, Pfizer's largest product, actually missed in this quarter due to the timing of ex-U.S. governmental purchases and the high initial capture rate of eligible patients in the U.S. after successful launch of Prevnar in elderly population in 2014,"" noted Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum in an email. ""Recall that previously Pfizer communicated that they expect the total 2016 worldwide Prevnar revenues to be close to 2015 levels, but consensus still models some minimal year-on-year growth.""Overall sales rose 11%, while profit climbed 14%. Q2 and Q1 together were the first back-to-back quarters of both sales and profit growth Pfizer has reported since its former blockbuster Lipitor went off patent in 2011.

In afternoon trading, shares were up less than 1%, near 44.Baxter's products, which include IV systems, dialysis machines and surgical equipment, are sold mainly to the hospital market, which has been looking strong this earnings season, according to Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy.""This -- now the third consecutive growth quarter in the U.S. after two consecutive quarters of low-single-digit declines -- could serve as another encouraging data point, in addition to Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), St. Jude Medical (STJ) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT) (Q1 reports) last week, that supports a potential trend for improving U.S. procedure volumes overall,"" Antalffy wrote in a research note.The fortunes of hospital stocks supports her view: The Medical-Hospitals group has been among the fastest-rising of IBD's 197 industry groups, leaping from No. 191 to six weeks ago to No. 39 at present.

126,BAX,"IBD research shows that buying a stock at a new high when the market is strong is preferable to buying a stock at a new low.However, finding a lower entry in a base isn't always a bad idea. Under the right circumstances, it can be ideal.Jesse Livermore's shakeout plus 3 pattern can deliver big gains, and you don't have to wait until the stock makes a new high.The pattern involves two lows, with the second low undercutting the first. The stock is bought when it rises 3 points above the first low in strong volume.When the stock is high-priced, say 80, 100 or 200 a share, add at least 6 to 10 points to the first low. You want to see the stock make a significant move up before building a position.The second low tells you that weak holders are being shaken out. The surge past the first low tells you funds are buying shares and resistance is minimal.In Livermore's time (1877-1940), big-money operators sometimes started the drive to the second low with a little selling of their own. They wanted the shares of the weak holders, and driving the stock to a second low was the easiest way to grab shares at reduced prices.After backing up the truck and reloading the bed with the cheaper shares, the big money could add to their positions without the average price getting too high.Manipulation, though, couldn't have accounted for all or even most of a stock's story. If the stock had strong fundamentals, conviction would naturally draw more money into the stock, fueling the run-up.Whether it's about financial pools in Livermore's era or the dark pools today, individual investors make the mistake of looking at market realities as ""unfair."" It's wiser to look at the market in terms of odds. They are either working for you or against you.Baxter Travenol Laboratories (BAX), which changed its name to Baxter International in 1988, shaped a shakeout plus 3 in 1966. The first low was notched in July 1966 at 28.25 1. The second low settled at 25.50 in the week ended Oct. 14 2. The shakeout plus 3 set the buy point at 31.25. On Oct. 18, Baxter broke past the entry. Daily volume was 180% above average. The stock then retreated almost 3% below the ideal buy point before finding traction. Baxter rose 112% in six months.Getting all of that gain would've been tough. Investors who held the stock — until it broke under its 50-day line in big volume May 31 — could've booked a 74% gain.

127,BAX,"Shares of medical equipment maker Cyberonics (CYBX) fell sharply after it reported mixed fourth-quarter estimates. Its earnings estimate for the full year was lighter than expected as it rolled out a variety of new devices.The maker of implantable devices to treat epilepsy, depression and other neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases said that earnings per share rose 20% vs. a year ago to 55 cents, a penny more than estimates.Revenue grew 9.5% to $74.85 million. Wall Street expected $76.7 million.For the full year, Cyberonics sees EPS of $2.33 to $2.39. Consensus of 10 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters was for $2.38 a share.The company's light earnings projection comes amid a shift in management and higher spending to launch several new products.On April 28, the medical-device maker named Rohan Hoare to the newly created position of chief operating officer, and O'Neill D'Cruz as chief medical officer.Like other medical-gear makers, including highly rated Invisalign clear braces maker Align Technology (ALGN), whose stock is on the IBD 50 list of top-rated stocks, and spine-disorder treatment gear maker Globus Medical (GMED), Cyberonics makes highly specialized equipment.Cyberonics makes monitoring devices and systems that deliver mild electrical pulses to the vagus nerve in a patient's neck, which sends a signal to the brain.Cyberonics' new AspireSR brand pulse generator for treatment of epilepsy and depression was approved in Europe in February, and ""communications with the Food and Drug Administration to determine next steps for U.S. approval for the AspireSR generator are underway,"" Cyberonics CEO Dan Moore said Wednesday after the earnings announcement.Moore had said earlier that the company was making ""significant, multiyear investments in our sales force ... and our technology pipeline"" to support the rollouts.Cyberonics' new Centro and ProGuardian systems are also nearing or under submission to regulatory agencies for approval.After plunging as much as 7% in six times usual trading volume, Cyberonics shares were down 6% in late morning trading in the stock market today (Wednesday).The small company has been a steady Eddie, growing at a consistent pace.Over the last five years, its annual revenue has grown 68% to $282 million. Its stock price rose 396% from early June 2009 to a high of 72.51 on Feb. 19 this year before it began retreating in sync with a market correction.Among other companies in the 100-company Medical-Products group, medical equipment giant Medtronic (MDT), largest in the group by market cap, was up fractionally.

"
179,BAX,"Novartis' blood screening portfolio focuses on tests for HIV, hepatitis B and West Nile virus, among other indications. It drew about $750 million in revenue last year.

"
182,BAX,"Araclon, a 2004 spinoff from Spain's University of Zaragoza, is involved in diagnostics and therapies for Alzheimer's disease.
"
183,BAX,"Grifols has kept expanding outside its core expertise in blood plasma. Earlier this year it bought a 60% interest in Progenika Biopharma, a Spanish diagnostic and prognostic firm that personalizes treatments in genetically complex diseases.
"
184,BAX,"It also recently took a minority stake in TiGenix, a biotech based in Belgium that develops therapies using stem cells for treating autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, among others. TiGenix's new cellular therapy for repairing knee cartilage is approved for use in Europe.
"
185,BAX,"Geographic Expansion
"
186,BAX,"Meanwhile, Grifols has expanded its blood-separation, or fractionation, plants in Clayton, N.C., and Barcelona. It intends to increase plasma fractionation capacity from 8.5 million liters of plasma per year to 12.5 million by 2016.

187,BAX,"The company also operates plants in Los Angeles, Melville, N.Y., Mexico, Switzerland and Australia.
"
188,BAX,"In the third quarter, revenue in the U.S. grew 14.3% from the year-ago period. Growth was even faster in Latin America and China. Overall revenue rose 4.4% to 2,046.6 million euros, or around $880 million. (Grifols reports in euros only.)
"
189,BAX,"In China, demand for the protein albumin, a plasma expander, is particularly strong. China has been importing albumin, used to replenish lost blood or to treat trauma, due to problems with the quality of the nation's supplies, Anderson says.
"
190,BAX,"""China is a huge growth opportunity for blood-plasma companies,"" said analyst Andrew. ""Some believe that over time China will allow additional (blood proteins) to come in.""
"
191,BAX,"Albumin is part of Grifols' core plasma-protein bioscience division, which accounts for nearly 90% of revenue. Albumin, the fastest growing product in the division, logged growth of more than 24% in the third quarter.
"
192,BAX,"The firm's earnings are growing much faster than revenue.
"
193,BAX,"Per-share earnings in ADRs have grown in double digits the last seven quarters. In the third quarter, they jumped 42% to 34 cents. Analysts expect full-year profit of $1.67 a share, up from $1.03 last year.
"
194,BAX,"They see 2014 earnings rising another 22% to $2.04, according to Thomson Reuters.
"
195,BAX,"Grifols' two smaller divisions are involved in diagnostics, driven by sales of blood typing cards, and hospital products. The diagnostics unit will become a much larger part of Grifols' business once the Novartis acquisition is completed, taking it from 4% of sales to 20%, Deutsche Bank analysts in Europe estimate.
"
196,BAX,"But they note that profitability of the Novartis assets has not been disclosed. And a majority of the estimated $100 million in royalty income alone could go away as core patents around hepatitis C testing expire in 2015 and 2016, they added.

It drew about $750 million in revenue last year.""The Novartis acquisition makes Grifols more vertically integrated, since it will basically have all the tests that are necessary to be run on blood samples,"" said Morningstar's Anderson.In 2012, Grifols bought 51% of Araclon Biotech, advancing its research-and-development pipeline in areas outside plasma.Araclon, a 2004 spinoff from Spain's University of Zaragoza, is involved in diagnostics and therapies for Alzheimer's disease.Grifols has kept expanding outside its core expertise in blood plasma. Earlier this year it bought a 60% interest in Progenika Biopharma, a Spanish diagnostic and prognostic firm that personalizes treatments in genetically complex diseases.It also recently took a minority stake in TiGenix, a biotech based in Belgium that develops therapies using stem cells for treating autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, among others. TiGenix's new cellular therapy for repairing knee cartilage is approved for use in Europe.Geographic ExpansionMeanwhile, Grifols has expanded its blood-separation, or fractionation, plants in Clayton, N.C., and Barcelona. It intends to increase plasma fractionation capacity from 8.5 million liters of plasma per year to 12.5 million by 2016.The company also operates plants in Los Angeles, Melville, N.Y., Mexico, Switzerland and Australia.In the third quarter, revenue in the U.S. grew 14.3% from the year-ago period. Growth was even faster in Latin America and China. Overall revenue rose 4.4% to 2,046.6 million euros, or around $880 million. (Grifols reports in euros only.)In China, demand for the protein albumin, a plasma expander, is particularly strong. China has been importing albumin, used to replenish lost blood or to treat trauma, due to problems with the quality of the nation's supplies, Anderson says.""China is a huge growth opportunity for blood-plasma companies,"" said analyst Andrew. ""Some believe that over time China will allow additional (blood proteins) to come in.""Albumin is part of Grifols' core plasma-protein bioscience division, which accounts for nearly 90% of revenue. Albumin, the fastest growing product in the division, logged growth of more than 24% in the third quarter.The firm's earnings are growing much faster than revenue.Per-share earnings in ADRs have grown in double digits the last seven quarters. In the third quarter, they jumped 42% to 34 cents. Analysts expect full-year profit of $1.67 a share, up from $1.03 last year.They see 2014 earnings rising another 22% to $2.04, according to Thomson Reuters.Grifols' two smaller divisions are involved in diagnostics, driven by sales of blood typing cards, and hospital products. The diagnostics unit will become a much larger part of Grifols' business once the Novartis acquisition is completed, taking it from 4% of sales to 20%, Deutsche Bank analysts in Europe estimate.But they note that profitability of the Novartis assets has not been disclosed. And a majority of the estimated $100 million in royalty income alone could go away as core patents around hepatitis C testing expire in 2015 and 2016, they added.Still, the analysts see potential for ""double-digit accretion by 2015,"" though they add it could fall to low single-digits if hepatitis C royalties disappear.Grifols likely paid a premium for Novartis' blood-screening business ""to gain a more significant footprint in the diagnostic market,"" the Deutsche Bank analysts said.Grifols' hospital division will get a boost from a recent licensing agreement with Tennessee-based Cumberland Pharmaceuticals (CPIX) to market an ibuprofen drug for intravenous infusion in Spain, Portugal and several countries in South America. The drug is used to treat postoperative pain and fever.

204,BAX,"Investors with an interest in Medical - Products stocks have likely encountered both Hill-Rom (HRC  -  Free Report) and Baxter International (BAX  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Both Hill-Rom and Baxter International have a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.HRC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 18.78, while BAX has a forward P/E of 25.30. We also note that HRC has a PEG ratio of 1.36. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. BAX currently has a PEG ratio of 1.89.Another notable valuation metric for HRC is its P/B ratio of 3.82. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, BAX has a P/B of 4.34.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to HRC's Value grade of A and BAX's Value grade of C.Both HRC and BAX are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that HRC is the superior value option right now.

205,BAX,"A 52-week high level is used as an indicator. A stock nearing that level is considered a winner.Investors often wonder if the high price has made the stock overpriced. While the apprehensions are not absolutely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, an investor might miss out on top gainers in a bid to avoid stocks that are trading near their 52-week high levels.A stock can continue the momentum and keep touching new highs as time progresses. So, a more informed approach to understand if any further upside is left is beneficial in these cases.Here we will discuss a strategy to find the right stocks:Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing, this technique bets on the catchphrase, “buy high, sell higher.”52-Week High: A Good IndicatorMany a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.In fact, overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors’ focus (or willingness to pay premium) has helped them reach the level. But that doesn’t always mean an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Setting the Right FiltersWe ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers, in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring continuation of their rally for some time.Current Price/52 Week High >= .80This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.% Change Price – 4 Weeks > 0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.% Change Price – 12 Weeks > 0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.Price/Sales <= XIndMedThe lower, the better.P/E using F(1) Estimate <= XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) >= XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry.

206,BAX,"The medical device industry has been benefiting from favorable consumer behavior, the growing prevalence of minimally-invasive surgeries, demand for liquid biopsy tests and the use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.Further, considering favorable demographics, changing market dynamics toward Artificial Intelligence (AI) & big-data applications, and increased business investments, this sector has been going strong. Broadly speaking, the latest Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which slashed corporate tax rates to 21% from the earlier 35%, has also buoyed optimism among investors.Additionally, the Senate’s decision, to defer the implementation of an industry-wide excise tax — known as the Medical Device — for another couple of years, has instilled confidence in investors. The tax will be effective from Jan 1, 2020. The bill also delays the Cadillac tax — 40% tax on employer insurance — until 2022. Per Emergo, the U.S. Medical Device industry is projected to reach a market value of $173 billion by 2019.Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) and Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) are two close contenders in this space.Notably, both stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which raises investors’ optimism.Here, we make a detailed analysis of the companies’ fundamentals to determine which stock is currently positioned better in the Medical Products space.With a market cap of $44.55 billion, Boston Scientific is one of the leading manufacturers of medical devices and products, used in various interventional medical specialties worldwide.On the other hand, based in Deerfield, IL, Baxter is a leading global medical technology company. The company has a market cap of $39.79 billion.Price PerformanceIn the past year, Boston Scientific’s shares have gained 15.3% compared with the industry’s increase of 11.9%. The stock has also surpassed the S&P 500 index’s increase of 13.7%. Shares of Baxter have risen 24.1% in this period.Earnings GrowthThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boston Scientific’s current-year earnings is pegged at $1.39 per share, which reflects year-over-year projected growth of 10.3%.The same for Baxter is pegged at $2.89, indicating year-over-year rise of 16.5%.Moreover, per the last nine years data, since 2009, Boston Scientific’s earnings per share have witnessed a CAGR of 93.8% to $1.26 in 2017. Baxter’s earnings are projected at a negative CAGR of 34.5% and totaled $2.49 in 2017.Hence, Boston Scientific wins this round.Sales GrowthThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boston Scientific’s current-year revenues is pegged at $9.84 billion, showing year-over-year growth of 8.8%. The same for Baxter is pinned at $11.37 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 7.7%.Since 2009, Boston Scientific’s revenues witnessed a CAGR of 10.5% and reached $9.05 billion in 2017. Baxter’s revenues depicted a negative CAGR of 15.9% in 2017.Here too, Boston Scientific wins over Baxter.Factors Driving StocksBoston ScientificOver the recently reported quarters, Boston Scientific demonstrated growth across all business lines and geographies. The 2018 view also paints a bright picture. The company achieved clinical milestones for Ranger Drug Coated Balloon and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device. Also, post the suspension of Lotus valve in Europe, the ACURATE TAVR valve platform continues to build momentum.Boston Scientific recently announced several acquisitions, including NxThera and nVision in Urology and Pelvic Health, EmCision in Endoscopy, Securus in EP and Millipede in Structural Heart. This inorganic expansion plan bodes well for the stock’s operational growth.BaxterStrong demand for Baxter’s CRRT, injectable pharmaceuticals, U.S. IV solutions and peritoneal dialysis therapies is a positive. The buyouts of RECOTHORM and PREVELEAK are noteworthy as well.Recently, the company got the FDA approval for Spectrum IQ Infusion System. Baxter’s surgical portfolio is highly diversified, with products available in more than 60 countries. It includes exclusive products like FLOSEAL Hemostatic Matrix, TISSEEL Fibrin Sealant, COSEAL Surgical Sealant and VASCU-GUARD Patch among others.In ConclusionOur comparative analysis indicates that Boston Scientific is positioned better than Baxter, considering price performance as well as earnings and sales growth.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report). While Illumina sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), IDEXX carries a Zacks Rank #2.

208,BAX,"With the suspension of the controversial 2.3% medical device tax for another two years, the medical device industry is currently riding high on optimism. AdvaMed, the medical device industry’s lobbying group, which strongly advocated for this relief, noted that the tax repeal will provide a huge impetus to the companies to channelize their turnovers into strategic consolidations, research and developments and also help in creating new job opportunities.According to an article published in Daily News, the tax before going into effect from January 2020 will save the device companies as much as $3.7 billion during the two-year suspension.The U.S. medical device market is undergoing substantial transformation. An aging population, longer expectancy for life, growing healthcare awareness in emerging economies combined with powerful long-term tailwinds, including mergers & acquisitions (M&As) and product innovation, have been contributing to growth of the sector.M&A Boom Continues It is yet to be seen how far the benefits of the tax repeal have been redirected to M&As till now. Meanwhile, according to Mark Bonifacio, President of Bonifacio Consulting Services, private equity and strategic OEM (Original equipment manufacturer) buyers are competing for assets in all sectors of medical contract manufacturing and broadening their portfolios or investing in new technologies.He strongly stated that although the start of 2018 was sluggish with respect to M&As, it was due to uncertainties over changes in the global healthcare market and the fate of Obamacare’s medical device tax. Now that the doubts are gradually getting cleared, the industry is once again heading toward another year of significant M&A activity.This year’s biggest M&A deal seems to be in the cards with the Wall Street Journal’s latest rumored news related to two mammoths of MedTech space, Boston Scientific BSX and Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report). The report says that both the rivals may consider a bid for consolidation.The analysts seem to be optimistic about the rumored deal and believe that after the colossal mergers of Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report)-Covidien and Abbott (ABT)-St. Jude Medical in the last couple of years, Boston Scientific also needs to make a mammoth move to maintain its foothold in the highly competitive medical-technology space.Following the company’s $25 billion consolidation with St. Jude Medical in January, Abbott ABT recently closed the $5.3-billion acquisition of Alere. With the successful wrap up of this transaction, the combined company is anticipated to emerge as a leading player in the $7 billion point-of-care diagnostic space.Another mega consolidation in the recent times was that of medical device major, Becton, Dickinson and Co. and medical, surgical, diagnostic, and patient care devices provider C. R. Bard, for $24 billion. After the completion of the deal in January, Becton, Dickinson is on its way to expand to new areas like vascular access segments – PICCs (peripherally inserted central catheters), midlines and drug delivery ports.Baxter International BAX purchased RECOTHROM Thrombin topical and PREVELEAK Surgical Sealant from specialty pharmaceutical company Mallinckrodt plc (MNK  -  Free Report).Varian Medical (VAR  -  Free Report) also inked a major M&A deal. The company recently signed an agreement to acquire Australia-based global life sciences company, Sirtex Medical Limited for a total deal value of $1.28 billion. The investment will strengthen the company’s position in interventional oncology therapies. This apart, in its effort to gain foothold in the emerging economy, the company recently acquired Cooperative CL Enterprises, a leading distributor of radiotherapy equipment in Taiwan.Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) subsidiary DePuy Synthes inked a deal to acquire Medical Enterprises Distribution in May.This apart, in 2018, Boston Scientific announced several strategic acquisitions including NxThera and nVision in Urology and Pelvic Health, EmCision in Endoscopy, Securus in EP and Millipede in Structural Heart. This inorganic expansion plan bodes well for the stocks’ operational growth.Divestments Medical device majors continue to offload their non-core business lines and assets that are similar to the ones acquired through mergers to focus on the main segments. These divestures have been mandated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and other international anti-trust regulators. This restricts chances of monopoly in the market.Earlier this month, Johnson & Johnson got a $2.7 billion offer from Fortive Corporation to sell its subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc.’s Advanced Sterilization Products business units to Fortive. If JNJ accepts the proposal, it will be a step toward streamlining of its business per its strategic roadmap for better resource utilization and higher shareholders’ return.This apart, according to a MASSDEVICE report, Medtronic recently divested its stake in LifeTech Scientific to China Everbright Ltd. and another unnamed investor. BD also divested its soft tissue core needle biopsy line and Aspira product line to Merit Medical for $100 million. The divestment is related to its acquisition of C.R. Bard.In April, Henry Schein HSIC announced its decision to spin off the company’s major segment global Animal Health business. We believe this initiative remains part of Henry Schein's 2018-2020 Strategic Plans to focus more on dental and medical businesses. According to the company, this transaction will enable it to make the most of the opportunities in the dental space in order to deliver quality clinical care and advanced wellness and prevention.Apprehending that China’s drug distribution reform may slow down the company’s growth in the region (according to a Reuters report), Cardinal Health sold off its China business to Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding for $1.2 billion.Following the announcement of its two major buyouts, Abbott divested its eye care business Abbott Medical Optics (AMO) to Johnson & Johnson for about $4.33 billion to streamline its newly added business lines.A marketer of aesthetic treatment systems, Cynosure, sold itself to Hologic. Notably, Hologic acquired all outstanding Cynosure shares for approximately $1.65 billion.Emerging Market Healthcare Scenario Bright A survey report by Gallup Analytics last July revealed that U.S. adults cited healthcare as the second major problem faced by the country under the new presidential administration. Following the new healthcare reform announcement in December 2017, a Gallup poll revealed that the past decade marked the biggest increase in the uninsured rate.Meanwhile, with exploding population, rising middle class and increasing governmental awareness of health issues, emerging geographies are facing huge demand for modern but cheaper healthcare options. Going by a report in The Guardian, International Finance Corp’s (IFJ) data shows that developing countries account for 80% of global deaths from chronic diseases indicating enormous market opportunity.Per a recent BCG report, the share of emerging markets, which is currently less than a quarter of global MedTech revenues, is likely to increase to nearly one-third of revenues by 2022. The MedTech market in China, currently the second largest in the world, is projected to grow about 13% annually from 2015 through 2022. India, the fifth largest MedTech market in the world, currently records 17% annual growth. At this pace, India may emerge as a strong competitor to Japan and Germany by 2022.Given the huge potential in these regions, long back, Johnson & Johnson had set up manufacturing and R&D centers in Brazil, China and India. The company’s emerging markets medical device segment continues to grow three to four times faster than the developed markets.Abbott continues to lead the emerging market investment trend with about 50% of sales from this region. In the recent quarters, sales in key emerging markets were up in double digits, driven by strength in BRIC as well as strong growth in several countries throughout Latin America, including Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Argentina.At Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report), in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, businesses in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, Eastern Europe and China showed sustained strength, growing in double digits.

209,BAX,"The global medical device industry has demonstrated strong and sustainable growth in the recent past. Banking on an aging population, increasing incidence of chronic and lifestyle diseases, increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and big-data applications, upbeat consumer sentiment and increased business investments, this sector appears to be in the pink of health.Going by KPMG data, the medical device industry’s global annual sales is forecast to rise more than 5% a year to reach nearly $800 billion by 2030.A CISION report says that the United States is the largest medical device market in the world at present, raking in more than $180 billion in revenues. Despite several socio-political hazards and economic dips, U.S. medical device companies have been riding high on R&D innovation, increasing consolidation, emerging market expansion and tax cuts.Undoubtedly, it has been a very profitable investment space of late.Here are a few major developments:Abolition of MedTech Tax The bipartisan two-year suspension of the Medical Device tax, which imposed a 2.3% excise tax on MedTech manufacturers, marks a temporary relief. It will be again put into effect from Jan 1, 2020.The repeal is expected to boost hiring and investment at 9,000 America-based medical device manufacturers, thus instilling investor optimism.The ratification of the tax-repeal amendment has encouraged massive investments in the sector.M&A Uptrend ContinuesApart from the tax relief, the MedTech fraternity has also been riding high on the ongoing merger and acquisition (M&A) trends in the space. In fact, various reports suggest that M&A has been the key catalyst driving the U.S. healthcare space of late. Per data provided by BioSpectrum Asia, M&A activity in the MedTech space surged 50% in 2017, increasing the value of aggregate M&A to more than $200 billion.Some of the major acquisitions in the recent past include Becton, Dickinson and Company’s (BDX  -  Free Report) acquisition of C. R. Bard and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) buyout of Actelion.PBM-Health Insurers ConsolidationLately, health insurers have been looking to collaborate with pharmacy benefit managers in the MedTech space to streamline costs in the drug supply chain.Buoyed by continued capital inflow, strategic M&A policies by key medical device players have expanded customer bases, moderated leverage and enhanced cash flow. These have also alleviated pricing pressure and competition in the MedTech space.In this regard, the latest buyout announcement of Express Scripts by Cigna (CI  -  Free Report), which comes just three months after drug chain and pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp’s (CVS  -  Free Report) announcement to acquire the nation's third-largest health insurer, Aetna, is important.Digital Revolution and MedTechLatest trends like robotic surgeries, Big-data analytics, bio printing, 3D printing, electronic health records (EHR), predictive analytics, real-time alerting and revenue cycle management services in the U.S. MedTech space are gaining prominence.Various reports suggest that the strategic application of AI in every sphere of healthcare can provide an impetus to productivity. Companies that adopted AI technologies have witnessed a 50% reduction in healthcare costs and have also experienced improved patient outcome of more than 50%.This along with a rise in minimally-invasive surgeries, higher demand for liquid biopsy tests and use of IT for quick and improved patient care, and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model have been driving profits at medical device companies of late.Trade War Fears Grip MedTechThe 10 sectors that have been identified by Trump for imposition of higher tariff are now on investors’ radar. Healthcare, including medical equipment, is one of the sectors, likely to bear the brunt of the trade dispute.Going by data provided in an article by Christian B. Jones in Mondaq, MedTech firms in the United States currently sell $4.7 billion annually to China, while the nation imports from China a total of $5 billion in medical device. U.S. exports of medical devices last year totaled $52 billion, creating a $1 billion worldwide trade surplus. Needless to say, the medical device lobby is extremely apprehensive about the proposed tariffs on Chinese products as it could significantly affect international trade.Zacks Industry RankWithin the Zacks Industry classification, Medical Device is broadly grouped into the Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) and further sub-divided into four industries at the expanded level: Medical - Instruments, Medical - Products, Medical - Dental Supplies and Medical Info Systems.We rank all 250-plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each.The Zacks Industry Rank is #70 (top 27% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries) for Medical Info Systems, #84 (top 33%) for Medical - Dental Supplies, #108 (top 42%) for Medical - Instruments and #189 (bottom 26%) for Medical - Products. Our backtesting shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Upon analyzing the Zacks Industry Rank for different Medical Device segments, it can be said that apart for certain medical product stocks, the near-term outlook for the aforementioned Medical device subsectors is overall positive.Price PerformanceThe price performance of two major Zacks categorized sub industries, are as follows:Over the past 30 days, while the S&P 500 has gained 2.2%, the med instruments space has risen 3.6%. Some of the stocks within this space that have been trading above the S&P are Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report), STERIS plc (STE  -  Free Report) and Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW  -  Free Report).While the Medical Product subsector’s industry rank indicated a bearish tone, the sector has increased 2.9% in this period. Some players from this space are Haemonetics Corp. (HAE  -  Free Report), Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) and Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report).Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

210,BAX,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Baxter International BAX)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 7% over the past month. BAX hit a new 52-week high of $75.62 in the previous session. Baxter International has gained 16.6% since the start of the year compared to the 1.7% move for the Medical sector and the 10.8% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 26, 2018, Baxter International reported EPS of $0.7 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.62 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.13%.For the current fiscal year, Baxter International is expected to post earnings of $2.89 per share on $11.37 billion in revenues. This represents a 16.53% change in EPS on a 7.65% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $3.22 per share on $11.89 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 11.51% and 4.61%, respectively.Valuation MetricsBaxter International may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for BAX? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Baxter International has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 26.1X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 19.2X versus its peer group's average of 19.7X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.95. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Baxter International Inc. Price and Consensus  Baxter International Inc. Price and Consensus | Baxter International Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Baxter International currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Baxter International passes the test. Thus, it seems as though BAX shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.How Does Baxter International Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Baxter International have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks, including Surmodics (SRDX  -  Free Report), Haemonetics (HAE  -  Free Report), and Stryker (SYK  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.However, it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking, so it isn't all good news for Baxter International. Still, the fundamentals for BAX are promising, and it still has potential despite being at a 52-week high.

215,BAX,"On May 14, we issued an updated research report on BioScrip, Inc. (BIOS  -  Free Report). Although the company struggles with reimbursement challenges, its core business continues to grow. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).BioScrip exited the first quarter of 2018 on a dismal note with lower-than-expected earnings performance. Although, revenues were above the consensus mark, the huge year-over-year decline was a disappointment. This downside was due to a shift in the company’s strategy to focus on growing core revenue mix including contract changes with United Healthcare in September 2017.Also, external challenges like reimbursement cuts pertaining to the 21st century Cures Act hampered growth in 2017 and the trend is expected to persist in 2018 as well. In the past three months, shares of BioScrip have underperformed the industry. The stock has lost 15.4% against the 1% gain of the broader industry.On a positive note, this Denver, CO-based leading Infusion Service provider has continued to progress with its multi-faceted CORE plan to improve the finances.

217,BAX,"A 52-week high level is generally an indicator for investors as stocks near that level are perceived to be winners.Often investors tend to worry if the stock is overpriced considering the high price level. While the apprehensions are not absolutely groundless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, in an attempt to avoid the steep prices of stocks that are near the 52-week high mark, an investor might miss out on top gainers.A stock can maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs with time. So, a more informed approach to understand if any further upside is left is beneficial in these cases.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks:Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing, this technique bets on “buy high, sell higher.”52-Week High: A Good IndicatorMany a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite potential as investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.In fact, overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors’ focus (or willingness to pay premium) has helped them reach the level. But that doesn’t always mean an impending decline. The factors — such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions — that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Setting the Right FiltersWe ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers, in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring continuation of their rally for some time.Current Price/52 Week High >= .80This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.% Change Price – 4 Weeks > 0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.% Change Price – 12 Weeks > 0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.Price/Sales <= XIndMedThe lower, the better.P/E using F(1) Estimate <= XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) >= XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.Zacks Rank <=2No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price >= 5This parameter will help screen stocks that are trading at $5 or higher.Volume – 20 days (shares) >= 100000Inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares, so trading is easier.Here are five of the 41 stocks that made it through the screen:Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. (SWM  -  Free Report) is a global provider of engineered solutions & advanced materials. The company delivered an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 13.2% and has a Zacks Rank #2.Insight Enterprises, Inc.

218,BAX,"On May 2, we issued an updated research report on GNC Holdings, Inc. (GNC  -  Free Report). We are upbeat about the company’s strategies to strengthen international presence. However, cut-throat competition continues to pose a challenge. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This leading global specialty retailer of products for health and wellness, including vitamins, minerals, herbal supplement, sports nutrition and diets, has been underperforming its industry over the past year. The company has lost 50.9% compared with the 21.4% decline of the industry.GNC Holdings exited the first quarter of 2018 on a dismal note with year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings and revenues. Additionally, in the United States, GNC Holdings competes with heavily advertised national brands of large pharmaceutical and food companies as well as other retailers. This leads to increased price competition for the company as more participants are entering the market. On a positive note, GNC Holdings’ international business has been a key driver of growth in recent years. Management expects to continue capitalizing on international revenue growth opportunities through the addition of franchise stores in existing markets, expansion into new high-growth markets and the growth of product distribution in both existing and new markets.In this regard, GNC Holdings recently announced the receipt of Hayao shareholders’ vote for the strategic partnership and China joint venture agreement with Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Holding (Hayao). Further, the company recently entered into a master franchise agreement with Rapid Nutrition to foray into Australia.At the same time, GNC Holdings has announced plans to expand presence in India where it operates in collaboration with the master franchise partner — Guardian Healthcare Services Pvt.

220,BAX,"Home to more than half of the world’s population, Asia Pacific or APAC, has significant unmet healthcare needs and holds attractive growth potential for the MedTech bigwigs. Adding further optimism to this corner of healthcare is Trump’s clear focus on this market.Per an article published on Economic Times, the Asian healthcare market is expected to grow from $1835 billion in 2016 to more than $2660 billion by 2020. The upside can be attributed to improved access to healthcare facilities amid increased government and private investments.US-China Trade WarMeanwhile, investors are concerned about the ongoing trade dispute which can severely hurt U.S. MedTech companies’ profits in the emerging market.Accusing China of unfair trade practices, President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on another $200 billion of imports from China just days after slapping punitive duties on $34 billion of Chinese goods. This was followed by an immediate retaliation by China, which imposed tariffs on U.S. exports of $3 billion. The blow followed Trump’s proposal of implementing tariffs on more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods.Per an article by Christian B. Jones in Mondaq, MedTech firms in the United States currently sell $4.7 billion worth of medical devices annually to China and import a total of $5 billion.Going by a JP Morgan report, the trade war can bring collateral damage to countries closely tied to China’s supply chain, including South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia Singapore and Thailand.India & Korea Relations Raise HopeAmid the trade-war uproar, Trump’s latest stance toward the rest of APAC has been a breather for investors. In his last landmark Asia trip, Trump revealed stronger reliance on India as a strategic partner. In fact, he sees India at the heart of his Asia policy.In keeping with this, Trump’s new policy on lowering drug prices can have a positive impact on the U.S.-India bilateral trade relations. This can further help fix prices of certain exorbitant pharmaceuticals and medical devices.An Emergo article shows that the Indian medical device market was valued at $3.5 billion in 2015 and can expand to $4.8 billion by 2019. Moreover, a Business Standard article suggests that India’s import of medical devices from the United States grew from INR61.5 billion in 2014-15 to INR74.2 billion in 2017-18.Meanwhile, U.S. ties with North Korea seem to be improving. In the recent historic summit with President Kim Jong-un, Trump put the age-old war tactics on hold with Korea.In the summit, Trump swore to provide security guarantees to the DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) and complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.The successful nuclear talks are likely to pave the way for a mutually beneficial trading relationship beginning at some point in the future.Per data published on the Korea Country Commercial Guide, in 2017, total imports of medical devices by Korea grossed $3 billion, with the United States contributing more than $1.4 billion. Furthermore, the U.S. market share represents approximately 47% of the Korean import market.Choosing the Right StocksWhile the economy is gradually focusing on the lucrative Asia-Pacific market, it is the right time for investors to cash in on the opportunities in this market. We have shortlisted a few medical device stocks which have carved out a niche in the Asian market. Such stocks are likely to log massive gains, given their solid stand in the APAC region at present.Our first pick is Baxter International (BAX  -  Free Report) which has a solid presence in Asia, with research hubs in Japan and China. The company’s renal care team recently launched KAGUYA peritoneal dialysis technology in Japan. In 2017, Baxter completed the acquisition of India-based Claris Injectables, a global generic injectables pharmaceutical company, for almost $625 million. The buyout bolstered Baxter’s foothold in the generic pharmaceuticals space. In the same year, Baxter signed an agreement with India-based Dorizoe Lifesciences for the expansion of its generic injectables pipeline.The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has outperformed the industry in a year’s time. The company’s shares have rallied 22%, compared with the industry’s rise of 13.2%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Next on our list is Align Technology (ALGN  -  Free Report). The Zacks Rank #2 company’s Invisalign Technology has been widely adopted in the APAC region. In the Asia-Pacific region, the company witnessed first-quarter volume growth of 56.1% led by China, Japan and Australia. Moreover, for Align Technology, China stands second to the largest market — United States. The company also introduced a clear Aligner solution for teen Class II correction — the Invisalign Technology Teen with mandibular advancement — in certain markets of APAC. The FDA approval for the same is expected in the second half of 2018.Over the past year, shares of Align Technology have skyrocketed 138.4%, compared with the industry’s rise of 6.5%.Investors can also consider Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG  -  Free Report). The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s flagship da Vinci in general surgery and urology procedures has been witnessing consistent growth in Asia. Intuitive Surgical also saw multispecialty growth in China in the last reported quarter.Recently, additional procedures were granted reimbursement by the Ministry of Health in Japan.

However, sales improved 1.6% from the prior-year figure.Meanwhile, in the past year, shares of AngioDynamics have rallied 17.9% against the industry’s decline of 12%.Geographical AnalysisU.S. net revenues in the quarter under review were $70.3 million, down 1% at constant currency (cc). Per management, the downside can be attributed to lower sales of Venous Insufficiency, PICCs, RFA (Radio Frequency Ablation) and NanoKnife product lines.International revenues totaled $18 million, up 9% at cc primarily owing to strong performance in Europe.Segmental AnalysisPeripheral Vascular (PV) businessSales in the segment came in at $52.6 million, which declined 2.5% on a year-over-year basis. Per management, growth in the Fluid Management, Angiographic catheters and AngioVac product lines was offset by declines in the Venous Insufficiency and Thrombolytic businesses.AngioVac procedural volumes remained strong and were up 14% year over year in the reported quarter.However, the Venous Insufficiency business continued to underperform. This was due to the discontinuation of exclusive use of the EVLT (Endovenous Laser System) products by the company’s largest customer.Vascular Access (VA) businessVascular Access net sales were $23.7 million, down 2.4% from the year-ago quarter. Per management, growth in Ports and Dialysis products was offset by declines in PICCs.Oncology/Surgery businessSales in this segment grossed $12.1 million, up a significant 38%. The upside can be attributed to strong growth in Solero Microwave Ablation System. However, an increase in sales of NanoKnife was partially offset by lower sales of RFA system.AngioDynamics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  AngioDynamics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | AngioDynamics, Inc. QuoteMargin AnalysisIn the quarter under review, gross profit totaled $47.5 million, up 12.1% on a year-over-year basis.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pinned at 93 cents, above the guided range.Free cash flow is expected between $38 million and $43 million.Our TakeAngioDynamics exited the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 on a dull note. Solid performance by the Oncology/Surgery segment is encouraging. Surging international sales buoy optimism. The company continues to witness strong growth in its oncology ablation, Solero and NanoKnife product lines. In the fourth quarter, the company witnessed a significant expansion in gross margin. Increased R&D investments in the thrombus management portfolio are a positive.On the flip side, underperformance of the core Peripheral Vascular and Vascular Access units raise concern. In the reported quarter, AngioDynamics saw persistent headwinds in the Venous Insufficiency business and PICC product lines. Declining sales in the United States and intense competition add to the woes.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAngioDynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked medical stocks in the broader medical space are Abiomed, Inc.

The continued instrument orders from BGI and China are encouraging. Furthermore, the company is well poised on expansion of SMRT Sequencing and product development activities. Meanwhile, a highly competitive environment raises concern. Falling consumer revenues adds to the woes.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space which have reported solid results this season are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report) and Baxter International Inc.

Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share of $10.95 lies within the range.The company raised the revenue growth guidance for fiscal 2018 to 5-5.5%, which is also at a high end of the previous guidance.Our TakeBecton, Dickinson ended the fiscal second quarter of 2018 on a promising note. Strong growth in BD Medical was primarily driven by Medication Delivery Solutions, Diabetes Care and Pharmaceutical Systems units. Meanwhile, the acquisition of C.R. Bard has proven accretive to fiscal second-quarter results. Internationally, BD posted strong revenues and has maintained its global foothold. However, declining margins raise concern. The recent product recalls and foreign exchange volatility are also likely to mar the company’s prospects.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space which have reported solid results this season are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report) and Baxter International Inc.

224,BAX,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Surmodics (SRDX  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 21.8% over the past month. SRDX hit a new 52-week high of $47.05 in the previous session. Surmodics has gained 66.8% since the start of the year compared to the -0.4% move for the Medical sector and the 7.8% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 2, 2018, Surmodics reported EPS of $0.07 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $-0.01 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 6.33%.For the current fiscal year, Surmodics is expected to post earnings of $-0.02 per share on $78.42 million in revenues. This represents a -103.92% change in EPS on a 7.26% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $-0.04 per share on $90.38 million in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of -100% and 15.25%, respectively.Valuation MetricsSurmodics may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for SRDX? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Surmodics has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.Surmodics, Inc. Price and Consensus Surmodics, Inc. Price and Consensus | Surmodics, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Surmodics currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Surmodics fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though SRDX shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does Surmodics Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Surmodics have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks, including Baxter International (BAX  -  Free Report), STERIS plc (STE  -  Free Report), and Varian Medical Systems (VAR  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.However, it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking, so it isn't all good news for Surmodics. Still, the fundamentals for SRDX are promising, and it still has potential despite being at a 52-week-high.

225,BAX,"President Donald Trump’s calling off of the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last Thursday was quite a shocker.The abandonement of summit plans dealt a blow to the underpenetrated and emerging markets of Asia, which are a solid source of revenues for more than 80% of U.S.-based multinational companies. The effects of the political mayhem caused the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, South Korea’s KOSPI and Japan’s Nikkei to plummet.Major Wall Street indices, S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, lost ground as well.Considering this trend of downward movements, the White House decided to conduct the meeting. The United States announced its plans to send a “pre-advance team” to Singapore to prepare for Trump-Kim summit on Jun 12.MedTech appears to be one of the very few sectors that might shelter investors from the political tension. Shrugging off the current volatility, the Medical-Products industry has returned 0.2% since the call-off against the S&P 500’s fall of 0.4%. In fact, analysts believe that the MedTech sector will be able to strengthen its foothold at a faster rate if the meeting goes on as planned.This is because there are a number of U.S.-based MedTech companies operating in Asia. Post the success of the summit, these companies will be able to spread their network in North Korea and augment overall production. Per research by Statista, the MedTech market in the Asia-Pacific region is estimated to reach a worth of around $78 billion in 2018.Buoyed by the encouraging projections, it would rather be interesting to see how the Medical-Product companies are placed amid the political turmoil.4 MedTech Stocks to GainMeanwhile, the Medical-Product companies have already been gaining from organic growth, R&D innovation, higher consolidation, tax abolition as well as focus on emerging markets including Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam, India, Philippines and more.In fact, stakeholders in the medical universe have been eyeing these markets over the last couple of years. These companies are bullish about growing medical awareness, economic prosperity, an aging population, increasing wealth, government’s focus on healthcare infrastructure and expansion of medical insurance coverage in the APAC space.Below, we take a look at four leading MedTech players that are gaining from the prospects in the APAC market:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report), popularly known as BD, particularly focuses on broader emerging markets like India, China, Brazil and Turkey, whose economic and healthcare sectors are growing rapidly. In particular, safety-engineered products continue to drive growth in the emerging markets. We believe that exposure in these markets will boost the top line, which in turn will accelerate EPS growth.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have returned 16.2% in a year, significantly higher than the S&P 500 index’s gain of 11.4%.Baxter International’s (BAX  -  Free Report) solid presence in Asia, precisely India, is worth a mention. The company has research hubs in Japan and China. Recently, Baxter completed the acquisition of India-based Claris Injectables, a global generic injectables pharmaceutical company, for almost $625 million.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has outperformed the S&P 500 index in a year’s time. The stock has returned 21%. Intuitive Surgical Inc’s (ISRG  -  Free Report) growing interest in the emerging markets, specifically in the APAC region, bodes well. In the past two years, the company’s procedure performance in Asia projected consistent strength. The company registered solid growth in China, Japan and Korea.The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s shares have returned 49.1% in a year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Boston Scientific Corporation’s (BSX  -  Free Report) growth strategy comprises the pursuit of development opportunities outside the United Station through strengthening of global presence, inclusive of emerging markets. Against the backdrop of flattening or declining sales growth in developed markets like the United States and Europe, Boston Scientific is fortifying its foothold in the emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC).In first-quarter 2018, business from the emerging markets registered 17% growth. Business in China was once again remarkable (up 23% year over year). The company is currently projecting an improvement in performance in China banking on the recent approval of SYNERGY.This Zacks Rank #2 stock has returned 11.7% in a year. Things to Remember“Things are not so easy as they appear to be!”Americans should never forget that former president George W. Bush referred North Korea as an ‘Axis of evil,’ as it sponsored terrorism and had solid access to nuclear weapons.Further, North Korea's multiple trials of nuclear warheads have dampened the inter-country relationship. Analysts believe that an unforeseen summit may not solve these age-old problems. Further, no one can guarantee that Kim Jong Un’s ‘tremendous anger and open hostility’ will not offend Trump anymore as it did last week.However, Trump’s team is expecting to reach an agreement to settle the North Korean nuclear and other issues in the meeting.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

226,BAX,"Shares of Orthofix International N.V. (OFIX  -  Free Report) have lost 13% over the past two weeks since the company’s first-quarter 2018 earnings release on Apr 30, 2018.Despite better-than-expected bottom line numbers, shares dropped due to lowered earnings outlook for the company in 2018. Over this period, the company has also significantly underperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has lost 12.5% against the industry’s 3.7% gain.Let us delve deeper into the earnings details of Orthofix:The company reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 39 cents from continuing operations. The figure was ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.3%. The bottom line surged 44.4% year over year primarily on strong sales growth at the company’s BioStim, Extremity Fixation and Spine Fixation strategic business units (SBU). Excluding one-time items, net income from continuing operations in the first quarter came in at 27 cents per share versus the net loss from continuing operations of 13 cents, thereby showing a remarkable year-over-year improvement.Sales DetailsOrthofix’s first-quarter sales improved 5.8% (up 3.3% at constant exchange rate or CER) to $108.7 million, almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $109 million. As a result of the company’s adoption of the revenue recognition accounting change at the beginning of 2018, Orthofix noted that if it converts the consolidated revenues of first-quarter 2017 into the new standard, growth would have been 2.4% at CER in the reported quarter. Sales were primarily driven by a strong performance by the company’s three SBUs, namely BioStim, Extremity Fixation and Spine Fixation, partly offset by a year-over-year decline in Biologics business.SBU DetailsFor the first quarter, the company posted BioStim sales of $46.2 million, reflecting 3.6% (same at CER) growth from the prior-year period. Extremity Fixation sales were $27.5 million in the quarter under review with 14.9% improvement (up 4.3% at CER) from first-quarter 2017. The company realized a continued uptake of new products and a commendable performance in most of the company’s global markets including the United States.Orthofix International N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Orthofix International N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Orthofix International N.V. QuoteOrthofix reported Spine Fixation SBU sales of $20.7 million, reflecting 7.5% (up 7.2% at CER) growth over the year-earlier quarter. This uptick can be attributed to product launches and the adopted strategic initiatives.Biologics SBU sales totaled $14.3 million, down 4.4% (same at CER) from the year-ago quarter. This decline resulted from the contractual reduction in the marketing service fee percentage that Orthofix receives from MTF Biologics.MarginsIn the first quarter, gross margin contracted 23 basis points (bps) to 77.8%. Unfavorable sales mix impacted the quarterly gross margin.Sales and marketing expenses rose 3.6% year over year to $50.2 million. General and Administrative expenses were up 6.6% to $19.5 million. The company witnessed a 6.6% decrease in research and development expenses to $6.9 million. Overall, adjusted operating margin expanded 148 bps to 7.2% owing to increased operating expenses.Cash PositionOrthofix exited the first quarter of 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $77.1 million compared with $81.2 million at the end of 2017. For the first quarter, net cash used in operating activities was $3.6 million compared with $10.8 million a year ago.2018 GuidanceOrthofix has lowered its 2018 earnings view as it expects Biologic sales to be flat or less by low single digits for the full year due to contractual decrease in the marketing service fee the company is going to receive from MTF Biologics. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations are expected in the range of $1.58-$1.78, falling below the earlier-projected band of $1.76-$1.84. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year adjusted EPS stands at $1.67, within the company’s projected range.Full-year net sales projection has been increased to the band of $458-$464 million (earlier prediction was $450-$455 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year revenues is pegged at $462.7 million, lying within but near the upper end of the guided range.Our TakeOrthofix exited the first quarter of 2018 on a mixed note. While earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate, sales almost matched the consensus mark. Investors are upset about poor Biologics prospects, which will continue to be a drag on the overall performance throughout the remainder of the year. Accordingly, the company has to reduce its full-year earnings expectation.This apart, currency fluctuations, a competitive landscape and macroeconomic headwinds continue to pose challenges to the company. Moreover, higher costs and operating expenses are a matter of grave concern for Orthofix. Also, heavy dependence on a third party for final distribution of products exposes the company to heightened risks. On a positive note, the top line was substantially driven by strength in Extremity Fixation as well as Spine Fixation businesses, which are expected to continue in the near term on the back of sales force enhancements, expanded distributorship network and introduction of products.Zacks Rank & Key PicksOrthofix carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space, having posted solid results this earnings season are, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Chemed Corp.

227,BAX,"A 52-week high level generally works as an indicator for investors as stocks near that level are perceived to be winners.Notably, investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced considering the high price level. While the apprehensions are not absolutely baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, an investor might miss out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices of stocks that are near the 52-week high mark.However, a stock can maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs with time. So, one should take a more informed approach to understand if any further upside is left.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks:Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing, this technique bets on “buy high, sell higher.”52-Week High: A Good IndicatorMany a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite potential due as investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending.In fact, overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors’ focus (or willingness to pay premium) has helped them reach the level. But that doesn’t always mean an impending decline. The factors — such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions — that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Also, when a string of positive developments dominate the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Setting the Right FiltersWe ran a screen to zero in on 52-week high stocks (trading near the high level) that hold tremendous upside potential. The screen includes parameters to shortlist stocks with strong earnings growth expectations, sturdy value metrics and price momentum.Moreover, the screen filters stocks that are relatively undervalued compared to their peers, in terms of earnings as well as sales, ensuring continuation of their rally for some time.Current Price/52 Week High >= .80This is the ratio between the current price and the highest price at which the stock has traded in the past 52 weeks. A value greater than 0.8 implies that the stock is trading within 20% of its 52-week high range.% Change Price – 4 Weeks > 0It ensures that the stock price has moved north over the past four weeks.% Change Price – 12 Weeks > 0This metric guarantees a continued upward price momentum for the stock over the past three months as well.Price/Sales <= XIndMedThe lower, the better.P/E using F(1) Estimate <= XIndMedThis metric measures the amount an investor puts into a company to obtain one dollar of earnings. It narrows down the list of stocks to those that are undervalued compared to the industry.One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) >= XIndMedThis helps choose stocks that have higher growth rates than the industry. This is a meaningful indicator, as decent earnings growth adds to investor optimism.Zacks Rank <=2No screening is complete without our proven Zacks Rank, which has proved its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to brave adversities and beat the market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price >= 5This parameter will help screen stocks that are trading at $5 or higher.Volume – 20 days (shares) >= 100000Inclusion of this metric ensures that there is a substantial volume of shares, so trading is easier.Here are five of the 37 stocks that made it through the screen:Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc.

(BAX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 earnings on Jul 26, before the market opens.We expect the company to see steady growth on the back of its international ventures.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.89, within the guided range.For the second quarter of 2018, the company expects sales growth of approximately 5% at cc. Baxter expects adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 69-71 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pinned at 71 cents, at the high end of the guided range.Strategic BuyoutsBaxter has been banking on strategic acquisitions and collaborations to enhance its existing product portfolio.Recently, Baxter completed the acquisition of RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK from Mallinckrodt, with a view to boost its surgical portfolio of hemostats and sealants. Notably, the company bought RECOTHROM Thrombin topical and PREVELEAK Surgical Sealant product lines from Mallinckrodt.Though the buyout did not prove accretive in the last reported quarter, management expects the deal to be modestly rewarding in 2018.From the acquisition of Claris Injectables Limited, Baxter expects revenues worth $145 million in 2018.Lately, Baxter announced a partnership with International Society of Nephrology (ISN) to spread awareness on chronic kidney disease awareness and its therapy in emerging markets. This reflects Baxter’s focus on specializing in renal care.Cyclophosphamide CompetitionCyclophosphamide is part of Baxter's Hospital Products segment, which has been underperforming over the last five years. For 2018, Baxter expects U.S. cyclophosphamide sales of around $120 million, up from the previous guidance of $95 million. However, the guided figure is much lower than $185 million in 2017.What Our Model PredictsOur quantitative model does not predict an earnings beat for Baxter this quarter.This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.

230,BAX,"There is no sign of respite from the ongoing market uncertainty due to apprehensions of a trade war. On the one hand, Asian stocks have started to revive on improvement in U.S-North Korea relationship while on the other hand, investors are restraining themselves on possibilities of trade loss due to the proposed China trade restrictions.Medical Device Caught in the Trade War StormGoing by data provided in an article by Christian B. Jones in Mondaq, MedTech firms in the United States currently sell $4.7 billion annually to China, while the nation imports from China a total of $5 billionin medical device. U.S. exports of medical devices last year totaled $52 billion, creating a $1 billion worldwide trade surplus.Needless to say, the medical device lobby is extremely apprehensive about the proposed tariffs on Chinese products as it could significantly affect international trade. MedTech trade group AdvaMed made a more specific comment claiming that the Chinese tariffs account for more than half of all MedTech imports from the region (in a MassDevice article). The trade group stated that, “for our industry, the proposed additional tariff of 25% on imports of nearly $3bn of medical technology products is the wrong action at the wrong time.""AdvaMed countered United States Trade Representative’s (USTR) claim of China’s unfair trade practices in medical devices harming U.S. exports significantly. The group argued that the U.S. trades with China on medical devices on the USTR list are in fact in slight surplus. Accordingly, if the proposed tariffs on diagnostic products and other medical devices made in both the United States and China are not dropped, it may result in trade imbalance.Per RBC Capital Markets estimates, if the proposed 25% tariffs get implemented, this could cost the medical device industry up to $1.5 billion each year.Going by the latest update, per a Financial Express report, a bipartisan group of 40 lawmakers has urged US Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer to remove $3 billion worth of medical devices from the list of Chinese products proposed by the Trump administration for additional tariff.Investors in Trouble?With the risk of a trade war between the two largest economies heightening, investment in medical device stocks is taking a backseat.The proposed imposition of additional tariff on Chinese products and China’s retaliatory efforts have resulted in widespread share losses so far in the Medical device sector. Bearish emerging market trade outlook has dealt severe blows to the bigwigs. We note that the sector has gained significantly from profits earned by a number of medical device companies from the BRIC nations.In this regard, we note that stocks like Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report), GE Healthcare (GE  -  Free Report) and others are witnessing considerable weakness since Mar 23, when talks of a U.S.-China trade war started doing the rounds. We note that Medtronic earlier bought orthopedic devices maker, China Kanghui Holdings and since then has been consistently shipping products to the United States from this operation. If these shipments are now subject to additional tariff, it will definitely hamper the company’s China business.GE Healthcare has also urged the administration to remove certain parts from the list of Chinese products for additional tariff. Going by a Mass Device report, China produced parts are essential for a number of GE’s devices, including ultrasound machines, patient monitors, MRI machines, CT machines and X-ray machines, some of which are produced by GE owned facilities in China while others are produced by local Chinese companies.3 MedTech Stocks to Counter the Trade Restriction HazardConcerns about the implementation of the trade tariffs on MedTech products have been weighing on stocks lately. Even though the market has not yet shown any steady plunge, such fears are likely to dampen investor sentiment going forward.We have shortlisted three MedTech stocks, which, in spite of the tumultuous market conditions, are well poised on strong fundamentals and timely strategic developments. Our selection is also backed by a good Zacks Growth Score and Zacks Rank.We have narrowed down our choices with the help of our new Style Score system.Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) offer the best investment opportunities in the value investing space. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report): Although, the company has a strong presence in overseas markets, it has no such business relation with China. Hence, in spite of considering international diversification as a core component of the company’s strategy, the company can very well sidestep the volatility of the U.S.-China trade war and continue to enjoy the bountiful scope offered by emerging markets. The company, in fact, is benefiting from developing countries' incremental investments in health care systems.Baxter has a Growth Score of A and a Zacks Rank #2. The company has an impressive long-term expected growth rate of 16.3%, higher than the industry’s 10.3%.Varian Medical Systems Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report): In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, Varian Medical’s global market share growth was driven by orders-based share gains in EMEA. In fact, Varian Medical was awarded a contract for eight TrueBeam systems in Stockholm, Sweden. Further, the company signed an agreement to acquire Australia-based, Sirtex, which focused on interventional oncology therapies. This apart, Varian Medical has recently announced the opening of a new facility in Jundiaí, Brazil, which extends its global manufacturing and training footprint in the region. Although Varian Medical has business in Greater China, the company’s huge global base outside the country shields it from severe damage that may occur as a result of the trade restriction.Varian Medical has a Growth Score of B and a Zacks Rank #2.ABIOMED, Inc. (ABMD  -  Free Report): Just like Baxter, despite having strong international foothold, ABIOMED does not have any significant presence in China.

233,BAX,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Baxter International (BAX  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 3.6% over the past month. BAX hit a new 52-week high of $73.04 in the previous session. Baxter International has gained 12.2% since the start of the year compared to the -0.8% move for the Medical sector and the 9% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 26, 2018, Baxter International reported EPS of $0.7 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.62 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.13%.For the current fiscal year, Baxter International is expected to post earnings of $2.89 per share on $11.37 billion in revenues. This represents a 16.53% change in EPS on a 7.65% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $3.22 per share on $11.89 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 11.51% and 4.61%, respectively.Valuation MetricsBaxter International may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for BAX? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Baxter International has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 25.1X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 18.5X versus its peer group's average of 19.5X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.87. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Baxter International Inc. Price and Consensus Baxter International Inc. Price and Consensus | Baxter International Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front.

The company registered strong bookings on business office services. However, subscription bookings were lower than expected.Cerner Corporation Price and Consensus  Cerner Corporation Price and Consensus | Cerner Corporation QuoteSegment DetailsInstead of reporting in three revenue categories — system sales, support maintenance and services — Cerner reported in six segments in the first quarter.Licensed software in the first quarter fell 5.3% to $134.8 million, on a year-over-year basis. Lower-than expected subscription bookings marred growth in the segment.Subscriptions accounted for revenues worth $76.6 million, down 32.4% on a year-over-year basis.Professional services increased 11.3% year over year to $441.3 million. Per management, strong performance in the segment is likely to enhance  revenue cycle position.Managed services segment revenues were $268.3 million, up 3.3% year over year.Support and maintenance revenues were $284.6 million, up 8.6% year over year.Reimbursed Travel sales amounted to $23.9 million, up 6% from the year-ago quarter.MarginsGross margin in the first quarter was 82.1%, almost flat year over year.Operating margin for the reported quarter was 15.1%, which contracted 427 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.The downside was caused by surge in operating expenses, which rose 6% year over year.

Operating cash flow totaled $409 million.Long-term debt, including capital lease obligations, was $527 million, down slightly on a sequential basis.View DownbeatCerner expects second-quarter 2018 revenues between $1.31 billion and $1.36 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.38 billion for the same, is higher than the projected range.The second quarter of 2018 adjusted earnings per share is projected in the range of 59-61 cents.

Revenues came below expectations due to software issues, technology resale, lesser-than-expected subscription bookings and the delay of the VA contract. A downbeat guidance indicates concerns for the stock. Further, lower margins on technology resale, resulting from higher mix of device resale is a concern. Additionally, Cerner has been facing macroeconomic challenges along with cutthroat competition in niche space. Surging operating expenses also add to the woes.International growth is likely to boost with the company’s prospects in Australia, Canada, Middle East, U.K., Ireland and Germany. Cerner witnessed strong cash flow and record bookings. We believe that the company has growth opportunities in the revenue cycle management (RCM), Population Health and ambulatory markets based on its product strength and enviable track record of adding new clients. Solid growth in the HealtheIntent platform also holds promise. Further, the company recently reported a suite of developments in its EHR platform.Q1 Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space which reported solid earnings this season are Baxter International Inc.

Further, the company lowered the EBITDA expectations largely due to strategic investments and lower-than-expected gross margins. However, Accuray continues to rides on the market’s solid response to the Radixact platform and the company’s revamped software.On the flip side, long sales and implementation cycles of the CyberKnife and TomoTherapy systems can majorly affect the company’s top line.

Strong sales in the United States and Europe raise optimism. A raised guidance for 2018 also paints a bright picture. On the flip side, declining margins owing to surging R&D expenses raise concern.

Solid contribution from Sensor revenues, Transmitter revenues and Receiver revenues are key catalysts at the moment. The glucose monitoring market represents significant commercial opportunity for DexCom.

Further, the company’s next-generation fully-disposable CGM systems is also in progressOn the flip side, cutthroat competition in the market for blood & glucose monitoring devices is a headwind for DexCom at the moment. We believe the company’s margins will continue to be under pressure in the coming quarters, owing to high product development costs and rising expenditures on research & development. Lower expected margins on transmitter sales are also a cause of concern.Q1 Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space, which reported solid earnings this season, are Baxter International Inc.

Notably, royalty and license fee revenues totaled $8.4 million, up from the year-ago quarter’s $1.1 million.

Surmodics issued a solid guidance for fiscal 2018. The company's solid initiatives to strengthen research and development programs bode well.On the flip side, the company witnessed significantly high operating losses. Product sales declined due to shipment issues, particularly in the Medical Device segment. Further, foreign-exchange woes related to the Creagh Medical buyout have been a major dampener.

QuoteMargin AnalysisGross Profit increased 10.7% year over year to $1.91 billion.As a percentage of revenues, gross margin expanded 30 basis points (bps) to 5.7% of net revenues.GuidanceThe company slashed guidance for fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share to $4.85-$4.95. The current range is significantly lower than the previous estimate of $5.25-$5.50. The downside was caused by the company's effective tax rate associated with the Cordis business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues is pegged at $136.11 billion.   Our TakeCardinal Health exited the quarter on a tepid note with adjusted earnings missing the consensus mark. The company witnessed encouraging performance in the Medical segment. The Pharmaceutical segment registered strong growth in the Specialty business and gained a large number of Pharmaceutical Distribution customers. Further, the company is banking on strategic buyouts, joint ventures and supply agreements to drive growth.Despite growth in business, profits in the Pharmaceutical segment were hurt by generic pharmaceutical pricing.

253,BAX,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.42, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.9%. Adjusted Earnings rose 6.8% year over year. Adjustments in the quarter primarily included the impact of restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization, debt redemption premium and acquisition-related items. After adjusting for foreign exchange tailwind of 2 cents, adjusted EPS was $1.44.Without these adjustments, the company’s reported net earnings of $1.07 per share, compared to 84 cents in the previous year.Full-year adjusted EPS came in at $4.77, a 4% improvement from the year-ago number. This also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.74 per share.Total RevenuesWorldwide revenues in the reported quarter grossed $8.14 billion, up 6.5% on an organic basis (up 2.9% on a reported basis). The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.99 billion. Organic revenues in the quarter include adjustments for divestitures of Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis (Compression) and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses to Cardinal Health and a $315 million positive impact from foreign currency.Fiscal 2018 worldwide revenues were $29.95 billion, up 4.6% on an organic basis (up 0.8% on a reported basis). This also remained ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $29.76 billion.In the quarter under review, U.S. sales (52% of total revenues) fell 4.9% year over year (up 5.3% after adjusting for the divestitures) to $4.19 billion. Non-U.S. developed market revenues totaled $2.72 billion (33% of total revenues), reflecting a 4.6% increase organically (up 10.8% as reported). Emerging market revenues (15% of total revenues) amounted to $1.24 billion, up 15.5% organically (up 16.8% as reported).Segment DetailsThe company currently generates revenues from four major groups, viz. Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG), Minimally Invasive Therapies Group (MITG), Restorative Therapies Group (RTG) and Diabetes Group.CVG comprises Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF), Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH) and Aortic & Peripheral Vascular divisions (APV). MITG now includes the Surgical Innovations (SI) and the Respiratory, Gastrointestinal & Renal (RGR) divisions after the divestiture of Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis (Compression), and Nutritional Insufficiency (Enteral Feeding) businesses. RTG comprises the Spine, Brain Therapies, Specialty Therapies and Pain Therapies segments, while the Diabetes Group incorporates the Intensive Insulin Management (IIM), Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies (NDT), and Diabetes Service & Solutions (DSS) divisions.CVG revenues improved 5.4% at constant exchange rate or CER (up 10.1% as reported) to $3.14 billion, driven by strong, low-teens growth in CSH, mid-single digit growth in APV, and low-single digit growth in CRHF, all at CER.CRHF sales totaled $1.63 billion, up 1.5% year over year at CER (up 5.8% as reported). This came on the back of low-single digit growth in Arrhythmia Management. This apart, double digit growth in AF Solutions, Mechanical Circulatory Support, and TYRX in Infection Control also contributed to the growth.CSH revenues were up 12.8% at CER (up 18.7% as reported) to $81.01 billion on the back of low-20s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong global uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform. Moreover, the continued uptake of the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent in the United States and Japan revived the Coronary business.APV revenues registered 4.8% growth at CER (up 8.8% as reported) to $497 million, driven by low-single digit growth in both Aortic and Peripheral and mid-teens growth in endoVenous.Medtronic PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Medtronic PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Medtronic PLC QuoteIn MITG, worldwide sales reached $2.24 billion, marking a 4.8% year-over-year increase at CER (down 14.1% on a reported basis) on high-single digit growth in SI, and a low-single digit growth in RGR, both at comparable CER basis.In RTG, worldwide revenues of $2.13 billion were up 6.1% year over year at CER (up 9% as reported) on low double-digit growth in Brain Therapies and Pain Therapies, mid-single digit growth in Specialty Therapies and low-single digit growth in the Spine business.Moreover, revenues at the Diabetes group increased 21.3% at CER (26% as reported) to $645 million.MarginsGross margin in the reported quarter expanded 136 basis points (bps) to 70.6% on a 4.9% rise in gross profit to $5.7 billion. Adjusted operating margin contracted 64 bps year over year to 29.7% owing to a 7.1% rise in research and development expenses (to $592 million) along with a 2.9% uptick in selling, general and administrative expenses (to $2.55 billion). Other expenses in the reported quarter totaled $188 million as compared with $48 million in the year-ago quarter.GuidanceThe company has provided its fiscal 2019 earnings and revenues guidance. For the full year, organic revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 4-4.5%. Currency fluctuation is expected to negatively impact the top line by $50 million- $150 million. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $31.05 billion.Fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS is expected in the range of $5.10 to $5.15, a 10% growth from the year-ago number at the mid-point of the range. This assumes a 5 cent benefit from foreign exchange. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.15 per share falls at the upper end of the guided range.Our TakeMedtronic exited the fiscal 2018 on a solid note with better-than-expected fourth quarter performances. The company demonstrated improved segmental performances at CER on growth in all business segments. However, escalating costs continue to be a concern.Moreover, all the major business groups contributed to solid top-line growth at CER, which highlighted sustainability across groups and regions, in addition to displaying successful integration and achievement of synergy targets. We are also encouraged by the company’s solid growth trend in the United States as well as healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies. Apart from product innovation, the company is focusing on geographical diversification of its businesses.Zacks Rank & Peer PerformancesMedtronic has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks that reported solid results this earnings season are ABIOMED, Inc. (ABMD  -  Free Report), Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) and Quest Diagnostics Inc. (DGX  -  Free Report).

254,BAX,"A smart beta exchange traded fund, the SPDR Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focus ETF (ONEV  -  Free Report) debuted on 12/02/2015, and offers broad exposure to the Large Cap ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes, a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment.Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor & IndexThe fund is managed by State Street Global Advisors. ONEV has been able to amass assets over $450.81 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Large Cap ETFs. ONEV, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focused Factor Index.The Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focused Factor Index reflects the performance of a segment of large-capitalization U.S. equity securities demonstrating a combination of core factors high value, high quality, and low size characteristics, with a focus factor comprising low volatility characteristics.Cost & Other ExpensesSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.20% for ONEV, making it one of the cheaper products in the space.ONEV's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 1.88%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Representing 18.50% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Consumer Discretionary sector; Industrials and Financials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.11% of total assets, followed by Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) and Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report).ONEV's top 10 holdings account for about 9.1% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, the ETF has lost about -0.22%, and was up about 11.94% in the last one year (as of 05/24/2018). ONEV has traded between $69.37 and $76.42 in the past 52-week period.The ETF has a beta of 0.98 and standard deviation of 11.29% for the trailing three-year period. With about 420 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSPDR Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focus ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Large Cap ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV  -  Free Report) tracks S&P 500 Index and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY  -  Free Report) tracks S&P 500 Index. IShares Core S&P 500 ETF has $147.45 B in assets, SPDR S&P 500 ETF has $260.79 B. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.04% and SPY charges 0.09%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Large Cap ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

Baxter’s shares have returned 24.7%, higher than the industry’s rally of roughly 14.7%.Geographical DetailsBaxter reports its operating results based on three reportable geographic segments: Americas (North and South America), EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and APAC (Asia Pacific).As a whole, U.S. sales inched up 2% year over year to $1.1 billion on an operational basis. International sales increased 3% to almost $1.5 billion on an operational basis. Strong demand for the company’s continuous renal replacement therapies (“CRRT”), sales of injectable pharmaceuticals, advanced surgery products, U.S. IV solutions and peritoneal dialysis therapies boosted sales worldwide.In Americas Baxter reported sales of $1.44 billion, up 4% at cc on a year-over-year basis.In EMEA, Baxter reported sales of $724 million, up 3% at cc on a year-over-year basis.In APAC, Baxter reported sales of $511 million, up 3% at cc on a year-over-year basis.Baxter International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Baxter International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Baxter International Inc. QuoteSegmental DetailsRenal ProductsSales in the segment increased 4% at cc to $868 million on a year-over-year basis.Renal products sales were supported by improved performance in all major product lines and therapies, globally. Notably, solid performance in chronic and acute renal therapies drove sales in the segment.Medication DeliverySales at the segment were $676 million, remaining constant year over year at cc.Notably, the segment includes company’s IV therapies, infusion pumps, administration sets and drug reconstitution devices.PharmaceuticalsSales in the segment were $496 million, up 13% year over year at cc.Notably, Pharmaceuticals include the company’s premixed and oncology drug platforms, inhaled anesthesia as well as critical care products and pharmacy compounding services.NutritionSales in the segment were $223 million, in line year over year at cc. Notably, the segment includes sales of the company’s parenteral nutrition (PN) therapies.Advanced SurgerySales in the segment were $182 million, up 4% year over year at cc.The segment includes of the company’s biological products and medical devices used in surgical procedures for hemostasis, tissue sealing and adhesion prevention.In March, Baxter completed the acquisition of two hemostat and sealant products from Mallinckrodt plc to expand its existing surgical portfolio, especially for intraoperative bleeding. Notably, the company bought RECOTHROM Thrombin topical and PREVELEAK Surgical Sealant product lines from Mallinckrodt.Notably, these developments were not accretive to first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings. However, Baxter expects the deal to be modestly accretive to its 2018 adjusted earnings.Acute TherapiesSales in the segment were $129 million, up 14% year over year at cc.Sales of the CRRT and other organ support therapies focused in the ICU boosted segmental revenues in the quarter under review.OtherSales in the segment were $103 million, down 12% year over year at cc.Baxter’s pharmaceutical partnering business is included in the segment.Margin AnalysisBaxter registered gross profit of $1.11 billion in the first quarter, up 7% year over year. As a percentage of revenues, adjusted gross margin contracted 60 basis points (bps) to 43.8% in the first quarter.Adjusted operating income increased 8% year over year to $448 million in the quarter. As a percentage of revenues, operating margin contracted 10 bps to 16.7% in first-quarter 2018.GuidanceBaxter raised its financial outlook for 2018.The company expects sales growth of 5% at cc. It expects adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the range of $2.85-$2.93 per share for the full year.For the second quarter of 2018, the company expects sales growth of approximately 5% at cc. The company expects adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the band of 69-71 cents.In ConclusionBaxter ended the first quarter on a solid note, beating the consensus mark on both the counts. Strong demand for CRRT, sales of injectable pharmaceuticals, advanced surgery products, U.S. IV solutions and peritoneal dialysis therapies boosted sales worldwide.Latest strategic buyouts of RECOTHORM and PREVELEAK are noteworthy.Recently, the company got FDA approval of Bivalirudin in 0.9 percent Sodium Chloride Injection.On the flip side, Baxter expects its pharmaceutical business to be flat on a year-over-year basis in 2018 due to increased competition for select products in the segment. Further, foreign currency headwinds and intense competition have been dampening the company’s performance since long.Baxter’s cyclophosphamide performance over the last five years lacked luster. Lower cyclophosphamide sales pose threats to the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise business.Q1 Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space, which reported solid earnings this season are, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report) and Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

256,BAX,"As if the heart of Q1 earnings season wasn’t informative enough, before Thursday’s opening bell we also see economic headline reads hitting the doorstep — in bulk. Durable Goods Orders, Core Capital Equipment, Advanced Trade in Goods and, of course, weekly Initial Jobless Claims numbers are all out right now, and we await impact of these figures on regular-day trading today.Jobless Claims once again ratcheted down far below our years-long range between 225K-250K, which itself is indicative of a robust domestic labor market. But this morning’s 209K is the lowest read we’ve seen since 1969, the year Neil Armstrong first set foot on the moon. This marks a precipitous drop of 24K claims from the slightly revised 233K the previous week.Continuing claims also recede to historic lows, last week reaching 1.837 million from the previous read of 1.866 million, also a very low number. In fact, we haven’t seen continuing claims get anywhere near 2 million for a week since last summer’s dual hurricanes hit the mainland. U.S. employment continues to amaze and astound.Durable Goods came in a tick higher than expected at 2.6% for March, from a strong upward revision from 3.0% to 3.5% for February. However, strip out Transportation costs and that March number plummets to 0%, with non-defense, ex-aircraft actually going negative to -0.1%. Core Capital Equipment Orders sank from a healthy 1.4% in February to 0.9% in March, with the shipments vs. orders ratio at -0.7%. So it would appear new airplane orders had completely covered this economic metric last month.The U.S. Trade Balance surprised to the upside in March to -$68 billion, lower than the -$73.4 billion analysts had been expecting and a revised -$75.9 billion in February. This is relative good news — certainly better than we’d seen earlier in the year — although it’s tough to get excited about a deficit of $68 billion.After the closing bell today, we expect quarterly earnings results from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report), among others. But ahead of today’s open, there is such a huge amount of earnings reports hitting the tape that we’re going to keep it to just a few of the Zacks Rank Buy and Sell stocks this morning:Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated CME Group (CME  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates by a penny to $1.86 per share, on quarterly revenues that narrowly missed our $1.12 billion Zacks consensus.

258,BAX,"DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (XRAY  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 45 cents in the first quarter of 2018, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.1%. However, the metric fell 8.2% year over year.Net sales increased 6.2% year over year to $956.1 million. Also, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $944.7 million. However, the metric declined 1.1% at constant currency (cc) exchange rate.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). DENTSPLY’s price movement has been unfavorable over the past year. The stock has lost 23.6% comparing unfavorably with the industry’s rise of 7.9%.Net sales (Excluding Precious-Metal Impact)Net sales of the company’s precious-metal dental alloy products, which are used by third parties to construct crown and bridge materials, are subject to risks from fluctuations of precious metal prices.To avoid the impact of fluctuating prices, DENTSPLY reports net sales with and without precious metal content to show actual performance, independent of precious metal price volatility.Net sales in the segment were $945.8 million, up 6.3% year over year.DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. QuoteSegmental DetailsThe business is organized into two reporting segments — Dental & Healthcare Consumables and Technologies.Dental & Healthcare ConsumablesThe segment comprises preventive, restorative, instruments, endodontic and laboratory dental products as well as consumable medical device products.Net sales improved 6.2% to $447.8 million in the segment, while it declined 0.4% at cc.Technologies & Equipment segmentTechnologies consist of dental implants, CAD/CAM systems, imaging systems, treatment centers and orthodontic products.The metric increased 6.1% to $508.3 million in the segment on a year-over-year basis. However, revenues were down 5.8% at cc.Geographic DetailsIn the quarter, sales in the United States fell 6.9% to $291.8 million year over year. Revenues in the area fell 7.4% at cc.Net sales in Europe increased 14.2% to $425.5 million and 0.6% at cc.Net sales in Rest of World climbed 11.4% to $238.8 million and 5.3% at cc.Margin AnalysisGross profit in the reported quarter was $514.1 million, up 4.5% year over year. However, as a percentage of revenues, gross margin contracted 80 basis points (bps) to 53.8%.Operating income fell 18.4% to $68.7 million in the quarter. Operating margin in the quarter contracted 220 bps to 7.2% of net revenues.Guidance Management expects adjusted earnings per share for 2018 in the range of $2.55-$2.65, down from the previous range of $2.70-$2.80. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at $2.71 per share, significantly higher than management’s expectations.Revenues are projected to rise 2% at cc. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $4.23 billion.In ConclusionDENTSPLY exited the first quarter on a solid note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the counts. Robust performance by the company’s flagship dental implants, CAD/CAM systems, imaging systems, treatment centers and orthodontic product platforms hold considerable promise over the long haul. Emerging markets like Asia-Pacific & the Middle East offer healthy growth opportunities on a long-term basis, as they remain vastly untapped with low dental products penetration. The company’s agreements with MedTech bigwig Patterson Companies in Canada are likely to drive sales. DENTSPLY recently witnessed a rebound in sales in Asia, particularly Japan, and strong growth in Russia.On the flip side, a lowered guidance is indicative of looming concerns. The company's higher capital expenditure on product development and tough competition are expected to exert pressure on margins. Unfavorable foreign exchange rate and integration risks are major headwinds for the near term.Q1 Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space, which reported solid earnings this season, are Baxter International Inc.

Smith.However, lower sales in the PharMEDium and the operating loss in the Profarma unit partially offset growth. AmerisourceBergen Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  AmerisourceBergen Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | AmerisourceBergen Corporation Quote Other SegmentThis segment includes AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (“ABCS”), World Courier and MWI Veterinary Supply.Revenues in the segment came in at $1.6 billion, up 12.6% year over year. Growth in the segment was driven by consolidation of the specialty joint venture in Brazil and revenues from MWI, ABCS's growth in its Canadian operations and World Courier business.However, operating income in the segment was $97.1 million in the quarter, down 6.3% year over year. The downside was primarily caused by lackluster performance at ABCS’s Lash Group.Margin AnalysisIn the quarter under review, AmerisourceBergen registered gross profit of $1.3 billion, up 9.2% on a year-over-year basis. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin was 2.8%, down 4 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter.

AmerisourceBergen's strong guidance instills investors’ optimism on the stock. Further, joint venture in Brazil, strength in MWI unit, ABCS's growth in its Canadian operations and prospects in the World Courier business are key positives at the moment. Further, the recent takeover of H.D. Smith, the largest independent wholesaler in the United States, is also a positive.On the flip side, sluggishness in ABCS’s Lash Group is a concern. AmerisourceBergen faces headwinds, thanks to the slowdown in hepatitis C revenues and conversion of branded drugs to the lower price generics.Further, a temporary slowdown in PharMEDium's growth is expected to mar the company’s bottom line. In this regard, the company faced lower-than-expected production at PharMEDium's Memphis facility.Q1 Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space, which reported solid earnings this season are, Baxter International Inc.

263,BAX,"Astute investors always opt for a plan that is likely to yield high returns irrespective of market conditions. Efficiency level, which measures a company’s capability to transform available input into output, is often considered an important parameter used to gauge a company’s potential to rake in handsome returns.A company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide stellar returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with price performance. Key Ratios to Identify EfficiencySometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are:Inventory Turnover: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company’s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value shows that the company is facing declining sales, which resulted in excess inventory.Receivables Turnover:  This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company’s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or “debtor’s turnover ratio” is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.Asset Utilization: This ratio indicates a company’s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.Operating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company’s ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.Screening ParametersIn addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average (Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)    The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to only 19.Here are five stocks from the 19 that made it through the screen:Marine Products Corporation (MPX  -  Free Report) designs, manufactures, and sells recreational fiberglass powerboats for the sportboat, deckboat, cruiser, jet boat, and sport fishing markets worldwide.

264,BAX,"The third-quarter earnings season has commenced on an encouraging note for most sectors, with releases from 87 S&P 500 participants (24.7% of the total market cap) till October 20.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these members rose 9.4% on 7.3% higher revenues. With 180 S&P 500 members lined up for releasing their quarterly results this week, we are decidedly bullish on the equity market, which is gradually demonstrating a sequential improvement.Medical, one of the broader sectors among the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to put up an impressive show in the quarter. For Q3, the expected earnings growth rate for the sector is 2.2% on 4.8% revenue growth. In comparison, the reported earnings growth rate during the second-quarter of 2017 was quite impressive at 7% on 4.4% revenue growth.Medical Products Amid Political UncertaintiesHowever, the Medical Product space, within the broader Medical universe, has been a precarious game for the Republicans since day one, courtesy of President Trump’s repeated failure to repeal and replace Obamacare.However, major MedTech players have been pinning their hopes on the abolition of the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax, though the elimination of this tax is far from being achieved.Considering these tax issues, investors interested in the Medical Product space will likely keenly await earnings reports from MedTech bigwigs like Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report), Varian Medical (VAR  -  Free Report), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., (TMO  -  Free Report) and Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report). Notably, all the companies are expected to release their earnings results on Oct. 25.For the third quarter, Baxter anticipates sales growth of about 4% at constant currency (cc). Adjusted earnings per share are forecasted in the range of 58-60 cents versus the year-ago figure of 56 cents. We believe the company’s solid sales in the Medical Products segment will be a key driver in the third quarter. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment stands at $1,648 million, up 4.2% on a year-over-year basis (read more: Baxter International Q3 Earnings: What's in Store?).Despite the solid prospects, our quantitative model does not conclusively show a beat for the company, given the combination of a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an Earnings ESP of -0.34%. That is because, as per our model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) to beat earnings.Baxter International Inc. Price and Consensus  Baxter International Inc. Price and Consensus | Baxter International Inc.

For the third quarter, Baxter anticipates sales growth of about 4% at constant currency. Adjusted earnings per share are forecasted in the range of 58-60 cents versus the year-ago figure of 56 cents. Also, for full-year 2017, the company projects earnings in the band of $2.34 to $2.40 per share (from continuing operations, before special items), up from full-year 2016 earnings of $1.95. Of late, Baxter International has accelerated pace of acquisitions and strategic collaborations to enhance its product portfolio, thereby opening up significant long-term opportunities. Also, several recent FDA approvals are likely to drive growth in the yet-to-be-reported third quarter of 2017.The company’s estimate revision trend is also encouraging. For the current year, Baxter International witnessed two upward estimate revisions with no movement in the opposite direction over the last one month.However, lower cyclophosphamide sales pose a threat to the company’s Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise. For the third quarter, a decline in cyclophosphamide sales is expected to impact top line by low-single digits. Also, the foray of group purchasing organizations (GPOs) in the United States intensifies competition for the company.Earnings WhispersOur quantitative model doesn’t point to an earnings beat this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Baxter International is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 59 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Baxter International carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

266,BAX,"IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report its first-quarter 2018 results on May 4, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.48%. Notably, the stock has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average beat being 7.3%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key Catalysts IDEXX is expected to continue with its gain momentum in the first quarter, courtesy of a strong global rise in Companion Animal Group (CAG) Diagnostics’ revenues. Last time, this upside was driven by consistent strong double-digit growth in reference labs and consumables plus owing to a high-single-digit increase registered in rapid assay sales. Management vouches for this trend to be retained further.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Quote We are also upbeat about IDEXX enhancing its commercial capabilities in the United States to maintain recurring revenue growth at CAG Diagnostics. We expect first-quarter results to reflect a rise in productivity as new sales representatives establish fresh customer relationships. Also, we anticipate the company to report exceptional customer retention rates for reference labs as well as instrument consumables in the United States and worldwide.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $460 million for CAG Diagnostics revenues represents a 5.9% improvement from the last-reported quarter.Notably, IDEXX’s 13-14.5% revenue growth projection for the quarter to be reported  highlights its organic gains of 9.5-10.5%. Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the total quarterly revenues is pegged at $525 million..Other factors predicted to influence IDEXX’s first-quarter results are:We pin considerable hopes on progress in the Water Business, lying on a growth trajectory of late, backed by encouraging test results in the United States as well as benefits drawn from the global go-direct initiatives. Moreover, the business witnessed 16% organic growth last quarter. Management also eyes gains from two favorable regulatory developments pertaining to wastewater in the United States and drinking water in Europe. The company earlier stated that it is perfectly on track for a continued high-single digit organic revenue boost in this business through 2018. The consensus mark for Water revenues stands at $28.3 million for the yet-to-be-reported quarter.IDEXX carries on to expand its global footprint. It has been significantly drawing advantages from the bountiful opportunities in the emerging companion animal diagnostics markets. Further, management’s consistent share buybacks underscores its robust free cash flow reserve. We believe the outcome of these endeavors will bear reflection on first-quarter conference call.On the flip side, foreign currency fluctuation is a major headwind. Another concern is the company’s heavy reliance on third-party distributors. The purchasing dynamics of distributors leave a significant impact on the company’s sales of instrument consumables as well as its rapid assay products. Moreover, IDEXX has been witnessing a rise in operating expenses due to increased head count along with higher investments in portfolio development and expansion in the United States plus internationally.Additionally, a competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on IDEXX’s performance. Thus, the struggle to gain market traction might be a drag on first-quarter results.Here’s what the quantitative model predicts:Per the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has higher chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.IDEXX has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s Earnings ESP of -0.90% leaves our surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around:Baxter International Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.15 is within the guided range.Our TakeHaemonetics exited fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 on a mixed note. Continued momentum in new business generation and geographical expansion have helped the company deliver strong results. However, we are disappointed with the company’s sluggish Blood Center business moderating overall growth despite encouraging progress in the Plasma and Hospitals.The company also seems to be upbeat about the receipt of some major regulatory clearances for the Plasma business. These should drive the top line in fiscal 2019. Also, the company’s strong cash position boosts investors’ confidence.Zacks Rank & Key PicksHaemonetics has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space which have reported solid results this season are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report) and Baxter International Inc.

A solid guidance for 2018 raises investors’ optimism on the stock. The company has been gaining on strong segmental revenues and improving product revenue margins. An expanding product portfolio and wider adoption of its non-invasive patient monitoring technology are major catalysts. Masimo’s SET pulse oximetry business represents considerable growth opportunities in international markets. Moreover, Masimo received some noteworthy CE and FDA clearances during the quarter, including a clearance for domestic use of the new Rad-97 telehealth monitor with two-way audio and video capabilities.On the flip side, lackluster performance in royalties and other revenue unit is a concern. Furthermore, the company faces fierce competition from OEM distributors and medical devices bigwigs that might mar the top line over the long haul.Q1 Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space, which reported solid earnings this season are Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

278,BAX,"Pure play growth and value investors have one thing in common – both strategize for long-term investments. Yet, their approach and growth goals make them totally distinct from each other when it comes to stock picking.During the course of their financial planning and execution, while value investors miss the chance of betting on stocks that have bright long-term prospects, growth investors often end up investing in expensive stocks.Consequently, investors often wonder whether they should resort to any of these distinctive strategies or follow an approach that combines the best of both. The investing track of the Oracle of Omaha over the past few decades and his gradual shift from being a pure-play value investor to a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) investor might give us all the answers.In this regard, we should take note that strategic mingling of both growth and value investing principles gives us a mixed investing strategy that is getting popular with each passing day. What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential (Investopedia).And here lies the importance of a not-so-popular fundamental metric, the price/earnings growth (PEG) ratio. Although it is categorized under value investing, this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing.The PEG ratio is defined as: (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P/E ratio with future earnings growth rate.While P/E alone only gives the idea of stocks, which are trading at a discount, PEG while adding the GROWTH element to it, helps finding those stocks that have solid future potential.A lower PEG ratio, preferably less than 1, is always better for GARP investors.Say for example, if a stock’s P/E ratio is 10 and expected long-term growth rate is 15%, the company’s PEG will come down to 0.66, a ratio which indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential.Unfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors’ limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It doesn’t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth rates followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (For more accurate valuation purpose.)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1  or #2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5%: Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of ‘A’ or ‘B’ when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 12 stocks that qualified the screening:Baxter International Inc.

Price and Consensus  PerkinElmer, Inc. Price and Consensus | PerkinElmer, Inc. Quote Further, the company is also expected to close on an acquisition in China to expand its elemental analysis products. For the DAS business, solid growth across life sciences and applied market boosted the company’s business in China.Diagnostics segmentRevenues were $247.5 million compared with $156.8 million a year ago, reflecting a 62% year-over-year increase. This reflects an improvement of 7% organically.Within the Diagnostics business, PerkinElmer’s infectious disease business, which exclusively serves the emerging markets, continues to show strong growth as it increased in mid-teen digits on a year-over-year basis.The reproductive health business within Diagnostics also grew in mid single digits year over year.However, the applied genomics business was down on a year-over-year basis due to lesser-than-expected micro fluidic sales.Adjusted operating income in the segment came in at $52.7 million, as compared with $44.7 million in the first quarter of 2017.Margin AnalysisAdjusted gross profit in the quarter came in at $313.3 million, up 25.8% year over year.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $2.74 billion, lower than the company’s estimate.    Despite an unfavorable foreign-exchange environment, which put solid pressure in the quarter under review, the company expects strong adjusted operating margin improvement over the remaining three quarters. Management expects a 70- 90 bps margin expansion in 2018.In ConclusionPerkinElmer exited the first quarter of 2018 on a solid note with strong performance in the DAS segment. Growth in DAS was bolstered by strength in the lifesciences end markets, informatics profile and OneSource offering. The company experienced healthy growth across all major geographies in Asia, Americas, Europe and the BRIC nations. Solid prospects in the elemental-analysis product line hold promise. Furthermore, a positive guidance and a solid long-term outlook for 2020 boosts investors’ confidence in the stock.On the flipside, despite having a diversified portfolio, unfavorable foreign exchange is a primary concern. Softness in the industrial end markets due to unfavorable timing of instrument orders has been a major dampener for PerkinElmer. Further, the company continues to acquire a large number of companies which increases integration risks. Also, high debt levels may hinder the company’s expansion plans.Q1 Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space, which reported solid earnings this season are, Baxter International Inc.

Year to date, cash flow from operations totaled $68 million, compared with $69.6 million a year ago. Year to date, the company registered free cash flow of $61.4 million, compared with $64.2 million in the year-ago period.GuidanceMyriad Genetics has raised the guidance for fiscal 2018 revenues to $771-$773 million from $760-$770 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $774.4 million lies above the guided range.On the bottom-line front, the company lifted the adjusted EPS range to $1.19-$1.21 from $1.11-$1.16. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16 is below the company’s guided range.Management has provided the guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. The company estimates adjusted EPS of 31-33 cents on total revenues of $193-$195 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted EPS is 31 cents and revenues is $197.8 million. While the consensus estimate for earnings coincides with the low end of the company’s guided range, our revenue estimate lies above the projected range.Our ViewMyriad Genetics performed better than expected in third-quarter fiscal 2018. However, the year-over-year decline in revenues is disappointing. On a positive note, the company observed strong growth in both GeneSight, Vectra DA and Prolaris testing revenues. The recent FDA approvals and encouraging test results buoy optimism.On the flip side, unfavorable foreign currency translation continues to pose a threat. With a considerable portion of its revenues coming from outside the United States, the company faces the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksMyriad Genetics has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space which have reported solid results this season are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report) and Baxter International Inc.

Adjusted EPS remained 3.3% ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Acquisition growth was 2.1% in the quarter.Henry Schein, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Henry Schein, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Henry Schein, Inc. QuoteIn the first quarter, the company recorded sales of $2.07 billion in the North American market, up 6.7% year over year. Sales totaled $1.15 billion in the international market, up 17% year over year.Segment Analysis    Henry Schein derives revenues from four operating segments: Dental, Medical, Animal Health and Technology and Value-added services.In the first quarter, the company derived $1.55 billion in revenues from global Dental sales, up 10.2% year over year. This includes 5.2% growth in local currencies and 5% contribution from foreign currency exchange. At local currencies, internally generated sales increased 2.9% and acquisition growth was 2.3%.Internal growth at local currencies included 3.1% growth in North America and 2.6% rise internationally.The company's global Animal Health segment witnessed 13.1% rise in revenues to $919.8 million.

However, gross margin contracted 34 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 27.8% due to a 10.7% rise in cost of sales.  Despite a 9% rise in selling, general & administrative expenses of $685.7 million, adjusted operating income improved 8.2% year over year to $209.9 million. However, adjusted operating margin declined 12 bps year over year to 6.5% in the reported quarter.Financial PositionHenry Schein exited the first quarter 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $99.2 million, compared with $174.7 million at the end of 2017. For the first three months of 2018, net operating cash outflow was $70.9 million, compared with $52.6 million of cash outflow in the year-ago period.As a result of a blackout period related to the spin-off and merger of the company's Animal Health business, during the quarter under review, the company did not repurchase any shares of common stock. At the close of the first quarter, the company had $200 million authorized for repurchase of common stock.2018 GuidanceExcluding costs related to restructuring and the spin-off and merger of Henry Schein’s global Animal Health business, the company has reiterated its 2018 EPS guidance. The company still expects EPS in the range of $4.03-$4.14, reflecting 12-15% growth from the 2017 adjusted EPS figure of $3.60. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 adjusted EPS is $4.09 remains within the guided range.Our TakeHenry Schein exited the first quarter of 2018 on a strong note with earnings and revenues steering past the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. All four of the company's operating segments recorded strong year-over-year growth. Henry Schein's strong share gains in the North American and overseas markets along with solid revenues raise optimism.Despite the better-than-expected revenue performance, we are disappointed with the year-over-year deterioration in Henry Schein's gross and operating margin due to higher cost of sales and expenses.We currently await the completion of the company’s global Animal Health business' planned spin-off. This business contributes nearly 30% to the company’s topline. The spin off, accordingly, is expected to bring in major changes to Henry Schein’s overall operating results.According to the company, following the spinoff, the Animal Health business will merge with privately-held Vets First Choice to form a new public company called Vets First Corp. We believe, this initiative remains a part of Henry Schein's 2018-2020 Strategic Plan to focus more on dental and medical businesses.Zacks Rank & Key PicksHenry Schein has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space which have reported solid results this season are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Chemed Corp.

285,BAX,"Hologic, Inc. (HOLX  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 financial results on May 2 after the closing bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 12.24%. Notably, Hologic’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the past four quarters with an average beat of 6.26%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystWithin Diagnostics, Hologic once again expects a stellar performance banking on molecular diagnostics.In the United States, the company is likely to gain from an increasing market share as well as utilization of fully automated Panther system along with market expansion by conforming to the testing guidelines.Global growth within molecular diagnostics can be attributed to the Panther system, Hologic’s fully automated molecular diagnostics instrument and also owing to a frequent utilization of Aptima women’s health assays. Notably, Aptima assays have gained a huge customer base in testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea, HPV (human papillomavirus) and trichomonas. We are also hopeful about Hologic’s expanded market for sexually transmitted disease testing.Hologic, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Hologic, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Hologic, Inc. Quote Further, we are upbeat about Diagnostics business earning a regulatory clearance for several new products in the United States over the last six quarters. These include the first three respiratory assays on new Fusion platform and three viral load tests for HIV (for human immunodeficiency virus), hepatitis C and hepatitis B. This steady pace of domestic assay innovation strengthens the company’s position to consolidate molecular testing on the Panther system. In January, the company again announced the PMA approval for the Aptima HBV Quant Assay for quantitation of hepatitis B viral load on the fully automated Panther system.All the above developments are anticipated to contribute significantly to the company’s topline in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $155 million for Molecular Diagnostics revenues reflects an increase of 9.2% from the year-ago quarter.Other few factors likely to influence Hologic’s results in the fiscal second quarter are as follows:Hologic is optimistic about sustaining a solid earnings trend in 2018 courtesy of gains from the Breast Health segment. Sales from the same have improved on the basis of an established clinical superiority of the segmental products over the last three quarters. The company has witnessed a consistent rise in market share within Breast Health on the back of direct-to-consumer initiativesand insurance coverage.Additionally, the company’s adoption of new mammography systems, 3Dimensions and 3D Performance, encourages us. These new products have already started to leverage the company’s Genius brand and also lured customers to upgrade their existing 2D systems. The company is building a broader portfolio of Breast Health products and services around the core of Genius systems so that it can play an instrumental role in the Breast Health continuum of care. Noteworthy in this regard is the recent PMA approval from the FDA for Clarity HD high-resolution 3D imaging and Intelligent 2D imaging technology. These products are now available in the 3Dimensions breast tomosynthesis system.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $293 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 remains 4.3% ahead of the prior-year tally.On the flip side, Hologic confronted challenges related to unfavorable foreign currency movement over the past few quarters. Escalating operating expenses and an intense competition, particularly in the tomosynthesis market, continue to raise a concern.What Our Model SuggestsPer the proven Zacks model, a company with a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has higher chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.Hologic has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of +0.94%, which raises confidence about a positive surprise. Together, the combination suggests that the company is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Conversely, we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to also surpass estimates this time around:Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.86% and a Zacks Rank #2.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.52% and a Zacks Rank of 2.Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.13% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player.

286,BAX,"Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on Apr 26, before the market opens. Positive tidings on the regulatory front, expanding product portfolio, strategic collaborations and strong presence in the international markets are key positives at the moment.We expect the company to witness steady growth in Hospital Products sales — one of the major revenue components. While this is projected to drive first-quarter 2018 earnings, an expected improvement in revenues in other sub-segments will generate impressive results.Last quarter, Baxter posted adjusted earnings per share of 64 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents and improved from the year-ago quarter’s figure of 57 cents.For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.62 billion, reflecting a rise of 5.9% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings per share is pegged at 62 cents, indicating an increase of 6.9% year over year.Baxter International Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Baxter International Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Baxter International Inc. QuoteLet’s delve into other factors which are likely to impact Baxter’s first-quarter 2018 results.Hospital Products to Drive Q1 ResultsBaxter has an impressive product portfolio with improved existing products and new product development. Recently, the company announced a distribution agreement for the U.S. launch of the Arisure Closed System Transfer device.In the last quarter, Hospital Sales were driven by solid demand for injectable pharmaceuticals and hospital pharmacy compounding services. Sales in the segment benefited from solid demand for the company’s advanced surgery products and cytotoxic contract manufacturing services.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hospital Products revenues is pegged at $1.67 billion. This reflects an increase of 5.6% from the year-ago quarter.Here we take a sneak peek at the major sub-segments within the Hospital Products and how are they poised to gain in the to-be-reported quarter:Surgical Care:Surgical Care (includes anesthesia and BioSurgery) sales recorded year-over-year sales growth in the last quarter, on low double-digit growth for anesthesia and critical care products, driven by growing demand for inhaled anesthetics internationally as well as increased U.S. sales of BREVIBLOC — a fast-acting IV beta blocker.On Mar 19, Baxter completed the acquisition of two hemostat and sealant products from Mallinckrodt plc to expand the existing surgical portfolio of hemostats and sealants, especially for intraoperative bleeding. Notably, the company bought RECOTHROM Thrombin topical and PREVELEAK Surgical Sealant product lines from Mallinckrodt.Baxter’s surgical portfolio includes products like FLOSEAL Hemostatic Matrix, TISSEEL Fibrin Sealant, COSEAL Surgical Sealant and VASCU-GUARD Patch among others. The portfolio is composed of hemostasis (addressing bleeding), tissue sealing and hard tissue regeneration as well as soft tissue repair and microsurgery with products available in nearly 60 countries.The company consistently strives to improve its Advanced Surgery business. For 2018, the company expects advanced surgery business to increase 3-4% on a constant-currency (cc) basis.Baxter announced plans to focus on launching advanced surgery products in Japan in the coming days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s sales is pegged at $576 million, reflecting a rise of 1.1% from the year-ago quarter.Fluid Systems: Within Hospital Products, sales in Fluid Systems is expected to be solid on robust IV solution sales in the United States. We expect Fluid Systems to maintain the trend in the first quarter.This is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fluid Systems of $621 million for the first quarter, reflecting 6.2% rise from the year-ago quarter.Integrated Pharmacy Solutions (IPS): Global sales of IPS, another sub segment within Hospital Products, increased by a formidable margin in the last quarter, partly on the back of increased sales for premixed injectable drugs.However, Baxter’s cyclophosphamide performance over the last five years has lacked luster, majorly. Lower cyclophosphamide sales pose threats to the Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise business. For 2018, Baxter expects U.S. cyclophosphamide sales to be approximately $95 million, reflecting a decline from $185 million in 2017. For the upcoming quarterly result, lower cyclophosphamide sales are expected to impact the top line by low single digits.For the first quarter of 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for IPS is pegged at $598 million, showing an increase of 8.3% from the year-ago number.Other Factors at PlayGuidance: Baxter expects first-quarter adjusted earnings in the range of 60-62 cents. However, net sales in the first quarter is expected to be affected by approximately $25 million due to disruptions in the Puerto Rico facility. For 2018, Baxter estimates sales growth of approximately 6-7% at cc. Adjusted earnings for 2018 are expected in the band of $2.72-$2.80.Regulatory Approvals: Baxter has been witnessing positive tidings on the regulatory front. Recently, Baxter announced the approval of Bivalirudin in 0.9 percent Sodium Chloride Injection (bivalirudin).Management confirmed that the FDA has granted two new approvals for temporary importation of certain drugs from the facilities in Canada and Mexico. With this development, Baxter now has four operational sites approved to address demand in the U.S. markets.Dull Projection for Pharmaceutical Unit: For 2018, the pharmaceutical business, which includes Baxter’s broad generic injectables portfolio, anesthesia and critical care products as well as hospital pharmacy compounding services conducted outside the United States is expected to be flat on a year-over-year basis. The lackluster performance is primarily driven by increased competition for select products in the segment.Further, in the Other business segment, which primarily includes Baxter’s contract manufacturing services, management expects low single-digit decline in 2018. Per management, sales in the segment benefited from a customer stockpile order in 2017. Baxter expects lower manufacturing revenues from Shire, which it acquired two years ago.What Our Model PredictsOur quantitative model does not predict an earnings beat for Baxter this quarter.This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Baxter is 0.00%.

Revenues increased 12% year over year.athenahealth carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Q1 DetailsSegment DetailsRevenues in the Business and Services were $313.3 million, up 12.6% from the year-ago quarter.However, revenues in the Implementation and other segment were $7 million, down 1.4% year over year.Network ExpansionPer management, the company expanded its network across ambulatory, hospital and population health platforms. Recently, athenahealth surpassed the 100-million patient threshold and currently serves more than 100,000 healthcare providers. During the first quarter of 2018, athenahealth added eight new hospitals. The company ended the quarter with 70 hospitals in its network.The company’s network has 114,265 Collector Providers, 62,631 Clinical Providers and 71,972 Communicator Providers, up 15%, 20% and 20%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.In the athenaOne (Hospital) platform, number of discharged beds increased a whopping 194% year over year.In the Population Health platform, number of covered lives increased 21% year over year.Buoyed by stellar network expansion, the company is expected to fortify its foothold in the Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) space and drive revenues and earnings over the long haul.athenahealth, Inc. Price and Consensus  athenahealth, Inc. Price and Consensus | athenahealth, Inc. Quote Margin AnalysisA strong client base has been a major growth driver for the company. Adjusted gross margin in the first quarter was 53%, compared with 51.5% in the year-ago quarter.athenahealth’s operating income increased 146% year over year to $54 million, driven by top-line growth and cost-saving initiatives. The company saw an operating margin of 16.9% of total revenues, up 920 basis points year over year.Guidanceathenahealth reiterated its fiscal 2018 financial guidance.The company expects revenues in the range of $1.31-$1.38 billion. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.35 billion.The company expects adjusted operating income in the range of $210-$235 million. Adjusted operating margin is expected in the band of 16% to 17% of net revenues for 2018.In Conclusionathenahealth exited the first quarter of 2018 on a solid note, with earnings and revenues outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. We believe that applications like athenaClinicals, athenaClinicals-Streamlined, athenaInsight, athenaCommunicator, athenaOne, athenaCollector for Hospital and Health Systems and the brand promise of ‘Unbreak Healthcare’ are fortifying its market position in terms of exclusiveness of services provided. A strong client base has been a key catalyst. Business and Services revenues witnessed year-over-year growth while the same in the Implementation and other segment declined.Among major concerns, athenahealth’s EHR solution faces significant competition from the likes of Allscripts Healthcare Solutions and others. Further, athenahealth fell short of its bookings goals in the quarter under review. Deteriorated client retention rates also add to the company’s woes.Q1 Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space, which reported solid earnings this season are, Baxter International Inc.

290,BAX,"Following encouraging fourth-quarter 2017 results, shares of Mallinckrodt Public Limited Company (MNK  -  Free Report) moved up 15.3%.  Hit by challenges in 2017, Mallinckrodt’s stock has lost 63.8% over a year compared with the industry’s fall of 34.1%.The company reported adjusted earnings of $2.01 per share in the reported quarter, up from the year-ago figure of $1.91, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.72.Net sales in the quarter came in at $792.3 million, down 4.5% year over year, but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $765.6 million.Mallinckrodt PLC Price and Consensus  Mallinckrodt PLC Price and Consensus | Mallinckrodt PLC Quote Quarter in DetailThe company reports results under two segments — Specialty Brands and Specialty Generics.Sales at the Specialty Brands segment were $582.2 million, down 3.5% from the year-ago quarter. Acthar, Mallinckrodt’s largest product, garnered sales of $295.2 million, down 9.3% due to patient withdrawal issues.  Mallinckrodt is reeling under an industry wide challenge, wherein an increasing number of written prescriptions are going unfilled.Inomax, its second-largest product, generated sales of $125.6 million, up 6.2%. Ofirmev sales increased 7.6% year over year to $78 million.Sales of the Therakos immunology platform were $57.2 million, up 18.4%.As expected, weakness in the Specialty Generics segment continues due to competitive pressure. The segment recorded sales of $195.8 million, down 8.0%. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter decreased 2.1% to $212.6 million. Meanwhile, research and development expenses increased 30.5% to $86.4 million.Pipeline UpdateEarlier in the month, Mallinckrodt acquired erstwhile Sucampo Pharmaceuticals for diversifying and reviving its beleaguered portfolio. The Sucampo acquisition added two approved drugs namely, Amitiza and Rescula to Mallinckrodt’s portfolio.Last month, Mallinckrodt entered into an agreement with Baxter International (BAX  -  Free Report) wherein the former will sell certain hemostasis products to the latter for approximately $185 million. The products include Recothrom Thrombin topical (Recombinant) and Preveleak Surgical Sealant. Baxter will assume other expenses, including contingent liabilities associated with Preveleak. The company had acquired these products from The Medicines Co. (MDCO  -  Free Report).However, Mallinckrodt will retain Raplixa (Fibrin sealant (human)) for topical use and is evaluating strategic options for this product.Meanwhile, the FDA accepted Mallinckrodt’s New Drug Application (“NDA”) seeking approval of the recently acquired developmental product stannsoporfin. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA set its action date to respond to the NDA as Aug 22, 2018.  The agency previously granted Fast Track status to stannsoporfin. 2018 GuidanceDue to the recently announced acquisitions and divestitures, Mallinckrodt will prospectively classify the ""Specialty Generics Disposal Group"" as discontinued operations, which includes the Specialty Generics segment, certain non-promoted branded products within the Specialty Brands segment, and the company's ongoing post-divestiture supply agreement.Net Sales in 2018 are expected to grow by 3-6% while adjusted EPS is projected to be $6.00- $6.50.Our TakeThe earnings and sales beat in the fourth quarter comes as a silver lining for Mallinckrodt which has been in troubled waters for quite some time now.  While Acthar sales continue to decline, Inomax revived a bit.The company is currently streamlining its business to focus better on its innovative medicines and therapies like terlipressin and StrataGraft, and the recently acquired products stannsoporfin, xenon gas and OCR-002. While the Sucampo buyout to diversify the company’s portfolio considering Amitiza’s potential is commendable, it remains to be seen if it will be enough to bail Mallinckrodt out of its current crisis.Zacks Rank & Key PickMallinckrodt carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock from the health care space is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

291,BAX,"On Nov 8, we issued an updated research report on Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report). Baxter recently exited the third quarter of 2017 on a favorable note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the counts. The impressive performance by the hospital products and renal segments holds promise. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Headquartered in Deerfield, IL, Baxter is a global medical technology company which operates in the life-sustaining and critical care products category that is cushioned against economic downturns. The company’s products are not commodity-like in nature and provide a strong recurring revenue base.Baxter has been experiencing burgeoning demand for dialyzers across the globe as more people are afflicted with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to growing incidence of diabetes, blood pressure and other kidney-related diseases.  Coming to the recently-reported third quarter, Baxter’s strong product portfolio, plethora of regulatory approvals and the completion of Claris acquisition drove the top line. Buoyed by solid performance, management at Baxter lifted its full-year guidance. For 2017, Baxter estimates sales growth of approximately 4% at cc. Adjusted earnings for the year are expected in the band of $2.40 to $2.43 per share, up from the previous band of $2.34 to $2.40.The year 2017 has been a favorable one for Baxter on the regulatory front so far. In the third quarter, management at Baxter confirmed two new FDA approvals for temporary importation of certain drugs from facilities in Canada and Mexico. Further, the FDA approval of a new premixed injectables is a key catalyst.Coming to product portfolio, Baxter’s convenient kidney dialysis solutions, regenerative tissue products, 3-in-1 oXIRIS set for continuous renal replacement therapy and the next-generation SIGMA Spectrum infusion pump are the latest additions to the extensive product portfolio.Notably, Baxter’s home solution system is the first technology designed to reduce storage and weight handling requirements for traditional PD therapy. Management claims to have the first patient on therapy with the new system as part of a clinical trial in 2018. Regulatory submission is expected in 2019.Despite the ongoing political conundrum pertaining to the repealing of Obamacare in the U.S. MedTech space and devastation caused by Hurricane Maria, we believe a solid foothold in the global markets will drive results for this MedTech major. With a large proportion of sales coming from overseas markets, Baxter should benefit from developing countries' incremental investments in health care systems.Share Price MovementOver the past year, Baxter has outperformed the broader industry in terms of price performance. The company represented a solid return of 39.5%, higher than the industry’s gain of roughly 15.4%. The current level is also higher than the S&P 500’s return of only 19.8%.Q3 Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceWith most of the S&P members having reported their numbers, the third-quarter earnings season is drawing to a close. Medical, one of the broader sectors among the 16 Zacks sectors, has put up an impressive show so far.Positive revenue momentum and favorable revisions in estimates for the current period are the two notable features of this season.PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report) reported earnings per share of 43 cents in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, up 79.2% on a year-over-year basis.

Revenues increased 18% year over year to $806.1 million. The stock carries a Zacks Rank 2.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

International sales increased 4% at cc to almost $1.6 billion.Baxter International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Baxter International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Baxter International Inc. QuoteSegmental DetailsHospital ProductsSales at the hospital products segment rose 3% at cc on a year-over-year basis to $1.7 billion. Hospital Products sales in the quarter were driven by solid sales in the U.S. fluid systems and select anesthesia and critical care products.Hospital Sales were also driven by solid demand for injectable pharmaceuticals and hospital pharmacy compounding services. Sales in the segment benefited from solid demand for the company’s advanced surgery products and cytotoxic contract manufacturing services.Renal ProductsSales in the segment increased 3% at cc to $1.1 billion. Renal products sales were supported by improved performance in all major product lines and therapies, globally. Notably, solid performance in chronic and acute renal therapies drove sales in the segment.Consistent Efforts to Increase ProductionPer management, the company’s Puerto Rico facilities, affected by the Hurricanes, are ramping up production. Additionally, Baxter has been working closely with FDA to support supply of certain products in the domestic market, which were cautioned for importation from Baxter’s facilities in Ireland, Australia, Canada, Mexico, England, Italy and Brazil.In the fourth quarter, Baxter launched the oXIRIS set for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and sepsis management protocols in select markets of Europe, Middle East and Africa. oXIRIS, which leverages on the company’s flagship PRISMAFLEX system, is expected to lend the company a competitive edge in the global market.Recently, the company upgraded the SIGMA Spectrum Infusion System with the launch of DeviceVue Advanced Asset Tracking System. Baxter is the first and only smart infusion pump manufacturer to offer a tagless, end-to-end acid tracking application designed in consultation with potential customers to drive operational efficiencies and maximize the clinical value of their pump investments.GuidanceFor 2018, Baxter estimates sales growth of approximately 6-7% at cc. Adjusted earnings for the full year are expected in the band of $2.72 to $2.80 per share.Baxter expects first-quarter in the range of 60-62 cents. However, Baxter expects sales in the first quarter to be affected by approximately $25 million due to disruptions in the Puerto Rico facility.2017 at a GlanceIn 2017, Baxter registered revenues of $10.6 billion, up 4% at cc on a year-over-year basis. Sales of Hospital Products totaled $6.6 billion (62.3% of net sales). Baxter’s Renal sales totaled more than $3.9 billion in the year (36.7% of net sales).Baxter increased the annual dividend rate by 23% and repurchased $564 million worth of shares, while also pursuing internal and external initiatives to augment growthOur TakeBaxter ended the fourth quarter on an encouraging note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the counts. The company's impressive performance at the hospital products and renal segments hold promise. Recently, Baxter launched the oXIRIS set for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and sepsis management protocols in select markets of Europe, Middle East and Africa. Further, the recent launch of DeviceVue, a comprehensive asset tracking solution available exclusively to hospitals, boosts the company’s product portfolio.On the flip side, foreign currency headwinds, intense competition and lackluster sales growth have been dampening Baxter’s performance since long. Generic competition for cyclophosphamide is a headwind. Further, the recent hurricanes are expected to dent the company’s results in the near term.Companies Reporting Solid Earnings ResultsA few better-ranked stocks that reported decent results this earnings season are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report) and Accuray (ARAY  -  Free Report).

Price and EPS Surprise | Baxter International Inc. QuoteThe company’s estimate revision trend is also encouraging. For the current year, Baxter saw two upward estimate revisions with no movement in the opposite direction over the last one month.However, lower cyclophosphamide sales pose a threat to the company’s Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise. For the second quarter, a decline in cyclophosphamide sales is expected to impact the top line by low single digits. Also, the foray of group purchasing organizations (GPOs) in the U.S. intensifies competition for the company.Earnings WhispersOur quantitative model doesn’t point to an earnings beat this quarter.

Also, net sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.37 billion.Segmental AnalysisGlobal Industrial Sales in the segment grew 5% year over year to almost $1.24 billion. The upside was driven by major gains in Water, Food & Beverage and Life Sciences unit.Europe, North America and Latin America led the Global Industrial regional growth.However, acquisition-adjusted fixed currency operating income in the segment decreased 5% on a year-over-year basis due to higher delivered product costs and massive investments in the business.Ecolab Inc. Price and Consensus  Ecolab Inc. Price and Consensus | Ecolab Inc. QuoteGlobal InstitutionalSales increased 9% to $1.22 billion, led by strong growth in the Specialty business line. The segment witnessed solid growth in North America and Asia Pacific.Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income rose 4% year over year.Global Energy Sales rose 9% to $847.1 million owing to strong growth in the well stimulation business and modest gains in the downstream business.Acquisition-adjusted fixed currency operating income remained flat year over year.Other Sales declined 11% year over year to $197.4 million. However, sales in this segment witnessed robust growth in North America.Notably, the Other segment now has Ecolab’s Colloidal Technologies unit. The unit was previously part of the Global Industrial Reportable segment.Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales rose 8% year over year, as the Pest Elimination unit within the segment registered solid growth in North America and Europe.Margin AnalysisThe company’s margins in the quarter under review remained under pressure owing to higher delivered-product costs.As a percentage of revenues, Ecolab registered adjusted gross margin of 40% in the first quarter, down 150 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.Adjusted operating margin in the first quarter contracted 60 bps to 10.9% of net revenues.However, Ecolab remains hopeful of the latest pricing initiatives that it has undertaken. Per management, these are expected to boost margins in the coming quarters.View UpEcolab expects full-year 2018 adjusted earnings in the range of $5.30 to $5.50 per share, up from the previously issued range of $5.25-$5.45. Notably, this represents an increase in the band of 13-18% year over year. Notably, the Zacks Consensus estimate is currently pegged at $5.35 per share.As a percentage of revenues, adjusted gross margin is expected to be 42% of net revenues, which is significantly below the previously issued range of 47-48%.For the second quarter of 2018, Ecolab expects adjusted earnings in the range of $1.23 to $1.29 per share. The current outlook reflects an increase of 10-15% year over year.Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter of 2018 is expected to be 42% of net revenues.In ConclusionEcolab ended the first quarter on a favorable note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. Despite strength in the Pest Elimination business, the Other segment declined year over year on a reported basis. Ecolab operates in highly competitive markets, which might mar prospects over the long haul.We believe that volatility in foreign currency exchange rates will remain a significant headwind for the company. Ecolab faces pricing pressure in the Energy segment, which is likely to hurt profits.On the brighter side, a strong guidance instills optimism on the stock. Further, Europe, North America and Latin America led Global Industrial regional growth in the quarter. Strength in the Global Institutional segment led by growth in the Specialty and Healthcare business lines is also a positive. A robust product portfolio and an expanding customer base are likely to drive organic sales over the long haul.Q1 Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space, which reported solid earnings this season are, Baxter International Inc.

297,BAX,"The fourth-quarter 2017 earnings season is gaining momentum with 133 S&P 500 participants having already released financial numbers as of Jan 26. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the reporting cycle was off to an encouraging start with above-average proportion of companies edging past the top and bottom-line expectations.Total earnings for these members have improved 11.6% on 6% increase in revenues.With results of roughly 121 members slated to be announced this week, per the Zacks data, estimates for the period are gradually trending upward across the board for nine of the 16 Zacks sectors. The Medical as one in the bracket, is expected to witness a 2.1% earnings rise in the fourth quarter on 2% revenue growth projection.What’s in Store for Medical Device Industry?The medical device space within the broader Medical sector somewhat displays a mixed bag of sorts. As part of the tax overhaul, corporate tax rates have been slashed down to 21% from the previous 35%, thus lending a huge relief to the MedTech mammoths.However, ahead of the industry’s fourth-quarter earnings release, a section of analysts expect this new tax law to negatively impact the industry due to a possible cut in overall Medicare spending, if certain criteria are not fulfilled by a specific date. The Congressional Budget Office apprehends that in absence of any alternative to meet the fiscal deficit from the huge tax reduction, automatic cut backs worth $136 billion including $25 billion in Medicare cuts from the mandatory budget of spending in 2018, could be triggered.Amid tax reform related concerns, the news of Congress delaying the medical device tax for another two years came as a huge boost to industry players and investors. This 2.3% tax was earlier delayed by Congress in 2015 for a couple of years. The deferral will once again largely propel R&D activities within this space.Let’s take a sneak peek at the performance of five major medical device companies, waiting to report earnings on Feb 1.Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report): We are optimistic about the company’s gradually improving performance in Interventional Cardiology, led by an innovative portfolio and robust commercial teams, globally. More specifically, The WATCHMAN platform is expected to experience another excellent quarter on consistent global momentum as Boston Scientific’s multiple market development efforts continue to push for growth.The company has a positive Earnings ESP of +1.07% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). While a favorable Zacks ESP indicates a likely positive surprise, a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.  (Read More: Will WATCHMAN Boost Boston Scientific's Q4 Earnings?)Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Scientific Corporation QuoteBaxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report): In the fourth quarter of 2017, Baxter International is anticipated to gain from strong Hospital Products, driven by solid sales in the U.S. Fluid Systems business as well as robust demand for injectable pharmaceuticals. Within the Hospital Products segment, we expect Fluid Systems to maintain the momentum, evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $634 million for the to-be-reported quarter, which reflects a 3.3% improvement from the year-ago period.Banking on solid prospects, our quantitative model also shows a beat for the company, given the combination of a Zacks Rank of 3 and an Earnings ESP of +1.28%.

Also McKesson Specialty Health unit is likely to drive the company’s top line in the same time frame. The unit is likely to benefit from the closing of the intraFUSION acquisition and the recent BDI Pharma buyout.We are unable to conclude whether McKesson is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

298,BAX,"Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors’ radar irrespective of market conditions. This is because a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with its price performance.Key Ratios to Identify EfficiencySometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are:Inventory Turnover: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company’s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which resulted in excess inventory. Receivables Turnover:  This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company’s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or “debtor’s turnover ratio” is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.Asset Utilization: This ratio indicates a company’s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.Operating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company’s ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.Screening ParametersIn addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average (Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)    The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to only 12.Here are four stocks from the 12 that made it through the screen:Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) provides a portfolio of renal and hospital products. The company operates through two segments, Hospital Products and Renal.

299,BAX,"On Mar 26, we issued an updated research report on Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report). The company rides high on a series of regulatory approvals and strategic acquisitions. However, generic competition and pricing pressure loom large. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Baxter has been witnessing positive tidings on the regulatory front. Recently, the company announced the approval of Bivalirudin in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (bivalirudin). Management at Baxter has confirmed that the FDA has granted two new approvals for temporary importation of certain drugs in Canada and Mexico. Furthermore, the FDA approval of new premixed injectables is a key catalyst. The company’s new product, the home PD technology, also received a go-ahead from the FDA. Baxter has been enhancing its product portfolio through strategic collaborations. Lately, the company took over RECOTHROM Thrombin topical and PREVELEAK Surgical Sealant product lines from Mallinckrodt. Earlier, Baxter had closed the acquisition of India-based Claris Injectables Limited, which is expected to prove accretive to adjusted earnings. In 2017, Baxter had signed an agreement with India-based Dorizoe Lifesciences for the expansion of its generic injectables pipeline. Baxter has a solid product portfolio, including the Arisure Closed System Transfer device and the SIGMA Spectrum Infusion System. Furthermore, the company launched the DeviceVue Advanced Asset Tracking System and the first 3-in-1 oXIRIS set in acute therapies. The company also recently launched a version of its AK 98 hemodialysis (HD) system to help dialysis providers  However, generic competition for cyclophosphamide is a concern. Cyclophosphamide is part of Baxter's Hospital Products segment, which has been posting lackluster performance for the most part of the last five years. The drop in cyclophosphamide sales poses a threat to the company’s Integrated Pharmacy Solutions franchise business. Price Performance In the past six months, Baxter’s shares have gained 5.1% compared with the industry’s 3%. The primary factor backing the solid share performance is the company’s presence in the life-sustaining and critical care products category that is cushioned against economic downturns.  Other Key Picks A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are athenahealth, Inc. (ATHN  -  Free Report), Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (BIO  -  Free Report) and Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report). Each of these stocks sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. athenahealth has expected long-term growth rate of 17.7% and earnings per share growth rate of 21.5%. Bio-Rad has expected long-term growth rate of 20% and earnings per share growth rate of 20%. Centene has expected long-term growth rate of 14.4% and earnings per share growth rate of 14.4%. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%. And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

300,BAX,"Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Feb 1, before market opens.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 8.5%. Baxter International has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the preceding four quarters, the average positive beat being 10.6%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsSimilar to last quarter, Baxter International is expected to gain from strength in Hospital Products on solid sales in the U.S. Fluid Systems business as well as solid demand for injectable pharmaceuticals.Baxter International Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Baxter International Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Baxter International Inc. Quote Within Hospital Products, in the third quarter, sales in Fluid Systems were up significantly on robust IV solution sales in the United States. We expect Fluid Systems to maintain the trend, as is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $634 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting 3.3% rise from the year-ago quarter.Global sales of Integrated Pharmacy Solutions (IPS), another sub segment within Hospital Products, increased by a formidable margin in the third quarter, partly on the back of increased sales for premixed injectable drugs. For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for IPS is pegged at $576 million, up 2.3% from the year ago reported number.Surgical Care (includes anesthesia and BioSurgery) sales also recorded year-over-year sales growth in the third quarter, on low double-digit growth for anesthesia and critical care products, driven by growing demand for inhaled anesthetics internationally as well as increased U.S. sales of BREVIBLOC — a fast-acting IV beta blocker. The fourth-quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s sales stands at$576 million, up 1.1% from the year-ago quarter.Also, BioSurgery sales increased low-single digits globally in the last reported quarter. The company expects growth in this business to continue as a result of continuous efforts to enhance commercial effectiveness.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hospital Products net sales of $1.67 billion reflects an increase of 2.6% from the year-ago quarter.Notably, on Sep 27, 2017, Baxter announced the launch of comprehensive asset tracking solution DeviceVue. The solution will be used alongside the company’s proprietary pump system, Sigma Spectrum Infusion System. It will aid clinicians and biomedical engineers to quickly find unused pumps by viewing location and status data on PCs, iPads or iPhones. We are bullish on the development as it provides an edge to Sigma Spectrum when compared with other smart pumps in the market.Here are the other factors that might influence Baxter’s fourth-quarter results:Sales in Renal business grew significantly in the third quarter on the back of solid performance across all lines of the business. Taking the stellar third-quarter performance into consideration, we expect the Renal business to perform well in the yet-to-be-reported quarter as well.On Sep 26, 2017, Baxter announced the commercial launch of a new indication for the company’s oXiris set, which can now be used to remove excessive levels of cytokines, endotoxin and other inflammatory mediators from a patient’s blood. The launch is likely to drive the top line in the yet-to-be reported quarter.As per the company’s earlier-provided guidance, sales in the fourth quarter are expected to increase 1% to 2%. Net sales in the quarter are expected to rise 2% at constant currency. The company expects Hurricane Maria to have a negative impact on fourth-quarter revenues of around $70 million. The company also expects adjusted earnings in the range of 56 cents to 59 cents per diluted share. This includes a 6-cent negative earnings impact from Hurricane Maria, which is mitigated by an increase in the sales projections for U.S. cyclophosphamide and a lower-than-expected tax rate for the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $2.76 billion, while the same for earnings is at 58 cents, reflecting a 1.6% increase.However, pricing pressure continues to raise caution.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Baxter has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Baxter International is +1.50%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Baxter International carries a Zacks Rank #3.Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 90 cents reflects a 20% improvement on a year-over-year basis.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.45% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

301,BAX,"PerkinElmer, Inc. (PKI  -  Free Report) is expected to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 25, after the market closes. In the last quarter, the company registered adjusted earnings of 73 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 72 cents. Further, adjusted revenues of approximately $554 million also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $552 million.Solid performances in the Discovery and Analytical Solutions unit as well as Diagnostics segment will drive PerkinElmer’s top line in the fourth quarter. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Discovery and Analytical Solutions revenues is currently pegged at $437 million. This reflects an improvement of 13.5% from the third quarter. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Diagnostics segment revenues is pegged at $180 million, up 6.5% from the last quarter.PerkinElmer, Inc. Price and Consensus PerkinElmer, Inc. Price and Consensus | PerkinElmer, Inc. QuoteNotably, PerkinElmer has also outperformed the industry over the last year. The stock has gained 52% surpassing the industry’s rally of 47.7%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to the fourth-quarter earnings announcement.Factors to ConsiderView Upbeat: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PerkinElmer’s fourth-quarter earnings is at 94 cents per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 13.3%. For revenues, the consensus estimate is pegged at $615.8 million, up 8.7% year over year.Earlier, management confirmed that the company has been progressing favorably per the original guidance cited in the beginning of fiscal 2017.

Further, post the first-quarter earnings, the company raised its revenue guidance as well.Favorable Market Trends: PerkinElmer continues to witness favorable market conditions. For the first time in more than five years, the company experienced positive organic growth in every region of the world and end market in which it operates in the last quarter. We expect the company to maintain this momentum in the quarter to be reported. Looking specifically at the end markets, pharma biotech and diagnostics are expected to see strong sales in the fourth quarter.Acquisition to Drive Growth: Acquisitions and strategic partnerships have proved to be key growth catalysts for PerkinElmer. Recently, the company completed its previously announced acquisition of EUROIMMUN Medical Laboratory Diagnostics AG. Through this acquisition, EUROIMMUN expanded PerkinElmer’s reach in the autoimmune and allergy diagnostic markets. It also fortified the company’s foothold in curing new infectious diseases. The management is optimistic about acquisition-driven growth in fiscal 2018.Solid Product Portfolio: PerkinElmer delivers a comprehensive suite of scientific informatics and software solutions to aggregate data into actionable insights in an automated and scalable way. The company launched its new mass spectrometry platform, QSight Triple Quad LC/MS/MS for the clinical market in the last quarter. While QSight has already received a very positive response in the niche space, this is expected to provide PerkinElmer a competitive edge in the MedTech space in the fourth quarter.The company’s products include the industry leading ChemDraw software, Electronic Lab Notebooks including cloud-based Elements SaaS Offering and enterprise E-Notebook Solutions, along with the TIBCO Spotfire platform for scientific data analytics.PerkinElmer’s expanding portfolio is helping the company win market share worldwide.Thus, PerkinElmer is confident of improving growth trajectory in the fourth quarter.Our quantitative model conclusively shows an earnings beat for PerkinElmer this quarter.This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for PerkinElmer is +0.21%.

As per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings of these companies have increased 25% on a year-over-year basis on 10.7% higher revenues. Further, a whopping 82.8% of these companies have surpassed earnings estimates, while 67.8% beat the revenue mark.However, the number of positive revenue surprises this season is lagging the preceding year’s numbers.

306,BAX,"Mallinckrodt plc (MNK  -  Free Report) entered into an agreement with Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) wherein the former will sell certain hemostasis products to the latter for approximately $185 million.Of the total, $153 million will be paid upfront while the remaining will be paid as milestone payments in future.The products include Recothrom Thrombin topical (Recombinant) and Preveleak Surgical Sealant. Baxter will assume other expenses, including contingent liabilities associated with Preveleak.However, Mallinckrodt will retain Raplixa (Fibrin sealant (human)) for topical use and is evaluating strategic options for this product.The company acquired these products from The Medicines Co. (MDCO  -  Free Report) to strengthen its growing hospital portfolio.The moves is in line with Mallinckrodt’s strategy to streamline its business to evolve as a top-performing specialty pharmaceutical company. It will help the company to focus on innovative medicines and therapies like terlipressin and StrataGraft, and the recently acquired products stannsoporfin, xenon gas and OCR-002.The divestiture of the products will dilute Mallinckrodt's bottom-line by $0.10 to $0.15 in 2018. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2018.Earlier, Mallinckrodt sold its Intrathecal Therapy business for approximately $203 million to Piramal Enterprises Limited's subsidiary, Piramal Critical Care in the UK. The company also sold its global Nuclear Imaging business to IBA Molecular for approximately $690 million due to lingering challenging conditions.In December 2017, the company announced that it will acquire Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  to revive its beleaguered portfolio.  Mallinckrodt’s stock has tumbled 58.3% over a year compared with the industry’s decline of 24.8%.The year 2017 has been challenging for Mallinckrodt as sales volume of lead drug Acthar declined while weaknesses in the generics segment still persist. This downside is attributed to the payer environment faced by specialty drugs and the slump is expected to continue in the fourth quarter as well.Additionally, the Dublin, Ireland-based company is also dealing with concerns related to Inomax. The company suffered a setback after a U.S. District Court invalidated 11 patents covering its second-largest product, Inomax. The company’s generic segment continues to be soft as various product categories are witnessing stiff competition, which in turn hurts volumes as well as prices. Further adding to its woes, Mallinckrodt expects a double-digit decline in revenues from this segment in the near time. Also, continued sluggishness in this segment might adversely impact the company’s gross profit margin.Zacks RankMallinckrodt carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

307,BAX,"On Dec 26, we issued an updated research report on Illumina, Inc. (ILMN  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the last three months, shares of this San Diego, CA-based company have been trading above the broader industry. The stock has rallied 7.6% versus the broader industry’s decline of 9.5% during the period.We are encouraged to note that the company’s third-quarter 2017 performance was quite promising. The top line was driven by a solid uptake of sequencing consumables and instruments as well as microarray portfolios. Meanwhile, the company’s raised 2017 guidance indicates that this bullish trend is here to stay.Management is hopeful that recent launches from the company’s product portfolio including NovaSeq S4 flow cell and the reagent kit for its NovaSeq 6000 System will drive demand for NovaSeq. We also look forward to the introduction of NovaSeqXp workflow. Besides, the company’s launch of Nextera DNA Flex buoys optimism. Moreover, it has recently partnered with Telegraph Hill Partners to set up an independent entity.We are also curious about GRAIL’s prospects, Illumina’s venture in the cancer screening market. Importantly, the company has started a detailed planning to embark on a large-scale clinical trial in 2017.Illumina is currently keeping pace with its goals to strengthen foothold in the multi-billion gene sequencing market with some highly competitive products in its existing portfolio and the pipeline. For its market expansion, the company’s primary focus was on reproductive and genetic health space, for which, Illumina seeks to widen its portfolio by providing the verifi laboratory-developed non-invasive prenatal test (“NIPT”).This market is rapidly developing on a global scale, allowing the company to witness consistent growth in the number of NIPT samples. Good news is that positive NIPT reimbursement trends have been observed within the United States during the third quarter. Incidentally, the rate of NIPT adoption is equally high beyond the country’s periphery.We are particularly upbeat about the strong uptake of VeriSeq NIPT CE-IVD solution in third-quarter 2017. On a positive note, countries like The Netherlands and Denmark too have started covering the test since the first quarter, followed by England and France. Hence, the company continues to see positive reimbursement trends in Europe as well.On the flip side, weak margins due to the NovaSeq launch, higher array service revenues and product mix within sequencing consumables continue to raise concerns. Also, the National Institutes of Health funding issue and a tough competitive landscape are a few more challenges to deal with.Key PicksSome of the top-ranked medical stocks are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) and ICU Medical Inc. (ICUI  -  Free Report).

308,BAX,"Shares of PRA Health Sciences, Inc. (PRAH  -  Free Report) rallied to a new 52-week high of $92 on Dec 22, closing the session nominally lower at $91.53. This represents a strong year-to-date return of approximately 23.9%, higher than the S&P 500’s 6.8%. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Taking the stable stock performance into consideration, we expect PRA Health stock to scale new highs in the quarters ahead. The company also has a trailing four-quarter average positive earnings surprise of 6.89%. Its  projected long-term growth rate of 18.1% (outperforming the broader industry’s 15.4% growth rate),is encouraging.Estimate revision trend for the current year looks impressive as well. Over the past couple of months, five estimates have moved north with no movement in the opposite direction. In this period, earnings estimates have improved 1.8% for the current fiscal to reach $3.31 per share.For the majority of the last three months, the company’s share price has considerably outperformed the broader industry. The stock has rallied 20.6% over the  same time frame, beating the industry’s gain of just 9.3%.PRA Health Sciences, Inc. Price PRA Health Sciences, Inc. Price | PRA Health Sciences, Inc. QuoteFactors Driving the StockStellar revenue performance over the last few quarters: Consistent revenue performance on the back of strong contribution from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies contributed to the company’s overall health. Considering the favorable foreign exchange scenario strong and balanced geographic expansion, we expect this trend to continue in the upcoming period.Symphony Health Solutions Integration a Positive: The acquisition of Symphony Health Solutions, a pharmaceutical and data healthcare company, which was closed in the third quarter of 2017, has already proved itself to be a strategic addition to PRA Health’s overall business. In the third quarter, the deal delivered significant earnings growth of 41% and revenue growth of 18% on a year-over-year basis at constant currency.New Director Appoinment: Investors may have taken the company’s management churn in a positive way. In this regard, we note that the company appointed a new director Alexander G. Dickinson last August. His competent background in analytics and informatics is believed to have boosted the firm’s performance. Previously, Dickinson served as the executive chairman of Chroma Code, a private clinical diagnostics company. He was also the senior vice president of Strategic Initiatives at Illumina where he worked with national governments and large institutions to develop precision medicine programs for healthcare systems.Key PicksSome of the other top-ranked medical stocks are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), Baxter International Inc.

309,BAX,"On Dec 22, we issued an updated research report on Warsaw, IN-based Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report). The company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Over the last six months, this leading musculoskeletal healthcare company has been trading below the broader industry on macroeconomic uncertainties, pricing pressure and unfavorable currency fluctuations. The stock has lost 6.3% of its value versus the broader industry's 2.3% gain.Per management, Zimmer Biomet is grappling with headwinds such as supply delay of certain products — causing its inability to win back lost customers in the United States and tap the new ones — softened domestic market conditions, the impact of consecutive hurricanes and a significant price reduction in the Indian knee market. The trimmed 2017 guidance, issued last quarter during the result announcement, adds to our concerns indicating little chances of recovery ahead.The estimate revision trend for 2017 also remains unfavorable with 17 estimates having moved south and none in the opposite direction over the past couple of months. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 21 cents downward over this period to $8.03 per share.On a positive note, we look forward to the synergies expected to be drawn from the recently completed LDR Holding acquisition, which should broaden and complement the company's musculoskeletal offering. This is in line with its strategy to grow through inorganic means by focusing on mega buyouts. We also pin high hopes on the strong tactical and financial goals the combined entity aims to reach, now that the deal has been sealed.Zimmer Biomet has been of late working to fortify its foothold in the emerging markets with potential to provide long-term opportunities. Good news is that the company's planned investments in these regions over several quarters with a view to enhance operational and sales performance are also yielding results.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), Baxter International Inc.

311,BAX,"A company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with the company's price performance.  Efficiency, which is the ability to transform inputs into outputs, is a potential indicator of a company’s financial health.However, it is difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks to build a profitable portfolio.How to Measure Efficiency? We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns.Inventory TurnoverInventory level is one of the key indicators of a company’s business health. While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough phase in terms of sales, a dwindling level may indicate that the company will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition. This is where inventory turnover comes into play. It is the ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a 4-quarter average inventory. Thus, a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS, while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory.Receivables TurnoverThis ratio is used to measure a company’s capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit. Receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or the “debtor’s turnover ratio” is calculated by dividing 12-month sales by four-quarter average receivables. While a high ratio indicates that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers, a low ratio signals that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low-quality customers or an inefficient credit policy.Asset UtilizationThis is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency. Asset utilization indicates a company’s potential to utilize its assets. It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4-quarter average of total assets. So, the higher the ratio, the greater is the chance that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently. On the contrary, a low value of the ratio signals that it is failing to use its assets effectively.Operating MarginAnother popular efficiency ratio is the operating margin. Operating profit margin, which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period, indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses. If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors, it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses.All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry. This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have higher ratios than their respective industry averages.Screening ParametersIn addition to the above mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) — to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average (Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)    Zacks Rank better than or equal to #2 (Buy)(Only Zacks Rank #1 and Buy-rated stocks can get through.)The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,904 stocks to only 13. Here are five of the 15 stocks that passed the screen.Athletic apparel companyLululemon Athletica Inc.

312,BAX,"JP Morgan has launched a new fund focused on providing exposure to the U.S. equity space. It invests in companies with low volatility. JPMorgan U.S. Minimum Volatility ETF JMIN tracks the JP Morgan US Minimum Volatility Index.  Fund Characteristics The fund utilizes a rules-based methodology to select stocks based on volatility. It has AUM of $25.7 million and seeks to provide exposure to low risk equities, while minimizing unsystematic risk. It charges 12 basis points as fee per year and has top holdings in NVR Inc, Walmart Stores Inc and Brownforman Corp, with 0.8%, 0.7% and 0.7% exposure, respectively (as of Dec 6, 2017). It bears less concentration risk as all, just a little over 7.0%, is allocated to the top 10 holdings. From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Health Care, Consumer Goods and Utilities, with 20.4%, 19.4% and 17.0% exposure, respectively (as of Dec 6, 2017).  Market Impact The Senate voted 51-49 in favor of the tax reform. Although there are multiple hurdles for the tax reform to become a law, Trump called the Senate vote a major victory and the Republican Party unbeatable. “Unless they have somebody that we don’t know about, right now we’re unbeatable,” said Trump. The House and Senate differ radically on what they want to establish from the tax reform. Multiple compromises might be needed to come to a conclusion. For instance, the House wants to abolish the estate tax, whereas the Senate wants to raise it. If there are significant negotiations made in reconciling the two plans, appeal for low volatility funds might increase. There is increased uncertainty with regard to Trump’s deregulation plans. This might increase investors’ appeal for safety and in turn make them shift to low volatility funds. Competition The fund faces high competition from other funds focused on providing exposure to the same space. Below we discuss a few ETFs that seek to provide exposure to this corner (see all Total Market (U.S.) ETFs here). iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF (USMV  -  Free Report) This fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies that are more or less immune to volatility.  It has AUM of $15.0 billion and charges a fee of 15 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Information Technology, Health Care and Consumer Staples with 19.6%, 16.6% and 13.3% allocation, respectively (as of Dec 6, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are Mcdonalds Corp (MCD  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report), with 1.5% allocation each (as of Dec 06, 2017). The fund has returned 19.0% in a year and 16.4% year to date (as of Dec 7, 2017). It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook. PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio (SPLV  -  Free Report) This fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies that are more or less immune to volatility.  It has AUM of $7.3 billion and charges a fee of 25 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Utilities, Financials and Industrials with 21.5%, 20.6% and 17.4% allocation, respectively (as of Dec 7, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are Honeywell International Inc (HON  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola Co (KO  -  Free Report) and Pepsico Inc (PEP  -  Free Report), with 1.3% allocation each (as of Dec 7, 2017). The fund has returned 18.2% in a year and 15.2% year to date (as of Dec 7, 2017). It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a Medium risk outlook. SPDR Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focus ETF (ONEV  -  Free Report) This fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies that are more or less immune to volatility. It tracks the Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focused Factor Index.  It has AUM of $474.0 million and charges a fee of 20 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Financial Services, Consumer Discretionary and Producer Durables with 23.5%, 20.1% and 16.3% allocation, respectively (as of Dec 6, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report), Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) and Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report), with a respective allocation of 1.1%, 1.0% and 1.0% allocation (as of Dec 6, 2017). The fund has returned 14.0% in a year and 15.4% year to date (as of Dec 7, 2017). It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3. Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox? Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

313,BAX,"Asia-Pacific, or APAC, is home to more than half of the world's population, so demand for healthcare is also exceptionally high in the region. Furthermore, the need for cutting-edge MedTech products and services is significantly high across the world, with APAC being no exception.In fact, a research report by McKinsey shows that APAC is expected to outpace the European Union as the world’s second-largest MedTech market pretty soon (after the United States). Almost 1.1 billion people in the region are expected to enter the 50-plus age group by 2025, indicating emerging demand for healthcare needs. Also, APAC accounts for two-thirds of the global disease burden.Further, a research report by Statista shows that the MedTech market in the Asia-Pacific region is estimated to reach nearly $78 billion in 2018.Trump’s Focus on AsiaWith the above data pointing toward the huge and unmet healthcare needs within the APAC market, investors may find President Trump’s recent 12-day long Asia trip (with stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines) to be a positive sign.Furthermore, his recent tweet – “Our great country is respected again in Asia. You will see the fruits of our long but successful trip for many years to come!”–is indicative of a favorable Republican stance on APAC, especially with respect to business and trade.Here we take a sneak peek at two major postulates of Trump’s recent Asia visit:Bilateral Trade AgreementTrump’s promise to augment bilateral trade agreements with Indo-Pacific nations instills our confidence in his APAC policies. However, Trump specifically mentioned that these agreements are bound to follow the ""principles of fair and reciprocal trade."" He also voiced for “free and open Indo-Pacific trade,” emphasizing on increased focus in the nations of Japan, Australia, and India.Prospects in China“Pacific is big enough to accommodate both China and the United States,” said China’s President Xi Jinping during Trump’s visit.China undoubtedly poses serious competitive threat to the United States, not just in the healthcare space, but also in electronic, semiconductors, retail, and other areas. Jinping’s statements clearly hint at the possibility of the countries coexisting peacefully despite the political tensions. This might also be indicative of strategic mergers between companies in the two nations in order to enhance trade practices.MedTech Companies Eye APACConsidering Trump’s growing focus on APAC, the region seems to be poised to yield accretive returns in the long term. In fact, stakeholders in the medical universe have been eyeing the emerging market over the last couple of years. These companies are bullish on the growing medical awareness, economic prosperity, an aging population, increasing wealth, government focus on healthcare infrastructure, and the expansion of medical insurance coverage in the APAC space.Meanwhile, despite the health-policy debacle in the United States and deteriorating economic conditions in Europe, we can conclude that growth in the emerging markets of China, India, Japan, and others will bolster the global foothold for MedTech companies. Below, we take a look at four leading MedTech players that are tapping into and also gaining from the bountiful opportunities in the APAC market:Baxter International (BAX  -  Free Report)Baxter’s solid presence in Asia, precisely in India, is worth a mention; the company has research hubs in Japan and China. In the just-reported third quarter, Baxter completed the acquisition of India-based Claris Injectables, a global generic injectables pharmaceutical company, for almost $625 million. In December 2016, Baxter had initiated the agreement. Per management, the acquisition will bolster Baxter’s foothold in the generic pharmaceuticals space. In the second quarter of 2017, Baxter signed an agreement with India-based Dorizoe Lifesciences for the expansion of its generic injectables pipeline. Further, Baxter’s strong presence in peritoneal dialysis, nutrition, IV fluids, and anesthesia gases fortifies its footprint in China.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has had an impressive run on the bourses in the last two years. The stock has returned 70.6%, significantly higher than the broader industry’s gain of 16.2%.  BostonScientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report)An important part of Boston Scientific’s growth strategy is to continue pursuing development opportunities outside the United States.In the just-reported third-quarter 2017, business from the emerging markets registered an 18% organic growth rate. It remained above the company’s target of reaching 15% of sales by 2017 (from 8% in 2013). Business in China was also remarkable (up 23% year-over-year). The company is currently looking forward to an improved performance in China, banking on the recent approval of SYNERGY.Boston Scientific is also optimistic about its core cardiology segment, which is gradually stabilizing with growth in the BRIC nations. The cardiology capacity in China is expected to double by 2017-end. In India, business is projected to grow more than 15% annually.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has yielded a stellar return of 59.3% in the last two years, way ahead of the broader industry’s 16.2% over the same time frame. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.  Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG  -  Free Report)Intuitive Surgical’s growing interest in the emerging markets, specifically in the APAC region, bodes well. Over the last couple of years, the company’s procedure performance in Asia showed continued strength, with solid growth in China, Japan, and Korea. In the just-reported third quarter, Intuitive Surgical’s system placements included 14 in Japan, five in India, four in New Mexico, and one in China.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has returned 135.4% over the last two years, much higher than the broader industry’s 25% during the same period.  Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report)Becton, Dickinson and Company, or BD, is focused on geographical expansion in overseas markets, and in particular, emerging nations. We note that the company is especially focused on broader emerging markets like India and China, which are seeing rapid growth in economic and healthcare sectors. We believe that significant emerging market exposure will boost the company’s top line, which in turn should lead to accelerated EPS growth.BD revenues grew 6.9% in the just-reported fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Emerging market revenues grew a strong 12.7% year-over-year in the quarter at constant currency, driven by strong performance in greater Asia and China, where revenues saw double digit growth.This leading player in the MedTech space is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock has returned 45.1% in the last two years, much higher than the broader industry’s growth of 10%.  The ParadoxHowever, Trump’s ‘Americafirst!’ pitch at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, or APEC, which was held in Vietnam (November 6-11), has been a serious threat to U.S. multilateral trade. It has been clearly portrayed that Trump’s primary focus was, is, and will be the betterment of the United States.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

314,BAX,"Astute investors are always on the lookout for a plan that is likely to yield high returns regardless of market circumstances. Efficiency level, which measures a company’s capability to transform its available input into output, is often considered an important parameter used to gauge a company’s potential to rake in handsome returns.A company with a promising efficiency level is likely to deliver stellar returns as it is assumed to be positively correlated with its price performance.How to Measure Efficiency? We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns.Inventory TurnoverInventory level is one of the key indicators of a company’s business health. While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough patch in terms of sales, a dwindling level may indicate that the company will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition. This is where inventory turnover comes into play. It is the ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a 4-quarter average inventory. Thus, a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS, while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory.Receivables TurnoverThis ratio is used to measure a company’s capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit. Receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or the “debtor’s turnover ratio” is calculated by dividing 12-month sales by four-quarter average receivables. While a high ratio indicates that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers, a low ratio signals that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low-quality customers or an inefficient credit policy.Asset UtilizationThis is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency. Asset utilization indicates a company’s potential to utilize its assets. It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4-quarter average of total assets. So, the higher the ratio, the greater is the chance that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently. On the contrary, a low value of the ratio signals that it is failing to use its assets effectively.Operating MarginAnother popular efficiency ratio is operating margin. Operating profit margin, which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period, indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses. If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors, it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses.All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry. This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have higher ratios than their respective industry averages.Screening ParametersIn addition to the above mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average (Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)Zacks Rank better than or equal to #2 (Buy)(Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Buy-rated stocks can get through.)The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,904 stocks to only 13.

315,BAX,"Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors’ radar irrespective of market conditions. This is because a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with its price performance.Key Ratios to Identify EfficiencySometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are:Inventory Turnover: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company’s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which resulted in excess inventory. Receivables Turnover:  This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company’s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or “debtor’s turnover ratio” is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.Asset Utilization: This ratio indicates a company’s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.Operating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company’s ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.Screening ParametersIn addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average (Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)    The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to only 14.Here are five stocks from the 14 that made it through the screen:Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report) provides hospice and palliative care services in the United States.

316,BAX,"Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) has had an impressive run on the bourses of late. Last year, the company has added 46.9%, outperforming the broader industry’s gain of 24.9%. The current level is also higher than the S&P 500’s return of 19.9%. Recurring revenue stream, expanding product portfolio and strong presence in the international markets are key positives. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Here we take a sneak peek at the major factors driving growth for Baxter at the moment:The year 2017 has been a favorable one for Baxter on the regulatory front. Recently, management confirmed that the FDA has granted two new approvals for temporary importation of certain drugs from the facilities in Canada and Mexico. With this development, Baxter now has four operational sites approved to meet demand in the U.S. markets.Furthermore, the FDA approval of new premixed injectables is a key catalyst. The company’s new product — the home peritoneal dialysis (PD) technology — also received an FDA nod. The platform leverages on Baxter’s flagship AMIA automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) system.In the recent past, Baxter achieved a regulatory milestone for its advanced dialysis technology. The company received an approval from the FDA for its home PD solution system to improve patient access to home dialysis.Baxter has a strong presence in foreign markets which makes international diversification a core component of its strategy. In a bid to fortify its overseas presence, the company has launched the oXIRIS set for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and sepsis management protocols in select markets of Europe, Middle East and Africa.Notably, oXIRIS, which leverages on the company’s flagship PRISMAFLEX system, is expected to lend Baxter a competitive edge in the global market. With a large proportion of sales coming from overseas markets, Baxter should benefit from developing countries' incremental investments in health care systems. Recent acquisitions position the company well for revenue growth in the rapidly-expanding Asian and Latin American markets.  Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories (IDXX  -  Free Report).Notably, PetMed Express sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 10%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Luminex represented a return of 6.2% over the last year. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1.IDEXX Laboratories has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 20.4%. The stock has climbed 39.2% over a year’s time and has a Zacks Rank #2.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>
