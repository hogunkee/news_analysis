13,WAT,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's health care plan, released over the weekend, could have a positive impact for some companies in the medical hardware and development market, says Evercore ISI.Analyst Ross Muken wrote in a research report that Clinton's plan to encourage research and development spending should give a boost to providers of life science tools and services used in pharmaceutical development.""The added focus on generics and biosimilars can add an additional leg of growth to the pharma end market, largely continuing to benefit chromatography (Agilent (A), Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO)), Waters (WAT)) and separations players (Pall/Danaher (DHR)),"" Muken wrote. ""The one potential offset would be if the increased scrutiny on drug pricing led to fewer total dollars spend on R&D (we view that as unlikely).""All the above stocks are currently highly rated by IBD metrics -- especially Danaher, which hold a highest-possible Composite Rating of 99 and is trading at all-time highs. Danaher stock closed down 1% at 80.08 on the stock market today, after touching a record high of 81.28 on Friday.Agilent shares fell 0.2%, Thermo Fisher also lost 0.2% and Waters eased 0.5%.Clinton also wants to clear out the backlog of generic drug applications in the FDA and shorten the seven-year exclusivity period granted to biosimilar drugs. Muken says this should accelerate production by companies making these drugs and drive business for contract research organizations (CROs).""Additionally, the plan's intention to hold drug companies accountable and require value-based studies to justify the high drug prices could accelerate pharma's adoption of real-world data services,"" he said. ""This adoption could provide CROs another avenue of growth outside the traditional clinical trial outsourcing and is one of the reasons highlighted by Quintiles' (Q) management for the Quintiles/IMS Health (IMS) merger.""Parexel (PRXL) has also named real-world data services as a growth driver, Muken noted.Quintiles stock, with a middling CR of 58, fell 0.8% Monday. Parexel, which holds an excellent IBD EPS Rank of 97, dipped less than 0.1%.The outlook is more mixed for clinical devices and systems. On the one hand, if the plan succeeds in expanding the number of covered lives it will help boost demand for things like orthopedic and cardiovascular implants, and the focus on women's health could be positive for Hologic (HOLX), Muken wrote. On the other hand, it could increase the pricing pressure that's already been dogging the industry.""Players like Medtronic (MDT) who are already shifting to a value-based business model are best positioned for the next leg of evolution in the health care space,"" Muken wrote.Medtronic stock, with a strong CR of 90, hit a new intraday high of 88.91 Monday before closing at 88.51. Hologic stock, which has been consolidating as the company goes through a financial turnaround, fell 0.9% to 35.61.

261,WAT,"Waters Corporation (WAT  -  Free Report) has managed to impress investors with its recent earnings streak, as the company’s earnings have trumped estimates in the four trailing quarters. We believe steady demand from pharmaceutical business, solid recurring revenues, strength in Asia as well as modest recovery in industrial markets will continue to be growth drivers, going forward.Driven by impressive growth drivers, the company’s stock has had an impressive run on the bourse in the past three months. It has appreciated 6.5%, ahead of the industry’s average growth of 2.3%. We believe that the company’s impressive traction across markets and strong product portfolio will drive growth.Read on to find out the key catalysts for the company right now.Factors at PlayWaters Corp’s key strengths include leading positions in the pharmaceutical market, broad global customer base and an impressive lineup of products. Over the past few quarters, the company has delivered strong organic growth on the back of continuous operational improvement and judicious use of shareholder capital. Going forward, the company remains confident that modest recovery of industrial markets as well as recurring revenue growth will accelerate growth momentum. In terms of geography, impressive growth of recurring revenues is expected to fuel growth in Asia, which is contributing strongly to the overall top line.Being one of the leading players in the mass spectrometry market, the company has been gaining significantly from the sale of its advanced mass spectrometry instruments. Further, the company’s global pharmaceuticals business is gaining traction over the last few quarters and fueling growth of Waters Division. Moreover, the company’s Industrial business is proving to be a major profit churner on the back of increasing regulation around food safety and quality, strict conditions for food testing, along with environmental and fine chemical applications.Moreover, an increased demand for research intensive products, especially the company’s mass spectrometry solutions, is a positive. Moreover, the company is benefiting significantly from both of its LC and LC/MS platforms. This apart, its sound financial health adds to strength.Despite these positives, the company’s high-debt levels and the consequent interest expenses remain a burden. In recent times, slower budgetary releases in the United States have hurt the pharmaceutical business in the country. Also, during the reported quarter, the company’s sales were limited due to macroeconomic and government policy uncertainties, which seem to be affecting general business activity in the United States.Moreover, the company is grappling with high R&D expenses and stiff competition, which is hurting revenues as well as margins. This apart, recently, the negative impact of currency translation has reduced sales growth, and this remains a risk for future quarters as well, posing a risk to the company’s financials.Considering growth drivers and the risks that the company faces, we have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) on Waters Corp.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks from the same space include Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report), Avid Technology, Inc. (AVID  -  Free Report) and Nutanix Inc. (NTNX  -  Free Report). While Analog Devices sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Avid Technology and Nutanix carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.

263,WAT,"Waters Corporation (WAT  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Jul 25.The company posted a positive earnings surprise of 9.8% in the last reported quarter. Overall, Waters Corp. has an average positive surprise of 5.8% for the trailing four quarters, having beaten estimates thrice.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?According to our proven model, Waters Corp. has the right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Waters Corp. has an Earnings ESP of +0.58%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.73 comes above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.72. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.Zacks Rank: Waters Corp.’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Drive Better-than-Expected ResultsWaters Corp.’s key strengths include a dominant position in the biopharma end markets and thriving sales in emerging markets. Global pharmaceuticals business, in particular, is the company’s largest single market and has been a major profit churner for the Waters Division over the past few quarters. We believe the company’s second-quarter financials will benefit from steady demand from pharmaceutical business, growth in recurring revenue and modest recovery of industrial markets.Moreover, the company’s Industrial business, which has gained momentum in the past few quarters due to increasing demand for improved food quality and safety testing, is also likely to drive the quarter’s top line. In addition, demand for research intensive products, especially the company’s mass spectrometry solutions and liquid chromatography, has been on an uptrend lately and is likely to drive second-quarter sales.During the last reported quarter, Waters Corp.’s liquid chromatography benefited from the ACQUITY Arc System while mass spectrometry sales grew on the back of QDa and Xevo family of Tandem Quadrupole. We believe robust market traction of the ACQUITY, CORTECS and Xevo line of products will supplement the top-line performance of the soon-to-be-reported quarter. In light of the above catalysts, the company’s shares have appreciated 37% year to date, outperforming the industry’s average gain of 35.5%.Despite these positives, sluggishness in the company’s academic and government businesses are likely to restrict growth to some extent. Of late, unfavorable order timing and volatility associated with instrument-heavy business have played a spoilsport for the academic and government businesses. Also, weakness in the chemical industry on a global scale is likely to dampen sales performance for the to-be-reported quarter. Further, we believe that currency fluctuations will remain a risk to the company’s top line in the quarter under review as well.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +1.18% and a Zacks Rank #2, is expected to release quarterly numbers around Aug 4.

The company is anticipated to benefit from strong growth potential in pharmaceutical business.The company is also witnessing encouraging trends in its industrial businesses driven by increasing regulation around food safety and quality, strict conditions for food testing, along with environmental and fine chemical applications. Waters Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Waters Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Waters Corporation Quote The governmental and academic markets have also turned its performance around and looks poised to maintain the growth trend, in the to-be-reported quarter.However, fluctuating demand in the Americas remains a concern.

267,WAT,"Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 17. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 17.6%.The surprise history has been impressive in Lam’s case. The company surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average of 9.16%.The company’s shares have charted a solid trajectory in the recent times, increasing 64.6% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 50.4%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderLam Research has a high exposure to the memory segment that is likely to witness strong growth in the coming quarters. The strength is driven by cloud computing, big data, mobile devices and IoT.In the fiscal second quarter, total system shipments were $2.63 billion, up 11% year over year and above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.61 billion. For the to-be-reported quarter, management expects shipments to be around $3.175 billion (+/- $125 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.18 billion.The company is doing well and expects to succeed in areas such as device architecture, process flow and advanced packaging technology inflections.The company also continues to witness increased adoption rates for 3D NAND technology, FinFETs and multi-patterning. The company has undertaken cost-reduction activities and density scaling for 3D NAND and new memory technologies. All these factors could positively impact the top-line figure of the company.For the quarter to be reported, the company expects revenues of approximately $2.850 billion (+/- $125 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.85 billion.However, volatility in the PC market remains a major concern. Weakness in the PCs could offset the expansion in the 3D NAND, impacting upcoming results.Also, the company faces significant competition in all its product and service categories in the semiconductor capital equipment market.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Lam Research is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Most Accurate estimate stands at $4.35 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.36. Hence, the difference is -0.15%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Lam has a Zacks Rank #2, which when combined with -0.15% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Lam Research Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Lam Research Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Lam Research Corporation Quote Stocks to ConsiderYou could consider the following stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank:Netflix, Inc.

268,WAT,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Waters Corporation (WAT  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 4.7% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is WAT due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Waters’ Q4 Earnings Beat on Broad-Based Sales GrowthWaters Corp. has a brilliant earnings beat streak, spanning 13 quarters of positive earnings surprises, which the company broke just once as it reported in-line earnings once last year.In fourth-quarter 2017, Waters Corp. continued its impressive trend, as the company’s adjusted earnings of $2.51 per share trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.44 by 2.9%.The bottom-line figure fared even better in year-over-year comparison, reflecting striking growth of 13.6% from the prior-year quarter tally of $2.21. Remarkable broad-based top-line expansion, along with spectacular growth in Europe, aided the earnings beat.Solid operational execution, backed by the company’s efficient business model, also lent strength to the results. Further, a decline in interest expenses aided quarterly profits.On a GAAP basis, Waters Corp. reported a loss of $4.44 per share compared with earnings of $2.15 in fourth-quarter 2016. The company’s GAAP profitability was adversely affected by a huge, one-time expense of income tax of about $550 million.For the full year, the company reported adjusted earnings of $7.49 per share, reflecting impressive growth of 14% over the previous year.Inside the HeadlinesIn the reported quarter, Waters Corp.’s net sales grew 9% year over year to $687 million and also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $671 million. For the full year, revenues grew 7% year over year to $2.3 billion.The upside in the quarter’s top line came on the back of robust performance in the bio/pharmaceutical end markets (up 11% year over year), and the government and academic market (up 17% year over year). The momentum was further backed by 3% growth in the industrial end markets.Also, impressive contribution from sale of key products across major geographies supplemented quarterly sales growth. In addition, Water Corp.’s recurring revenues and instrument system sales climbed 12% and 7%, respectively, driving top-line growth.In terms of geographies, Waters Corp. witnessed strong sales in Europe, United States and Asia, which posted 16%, 9% and 7% growth, respectively. Overall sales in the Americas rebounded from the earlier weakness, and rose 6% year over year.Total selling and administrative expenses in the quarter came in at $148.8 million, up from $130.2 million incurred in fourth-quarter 2016. Research and development outlay for the quarter was $35.1 million compared with $32.8 million incurred a year ago.Despite the rise in these expenses, operating income in the quarter advanced 10.5% year over year to $230.2 million.LiquidityWaters Corp.’s cash, cash equivalents and investments at the quarter end amounted to $3.4 billion, higher than the $2.81 billion recorded as on Dec 31, 2016. The company’s total liabilities at quarter end increased to about $3.1 billion from $2.4 billion as on Dec 31, 2016.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month. There have been two revisions lower for the current quarter. While looking back an additional 30 days, we can see even more downside. There have been six moves down in the last two months.Waters Corporation Price and Consensus  Waters Corporation Price and Consensus | Waters Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, WAT has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a B. The stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for growth investors than momentum investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Interestingly, WAT has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect in-line returns from the stock in the next few months.

The company’s total liabilities at quarter end increased to about $3.1 billion from $2.4 billion as on Dec 31, 2016.Our TakeWaters Corp.’s leading position in the high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry markets is its key strength that has acted as a sturdy revenue driver for the past few quarters. The company’s bright pharmaceutical business ended 2017 on a healthy note and looks set to continue its momentum into 2018 as well. It is also seeing encouraging trends in its industrial businesses. The governmental and academic markets have also turned its performance around and look poised to maintain the growth trend, in the coming quarters.Waters Corp.’s exposure in the pharma/biotech industry is primarily in regulated commercial lab environments, where demand is non-discretionary and not prone to cyclicality. This helps the company mitigate uncertain client spending stemming from macroeconomic volatility. Additionally, given the fact that liquid chromatography is used in a huge variety of applications, Waters Corp. is well poised to benefit significantly from this business in the near future.Zacks Rank & Key PicksWaters Corp. currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader sector include Nutanix Inc.

273,WAT,"Waters Corporation (WAT  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Oct 24.The company has a brilliant earnings beat streak, spanning 12 quarters of positive earnings surprises, which the company broke with in-line earnings in one of the quarters last year. Waters Corp.hasposted a positive earnings surprise of 2.3% in the last reported quarter. Overall, Waters Corp. has an average positive surprise of 4.1% for the trailing four quarters, having beaten estimates thrice.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Waters Corp. has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Waters Corp.has an Earnings ESP of +0.77%, as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.75 is pegged above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors to Drive Better-than-Expected ResultsWaters Corp.’s key strengths include a dominant position in the biopharma end markets and thriving sales in emerging markets. Global pharmaceuticals business, in particular, is the company’s largest single market and has been a major profit churner for the Waters Division over the past few quarters. We believe the company’s third-quarter financials will benefit from steady demand from the pharmaceutical business, growth in recurring revenues and modest recovery of industrial markets.Waters Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Waters Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Waters Corporation QuoteMoreover, the company’s Industrial business, which has gained momentum in the past few quarters due to increasing demand for improved food quality and safety testing, is likely to drive the quarter’s top line. In addition, demand for research intensive products, especially the company’s mass spectrometry solutions and liquid chromatography, has been on an uptrend lately and is likely to bolster the third-quarter sales.During the last reported quarter, Waters Corp.’s liquid chromatography benefited from the ACQUITY Arc System, while mass spectrometry sales grew on the back of QDa and Xevo family of Tandem Quadrupole. We believe robust market traction of the ACQUITY, CORTECS and Xevo line of products will supplement the top-line performance of the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Despite these positives, sluggishness in the company’s academic and government businesses are likely to restrict growth to some extent. Of late, unfavorable order timing and volatility associated with instrument-heavy business have played a spoilsport for the academic and government businesses. Also, weakness in the chemical industry on a global scale is likely to dampen sales performance for the to-be-reported quarter.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Terex Corporation (TEX  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +5.04% and a Zacks Rank #2, is expected to release quarterly numbers around Oct 30. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Scorpio Bulkers Inc.

Remarkable broad-based top-line expansion, along with spectacular growth in Asia, aided the earnings beat.Solid operational execution backed by the company’s efficient business model also lent strength to the results. Further, a decline in interest expenses aided quarterly profits.Inside the HeadlinesIn the reported quarter, Waters Corp.’s net sales grew 4% year over year to $558 million and also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $552.9 million.The upside in the top line came on the back of robust performance in the industrial end markets (up 7% on a constant currency basis) and the bio/pharmaceutical end market (up 4% on a constant currency basis). The momentum was further aided by growth of 5% (on a constant currency basis) in the government and academic markets.Also, impressive contribution from sale of key products across major geographies supplemented quarterly sales growth.

However, sales in the Americas continued to reflect weakness and declined 3% year over year.Total selling and administrative expenses in the quarter came in at $130.2 million, up from $129.6 million incurred in second-quarter 2016. Research and development outlay for the quarter was $32.9 million compared with $32.6 million incurred a year ago.Despite the rise in these expenses, operating income in the quarter climbed 1.4% year over year to $118.9 million.LiquidityWaters Corp.’s cash, cash equivalents and investments at the quarter end amounted to just over $3 billion, higher than the $2.81 billion recorded as on Dec 31, 2016.

307,WAT,"Waters Corporation (WAT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 23.Last quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74 by 1.7%. Overall, Waters Corp. outpaced estimates in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 4.5%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderWaters Corp.’s key strengths include leading positions in the pharmaceutical market, broad global customer base and an impressive lineup of products. Particularly, Global pharmaceuticals business, which is the company’s largest single market and has been a major profit churner for the Waters Division in the past few quarters. We believe stable demand from pharmaceutical business, modest recovery of industrial markets as well as growth in recurring revenues will benefit the fourth-quarter results.Moreover, the company remains bullish on its Industrial business backed by increasing regulation around food safety and quality, strict conditions for food testing, along with environmental and fine chemical applications. Additionally, an increased demand for research intensive products, especially the company’s mass spectrometry solutions, is a positive for its business and is likely to bolster the fourth-quarter sales.During the last reported quarter, the company benefited largely from both of its LC and LC/MS platforms. The company’s liquid chromatography benefited from the ACQUITY Arc System, while mass spectrometry grew impressively, driven by ACQUITY QDa and Xevo family of Tandem Quadrupole. We believe robust traction of ACQUITY and CORTECS line of products along with strength in end markets are likely to prove conductive to upcoming results.However, the fact remains that rising R&D expenses and high interest expenses remain a burden, consequently eroding profitability for the upcoming results. A significant portion of the company’s revenues is generated from non-U.S. markets. This makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates. We believe currency fluctuations to put pressure on top-line growth and margins for the quarter under review.Further, the company grapples with stiff competition from several international instrument manufacturers as well as other companies in both domestic and foreign markets. The company’s key technologies like HPLC, UPLC, MS, LC-MS, thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry product lines are part of a highly competitive industry and are subject to rapid changes in technology.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Waters Corp. this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Waters Corp. has an Earnings ESP of -0.32%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Waters Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Waters Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Waters Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of the ESP. However, the company’s ESP of -0.32% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.73 % and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.AMTEK, Inc. (AME  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.50% and a Zacks Rank #2.PerkinElmer, Inc.

In third-quarter 2017, Waters Corp. continued its impressive streak, as the company’s adjusted earnings of $1.77 per share trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74 by 1.7%.The bottom-line figure fared much better in year-over-year comparison, reflecting striking growth of 12.7% from the prior-year quarter tally of $1.57. Remarkable broad-based top-line expansion, along with spectacular growth in Europe, aided the earnings beat.Solid operational execution backed by the company’s efficient business model also lent strength to the results. Further, a decline in interest expenses aided quarterly profits.Inside the HeadlinesIn the reported quarter, Waters Corp.’s net sales grew 7% year over year to $566 million and also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $552.6 million.The upside in the top line came on the back of robust performance in the industrial end markets (up 6% year over year) and the bio/pharmaceutical end market (up 7% year over year). The momentum was further backed by 15% growth in the government and academic markets.Also, impressive contribution from sale of key products across major geographies supplemented quarterly sales growth. In addition, Water Corp.’s recurring revenues and instrument system sales climbed 8% and 6%, respectively, driving top-line growth.In terms of geographies, Waters Corp. witnessed strong sales in Asia and Europe, which posted 7% and 20% growth, respectively.

The company’s total liabilities at quarter end increased to about $2.53 billion from $2.36 billion as on Dec 31, 2016.Our TakeWaters Corp.’s leading position in the high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry markets is its key strength that has acted as a sturdy revenue driver for the past few quarters. The company’s bright pharmaceutical business started 2017 on a healthy note and looks set to continue its momentum, going ahead. It is also seeing encouraging trends in its industrial businesses. The governmental and academic markets have also turned its performance around and look poised to maintain the growth trend, in the coming quarters.Waters Corp.’s exposure in the pharma/biotech industry is primarily in regulated commercial lab environments, where demand is non-discretionary and not prone to cyclicality. This helps the company mitigate uncertain client spending stemming from macroeconomic volatility. Additionally, given the fact that liquid chromatography is used in a huge variety of applications, Waters Corp. is well poised to benefit significantly from this business in the near future.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderWaters Corp. currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the broader sector include MAM Software Group, Inc. (MAMS  -  Free Report), DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) and Mettler-Toledo International, Inc. (MTD  -  Free Report).

311,WAT,"Internet-based social expression and personal publishing service provider, Shutterfly, Inc. (SFLY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 numbers on Jul 25, after market closes.In the last reported quarter, the company’s loss was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, which led to a positive earnings surprise of 18.45%. In fact, the company surpassed estimates in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 13.12%.Shutterfly, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Shutterfly, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Shutterfly, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayShutterfly generally incurs loss in the first three quarters and makes profit in the final quarter of every year because of the seasonal nature of its business. For the second quarter of 2017, the company expects to incur loss per share in the range of 55-50 cents. Net revenue is projected to be in the range of $205-$212 million, representing a year-over-year decrease in the band of 0.5%-3.9%.Shutterfly’s improved offerings in the growing mobile e-Commerce segment, aggressive promotions and easy-to-use products are its strong points and should continue to boost results in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, continuous expansion of its range of products is a key element of the company’s strategy, which is likely to boost sales. In fact, its Shutterfly 3.0 initiative, under which the company aims to create a platform and device-agnostic memory management as well as personalized e-commerce solution, might further drive the quarter’s performance.As announced in the fourth quarter of 2016, Shutterfly has undertaken various structural changes. Also, in order to focus more on profitable and cost-effective brands, the company plans to retire many of its other brands.As part of the restructuring, the company is focusing on reducing its workforce by about 13%, thereby reducing costs considerably. The first three quarters of 2017 are thus expected to be a transitioning period for the company. Additionally, the company expects to incur restructuring charges over the first few months of the current year ranging from $15-$20 million, which could pressurize margins in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, by the end of first-quarter 2017, about $9 million of the expenses had already been incurred.Moreover, higher costs associated with strategic initiatives to increase its production capacity may also somewhat hamper the quarter’s profits, while unfavorable travel industry and consumer spending trends might limit revenue growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Shutterfly this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Shutterfly has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 56 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Shutterfly currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies in the same space to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Logitech International S.A.
