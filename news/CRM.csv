2,CRM,"A solid concentration in top-performing stocks, including Facebook (FB,) Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Bank of America (BAC), and a strong fund management team have helped Fidelity Advisor New Insights Fund (FNIAX) beat the S&P 500 and its large-growth Morningstar category in the past one, three and five years.X Those leading stocks, along with Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), account for nearly a fifth of the $30 billion fund's assets.Since its inception in 2003, New Insights has been managed by the legendary Will Danoff, who ran it identically to its widely followed $134 billion Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX). In 2013, John Roth, who also manages $8 billion Fidelity Mid-Cap Stock (FMCSX), joined as co-manager, bringing with him his midcap expertise. Since late 2015, Danoff and Roth have been splitting the management of the fund 60%-40%.The fund focuses on companies that have strong growth prospects, solid management teams and whose potential is misperceived by the public.""If we think Facebook can sustain 30% growth for longer than people think, or we see Mark Zuckerberg's genius ultimately being applied to Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, video ... we're not seeing anything that other people may not see, but we think the good news will last longer,"" Danoff told IBD.Having two managers may well be the reason why New Insights is more diversified at the top than Contrafund with top 5 holdings representing 17.3% vs. Contrafund's 24.1%. In addition, 26.7% and 37.9% of each fund's assets are in the top 10 holdings, further drawing the distinction.New Insight also holds nearly 10% more midcaps, is somewhat underweight technology and has a lower overweight in financials vs. the benchmark and its peers than Contrafund. Both sectors have been strong performers in the past several years.As a result, New Insight's performance has been trailing a bit that of Contrafund's, returning 22.91%, 11.89% and 14.35% the last one, three and five years vs. Contrafund's 27%, 13.45% and 15.92%. Both funds pulled back slightly in the recent, albeit short, market correction, but quickly recovered ground and are up 5.44% and 6.57%, respectively vs. the S&P 500's 2.41% year to date.Regarding concerns that we're late in the economic cycle, Danoff notes the differences between now and conditions that led to bear markets like 2008-09.""The starting point (after the crisis) was quite drastic,"" said Danoff. ""So even though we've had this long economic expansion, I don't feel like people are high-fiving themselves. Up until very recently, most companies were managing their costs conservatively and controlling their capital spending. ... The world is much more global, U.S. companies are able now to sell their products all over the world and the big companies in the S&P 500 are now much less capital intensive, so they're high margin, high growth and they're highly cash generative.""But it's not just the top hot stocks that determine a fund's longevity and strong performance. Other winning names include Adobe Systems (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), PayPal (PYPL), Visa (V), Estee Lauder (EL), Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and United Health (UNH), each of which soared between 40% and 87% last year, compared with the S&P 500's 21.8% return.Netflix, which the fund has owned since early 2015, has been benefiting from a strong international momentum for its brand and stronger-than-expected subscriber additions in the U.S. and overseas."" Netflix is crushing it overseas,"" said Danoff. ""They have some pricing power, the service is outstanding and it's a subscription model offering great value.""The top name for creative design programs, Adobe has successfully transitioned to a recurring revenue model by moving its product lineup to the cloud. Last month, the company said that its longtime CFO Mark Garrett will be retiring, though he'll stay on until they find a replacement. Adobe's earnings jumped at least 40% in each the past four quarters, while revenue increased 22% to 27%. The company also raised its fiscal Q1 and 2018 guidance after adjusting for President Trump's tax cuts. Adobe's stock is up 12.5% year to date.Cosmetics giant Estee Lauder has been experiencing strong growth. Its most recent Q2 results saw a 25% EPS rise on sales that grew 17%, primarily driven by strong advances in its skin care product lineup. Analysts expect the company to grow its market share from a current 15% as the company further builds out its e-commerce business. It also stands to benefit from the recent tax reforms. The stock is up 9.8% this year.Customer relationship software maker Salesforce.com (CRM), which rallied 49.3% last year and has risen 6.6% so far in 2018, stands to benefit from a growing product offering and low customer attrition despite strong competition in the sector. The company earnings accelerated in the past two quarters, jumping 63% in the most recent one. Sales grew 25%. Salesforce.com also raised its 2018 sales guidance to $12.5 billion and plans to reach $20 billion by fiscal 2022. Earnings guidance was also upped. It is due to release its next earnings report Feb. 28.In the midcap arena, the fund holds names such as Under Armour (UA), U.K.-based Metro Bank and LogMeIn (LOGM). The fund bought Under Armour last quarter as a starting position and Roth says they'll continue to work on it going forward.""It's a great brand, the stock got to be pretty expensive and expectations were pretty high, they struggled a bit and they got massively re-priced, the Street turned on them and investors turned on them, and then it became an interesting opportunity. ... The ultimate bet is that brand's still good.""RELATED:In A Volatile Market: Go To Cash Or Stay The Course?

9,CRM,"Big-cap techs Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), PayPal (PYPL), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Salesforce.com (CRM) are all well-known S&P 500 index components ended last week within 2% of buy points. But that doesn't mean they're all equally enticing. Nvidia broke out on Monday to a new high, but even that chip leader has some question markets.XApple outpaced the S&P 500 from May 2016 to May 2017, but since then has been moving with the market, lagging in the past couple of weeks. Nvidia, PayPal, Adobe Systems and Salesforce.com have a more recent history of S&P 500 outperformance than Apple. Unlike Apple, they significantly outperformed the market in the last week as they built the right side of bases.Nvidia, PayPal, Adobe and Salesforce are all the No. 1 stocks in their industry groups. Then again, so is Apple.Nvidia, PayPal and Adobe are all members of the IBD 50. PayPal, Adobe and Salesforce.com are also on the IBD Big Cap 20.Apple closed Friday at 175, less than 1% from its 176.34 flat-base entry. Apple's relative strength line, which tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been slumping for the past two months. Apple rallied 3.4% last week, but that wasn't much better than the S&P 500's 2.6% gain and even with the Nasdaq's 3.4% rise.Apple shares fell 0.4% to 174.35 on the stock market today, as the major averages rallied once again.The RS line is actually below where it was last May, when Apple was last significantly outperforming the S&P 500.Apple briefly broke out past the buy point on Dec. 18, but just barely and on volume that was only slightly above normal. The RS line wasn't close to confirming the breakout. Shares quickly fell back until finding support near their 50-day line.Apple could easily retake its buy point in the near future, and that move could work. But the odds of success are lower than with a truly leading stock.Nvidia jumped 3.1% to 222 Monday in strong volume, clearing a 218.77 cup-base entry.Nvidia's RS line is still lagging somewhat vs. its prior high. You'd like to see that RS line confirm the breakout.Keep in mind that Nvidia is a late-stage base. Late-stage bases are more likely to fail.Nvidia shot up 11.3% to 215.40 last week. It crossed its 50-day moving average in heavy trading on Wednesday, offering an entry point for aggressive investors.Chip stocks, which had struggled in late 2017, are roaring back. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index popped 5.8% last week, with several chip stocks moving back above their 50-day lines and carving the right side of bases. Chip stocks rose modestly overall Monday.Nvidia will have a presence at the CES 2018 tech show in Las Vegas this week. Nvidia on Sunday, in a pre-CES event, said it is teaming up with Uber on self-driving cars and expanded an artificial Volkswagen (VLKAY) partnership announced in mid-2017.Nvidia is already involved in several significant autonomous driving initiatives with various automakers and tech companies.IBD'S TAKE: Check out this Investor's Corner or on how the 50-day moving average or 10-week line offers buying opportunities.PayPal climbed 6.9% last week to 78.70, 1% below a 79.48 flat-base buy point. PayPal retook its 50-day line on Wednesday, but volume was only 11% above normal.PayPal rose 0.4% to 79.05.Leading stocks' performance is closely tied to their industry groups. And payment stocks are once again acting well. Square (SQ) moved back over its 50-day line Friday after a big retreat. Mastercard (MA) broke out past a buy point during the week, but on below-average volume.Adobe Systems advanced 5.8% last week to 185.34, less than 1% from a 186.37 flat-base entry. Adobe also reclaimed its 50-day line, but on below-average trade.Adobe dipped 0.2% to 185.04.Salesforce.com rose 5.7% to 108.10 last week. That's about 1% from a 109.29 entry in a flat base. Salesforce moved above its 50-day on Tuesday, but in average volume.Salesforce climbed 0.7% to 108.86, advancing to 109.14 intraday.One more observation on Nvidia, PayPal, Adobe and Salesforce. After running up so much last week, these stocks — and the overall market — are ripe for a pullback. That would not necessarily be a bad thing. Ideally, the stocks will ultimately break out in heavy volume, moving convincingly past the buy points to let their RS lines confirm the advance.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Alibaba Leads 5 Top Chinese Stocks Setting Up In BasesAdobe, PayPal Lead 5 Stocks Near Buy Points With Rising Earnings EstimatesStocks To Watch: Who Joins Apple, BofA On List Of New Buys By Top Funds?The Top 16 China Stocks Surge, In A Fast-Moving Start To 2018

15,CRM,"Google could be the fastest-growing cloud computing service provider but it's still playing catch-up to Amazon Web Services.On its fourth-quarter earnings call, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) disclosed that its Google Cloud Platform unit and G-Suite software productivity tools became a $1 billion per quarter business in the December period.X Trouble is, revenue at AWS, the cloud unit of Amazon.com (AMZN), jumped 45% to $5.11 billion. Amazon also reported fourth-quarter results on Feb. 1. Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure-branded cloud business has been ranked No. 2 in cloud computing behind Amazon's AWS, though Microsoft doesn't break out its revenue precisely.Diane Greene, chief executive of Google Cloud, told CNBC in an interview that analysts have been ""grossly underestimating"" the size of the business. Aside from keeping mum on the size of Google Cloud revenue, Alphabet has never broken out the financials of its YouTube streaming business either.Even after Google's disclosure that Google Cloud and G-Suite software is now on an annual $4 billion run rate, analysts are speculating about the exact split. RBC Capital estimates 90% of the $4 billion could be Google Cloud, while other analysts estimate only 50%. The G Suite software productivity tools — word processing, spreadsheet, calendar and other software — compete with Microsoft's Office 365.Morgan Stanley says that based on Google management comments, Google Cloud itself had $1 billion of revenue for the fourth quarter and about $2.9 billion in 2017.Even if Google Cloud is the fastest growing public cloud as Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai touted, the big picture is that Google is playing catch-up with AWS and is spending heavily, says Youssef Squali, analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.And, the cloud isn't the only area where Google lags Amazon, he says. Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that Amazon has sold 31 million of its voice-controlled Echo devices, while Alphabet has sold 14 million Google Home units.Alphabet, meanwhile, missed fourth-quarter earnings estimates.""Alphabet's higher-than-expected costs were one area of concern for us, which we believe highlights its ongoing efforts to catch up with the leader in Cloud (Amazon's AWS) and assisted devices (Amazon's Alexa),"" Squali said in a report to clients. ""Expenses included data centers, hardware, content costs associated with YouTube, and aggressive marketing of 'Made by Google' family of products. We believe this marks the beginning of an investment cycle into emerging revenue lines for the company, which could pressure margins for several years.""IBD'S TAKE: Finding the best stocks to buy can be tricky. That's why Investor's Business Daily makes it easy with educational tools, stock lists, research, Leaderboard and more.Cloud service providers provide access to number-crunching computers and data storage via the internet. They also sell applications and software that run on cloud infrastructure.Daniel Salmon, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, also was cautious on Google's outlook in a report.""This quarter reiterated our long-held focus on the reality of declining margins over time as businesses like cloud, hardware, and YouTube  drive Alphabet's '2nd wave of growth' (per CEO Pichai),"" said Salmon.

18,CRM,"Futures for the S&P 500 index were little changed Wednesday morning. On Tuesday, the first trading day of 2018, the major averages soared, with the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite both hitting record highs.X Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Broadcom (AVGO) and Salesforce.com (CRM) were among the many stocks retaking their 50-day moving averages.But Netflix's move created a new buying opportunity for aggressive investors, while Apple, Facebook, Broadcom and Salesforce.com did not. The reason? Volume.S&P 500 and Dow futures were essentially flat vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed a fraction.Netflix rose 4.75% on Tuesday to 201.07 in volume that was 91% above normal, blasting above its 50-day moving average. Aggressive investors also might have traced a downward sloping line from the Oct. 17 high as another entry with a similar share price.On the downside, Netflix's relative strength line, which tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been lagging since mid-October and hasn't made headway since late July. Even with the recent rebound, the RS line is below where it was when Netflix's stock price was last at these levels.Netflix also offers a 204.48 flat-base buy point as a traditional entry.Netflix is ""miles ahead"" of streaming rivals, Macquarie Research said, fueling Tuesday's big stock gain.IBD'S TAKE: Check out Investor's Corner to learn about how to invest, including this article offering more detail on how the 50-day moving average and 10-week line offer buying opportunities.Facebook rebounded from its 50-day as well, climbing 2.8% to 181.42. But unlike fellow FANG stock Netflix, Facebook's volume was just 7% above normal. If you're going to make an aggressive buy off the 50-day line, you want to see powerful trade. Adding to the caution: The stock's RS line has lagged for some time, and hasn't made a big rebound recently either.Facebook has a new flat base with a 184.35 entry. Ideally the RS line would lead or confirm any breakout into a buy zone.Apple nudged up 1.8% to 172.26, retaking its 50-day line on trade 10% below normal.Apple just broke out past a 176.34 buy point on Dec. 18, but the RS line did not confirm that move. Shares fell back the next day and drifted lower by year-end even as the major averages held up well.Broadcom, an Apple iPhone supplier, is one of just a few chip plays that are above the 50-day line, vaulting 3.9% to 267.01 on Tuesday. But volume was 20% below normal and the stock's RS line is closer to a short-term low than a new high. Broadcom recently formed a new flat base with a 285.78 entry.Salesforce.com climbed 2.1% to 104.41 on Tuesday, breaking a short downtrend as well as reclaiming its 50-day line.

28,CRM,"Even if you recruit the smartest people in the world to help you innovate within your organization, they won't have all the answers. Outsiders — from customers to suppliers to the general public — can offer fresh and valuable perspectives, a concept known as ""open innovation.""To harness open innovation, leaders look to enlist business partners, consumers, vendors and anyone else to provide input on designing new products or services.To apply open innovation principles:Replace internal politics with openness. If your employees vie for attention by hoarding ideas and hogging credit for team achievements, they probably won't welcome your efforts to solicit ideas from outside. In fact, they may quietly engage in sabotage.""At a high level, leaders at larger companies need to be ready to incentivize their people to external innovation,"" said Tim Bernstein, chief executive of Yet2, a consulting firm in Newton, Mass.Otherwise, employees may feel threatened by outsiders offering insights. Resentful staffers might think, ""I was hired to come up with great ideas. Now I'm ignored and we listen to just about anyone out there.""Bernstein encourages leaders to create a culture of openness to outside input. Dangle rewards for employees who champion innovations from outside sources rather than just promoting their own proprietary ideas.Minimize risks. Turning to the public for creative breakthroughs has a downside: It can lead to messy intellectual property disputes.Say outsiders share details of an innovation with a company that's already well underway in testing the same concept. Once the new product appears, those outsiders might conclude that the company stole their idea.""The solution is to have a single point of entry, like an online portal platform, for all submissions,"" Bernstein said. ""Make sure all your employees reject all other points of entry or redirect submissions to that single portal.""Prepare to collaborate. Outsiders won't necessarily present you with a polished, ready-for-market innovation. In many cases, you'll want to tweak the idea or treat it as a springboard for further exploration.""Open innovation doesn't come free,"" Bernstein said. ""Be ready to commit resources. You'll need your research-and-development people freed up to work with the [external] solution provider.""Stay close to customers. As inventive employees devise new designs, excitement can mount within your organization. But the real measure of innovation is how consumers will respond.""We'd rather build what other people think is cool, not what we think is cool,"" said Larry Portaro, director of FirstBuild, which seeks ideas for new appliances from outsiders. Based at the University of Louisville, FirstBuild connects with consumers through online outreach and even invites them to its Louisville, Ky., headquarters to develop prototypes at its micro-factory.Portaro adds that bringing in consumers to devise new products ""allows for collisions and interactions to happen"" that spur innovation.Let customers bond with each other. Because innovation often arises from group collaboration, it helps to give outsiders a forum for idea sharing. As they compare notes and combine forces, they might arrive at bolder, more ambitious breakthroughs.""We host an online 'success community' for customers to talk to one another, get help and share ideas,"" said Marie Rosecrans, a senior vice president at Salesforce (CRM) in San Francisco.Close the loop. Once you solicit input from outsiders, provide regular updates as you follow through. They'll gain more buy-in if they see that you're taking their ideas seriously and exploring ways to turn their suggestions into tangible products or services.""Identify what next steps will be taken and then close that loop when those steps are taken,"" Rosecrans said. ""Also document when you'll release"" the prototype and how you'll measure its impact or effectiveness.MORE SECRETS TO SUCCESS:7 Essential Ingredients For Fueling A Product Launch9 Steps To Take From Failure To Greater SuccessGood Lessons From Bad Bosses6 Strategies For Staging Goal-Driven Meetings5 Genius Ways To Sharpen Your Mental Acuity

30,CRM,"The $1.7 billion Columbia Large Cap Growth Fund III (NFEAX) is way ahead of the broad market as measured by the S&P 500 this year, and that's a nice change from last year. The rebound has a lot to do with the rally by growth stocks vs. value stocks in general, especially technology sector names like Alibaba Group (BABA) and Facebook (FB), says lead manager John Wilson.X Those two holdings are up 101% and 55%, respectively, this year. ""Technology this year is anchored by strong performances in internet stocks and semiconductor names and infrastructure (internet platform) software names,"" Wilson said.The shift has helped the fund. In 2016 the fund edged up 1.26% while the bogey advanced 11.96%. This year going into Wednesday the fund was up 27.58% vs. a 21.30% gain for the S&P 500 and a 26.97% gain by the fund's large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc.The fund appears poised to keep riding that wave. Its largest sector as of Oct. 31 was technology, with a 34% weighting. That was more than double its next biggest weighting, which was 15.37% in consumer cyclical stocks. Health care stocks were less than one percentage point behind.In tech stocks, Wilson and co-managers Peter Deininger and Tchintcia Barros are playing several themes. One is a switch by technology consumers. ""They are starting to re-architect the different applications they use and software platforms they use,"" Deininger said. ""That benefits some individual software companies like Salesforce.com (CRM) and ServiceNow (NOW).""Another theme involves the companies that create and supply the internet infrastructure — including the cloud — that firms like Salesforce and ServiceNow use to provide their services. ""Nvidia (NVDA) helps power some of the computer processing in next-generation data centers,"" Deininger said. ""It also helps drive business for more mundane suppliers, whether they are Micron Technology (MU), supplying underlying memory architecture, or Lam Research (LRCX), providing capital equipment that drives expansion that we see in the semiconductor industry overall.""Micron makes several types of computer chips, including dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) and flash memory (NAND), which are increasingly important in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and augmented- and virtual-reality applications on Apple (AAPL) iPhones and other high-end smartphones, Deininger says.Lam is a semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer. It benefits not only from robust demand for memory chips and a rotation away from old disk drives to solid-state flash-driven drives. It also benefits from the shift to multilayered computer chips and the increasing capital intensity of manufacturing with advanced technologies, Deininger says.After Alibaba's big share-price gain this year, the fund has moderately trimmed its share count in recent disclosures. ""These were modest position trims given the stock's strong performance this year,"" Wilson said. ""It had elevated to the point where we took a modest percentage off the table. It reflects the stock's strong price performance and the fact that its relative weighting had increased a lot, so we made trims to bring the relative risk-return down.""Wilson and his colleagues still like Alibaba because ""it's done a good job of monetizing their mobile user base,"" he said. ""There was some concern when they went public (about three years ago) that that would be a slow process. But they've done a good job of improving the relevance of their ecosystem to the Chinese consumer. And they've done an excellent job of tying in their retail network as a marketplace for them to sell a broad variety of goods and services.""He adds that Alibaba has done a good job of developing their infrastructure business like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud.The fund has made moderate trims to its share count in Facebook for similar reasons. The fund still likes the stock. ""Our view is that the company has a tremendously strong global franchise,"" he said. ""They're increasingly effective at monetizing, especially in their core Facebook platform. And they've done a tremendous job of ramping up their Instagram platform, which is smaller but growing quickly.""He added, ""There are six million advertisers in Facebook and only two million on Instagram. But it is fair to say Instagram will get to six million, so it has a lot of runway."" User growth will spur advertiser growth, which will fuel Instagram's pricing power, Wilson says.In addition, he expects the firm to monetize Messenger and WhatsApp. ""They have some additional opportunities that are interesting, but not totally clear,"" he said.As for Facebook's spending, Wilson is not worried. ""Clearly they are spending aggressively to address issues of newsfeed-quality issues,"" Wilson said. ""They're addressing those issues head-on and it is relatively well understood by the marketplace at this time.""Health care may be the fund's third-largest sector, but it is the fund's biggest overweight vs. the Russell 1000 Growth Index. The fund managers like some biotechnology stocks that offer ""new revenue streams driven by new products that are perhaps not well understood by the market,"" he said.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) is one. The company's lead drug, Soliris, has been used to treat blood disorders. The company now has approval to begin selling Soliris for treatment of myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune neuromuscular disease. But the stock, trading around 113, is 24% off its 51-week high of 149.34 set Sept. 5 and attempting a rally from its Dec. 7 low of 105.01.RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

33,CRM,"Advisors often gush about the march of technology. That's especially true when they discuss their customer relationship management software and artificial intelligence.XWhile admitting that they're still learning how to maximize CRM, they tend to rave about the ease with which they can stay close to clients. And the future holds even greater promise, as CRM software providers race to differentiate their offerings to stand out in a hotly competitive field.Reflecting on her 16 years as an advisor, Jessica Peck Donnerstein traces the evolution of CRM systems. She recalls using yellow legal pads and rudimentary CRM products in the early 2000s. In 2011, she began using a more robust platform from Redtail Technology.Can Tech Tools Help Millennials Avoid A Looking Retirement Crisis?Mulichannel Strategy Is needed To Reach Mobile-Toting ClientsPursuing Target Markets In New Ways""We have two offices, and CRM allows all our advisors to see client information and work on client cases together so that we can all be on the same page,"" said Donnerstein, a certified financial planner in Scottsdale, Ariz.Like many advisors, she looks forward to new features that accommodate clients' preferences. For example, she says that some clients communicate with her via text message but she has had to reply via email.""When they ask me to text them back, I've had to explain the compliance side of things,"" she said. But Redtail recently launched ""Speak"" as a compliance-approved tool for advisors to communicate with clients via text messages.Advisors foresee CRM software providing better customization and integration. With the proliferation of mobile apps and interfaces, integrating all of them seamlessly poses a challenge.Donnerstein seeks better integration between her CRM and phone system. Ideally, she'd like to have a record of incoming and outgoing voice mails.""Now I have to type a note on what I just did, like leaving a voice mail with a client,"" she said.With the surging popularity of virtual assistants such as Alexa and Siri, Donnerstein adds that voice-activated data entry could make CRM even more valuable. Using simple voice commands to enter a client note or update her calendar would save her from logging into the CRM system, finding the right file and typing a note, she says.IBD'S TAKE: Not all financial advisors are experienced stock pickers or feel they need to be, but those that are can be of added service to well-heeled clients who are active in the stock market. See how you can strengthen your investing skills at investors.com.In the coming years, more CRM platforms will allow users to map data graphically to a particular app, says Ryan Fickel, chief technology officer of Advisors Excel, a financial marketing organization in Topeka, Kan.""More and more CRMs will work hand-in-hand to create more user-friendly ways to map data from one platform to another,"" he said. ""If you're trying to pass data from one system to another, you need the ability to custom-tailor the connectivity between the systems.""For example, advisors who want to use DocuSign for electronic signatures or Calendly to schedule appointments will rely on a CRM system that more effectively integrates across applications.""This will allow advisors to treat their CRM as the core system of record,"" Fickel said. ""They will go from application fragmentation and data fragmentation to having all data and documents in one single system.""Strides in artificial intelligence, or AI, create opportunities for CRM to help advisors cultivate more consultative relationships with clients. Instead of just focusing on selling — and converting prospects into clients through lead generation and follow-up — future CRM platforms can facilitate deeper interactions that heighten client retention.""Rather than reinforce the traditional sales cycle, I'm hoping we see CRM break that cycle and branch out into multiple ways to integrate marketing automation tools and AI so that advisors better understand the depth of the relationships they are creating,"" said Tandi LeFranc, vice president of marketing at Shurwest, an independent distribution firm that supports advisors in Scottsdale, Ariz.The next wave of CRM systems will provide easier and better customization, LeFranc says, to facilitate stronger relationships between advisor and client. For instance, they will help advisors answer questions such as, ""How many people has a particular client introduced me to?"" and ""What is the client's level of engagement (in terms of reading our newsletter, attending our wine-tasting and other events, etc.)?""Despite this bright future, new developments in CRM can test advisors' patience. The ever-increasing encroachment of technology, even if it's easy to learn and fun to use, can prove a distraction.""You've got to find the right balance for you and your firm between working hands-on with CRM and other technology and focusing on clients,"" LeFranc said. ""Some advisors feel that it keeps them from talking to clients. So you need to make sure that your time using technology, like entering CRM data, is well spent.""RELATED:What Works Best Onboarding Clients In The Robo Age

34,CRM,"Can using Skype, a smartphone, CRM and the cloud for storing your office data help you extend your career even as you tour the world?For decades, older advisors happily retired upon reaching a certain age. Perhaps they sold their practice or groomed a younger partner, thus allowing them to bow out. Today, however, some aging advisors remain busier than ever. Rather than retire, they prefer to keep practicing well into their 70s and beyond.Fortunately, they can take advantage of technologies that make life easier for them and afford them the flexibility to work from home — or abroad. And as tech tools grow increasingly user-friendly, the learning curve shrinks and new converts reap the benefits.""It's a misconception that older advisors don't understand the latest technology or run their practices without it,"" said Dan Cuprill, a certified financial planner in Cincinnati, Ohio. ""The new norm requires you to be technologically savvy.""Yet advisors who spent their early years in the pre-digital age may not realize how mobile apps and cloud-based solutions can help. Even if they want to continue working well past 65, administrative and operational hassles of managing a practice can prove overwhelming.""You don't have to put in 60 hours a week if you have the right technology,"" Cuprill said.He created a system to build a profitable advisory practice in part by harnessing automation to generate referrals and handle administrative and marketing tasks. The system, Advisor Architect, affords him the freedom to manage his business remotely.Older advisors can differentiate themselves by sharing the wisdom they've gained from long careers in the business. Some clients gravitate to planners who can put roiling markets in the proper perspective and who articulate an investment philosophy built on decades of successful experience.""Getting older actually helps you,"" Cuprill said. ""You're viewed as learned, as a sage. But if you want to stay in the game in your 70s, you need an automated 24/7 marketing system.""He recommends that advisors post their educational content online — from e-books to white papers to newsletters — and use a customer relationship management (CRM) platform to produce an ongoing marketing campaign. With one click, prospects can read a compelling blog post — or watch an advisor's short video explanation of a financial strategy — and schedule an appointment.Advisors who stay active in their 70s invariably find that going paperless helps them operate from anywhere. As a result, they can enjoy leisure travel without abandoning their clients for months at a time.""I'm moving everything to the cloud so I'm not tied to an office,"" said Michael Fox, 74, an advisor in Cinnaminson, N.J.Fox, who continues to work over 60 hours a week, uses Laserfiche to digitize and store documents. By snapping photos of documents with his smartphone, he no longer needs a physical file cabinet.He tries to involve his clients' adult children in their family's financial planning. Using ShareFile, he invites the children to review what he discusses in meetings with their parents (after the clients give permission).""I make the agenda and minutes of our meetings available to the children because I want to be the guy in place when they realize they're going to inherit money,"" Fox said. ""I want to capture the next generation of clients.""Another tech tool that enables older advisors to remain productive is video chat software. It helps them communicate more effectively from afar so that they don't lose touch while on the road.""Without videoconferencing technology like FaceTime, I couldn't live the way I live,"" said Russ Hill, 71, chief executive of Halbert Hargrove, an advisory firm in Long Beach, Calif. ""I'm in Italy for two months a year and most people don't even know I'm gone.""Most mornings, Hill peruses a mix of blogs, financial journals and other online content such as Geopolitical Futures. He says his goal is to ""extract what's most relevant to our clients and our business,"" even when he's traveling.Hill, who serves on the advisory council for the Stanford Center on Longevity, tracks the latest research on aging and medical advances. He expects more seniors to maintain their health and live longer, more fulfilling lives.Two years ago, he provided stand-up desks for all employees at his firm after he read studies about the risks of prolonged sitting during the workday. He proudly notes that about 75% of his staffers now choose to stand for much of the day.""Taking steps to solve the aging challenge will upend how advisors talk to their clients in the next five years,"" Hill predicted. ""If you look at financial planning software, they all have an end date. What if you're wrong by 10 years?""RELATED:

40,CRM,"Snapchat is for teenagers, Facebook (FB) is for your mom and Twitter (TWTR) is for folks who like the din of a public square.X But email remains the dominant form of business communication, and recent IPO SendGrid (SEND) is riding a wave of Uber receipts, Yelp (YELP) notifications and eBay (EBAY) marketing emails to profitability.The cloud-based email-service provider, which sprouted in 2009 after participating in the TechStars accelerator program, mostly specializes in something known as email API. Its servers send over a billion emails a day on behalf of its 58,000 customers, a list that includes Uber, Yelp, eBay, Spotify, Airbnb and Glassdoor.After pricing at 16 a share, SendGrid jumped 16.5% to 18 in its Nov. 15 debut. The stock was up nearly 7% in early trades Monday, near 25.74.In this day and age, email seems like a straightforward form of messaging, but as it turns out, a lot of them disappear into the ether. The industry average for email deliverability is only 80%, wrote William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri in a recent report, meaning that one in five emails never makes it to its destination. You might not mind so much if an ad whizzes by you, but refreshing your inbox for the arrival of a much-needed password reset or shipment confirmation is another matter.By contrast, SendGrid's delivery rate is 94%, which Suri — who initiated coverage of the stock with an outperform rating – says is ""a result of its strong sender reputation and close relationships with inbox service providers — enabling the company to effectively navigate sophisticated email filters and avoid emails being sent to spam.""For SendGrid's customers, ""the delivery of their emails to the inbox is not a 'nice to have,' it's a business-critical communication from their company to the user,"" Chief Executive Sameer Dholakia told Investor's Business Daily. ""And the difference between it getting there nearly all the time and it only getting there most of the time is the difference between acceptable and unacceptable.""Transactional email API drives about 80% of SendGrid's revenue, with the rest stemming from email marketing campaigns and other services. While the company would not disclose its largest clients by revenue, Dholakia said that no single customer accounts for more than 2% of total revenue.""Our top 10 customers constituted 10% or less of our total revenue in any period, so it's a highly de-risked and un-concentrated customer base, which is terrific,"" he said. ""I know not all companies that look like us enjoy that, but thankfully for us, we're fairly broad-based.""The company earned an adjusted $576,000 in the first six months of 2017 vs. an adjusted loss of $2.365 million during the prior-year period. For the year, analysts expect SendGrid to report a profit of 3 cents a share, according to Zacks Investment Research. But Wall Street sees a 4-cent loss in 2018 before the company returns to the black with a 2-cent gain the following year. Revenue was expected to rise 25% to $100 million in 2017, swelling to $136 million in 2018 and $170 million in 2019.IBD'S TAKE: Since going public Nov. 15, Sendgrid shares have generally climbed from their IPO at 16. Shares settled Friday at 23.97, a record close and up 50% from its IPO. But Sendgrid is not the top-ranked stock in its group. That designation belongs to Autohome (ATHM).SendGrid is in ""heavy investment mode,"" according to Morgan Stanley. William Blair's Suri expects public-company costs and investment expenses to weigh on operating margins and profitability in the near term, but says SendGrid's self-service model means that it doesn't need a big salesforce, translating to lower sales and marketing expenses.""Over the longer term, we believe SendGrid should be able to exceed its operating margin target of 25% given the efficient dynamics of its business model, which include high SaaS gross margins and below-average sales-and-marketing expense,"" wrote Suri on Dec. 11.Analysts put SendGrid's share of the very fragmented email API market at 1%-2%, competing against the likes of SparkPost and Amazon's Simple Email Service (more on that later). On its smaller marketing campaign front, MailChimp, Constant Contact (owned by Endurance International (EIGI)), Oracle (ORCL) and Salesforce.com (CRM) are rivals.""We see a fragmented competitive landscape of private players, positioning SendGrid as the go-to platform, which should allow the company to sustain a 20%+ revenue (compound annual growth rate) over the next 15 years,"" wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Stan Zlotsky. He initiated coverage with an equal weight rating and 23 price target, as he sees most of SendGrid's growth potential and margin expansion already priced in.Dholakia, who has been at the helm since 2014, sounds bullish about SendGrid's growth prospects and position in the industry.""There are many smaller competitors that compete with SendGrid that I think will find it increasingly difficult to compete with SendGrid, just given economies of scale,"" he said, indicating that management is keeping an eye open for possible acquisitions.The company has made two small buys so far, acquiring Message Bus' customer base in 2015 and bringing email marketing startup Bizzy into the fold earlier in 2017, the latter of which was ""a great technology and talent deal, more so than about revenue or business,"" said Dholakia. Bizzy should help beef up SendGrid's marketing campaign business.SendGrid also has a partner — and a rival — in Amazon (AMZN). The companies over the summer expanded their technology alliance, with SendGrid saying it is ""aggressively expanding (its) footprint with Amazon Web Services (AWS)."" But its offerings also compete with Amazon Simple Email Service (SES), which debuted in 2011 as a ""bare bones"" add-on to AWS, wrote Morgan Stanley's Zlotsky.Amazon's seemingly endless appetite can prompt nervousness, even in companies that don't compete directly with the e-commerce and cloud-computing behemoth. (After all, prior to its acquisition of Whole Foods Market, who would've thought Amazon was so interested in the grocery space?)But even though SendGrid's per-email prices are three to four times more expensive than Amazon SES, neither its chief executive nor analysts seem too concerned about the idea of Amazon unhinging its jaw and feasting on the email API sector.""We had a very candid conversation about the 'co-opetition' nature of that relationship,"" said Dholakia of the e-commerce titan, adding that Amazon is ""very used to having this conversation where they partner very closely with companies that they may compete with on any given service.""And Morgan Stanley's Zlotsky said talks with customers revealed that SendGrid's higher email deliverability, analytics and customer support took priority over pricing. He also pointed out in his recent report that SendGrid is listed as the ""premier AWS email service"" in the AWS Marketplace.""They've been great,"" said Dholakia of Amazon. ""We integrated very closely — so it's not one of these Barney relationships, where you put out a press release and that's about as deep as the relationship goes.""Among various analyst concerns: growing competition, the sustainability of its self-service model and the ease with which customers could switch to a rival email API product.There's also the fact that SendGrid's business depends entirely on email. (Young people, Zlotsky notes, aren't so hot on email.)Nevertheless, he sees SendGrid as the ""leading provider"" in a $9 billion-and-growing total addressable market (TAM), ""which should provide the company with a long runway of sustainable growth,"" he wrote.Echoing that sentiment, William Blair's Suri told IBD that the company is ""very attractively valued"" and led by a ""solid management team, solid execution guys.""SendGrid's growth, he said, is ""underestimated by the market.""YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:New Cloud-Based Issue To Turn Profitable This Year, Forms IPO BaseTop Data-Analytics IPO Pulls Back To Critical Support LevelCould These 10 Growth Stocks In The IBD 50 Have A Banner 2018?IPO LeadersStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

45,CRM,"Telecom companies dashed the hopes of investors betting on a frenzy of mergers and acquisitions last year, but Broadcom's (AVGO) pursuit of Qualcomm (QCOM) and Walt Disney's (DIS) deal with 21st Century Fox (FOXA) have primed the pump for 2018 M&A in semiconductors and media.Wall Street analysts say 2018 is shaping up a bigger year for mergers and acquisitions, amid slower activity since the 2015 boom.One reason is the expected cut in corporate taxes, including lower levies on overseas cash brought into the U.S. For private equity firms and others that structure deals using high-yield debt the good news is that deductions on interest expenses are still allowed, though capped.Some companies may target deals that optimize corporate structure around new tax policies, says investment bank Goldman Sachs. Others may take the common M&A routes of gaining scale and cutting costs or expanding into new markets.""All the right ingredients are in place,"" said Marc Suidan, a partner and tech sector leader in PricewaterhouseCooper's M&A advisory practice. ""Tax clarity could bring some money onshore, facilitating some transactions. A lot of big tech companies have ample cash in any event. And, strategically companies are making big bets on emerging technologies.""PwC says tech companies will aim to acquire startups in artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and the Internet of Things, a system of web-connected devices.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Startups' easy access to venture capital funding, though, has made it hard for tech giants to gobble up hot private companies.Another reason for slower M&A in 2017 was public company valuations. Targeted companies were leery of all-stock acquisition proposals, analysts say, fearing a possible market correction.Goldman Sachs analysts are among those expecting a rebound in 2018 after M&A activity dipped in late 2016 and 2017. Republicans pushed through lower corporate tax rates, which may free up cash for deal making.""Reduced policy uncertainty should increase the fundamental incentive for corporate acquisitions,"" a Goldman Sachs report said.Companies that could be involved in M&A in 2018 include Twitter (TWTR), Twillio (TWLO), Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD), Hortonworks (HDP), Lumentum Holdings (LITE) and Acacia Communications (ACIA), the investment bank said.Of course, even if a sector looks ripe for consolidation, merger talks can fizzle out. Telecom investors bid up shares of T-Mobile US (TMUS), Sprint (S), Dish Network (DISH) and Charter Communications (CHTR) on takeover speculation in 2017 only to be disappointed.T-Mobile and Sprint shelved their merger talks in November. And cable TV firm Charter remains independent despite rumored suitors such as Verizon Communications (VZ), Japan's SoftBank, Altice US (ATUS) and Comcast (CMCSA).Here's a snapshot of sectors and companies to watch in 2018:Media. In the wake of Disney gobbling up much of 21st Century Fox, more media deals are expected. Discovery Communications (DISCA) and Scripps are already betrothed. Some analysts speculate that CBS (CBS) will be next to find a mate. RBC Capital sees a potential match in CBS and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF).The Trump administration has sued to block AT&T's (T) purchase of Time Warner (TWX), creating uncertainty over antitrust policy. A federal judge may not rule on the case until late spring 2018. While Comcast dropped out of the bidding for Fox assets, the cable TV firm is unlikely to stay on the sidelines.FANG (Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google) companies. Amazon, after acquiring Whole Foods to boost its retail distribution, could turn its attention to entertainment assets, some analysts speculate. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) acquired part of HTC's smartphone business in 2017 but the internet giant hasn't made a major acquisition since smart device maker Nest Labs in 2014.Google's cloud computing business might benefit from acquiring a large software company, but most analysts doubt that will happen. Google instead partnered with Salesforce.com (CRM) last year. Facebook, meanwhile, is likely to remain focused on small deals in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.Semiconductors. Broadcom's hostile bid for Qualcomm is shaping up as an epic battle. One wild card: whether Qualcomm can first close its purchase of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Elliott Advisors, an activist hedge fund, is pressuring Qualcomm to up its offer.Nvidia (NVDA), though cash-rich, has shied away from big deals.  Xilinx (XLNX), though, makes a good fit for Nvidia, KeyBanc Capital speculates.  Either Nvidia or Xilinx, meanwhile, could make an offer for Ambarella (AMBA), analysts say.Romit Shah, an analyst at Nomura Instinet, says a M&A wave among midcap stocks is possible in 2018. ""The sweet spot, in our opinion, is companies in the $1 billion to $15 billion market cap range,"" he said in a report. ""These companies include Dialog Semiconductor (DLG), Diodes (DIOD), Macom Technology (MTSI), Maxim Integrated (MXIM), MaxLinear (MXL), and Microsemi (MSCC).""Payments. Vantiv (VNTV) acquired U.K.-based Worldpay in July, marking the sector's biggest 2017 deal. There's speculation that PayPal Holdings (PYPL), with $6 billion in cash, could target Europe's Adyen. James Faucette, a Morgan Stanley analyst, says the pace of M&A picked up in the payments industry in 2017. ""We see no signs of the trend abating especially as tax reform could help efficient cash repatriation and make funds available for deployment (i.e. PayPal),"" he said in a report.Software. A tax holiday on overseas profits brought to the U.S. should give Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) more cash to make acquisitions. Other companies with ample cash on their balance sheets include VMware (VMW), Adobe Systems (ADBE),  ServiceNow (NOW), Red Hat (RHT) and security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW). For many buyers, the focus is expected to be on fast-growing software-as-a-service companies. The customers of SaaS vendors purchase renewable subscriptions, rather than one-time, perpetual software licenses.Cloud computing data centers. The sector has been busy with Digital Realty (DLR) buying DuPont Fabros and Equinix (EQIX) acquiring data centers from Verizon.  Equinix continued its buying spree in late December, purchasing Australia's Metronode. Europe-based InterXion Holding (INXN) could be targeted, says Oppenheimer.RELATED:Wall Street Analysts Identify Top Chip Takeover Targets For 2018These Stunning Stats Reveal Epic Netflix-Amazon-Hulu-Apple War To Come2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New Year

47,CRM,"The major indexes were narrowly mixed Wednesday afternoon, trading in a narrow price range that saw only a few sectors make significant moves.The Nasdaq composite held to a minimal gain, while the S&P 500 eased 0.1% and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3%. The Russell 2000 was up a fraction. All indexes held near new highs, and the Nasdaq inched up to another new high this morning before ceding some gains.Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) fell to its 50-day moving average, which coincides with a 137.18 buy point the stock cleared in October. The medical products company now seeks support at that key level. Verizon (VZ) rose 2%. The company stands to gain more power if the Federal Communications Commission rolls back net-neutrality rules, which the commission said Tuesday will be voted on Dec. 14.Volume was tracking below Tuesday's levels at the same time of day. That's not surprising on the eve of Thanksgiving, when many traders plan to take a four-day break. Winners led losers by a 9-7 ratio across the board.Health care stocks led, with hospital, home care and drug wholesale industry groups flashing gains of more than 2%. But those industry groups rank low, and are lacking in leading stocks. The energy sector also led, after the price of oil rose 88 cents to $57.71 a barrel, off from a session high just above $58.The weakest industry groups were spread among semiconductors, scientific equipment, automakers, RV makers, jewelry companies, plastics and other industries.Salesforce.com (CRM) fell 1.7% in heavy trading after the company beat profit and sales expectations for the October-ended quarter but gave a profit guidance for the current quarter that disappointed. The stock, however, remains in a strong uptrend since its breakout past 98.32 on Oct. 20.Despite the outlook, BMO Capital Markets, Royal Bank of Canada, Pivotal Research and SunTrust Banks raised their price targets on the stock. Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis also raised his price target, to 130 from 120.""With this quarterly print and guide ... we do not know how anyone can reasonably argue that Salesforce is not one of, if not the, highest-quality software companies on the planet,"" Davis wrote. He cited the company's major deal with the Department of Homeland Security during the quarter, and the launch of its Financial Services Cloud business for banking.Fastenal (FAST) cleared the 49.07 entry of a cup with handle. But volume was below average. Fastenal is in the building products industry group, which includes leaders such as Home Depot (HD) and Beacon Roofing Supply (BECN). A few other stocks in the group are forming bases.

48,CRM,"Increasingly, advisors are doing more than advising clients. They're educating the public.X Some planners seek to build their brand by sharing their investment philosophy or musings about the economy. Others want to empower investors to make smarter decisions or teach them about financial principles.Regardless of their motive, financial advisors seem intent on disseminating their thoughts in writing. From blogs to books, they're producing content like never before.If you're going to share your knowledge or opinions, what's the best vehicle to use? Posting short blogs from time to time on your firm's website is a low-cost, low-commitment endeavor. Writing a monthly or quarterly newsletter can strengthen your relationships with clients (and attract prospects), but it requires more time and effort. And completing a book can enhance your credibility and help you reach a wider audience.""What works best is pairing your writing channel with the appropriate demographic that you're trying to reach,"" said Douglas Boneparth, a certified financial planner in New York City. ""Reaching certain baby boomers through social media can be a bad idea, because they may prefer a newsletter. But for Generation X or Generation Y, more digital content can be effective.""Even if you deliver substantive content to your target audience, you need to convey your points clearly and succinctly. Pruning away extraneous detail — and presenting digestible nuggets of insight — raises the odds that readers will take notice.It's also important to balance what you find fascinating with what your readers deem interesting and relevant to their lives. You may enjoy speculating about the inner workings of the Federal Reserve, while investors might simply want to know how the Fed's moves can impact their investments.Savvy advisors don't just write stuff in a vacuum, hoping that people read it. Instead, they follow the numbers to determine whether their content hits the mark.When Boneparth adds written material to his firm's website, he measures the results. Using tools such as MailChimp for email marketing, he tracks the number of readers, when they open a particular blog post or newsletter article, and how long they spend on it.""If you don't measure it, it's harder to make adjustments,"" he said. ""The analytics can show you if you're reaching whom you want to reach.""Boneparth, 33, wants to connect with readers from age 18 to 36. So he writes with them in mind, knowing that they tend to ""digest information in two- to three-minute spurts."" He also cites movies and other cultural touchstones that resonate with them.Some advisors strive to reach a mass audience in the hope of positioning themselves as thought leaders. With limited time to devote to writing, they may figure that the more readers they attract, the better.For the past three years, Jon Ten Haagen has written an article every other week for Long-Islander News, his regional newspaper. He's a certified financial planner in Huntington, N.Y.He says each ""Ask The Expert"" article takes about two hours to research and write, and he invites readers to sign up for his e-newsletter. He plans to compile the articles for a book.""I used to post my articles on my website, but that was a waste,"" he said. ""I didn't get much of a response. Now that I'm in the newspaper, I reach a lot more people.""For many advisors, the starting point for writing is launching a blog. They may lack grounding as writers, so blogging gives them a chance to polish their craft, find their voice and identify what topics trigger the most interest.Blogging requires experimentation and patience. Advisors usually don't see instant results, as it takes time to build a following. Those who offer compelling facts, trenchant observations and eye-catching graphics tend to stand out.Lauren Zangardi Haynes, a certified financial planner in Midlothian, Va., started a blog in 2016. Initially, she sought to help friends who posed questions about their personal finances.It took many months for her readership to grow. But she now finds that the blog solidifies her standing among prospects.""It's a way they can check me out before calling me,"" she said. ""People want to hire a planner who's knowledgeable, but it can be hard to connect with someone on a typical website.""Having the blog has also opened doors for new writing outlets. She has started to submit articles to a local magazine aimed at families.""I'm not sure I would have gotten that opportunity without having my blog in place,"" she said.RELATED: Why Quit Your Job?

50,CRM,"In the wake of a solid month for the broad market and U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, some fund managers are tilting toward value-oriented stocks.X Having lagged growth stocks, value stock valuations are increasingly attractive, says Tom Galvin, lead manager of $4.1 billion Columbia Select Large Cap Growth (ELGAX). Yet their prospects are bright as the U.S. and key foreign economies continue to grow, Galvin added.In November, the broad market got a lift from such Dow Jones Industrial stocks as Boeing (BA), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Walt Disney (DIS) and Home Depot (HD).With the S&P 500 climbing 3.07% last month, the broad stock market made it 13 straight month of gains, according to Lipper Inc. U.S. diversified stock mutual funds rode along, advancing 2.62% on average, their 15th monthly gain in the past 16 months and third positive month in a row. That lifted their year-to-date gain to 17.40%.Both the S&P 500 and Dow hit all-time highs to that point on Nov. 30.List Of Mutual Fund Six Month LeadersBest Performing Mutual Fund CategoriesWhy Fidelity Gave This Mutual Fund Manager More Money To InvestWhich Stocks Are The Top Fund Managers Buying?Bond Fund Decline In November: Turning Of The Tide?The November gain by U.S. diversified stock funds was due largely to ongoing global economic growth, generally better-than-expected corporate profits, benign inflation and heightened prospects for U.S. tax reform with a lowering of the corporate tax rate, said Galvin, whose fund finished among the top 16% in large-cap growth fund performance last month.Wall Street's approval of reforms that lighten corporate regulatory burdens also boosted the stock market last month, said John Rogers, chairman, CEO and chief investment officer of Ariel Investments and lead manager of flagship $2.2 billion Ariel Fund (ARGFX).But market leadership is poised to shift to value-oriented categories of stocks and mutual funds in the coming months, away from growth-oriented ones, added Rogers, whose fund's 7.01% return last month topped 98% of its midcap value rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct.That tilt toward value already seemed underway in November. With a 3.27% gain on average, midcap value funds led all U.S. diversified stock fund categories. Small- to midsize companies tend to derive a larger portion of their revenue and earnings from the U.S., so they're likely to benefit more than large-cap companies from tax reform. ""There was a rotation into smaller stocks and value stocks as the prospect for successful passage of tax reform grew,"" Galvin said.That tax-reform tilt was also why U.S. diversified stock funds outpaced world stock funds, which averaged just a 1.03% gain last month. Japanese funds, averaging a 2.95% advance, led foreign stock funds.Industrials funds averaged a 3.10% gain in November, leading all major sector categories. They were driven by the rotation into value-oriented stocks.U.S. taxable bond funds were slightly above break even on average in November. U.S. Treasury funds led other categories, averaging a 0.08% gain. World income funds averaged a 0.54% gain. Muni bond funds lost ground overall last month.While GDP growth, corporate profits, tax reform and regulatory reform should benefit all corporations, longtime outperformance by growth stocks has left value stocks more attractively valued, Rogers said.The Russell 2500 Value index was trading at 18 times next year's earnings as of the first week of December. In contrast, the Russell 2500 Growth index was trading at a lofty 32 times. ""It's one of the biggest gaps I've seen in my career between value and growth,"" Rogers said. ""And there will be an inevitable reversion to the mean when things go too far.""In addition, the Federal Reserve's widely expected tax hikes should boost margins for banks, which generally are categorized as value stocks, Rogers said.Already, his firm's researchers are getting bullish input from industrial companies. ""A lot are describing recoveries and business momentum building,"" Rogers said.Further, Amazon's (AMZN) widespread competitive influence is helping to keep retail prices low, which is preventing inflationary pressure from growing, he said.In at least the near term, one area in which he expects to see many investment opportunities is among industrials, what he calls light cyclicals and manufacturers. In that group, he holds Kennametal (KMT). ""It's a favorite,"" he said. ""They make cutting tools and cutting blades that are used for everything from coal mines to rebuilding highways and infrastructure. They should be a prime beneficiary whenever we get an infrastructure (spending) bill through Congress.""Going forward, financial services should also outperform, ""especially money managers and private equity funds that are public,"" he said, adding, ""They're cheap because they're not in popular indexes.""Among those, he cites KKR (KKR). ""They are a large private equity firm run by Henry Kravis,"" he said. ""They're cheap and private equity is one of the best performing asset classes.""Rogers also owns Lazard (LAZ). ""They're an investment banking franchise,"" he said. ""They have money management and mutual fund subsidiaries that focus on emerging markets and international investing.""He also likes the beleaguered media space. Many investors are afraid that cable companies are suffering subscriber attrition, which creates downward pressure on fees to content providers. Rogers nevertheless like MSG Networks (MSGN). The New York City-area sports network broadcasts games for nine sports teams including the professional basketball Knicks. ""The fear has been overdone,"" Rogers said. ""Live sports, whether seen on smartphones, computers or TV, one way or another that content will be viewed and monetized.""Health care is his fourth-largest sector. He prefers systems and instruments maker Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO) and clinical testing services provider Laboratory Corp. of America (LH). ""We're not involved in the riskier, more complicated parts of health care,"" he said.Growth-oriented fund managers still see opportunities on their side of the market ledger.""In the consumer space, where we're overweighted, Costco (COST) continues to demonstrate very strong traffic gains and sales growth,"" Galvin said. ""Roughly one-third of their customers are small-to-medium size businesses, which could benefit from tax reform.""Galvin also likes apparel maker Nike (NKE) and coffee-shop chain Starbucks (SBUX). After lagging in 2017, both ""could be potential winners in 2018,"" Galvin said. ""Each has issues, but each could benefit from accelerating GDP growth, helped by fiscal stimulus, stronger consumer confidence fueled by lower consumer tax rates and better jobs growth.""In health care, the CVS Health (CVS) takeover of Aetna (AET) could signal that ""more consolidation is forthcoming,"" Galvin said. Also, a looser regulatory environment and tax reform that motivates companies to repatriate profits held outside the U.S. could increase the attractiveness of more health care companies.And new opportunities could emerge in the tech sector if tax reform and corporate profit escalation encourage more companies to spend on technology. ""For example, Salesforce.com (CRM): it was the fastest company to get to $10 billion in revenues, and it's likely to be the fastest to double revenues within five years as they continue to go broader and deeper in (finding customers among) Fortune 1000 companies at home and abroad,"" Galvin said. ""Salesforce is already by far the market leader in cloud dominance.""The firm's cloud software helps businesses organize and handle sales operations and customer relationships.And take $1.5 billion Champlain Small Company Fund (CIPSX) — an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner in the growth, small-cap and diversified equities categories. The growth-oriented fund owned Innospec (IOSP) as of July 31, a specialty chemicals firm that has a 92 Composite Rating from IBD and an A SMR Rating. Earnings per share rose 8%, 13% and 28% the past three quarters.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Composite Rating is scored on a scale of 1 to 99. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher. Innospec's SMR Rating means it's in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.RELATED:Looking For Winning Stocks?

""Now we have products like GoMeeting, GoToWebinar, OpenVoice and Grasshopper, which essentially bolstered our annual (communications and collaboration) sales by an order of magnitude.""JPMorgan's Auty says LogMeIn built a successful franchise in remote access, then added several related high-growth businesses around that core, such as web conferencing. Yet he sees room for even more. Auty noted that LogMeIn hit a targeted $100 million in cost synergies a year ahead of plan, and revenue synergies are already starting to kick in. For example, LogMeIn consolidated 50% of data centers and is successfully cross-selling LastPass subscriptions to GoTo customers.Beyond software applications, Auty sees a ""larger opportunity"" in providing a cloud platform for companies tied to the Internet of Things.A LogMeIn spokesperson told IBD that the company's fledgling IoT efforts are centered on customer engagement and support. That could pit it directly against Salesforce's Service Cloud as well as Oracle and Zendesk.It's all showing up in the quarterly results. During the third quarter, LogMeIn logged triple-digit earnings and revenue gains, while cash flow from operations surged to $90.5 million, a hefty 33% of revenue. The company also raised guidance for profits and free-cash-flow margins for 2017 as a whole.Shares briefly shot to an all-time high of 129.52 but now sit 7% below that peak, undercutting a 121.35 entry they cleared in October. Still, they are up about 24% year to date, while the S&P 500 has risen 16% over the same period.Auty rates LogMeIn stock as overweight and upped his price target from 140 to 145.In February, CEO Wagner hinted at ""big ambitions"" while alluding to a next generation of cloud technologies.IBD'S TAKE: Software stocks and cloud players have a strong presence in the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks, where you can find new ideas for your investing watchlist.Just a handful of months later, the company acquired the Israeli firm Nanorep. An artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning expert, Nanorep already makes chatbots and virtual agents ""more human"" for hundreds of companies across the world, including Intuit (INTU), FedEx (FDX) and Vodafone (VOD), according to LogMeIn.The acquisition accelerates LogMeIn's efforts in the rapidly growing market for digital customer service — one that it expects to balloon from 3% of all customer service interactions in 2017 to 30% by 2022.Wagner told IBD that the $45 million Nanorep deal builds on his company's history of disruptive innovation.""We were an early innovator in the 'freemium' business model, a structure we relied upon for our organic growth in the early days of the company and one that has been copied by many other successful technology companies,"" Wagner said.That model, of converting free users to paid or premium subscribers, was successfully deployed by Join.me. It offered single-click, frictionless sharing of screens, showing up older rivals like Cisco's WebEx and Citrix's GoToMeeting. GoToMeeting is now part of LogMeIn's portfolio.Launched in October 2010, Join.me was recognized as the fastest-growing web-conferencing product less than five years later.LogMeIn is now looking to harness Nanorep's AI expertise across its entire, newly expanded suite of product offerings. With GoTo under its belt, the company says it supports 25 million users and 900 million conferencing minutes every month, as well as roughly 200 million customer engagements and 5 billion voice minutes every year.But as LogMeIn targets new markets, challenges await. Patent litigation could resurface and roil the stock, experts caution. Plus, upstarts like Splashtop and TeamViewer are moving into remote access, support and monitoring.Competition in this increasingly crowded space is expected to drive down prices, with only the strongest players likely to survive.Still, analyst expectations for future growth have marched up, notwithstanding LogMeIn's formidable annual 45% earnings growth rate and 46% sales growth rate over the past three years.Consensus estimates call for annual earnings of $3.28 per share in 2017, up from $2.03 in 2016 and from $1.66 in 2015. Earnings are seen climbing to $4.10 a share in 2018, according to Zacks Investment Research.Revenue is forecast at $1.02 billion in 2017, ballooning from $336 million in 2016 and from $272 million in 2015. It is seen rising to $1.17 billion in 2018.LogMeIn's free cash flow, a key valuation metric, has especially impressed industry analysts. Its free-cash-flow margin is now expected to be 30% for the year and to expand to more than 33% in 2019, said Matthew Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets.Investors and analysts await the strategic road map that Wagner is set to discuss at an event on Dec. 19.""We think the event could be a catalyst as management updates longer-term targets,"" Hedberg wrote on Oct. 26, calling LogMeIn a ""favorite idea"" for the rest of this year. He rates LogMeIn stock an outperform and hiked his price target from 140 to 143.RELATED:Could This IBD 50 Software Stock Be The Next Cloud-Transition Star After Adobe?Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

59,CRM,"Shares in technology companies fell sharply Wednesday with so-called FANG stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) — among the hardest hit as investors rotated into banks and value-stocks, one market strategist said.The Nasdaq dropped 1.4% to close at 6,824.39. The Dow rose 0.4% to 23,940.68. Telecom and financial stocks rallied amid the tech sell-off.Among the FANGs, Facebook lost 4% to 175.13 on the stock market today, and Amazon was off 2.7% to finish at 1,161.27. Netflix plunged 5.5% to 188.15. Alphabet retreated by 2.4% to 1037.38.The last rotation out of big-cap internet stocks occurred after President Trump's surprise election in 2016. But FANG stocks and other techs bounced back in 2017, accounting for most of the Nasdaq's gains.Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, says the breakout by banks is significant.""One day does not make a trend but we are seeing signs of a rotation,"" Belski said. ""Does (the tech sell-off) mean that value investing strategies are beginning to become more prevalent — banks and financials being the biggest part of the value index — I think the answer to that is yes.""""The money has to come from somewhere. So it doesn't surprise us that the FANG/technology companies are across-the-board being used to fund this move into banks. Does that mean the tech boom is over? Absolutely not. It just seems natural, healthy that a reallocation of portfolio money is occurring.""Wednesday's sell-off in tech came even as Republicans moved closer to passing tax-reform legislation. One expectation is that companies such as Apple and Alphabet will get a boost on lower taxes for cash brought back into the U.S. from overseas. A sell-off in Chinese tech stocks, meanwhile, has gained momentum amid investor worries that its communist government is backtracking on some economic policies. Alibaba Group (BABA) tumbled 5.9% to 175.60, Baidu (BIDU) dropped 3.5% to finish at 235.49, and Tencent (TCEHY) gave back 4% to 52.Among U.S. tech stocks, Apple (AAPL) dropped 2.1% to 169.48, Tesla (TSLA) fell 3.2% to 307.54, and Nvidia (NVDA) plunged 6.8% to finish at 196.42.Chip companies and makers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment also sold off.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Ichor Holdings (ICHR) fell 7.7% to 28.01, while Applied Materials (AMAT) also fell 7.7%, going to 52.91. Lam Research (LRCX) dropped 7.6% to 197.06. Broadcom (AVGO) slipped 2.1% to 271.50.But shares in telecom stocks AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) rose. AT&T gained 3% to close at 36.48. Verizon was up 2.27% to 49.90. The dividend-paying telecom stocks are viewed as a safe haven.Bank and financial stocks also rallied.Among stocks in the IBD 50, PayPal Holdings (PYPL) fell 5.8% to finish at 73.25, Arista Networks (ANET) shed 3.8% to 234.21, and Atlassian (TEAM) lost 9% to 46.59. PayPal peer Square (SQ) fell 8% to 39.13.Enterprise software stocks also took a hit.

60,CRM,"Where would financial advisors be without their gadgets — their smartphones, laptops, social media, CRM and even robo, or automation, tools?Advisors in their 50s and 60s may not feel old, except when they consider how much technology has changed the way they do their job.XJust two decades ago, for example, they spent significant time on paperwork — rifling through real paper documents. File cabinets lined their office. They largely kept in touch with clients — and everyone else — with a telephone.To younger financial advisors who came of age playing online games and relying on social media, it seems quaint to imagine their elders trying to operate efficiently in a pre-internet world with limited software choices and automation tools. The new reality creates more opportunity, but it requires tech savvy as well.Can Tech Tools Help Millennials Avoid A Looking Retirement Crisis?Strides In CRM, Artifical Intelligence Software Hold Promise For AdvisorsPursuing Target Markets In New WaysGary Anetsberger has enjoyed a front-row seat to these momentous changes.Anetsberger, 62, is chief executive of Millennium Trust Co., which provides specialized custody and retirement solutions. He joined the firm in 2002 as chief operating officer and has run its client service, operations, information technology and administration teams. The company has over $23 billion in assets under custody and nearly 600,000 custodial accounts.In this interview with IBD, Anetsberger, a certified public accountant, assessed the fast-moving technological landscape and how it affects financial advisors.IBD: What's the biggest technological challenge that advisors will face in the coming years?Anetsberger: I think digital experiences will accelerate over the next three to five years, impacting advisors in many ways along with their clients. From automatic account opening to tracking client holdings, there will be more client transparency in their accounts. Any transactions that impact their portfolios will be part of that digital experience.IBD: So how will all that digital activity change the advisor's role?Anetsberger: Advisors will be able to communicate digitally with clients in a more timely manner. With my account, I get email on any transactions and any important news and events via a digital portal. I think advisors will increasingly provide content digitally and then follow up with a call as needed.IBD: What's the best way for advisors to capitalize on all this digital communication?Anetsberger: Your mobile strategy has got to be at the top of your priority list. You need to have a multichannel strategy. Over the next 30 years, there will be a transfer of wealth from baby boomers to millennials. These younger investors grew up with mobile devices, and they'll expect their advisors to have everything geared for mobile.IBD: What other tech trends do you see as important to advisors?Anetsberger: More and more practice management software has the ability to aggregate other accounts. It brings in data from investment, banking and credit card accounts, giving the advisor a more holistic view of the client's overall situation. More aggregation tools will help with transparency in clients' accounts.IBD: What about customer relationship management (CRM)? How will it evolve?Anetsberger: CRM software tools help advisors, and you're starting to see (CRM providers) enable advisors to manage not just existing clients but also other groups such as family members of clients, attorneys, bankers, CPAs. The advisor will use CRM not just to manage the client relationship but also to help (coordinate) communication with others in their wider network.IBD: Speaking of relationships, how will the growth of robo-advisors affect the relationship between human advisors and their clients?Anetsberger: Automated platforms that help advisors construct a portfolio can streamline the investment management process. Human advisors can add value by having deeper conversations with clients about their retirement goals and objectives, and discussing the financial impact of life-changing events. Using robo platforms, advisors can free up their time to have the kind of client conversations that only a human advisor can provide.IBD: So you don't see robo offerings as a threat to human advisors?Anetsberger: Human advisors can add value beyond just doing allocation across asset classes. They can spend more time on higher-value relationships with their existing clients and then use a robo platform when the client says, ""I'd like you to help my kids too."" This is a good way to help them strengthen their relationships with clients' adult children.IBD: Any suggestions on how advisors can maximize the quality of their digital outreach to prospects and clients?Anetsberger: Be content-driven and make the content stand out. I get a lot of digital communication from financial firms that I work with. It's very valuable to me personally.IBD: Can you give an example?Anetsberger: I'll get email with their views on tax reform or the markets. I like to get a quick snapshot or summary, with highlights featured in an easy-to-digest way. Sometimes, less is more. More of these vehicles incorporate video. Lots of people prefer video (to reading an email).IBD: Looking ahead, how can advisors ensure that they're delivering compelling digital content?Anetsberger: With more people using mobile devices, a multichannel approach works best to communicate with clients. The real estate on an iPhone is smaller so you have to design content with bullets and videos to get your message out, along with links to deeper content.IBD: What about the phone? Some advisors still prefer making calls.Anetsberger: It depends on the person you're trying to reach. If I call my adult children, they don't answer. But if I text them, I get an immediate reply. Text messages and social media need to be part of your multichannel strategy.IBD: Do you see any downside as advisors apply all these tech tools?Anetsberger: Technology will increasingly help advisors be more efficient, but you can't lose touch with the human element. You're seeing more robo-advisors offering different levels of service so that you can talk to a human advisor if you'd like. Millennials will still want to talk to somebody about some financial issues. Establishing that trust and confidence in one-on-one relationships with clients will not go away.RELATED:Advisors Go Holistic By Expanding Their Skill Sets

65,CRM,"Regardless of their age, background or investment philosophy, advisors agree on one thing: Technology is changing the way they do business.XAsk them about their client communication, back-office operations and workflow, and almost every advisor will start by marveling, ""There have been so many advances in recent years,"" as one planner recently put it. Tech tools enable them to allocate their time better so that they can concentrate on listening to clients and helping them address current financial challenges as well as plan for the future.One of the biggest challenges that individuals face, especially those under age 40, is saving for retirement. The trends are troubling.Mulichannel Strategy Is needed To Reach Mobile-Toting ClientsStrides In CRM, Artifical Intelligence Software Hold Promise For AdvisorsPursuing Target Markets In New WaysFor starters, parents of young children may focus on paying bills — and stashing away funds to cover their kids' education — rather than contributing to their retirement account. That's especially true if talented youngsters pursue a passion: Parents often fork over hefty sums for their gifted kids to participate in elite sports or music lessons, while neglecting their own financial goals.Even childless couples struggle to save for retirement. Millennials — born in the 1980s and 1990s — often embrace entrepreneurial ventures. But self-employed go-getters tend to overlook retirement savings, only to find that they've missed out on a few extra decades of compounding on what could've been an initial, modest investment.IBD's TAKE: One way to help clients save for retirement is by including highly rated stocks their portfolios. Such stocks often lead the stock market and produce big gains. Learn how to invest in them at IBD University.Because they often lack predictable income or a traditional employer, entrepreneurs may not participate in company-sponsored retirement vehicles that encourage regular contributions. Startup culture and prudent retirement planning rarely go hand-in-hand.Advisors harness technology to drill home the importance of saving for retirement. They wow clients with fancy graphics showing the power of compound interest or run a Monte Carlo simulation that projects the statistical likelihood of various investment outcomes far into the future.Yet such technology has its limits.""In my 15 years in the industry, I've seen technology play a much larger role in retirement planning,"" said Robert Finley, a Chicago-based certified financial planner. ""But just because advisors have all this information that tech has given us, do we — and our clients — know what to do with all of it?""For those who woefully underfund their retirement accounts — or bypass them entirely — mobile apps that encourage ""micro-saving"" are gaining steam. Examples include Acorns, Stash and Digit.""It's hard to realize what saving $50 or $100 a month would be worth in 20 years,"" Finley said. But some digital tools can estimate the rising value of small chunks of savings over time, reinforcing the wisdom of setting aside even modest amounts every month.Millennials with little or no retirement savings may figure that with minimal cash on hand, they can wait to engage in long-range financial planning. If they feel they aren't ready to save for their golden years, they may assume they cannot afford to hire an advisor.In fact, this young population might benefit from a financial expert's input. Early in their careers, they may need to pay off student loans before they can shift their focus on saving for retirement — and an advisor can help them stick to a budget and pay down debt.""You can find a fee-only advisor who can do a financial plan for a set amount,"" Finley said. ""That can set you on a really good path.""Awareness of spending and saving patterns largely determines whether someone will stick with their financial plan. When individuals feel a sense of control over their money, they're more apt to stay on track to meet retirement goals.Advisors who crunch the numbers and establish clear milestones for accumulating wealth in retirement can make the process more real — and less theoretical — to clients just starting to build a nest egg. But the process really kicks into high gear when clients get more involved.Clients who are thinking of paying $10,000 for a vacation might call their advisor and ask, ""What happens if I spend that money on a big trip? Will it throw off my retirement plan?""New tech platforms can enable clients to tweak the numbers on their own and gauge to what extent a lavish spending spree would affect their long-term savings, says Elijah Kovar, an advisor in Minneapolis, Minn. He says that tech-savvy millennials ""crave this kind of tool"" to self-manage their plan.""Some young people give up if they have no idea where the finish line is,"" Kovar added. ""Technology is getting simpler every year and making retirement planning more accessible with a finish line so that people can see a plan in front of them all the time on their smartphone, not just when they meet with their advisor.""Looking to the near future, Kovar expects more mobile apps to provide ongoing progress reports on a client's retirement savings plan. Online features that track spending, pay bills and prod savers to adopt disciplined habits will become increasingly indispensable, he predicts.""Imagine your client's retirement plan on an app that says they have a 90% probability of success based on numbers that are clearly and simply explained,"" Kovar said. ""You'll have a client who trusts those numbers and understands how the software calculates those numbers. That kind of technology is right around the corner.""RELATED: Here Is How Wealthy Women Get Smarter Pitches From Financial Advisors

66,CRM,"A rising generation of advisors grew up with cutting-edge technology. Now they're using it to reach their target market.XAcross America, young, diverse advisors seek to win over communities that have rarely sought out financial planners. To market themselves, these advisors are harnessing social media and other technologies in new ways.By definition, niche marketing involves narrowly focused outreach. Social media enables advisors to reach a small subset of the general population that they're ideally suited to serve.Can Tech Tools Help Millennials Avoid A Looking Retirement Crisis?Mulichannel Strategy Is needed To Reach Mobile-Toting ClientsStrides In CRM, Artifical Intelligence Software Hold Promise For AdvisorsPursuing Target Markets In New WaysBrian Thompson, a certified financial planner in Chicago, launched his firm in 2016 with an emphasis on advising gay professionals. He has sought to build visibility by designing a website geared to his audience.""The website screams that this is the right place if you're looking for an advisor who looks like you and reflects what you're looking for,"" Thompson said. ""I use very deliberate language to signal safety to the people I'm targeting.""To capitalize on content marketing, Thompson writes a blog and aims to add video and audio elements to his website. His goal is to make it easy for LGBTQ consumers to discover his firm online.""People are very specific in what they're searching for (on the internet),"" he said. ""So I have to keep current on trends in social media and search engine optimization rather than get complacent.""Advisors are learning that they can use online content not just to showcase their expertise, but also to engage prospects and learn from them. By inviting comments on their blog posts, educational videos and podcasts, advisors can gain a better understanding of their followers and hone in on their needs.Advisors who market themselves to underserved communities often expand their social media horizons. They may experiment with different tools and test the results.Jiyao Xu, a Los Angeles-based certified financial planner, seeks to attract young Chinese professionals in the U.S. He recently created a profile of his newly opened firm using WeChat, and he shares it with his friends and online followers.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.While he's still assessing WeChat's effectiveness in helping him gain clients, Xu is harnessing technology in other facets of his business. He uses MailChimp for his newsletter and Squarespace to design his firm's website.""It's very hard to reach the people that I want to reach,"" Xu said. ""I'd love more tools to help me reach Chinese professionals living in the U.S. of a certain age and income. So I'm doing lots of pro bono stuff like public education events"" instead of relying solely on social media marketing.To reach their target market, advisors like Xu combine high-tech and high-touch outreach strategies. In October, Xu volunteered to educate consumers at a ""Financial Planning Day"" event in Los Angeles.Similarly, Mark Boujikian regularly conducts educational sessions at local libraries that are free and open to the public. A certified financial planner in Rolling Hills Estates, Calif., Boujikian wants to raise consumers' financial literacy — and build his business in the process.While Boujikian resides in a seemingly affluent area, he says that many locals are ""property rich but have minimal retirement assets and low cash flow."" He seeks to educate them about financial matters and win some of them as clients.""They may need an advisor but either don't have the means to hire one or they're insulated by a language barrier,"" he said.In 2017, he has led 18 sessions in nearby libraries. They consist of a 45-minute PowerPoint presentation followed by Q&A. The talks attract 35 to 40 attendees on average, he says, and he offers a free follow-up consultation.""About 90% accept my offer so that can mean 30 or more meetings with each one lasting 90 minutes,"" Boujikian said. ""It's a lot of time, but I typically get two to three clients out of it.""In tracing social media's evolution, Boujikian sees more opportunity to connect with people to educate rather than sell to them. He expects online resources to feature what he calls ""more financial hacks — tips and tools to bring people together to learn and improve their financial literacy.""Like many advisors eager to teach and inform, Boujikian is passionate about spreading financial wisdom to a wider audience. That's especially important when certain segments of the population resist or express skepticism.Miguel Gomez, a certified financial planner in El Paso, Texas, faces what he calls ""an uphill battle"" in convincing some members of the Hispanic community to hire an advisor. He says that many of them lack trust in financial institutions and stash cash at home.""Technology has given me a voice to educate, to tell people it's OK to invest,"" Gomez said. His uses Facebook to post information and both Zoom and GoToMeeting to conduct remote conferences.RELATED:Advisors Gain Edge As Anti-Fraud Advocates

69,CRM,"After years of strong revenue growth and hefty losses, Workday (WDAY) has reached a major milestone. The cloud-based enterprise software firm unexpectedly reported its second straight quarter of positive earnings in its fiscal fourth quarter. Wall Street now sees increasing profitability as the company grabs market share from giants Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP).X On June 1, analysts expect Workday to report that fiscal Q1 earnings surged 220% to 16 cents a share excluding various items. Revenue likely rose 35% to $467.33 million. After a 12-cent profit in fiscal 2017, the company's first year in the black, analysts project EPS to accelerate to 51 cents, 81 cents, and $1.32 over the next three years.Workday provides human capital management and payroll software and has recently expanded into financial applications. Its investment in new products and features and its ability to maintain a high customer-satisfaction rate bodes well, according to Credit Suisse analyst Michael Nemeroff.""Our subscription revenue estimates imply continued market-share gains in both the HCM and Financial applications markets due to WDAY's best-of-breed capabilities and competitive advantages in its large and growing total addressable market,"" Nemeroff said in an April report.
"
70,CRM,"Workday mostly targets larger companies, boasting FANG stocks Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) as two premier clients. But it also serves retail giants Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) as well as big biotech Amgen (AMGN).
"
71,CRM,"Workday finished January with 1,528 human capital management customers, including 136 Fortune 500 companies.
"
72,CRM,"Existing top-tier customers are contributing to Workday's growth as many are signing contracts for additional product offerings.""There are many cases in the first several years of (our human-resources product) where we won the HR deal, but they don't want to touch payroll and now our payroll attach rate is over 60%,"" CEO Aneel Bhusri said on Workday's fiscal Q4 conference call on Feb. 27.Bhusri noted on that call that Netflix is one of five Fortune 500 companies that has signed up for Workday's new financial performance management software.""We are really well-positioned to run the tables within that enterprise (client) when they do move their transactional platform as well,"" he said.Credit Suisse calls Workday the leading vendor in cloud HCM applications ""for upper midmarket and large enterprises.""
"
73,CRM,"Workday has reorganized to better accommodate companies of different sizes. The company has divided its North America business into two groups — large enterprise and medium enterprise — from the account executive level to the sales and services levels.IBD'S TAKE: Workday is a member of Leaderboard, a list of top growth stocks at or near buy points curated by our markets team. To find more fast-growing names with actionable trading opportunities, take a free trial.After hitting a nine-month low of 65.79 on Dec. 30, shares closed Friday at 99.99, near their best levels since their early-2014 all-time high. Workday shares cleared a cup-with-handle base with a 92.56 buy point in heavy volume on May 15. The stock is now extended from the 5% buy range, but if it pulls back in light volume — as some leaders do — it could provide investors with another chance to purchase shares.The Pleasanton, Calif.-based company has a strong IBD Composite Rating of 95 out of 99, yet it's still ranked seventh in the highly rated enterprise software industry group.Workday says that continued into the most recently reported quarter. ""The win rates against SAP and Oracle were as high as they have been in recent memory,"" CEO Bhusri said on the Q4 call.Despite expectations for strong revenue growth and margin expansion over the next few years, Credit Suisse and Benchmark both initiated coverage on Workday's stock in April with a neutral, or hold, rating.""We are wary of intense competition in its core target Human Capital Management (HCM) market, which continues to drive pricing pressure, unfavorable billings terms and lengthening sales cycle,"" Benchmark analyst Yun Kim said in an April 26 report. But Kim did highlight Workday's successful execution, citing ""strong product positioning and superior customer references.""Meanwhile, Nemeroff said there are not yet signs of ""accelerated momentum"" in large clients for Workday's financial management software, due to the risk and complexity of switching core financial applications to the cloud.But he notes that IDC projects the cloud-based financial applications software market will reach $9.5 billion in 2020, representing a compound annual growth rate of 12%.Workday could adjust its outlook on the next quarterly call, but last forecast fiscal 2018 revenue of $2.005 billion to $2.025 billion, or growth of 27% to 29%. That would make it the second pure-play software-as-a-service provider to top $2 billion in annual revenue, only after Salesforce (CRM).

He added that it's an amazing time to build relationships with clients, and of course his organization stands ready to offer services to assist in those endeavors.To help accomplish that, Morningstar is about to debut new data for fixed-income investors and the financial advisors who assist them. ""We are spending our time to make you, the advisor, look good and valuable,"" Kapoor said.Wales told his audience that he has launched Wikitribune, which he described as a hybrid effort using professional and citizen journalists.

76,CRM,"Nobody wins all the time. But $49.9 billion T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund (PRGFX) comes pretty close. With Joseph Fath in his fourth year as manager, the fund has outperformed 94% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. so far this year and over the past one and three years respectively.The fund was up 17.46% for 2017 going into Thursday, far outrunning the 7.94% gain for the S&P 500.Fath has done it without resorting to any trick plays. He's of course aware of how last November's election offers ongoing opportunities to companies that can benefit from rising interest rates, a lighter regulatory load and heightened spending on infrastructure, he wrote to shareholders in January.But his investment approach remains largely the same as in the past. ""We believe that disciplined fundamental analysis will enable us to identify high-quality companies with durable growth prospects that are poised to stand out from the broader market,"" he said. ""We continue to favor companies that have more control over their destiny, are positioned to benefit from powerful secular trends, and are using innovation to disrupt less efficient business models and create new ones.""You can see how that strategy is expressed in the fund's top holdings. Among top holdings as of April 30 was Alphabet (GOOGL), up 20% so far this year. Amazon (AMZN), which is an IBD Leaderboard stock, is up 27%. Apple (AAPL), another Leaderboard stock, is up 32%. Facebook (FB), which is on the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals, is up 31%. Mastercard (MA) is up 13%.Fath had placed 63% of his shareholders' money in just two sectors as of the end of last month. The fund's weighting in information-technology stocks was 39%. Its weighting in consumer discretionary was 24%.Some smaller holdings also illustrate Fath's appetite for innovators driven by secular trends. MGM Resorts (MGM) is holding tight after its recent 30.72 breakout from consolidation.It broke out April 27, the day it reported that first-quarter earnings per share jumped 138%. In the U.S., newcomers to MGM's portfolio, the Borgata and National Harbor casino resorts, kicked in to results. Gaming stocks got a boost from news that Macau's gaming revenue rose 18.1% in March, then gained 16.3% for April. MGM has one property in Macau and is slated to open a new resort in the Cotai section of Macau later this year.In addition, the firm has been taming its debt. Its debt-to-equity ratio is down to 209% as of Dec. 31 vs. 313% in 2014.IBD'S TAKE: MGM Resorts ranks No. 1 in IBD's Leisure-Gaming/Equipment industry group. See how its fundamental and technical data stack up against those of rivals at IBD's Stock Checkup.ServiceNow (NOW), trading around 97, is within a 5% buy zone that stretches above a cup pattern's 94.82 buy point.The company develops cloud-based IT software for workflow automation. EPS grew 53%, 26% and 167% the past three quarters.The stock has a 97 Composite Rating from IBD. The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.ServiceNow also has an SMR Rating of A from IBD. That means it is in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return on equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.Salesforce.Com (CRM) is another stock on the upswing. It broke out above a double-bottom base that had a buy point of 80.47. It's now extended past that buy point, trading around 87. Demand for cloud-based applications is driving growth of this company, which provides customer-relationship-management software and services.Sporting a 95 Comp Rating and an A SMR Rating, EPS rose 14% and 47% the past two quarters.A more recent buy for the mutual fund is MercadoLibre (MELI), which runs an online marketplace and provides an electronic payment service in Latin America. Although widely described as poised for growth the way Amazon was at an earlier stage of its life cycle, the stock is up 81% so far this year and is now extended.MercadoLibre is another IBD 50 member. Shares gapped up 16% on May 5 after the e-commerce giant reported Q1 EPS up 64% on 74% revenue growth. The firm's core marketplace performed well.

77,CRM,"Veeva Systems (VEEV) stock rushed to a record high Friday after the IBD 50 software firm reported what one analyst called ""another exceptional quarter"" and issued Street-topping guidance.On the stock market today, Veeva stock was up 8,2%, near 66.825, after rising as much as 10% in earlier trading. Shares have run up more than 50% for the year on an uptrend in software, Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis said in a report.""Software valuations are moving toward leptokurtic distributions, which is another way of saying that valuations have fat tails of winners and losers,"" he said. ""And in case you missed it, Veeva is decisively in the winner's bucket.""Veeva belongs to IBD's 18-company Computer Software-Medical industry group, which is up 28% since January. Veeva makes the software backbone for the biggest names in pharma including Eli Lilly (LLY), Novartis (NVS), Pfizer (PFE) and Amgen (AMGN).But now Veeva is looking to expand outside the life sciences market and has ""essentially greenfield opportunities in other regulated industries outside life sciences with QualityOne,"" a next-generation version of the Vault software that it uses to organize clinical trial data.IBD'S TAKE: Veeva is looking for growth outside of life sciences. Visit The New America for an exclusive chat with Chief Executive Peter Gassner on what that new initiative might look like.Still, Veeva added nearly 30 new customers to its Vault offering in the first quarter, and a top-50 pharma began standardizing on Veeva CRM (customer relationship management) software, Chief Executive Peter Gassner said on a late Thursday call with analysts.The number of customers with multiple Vault products — there are 14 — increased more than 70% year over year in the quarter. That included a top-20 pharma that added Vault RIM and Vault QualityDocs in a big deal, Gassner said.""This is exciting as it represents a top-20 pharma going all in with Vault,"" he said. ""This also bodes well for the newer Vault applications we're building.""Canaccord's Davis noted that he ""struggled to find anything particularly amiss"" in the quarter.""Instead, Veeva executes the far better strategy of identifying prospects that can become successful references that drive new customer wins and revenues in year two,"" he said.RELATED:IBD 50 Stock Veeva Surges On Consensus-Crushing Q1

79,CRM,"X Key stock indexes edged lower at lunchtime in New York on Friday following inflation data that showed U.S. consumer prices edge up in April, but not as much as economists had forecast.The CPI core index, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.1% for the month, below the 0.2% consensus growth forecast issued by Econoday. U.S. retail sales, meanwhile, lifted 0.4% in the same month, missing the view for a 0.6% gain; core sales growth of 0.3% also undercut the 0.5% consensus estimate.The Dow Jones industrial average is working on its fourth straight decline, but on Friday the 30-stock index was off less than 14 points. At 20,905, the Dow Jones industrial average continued to hold above its key 50-day moving average, which has flattened out some.The S&P 500, hit by some selling in oil drilling, superregional bank, retail and building-related issues, fell around 0.1%, but the Nasdaq composite, riding a continued rise in techs, edged 0.1% higher.Crude oil futures eased Friday to $47.57 a barrel, but the price of West Texas Intermediate looked set to rebound sharply for the week, up nearly 3% since last Friday.Meanwhile, investors continued to trim their holdings in government bonds, particularly on the long end, even as the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note slipped back to 2.33%. Earlier in the week, yields touched as high as 2.42%; in general they have traded in a range between 2.18% and 2.62% since mid-December of last year. Salesforce.com (CRM) continues to make slow and steady progress since breaking out of a long cup with handle at 84.50. The stock rose more than 1.2% to 88.86 in heavy turnover.The 5% chase zone for the enterprise software group leader extends up to 88.73.Notice on a daily chart that during a mild dip in April, the cloud-based business software giant, started by a former Oracle employee, never touched its 50-day moving average. That's a sign of robust institutional demand.Salesforce is set to report fiscal Q1 results for the quarter ended in April on May 18. Wall Street expects earnings to bump up just 8% to 26 cents a share; keep in mind that in the year-ago quarter, earnings vaulted 50%, an amazing figure for any enterprise software company of Salesforce's class.Revenue is seen rising 23% to $2.35 billion; in the past 10 quarters, the top line has grown 29%, 26%, 23%, 24%, 24%, 25%, 27%, 25%, 25% and 27% vs. year-ago levels, underlining the San Francisco-based company's steady and robust performance.Momo (MOMO) and Amazon.com (AMZN), meanwhile, also join Salesforce as No. 1 firms in their respective fields. While both stocks are extended from proper buy points, the astute growth investor never gives up patiently waiting for new opportunities to buy shares.Momo, up 5% to a new high of 40.34 in fast turnover, has gained more than 60% since blasting out of a good cup with handle at 23.96 in huge volume Feb. 8. These new opportunities may arise in the form of a normal pullback to the 10-week moving average, the formation of a solid new base, or a 3-weeks-tight follow-on pattern. Go to Investor's Corner, in the ""How To Invest"" section at Investors.com, to read more about these specific buy rules and chart patterns.Momo, headquartered in Beijing, is slated to report Q1 results before the market open on May 23.The Street expects revenue to rise 376% to $242.2 million, following gains of 113%, 93%, 222%, 319% and 524% in the prior five quarters. For the year, analysts on consensus see FY 2017 revenue up 106% to $1.14 billion, then climbing another 35% to $1.54 billion.Momo is a true leader in IBD's internet content group, even though its market cap of $7.8 billion is well below some of its mega-cap peers. But it's not market size that matters as much as the size of a company's growth. The 84 EPS Rating for Momo, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, is weighed down by the company's net losses from 2012 to 2014. But the expected progression today is immense, going from 15 cents a share in earnings in 2015 to 87 cents in 2016 to estimates of $1.40 and $1.94 in FY 2017 and FY 2018.As seen in Momo's weekly chart, the stock has been so strong in its advance since the early-February breakout that it's yet to even touch its 10-week moving average (painted in red on IBD and Marketsmith weekly charts). So, a steep drop that pierces the support level in unusually heavy volume may signal the start of a significant correction.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, certain retailers continued to get slammed, led by Macy's (M) and the department store chain group, down 4.3% on Friday and down more than 25% since Jan. 1. In contrast, the S&P 500 is up.Macy's, which on Thursday reported bigger than expected drops in earnings and sales in the April-ended first quarter, sank an additional 2% Friday on top of Thursday's 17% plunge. The former market leader during the 2012 to 2015 market uptrend is now 68% below its all-time peak of 73.61. On March 3, Macy's triggered a short-sale entry by diving below its 50-day moving average amid a long-term downtrend. It joined Leaderboard as a short sales idea March 6.Even some of the very best names in the retail space are taking a break.Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) fell nearly 3% to 38.80 in heavy turnover. Watch for a potential test of the stock's rising 50-day moving average. Ollie's, which is aggressively expanding its store footprint, has rallied nicely since clearing a 32 buy point in a cup with handle.

Advisors hit obstacles along the way, some self-imposed.But the heads of top-tier firms share something in common: They maximize their ability to learn from experience — and constantly apply their insights to make their business better.Three top advisors told IBD of the factor that played big roles in their success: finding mentors, hiring correctly and getting to the office early.Advisors often begin their career with a few core beliefs. For example, they want to help people attain their financial goals, provide exceptional service and act with integrity.Yet even if the vast majority of advisors start with the same foundational beliefs, only a select few rise to the top. When asked to share their hard-earned wisdom, these industry leaders demystify the tools, traits and strategic moves that gave rise to their success.Perhaps the most important lesson top advisors learn is the limits of their own expertise. From a young age, they thirst for knowledge and enlist others' help to expand their horizon.""Early on, I gravitated to people at the top of the heap,"" said Steve Cassaday, a certified financial planner in McLean, Va. ""Everywhere I worked, I'd find the top person and ask, 'You do this really well. How do you do it?'""he says he isolated a specific area that he wanted to improve in his own performance and then identified someone who excelled in that area.""I found incremental mentors, people who could incrementally help me do stuff,"" he said. ""I might meet somebody who was good at overcoming objections or integrating various financial planning processes, and find out how they did it. Then I'd move on to somebody else with a different skill set.""To find talented role models, Cassaday mingled at conventions and other industry gatherings. He also observed the leading producers at the Wall Street firms where he worked in his 20s and 30s.In terms of growing his business, one of the most important lessons Cassaday has learned boils down to two words: time management.He suggests that advisors keep a written log of all their activities for one week, organized in 15-minute chunks. Then review the list, scrutinize each activity and ask, ""What can I automate, eliminate or delegate?""Thanks to this exercise, he realized that he could automate such tasks as generating client-appointment letters using a customer relationship management (CRM) system or producing easy-to-read spreadsheets to help clients track their portfolio.""Before, we were writing all our appointment letters and recreating each spreadsheet,"" he said.Similarly, he used to give clients a thick booklet detailing an elaborate financial plan. But he decided that such binders were ""a big waste of time"" and replaced them with a three- to four-page checklist of to-do items.Clients appreciated the shorter handout. And they found it easier to follow through because of the simple format.""When you put a check box on a document, people are automatically drawn to it,"" Cassaday said.To delegate well, advisors need to trust their workforce. If you hire poorly, you can get mired in cleaning up messes that your staff created.In recent years, many professional services firms have adopted the rallying cry, ""Hire for attitude, train for skill."" Embracing this mantra, they have brought aboard brilliant thinkers or sparkling personalities — even if there's no clearly defined job opening.Michael Klein, a Milwaukee-based advisor, has concluded that such a hiring strategy rarely works. Over the 24 years that he has helped grow his practice to about $11 billion in assets under management, he and his colleagues have learned to recruit with a more targeted focus.""Early on, we'd take interesting resumes and try to make them fit,"" said Klein, 52, a managing director at Robert W. Baird & Co. ""But we learned to pass on some good candidates because we couldn't craft a job around them. Instead, we identified the job and then sought the right fit for that role.""In search of an office manager, he says an applicant impressed him so much with her ""star potential"" that he hired her, even though she lacked relevant experience.""It didn't work and two months later we were stuck,"" he said ruefully.Another lesson Klein has learned revolves around the increasing complexity of the business. Establishing a niche helps differentiate your firm so that you don't try ""to be all things to all people,"" he says.He and his co-founder started by focusing on airline pilots. Over time, they expanded their clientele to include business owners, pension plans and CEOs.""We had to do the same thing over and over to be successful,"" he recalled. ""That means you have to be stubborn and turn away business outside the niche.""Work ethic is a given for any top advisor. But putting in 10- or 12-hour days also sends a message to the rest of your team.Ron Basu, 50, attributes his success in part to his turn-the-lights-on-every-morning philosophy. Beating everyone to the office gave him an edge.A New York City-based advisor at Morgan Stanley Private Wealth Management with $3.5 billion in assets under management, Basu says that he's still the first one at work every morning.""It's super important,"" he said. ""It keeps you disciplined to have to go to sleep at a certain time to get up early. And information is power; gathering information between 7:00 and 9 a.m. puts you at an instant advantage. Why start a tennis game when you're down a set?""RELATED:What's The Stock Market Doing Now?

81,CRM,"Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 were little changed early Friday morning after the major averages staged a modest rebound Thursday following Wednesday's sharp sell-off.Once again, the FANG+ stocks led the way Wednesday. Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) rose about 1.5% in Thursday stock market trading, with Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB) climbing close to 2%. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) was a relative laggard, up 0.9%, but still outperformed the major averages.X Apple's ecosystem also thrived. Apple iPhone chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO) (2.8%), Skyworks (SWKS) (2.6%) and Qorvo (QRVO) (4.15%) had big gains.Futures for the Dow industrials and S&P 500 were virtually flat vs. fair value. So were Nasdaq 100 futures. After Thursday's close Applied Materials (AMAT), Salesforce.com (CRM), Ross Stores (ROST), Gap (GPS) and Autodesk (ADSK) rallied on their earnings reports.In Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.1% while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.2% and China's Shanghai composite was fractionally lower.Last week, Amazon celebrated its 20th anniversary as a public company. On Thursday, Facebook had its fifth anniversary. Facebook went public at 38 a share on May 18, 2012. Shares popped to 45 moments after trading began, but closed near the IPO price. Then it spent more than a year below 38. Finally, it broke out in powerful fashion in July 2013. From that 32.61 buy point, Facebook has soared 354% to Thursday's close of 147.94.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook is a standout company and stock. But it's only ranked sixth in IBD's Internet-Content group. To see which stocks are the group's top performers and how they stack up vs. Facebook and objective criteria, check out IBD's Stock Checkup.It seems obvious in hindsight that Facebook would thrive, even when its stock was underwater for 14 months. But it wasn't. Yahoo (YHOO) fell behind to Google in search, and Google couldn't catch up in social media with its ill-fated Google+. Facebook, like many other internet firms, had to deal with a massive shift to mobile, where ads paid out less. That meant Facebook had to spend more to make less.However, Facebook executed brilliantly. As mobile became its dominant form, additional users and ads translated into massive revenue and earnings growth yet again. Its Instagram purchase — a month before its IPO — turned out to be a boon, especially in battling upstart Snapchat, the main unit of recent IPO Snap (SNAP).On its anniversary, Facebook kept busy. Facebook reached a deal Thursday to live-stream 20 Major League Baseball games. It'll stream a game every Friday for the rest of the season, starting on May 19 with the Colorado Rockies vs. the Cincinnati Reds. Facebook already has a pact with Univision to stream some MLS soccer games.Facebook and other streaming sites are making a big push to cover sports. Amazon recently forged a deal to air the NFL's 10 ""Thursday Night Football"" games next season. Amazon is replacing Twitter, which had those rights in the most recent season.Facebook rebounded from its 50-day moving average on Thursday in above-average volume, though trading cooled from Wednesday. It was solid action at a key support level. But with the current market uptrend under pressure, investors should be cautious about stepping in.RELATED:The Big Picture: 3 Technical Signs That Favor The BullsSalesforce.com Beats Profit, Revenue Views, Tweaks Full-Year OutlookApplied Materials Hails 'Tremendous Momentum'; EPS Growth Tops 100% Again

82,CRM,"XStock futures reversed lower Thursday morning as Brazil's political and market turmoil adds to Trump-related selling following New York's worst day of 2017.The Justice Department late Wednesday named a special prosecutor to take over the Russia-Trump probe and Cisco Systems (CSCO) plunged on weak guidance. Meanwhile, fellow Dow component Wal-Mart (WMT) gets a chance this morning to show if it can hold its own against Amazon.com (AMZN).That comes after the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite suffered their worst losses in months, following reports that President Trump pressured then-FBI chief James Comey to drop his investigation of short-lived National Security Advisor Mike Flynn.Bank stocks were big losers, with Citigroup (C) falling 4% and Bank of America (BAC) 5.9%. Citigroup dropped below an aggressive buy point. Bank of America plunged through its 50-day line.The DOJ late Wednesday named ex-FBI Director Richard Mueller to take over the investigation of links between Russia and President Trump's associates in the 2016 campaign.At minimum, Trump's escalating political troubles suggest that the president will struggle to pass tax cuts or other pro-growth initiatives. Stocks had soared on hopes for that agenda but soured Wednesday.Meanwhile, Brazil stock futures tumbled overnight following new audio disclosures linking President Temer to a massive corruption scandal underway. Huge protests took place Wednesday night vs. Michel Temer, who was vice president until his predecessor, Dilma Rousseff, was impeached for her ties to the same broad scandal. The iShares MSCI Brazil Capped ETF (EWZ) plunged 15.6% in the premarket after falling 3.2% Tuesday.S&P 500 index futures fell 0.3% vs. fair value reversing from gains of roughly 0.4% overnight. Dow futures were down 0.4% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures sank more than 0.4%.Over in Asia, investors continued the worldwide selloff. Japan's Nikkei sank 1.3% and Australia's ASX/S&P 200 retreated 0.8% Thursday. The Shanghai composite retreated 0.45%. European markets were lower in intraday action, with the U.K.'s FTSE down 1.4%, Germany's Dax 0.9% and France's CAC-40 1%.After Wednesday's market close, networking giant Cisco Systems reported better-than-expected earnings while revenue edged past views, though it fell vs. a year earlier for a sixth straight quarter. But Cisco sees larger-than-expected EPS and sales declines in the current quarter. Shares crashed 7.5% in premarket trading. Cisco had fallen 1.4% to 33.82 on Wednesday, better than the general market and not far from a 34.63 buy point.Looking ahead, Wal-Mart will report first-quarter earnings early Thursday. Wal-Mart has spent heavily to step up its online game, buying Jet.com last year and adding some niche e-commerce firms in 2017. The retail giant even stole a march on Amazon, cutting its minimum online order for free shipping to $35 earlier this year. That spurred Amazon to reverse its policy and cut rates twice, from $50 to $35, and then to $25.Wal-Mart is expected to report a 2% EPS decline to 96 cents, according to Zacks Investment Research, with sales up 1.5% to $117.63 billion. Wal-Mart shares actually rose 1 cent to 75.12 on Wednesday.Also Thursday, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) will report in the morning, while Salesforce.com (CRM) and Ross Stores (ROST) are on tap for after the market close.RELATED:Stocks Slide Fast As White House Focus Grows; Uptrend Under PressureCisco Sales Fall For Sixth Straight Quarter; Revenue Outlook MissesRun On Bank Stocks: Citigroup Loses Buy Point, Bank of America Breaks Key Level5 Key Earnings Reports Due: Investing Action Plan

84,CRM,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) hiked its stake in Apple (AAPL) by more than 125% to 129.4 million shares in the first quarter, and made modest changes to its airlines holdings while avoiding Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP), which went public in March.Meanwhile, Soros Fund Management bought 1.7 million shares of Snap, joining David Tepper's Appaloosa Management and Dan Loeb's Third Point. Soros also dissolved his firm's positions in Amazon.com (AMZN) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), and added to its stake in Facebook (FB), according to filings late Monday.David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital trimmed its Apple holdings to 4.2 million shares from 6.1 million in Q4, while more than quadrupling its stake in General Motors (GM) to 55 million shares from 13 million.In Q1, Berkshire grew its American Airlines (AAL) stake to 49.3 million shares, up 8.4% vs. the previous quarter, and its investment in Southwest Airlines (LUV) to 47.7 million, up 10.4%. It trimmed its position in Delta to 55 million shares, down 8.3%, while keeping its holdings in United Airlines (UAL) steady at 28.9 million.The regulatory filing confirmed news from early May that Berkshire's Buffett busily dumped tech giant IBM (IBM) in Q1. It had 64.6 million shares left at quarter-end, down 20%. (Even IBM Retirement Fund's unloaded 70,000 shares of IBM, leaving it with 12,451 IBM shares in Q1, according to the fund's 13F filing on May 10.)Meanwhile, the conglomerate's massive long-term stakes in Coca-Cola (KO), American Express (AXP) and Kraft Heinz (KHC) were left basically unchanged.Buffett had already said Berkshire more than doubled its Apple holdings in Q1, giving it a 2.5% stake in the iPhone maker's outstanding shares. Berkshire initiated a position in Apple, worth $1.1 billion, in Q1 2016 and doubled down on Apple as the year progressed.By contrast, Appaloosa Management slashed its stake in 2017's best-performing Dow component Apple by a third, to 300,000 shares, and trimmed Facebook by 12.6%, to 1.9 million shares in Q1, according to filings from Friday. The company also scooped up 100,000 shares of Snap, which tanked 17.5% last week on a dismal debut earnings reports following its March IPO.Similarly, Third Point exited its 1.85 million-share stake in Apple during Q1, while buying 2.25 million shares of Snap.Shares of Berkshire closed up 0.3% at 163.76 on the stock market today. Apple dipped 0.3%, down from Friday's fresh record high, and Snap rallied 8.4%, after last week's plunge. Facebook eased 0.1%, and IBM added 0.7%.Among Appaloosa's other notable moves, the fund entirely liquidated its massive stakes in two troubled stocks: chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) and retailer J.C. Penney (JCP).Appaloosa added a 1.6 million-share stake in Symantec (SYMC), which was leading a cybersecurity stock rally Monday on the heels of a global ransomware attack. Appaloosa also raised its Western Digital (WDC) stake by 16.1% to 1.3 million shares.But the hedge fund's biggest bet seems to be on an American industrial renaissance. It opened positions of roughly half a million shares each in AK Steel (AKS) and Nucor (NUE), while upping ArcelorMittal (MT) by more than 410%, to nearly 5 million shares.Other hefty new positions included Bank of America (BAC) and CBS (CBS) (8.8 million and 1.0 million shares, respectively).Third Point's other moves include adding to positions in T-Mobile (TMUS), Salesforce (CRM), Qualcomm and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD).The fund closed a small stake in Goldman Sachs (GS), and reduced holdings in Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Late Friday, Trian Fund Management also disclosed bigger positions in General Electric (GE) and Procter & Gamble (PG) and a smaller stake in DuPont (DD).RELATED:What Will Berkshire Filing Show As Loeb Cuts Facebook, Apple Stakes?Why Buffett Still Isn't Sure If He'd Buy Amazon, Alphabet Stock Now

85,CRM,"Many mutual funds share the same holdings as TCW Select Equities, but most haven't performed nearly as well as this mutual fund under Craig Blum's management.The $907 million fund (TGCEX) is up 12.62% so far this year vs. returns of 6.07% for the S&P 500 and 8.63% for its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. In the past 10 years, the fund returned an average annual 8.20% vs. 7.40% for its peers and 7.08% for the S&P 500.How do Blum and his investment team produce such results? Their investment approach sounds similar to some other funds, so the difference must be in the execution.Part of that comes from the fund's concentrated portfolio. It holds only about 30 stocks and has about half of the fund's assets invested in the top 10 holdings. Top holdings as of March 31 were Alphabet (GOOGL) at nearly 7% of assets, Facebook (FB) 6% and Visa (V) 6%. Alphabet's stock has risen 12% this year. Facebook is up 27% this year and 13% above a cup-with-handle base buy point of 129.37. Visa is up 18% and 9% above a flat-base buy point of 84.06.Despite the heavier-than-average weightings, the mutual fund has a relatively low turnover rate of 14% vs. a norm of near 100% for stock funds.Blum's team selects quality large- and midcap stocks with the ""most unique and extraordinary growth opportunities available that are fundamentally misperceived by the market, and for that reason mispriced longer term,"" Blum explains.Underpinning stock holdings' potential are long-term revenue opportunities that flow from potentially huge addressable markets. Blum also looks at the business model for ""some sort of unfair advantage that puts a wide competitive moat around the business,"" he points out.TCW Select Equities focuses on fast-growing companies, but valuation matters. ""Valuation is the third pillar of what we do. It is best to avoid overpaying for a business,"" Blum said.He finds that deep and efficient markets are good at pricing-in consensus expectations and extrapolating near-term experience. ""What markets get wrong all the time are addressable revenue opportunities,"" he said. ""So markets misjudge how large an opportunity can be for a business, and they often misjudge competitive advantage.""A case in point is the story of Salesforce.com (CRM), which the fund started buying in 2005 and is now its fifth-largest holding. ""People thought it was never going to be anything more than sales force automation, Oracle (ORCL) is going to kill them, PeopleSoft is going to kill them,"" said Blum. ""Well, it wasn't just sales force automation. It was marketing and another segment of the service business, it was artificial intelligence and the predictive cloud. The entire software industry became the end market.""That said, the fund is not immune to volatility and significantly underperformed the market and its peers in 2016. TGCEX lost 8.07% last year vs. gains of 3.23% by its peers and 11.96% by the S&P 500.Among the culprits were a heavy exposure to the health care sector since early 2016 and the markets' favoritism of high dividend-paying stocks. In addition, Blum points out that there was asymmetry in the market in that it did not reward much for a strong fundamental story, yet any hint of chance of bad news would send otherwise-healthy stocks significantly lower. Also, the fund had little exposure to the postelection reflationary trade sectors such as financials, energy, materials and industrials.But as 2017 rolled around, markets started to realize that President Trump's proposals for pro-growth reforms may not happen as quickly as expected. ""You started to see the Trump reflation trade unwind,"" Blum said.In addition, the U.S. economy proved to be more robust to tolerate a Fed tightening, compared with a year ago. And markets became more comfortable pricing quality fundamentals and growth, he said, ""which is our wheelhouse.""""And so, you're seeing sectors like IT and health care, that were punished so heavily last year, begin to outperform,"" he said.One of the strong performers has been Mobileye (MBLY), a developer of software for camera-based advanced driver-assistance systems, which is being acquired by Intel (INTC). Mobileye's stock has jumped 62% this year.Blum says Mobileye is a good example of a business where Intel saw value whereas public markets didn't. ""They're the share leader in vision-based systems in your car. ... They're winning upwards of 90% of all business out of the auto OEMs.""Another stock he likes is Priceline Group (PCLN), of which the fund holds more than 4%. ""North of 70% of profits come from their European brand, which is Booking.com. Priceline is a dominant and proven online travel agent.""Blum says that the global online travel market is still only 11% to 12% penetrated, so there's a lot of runway for growth. Priceline's stock is up about 23% in 2017.One of the better plays on higher bond yields is Charles Schwab (SCHW), points out Blum. ""We still think it's sort of misunderstood as a high-quality business and asset-gathering machine, that also gives you lots of upside if we do successfully bring interest rates higher over the next two-three years.""Only about 15% of Schwab's revenue comes from trading commissions, while approximately 45% of the business is made up of fees from the asset management branch and another 35% to 40% from net-interest margins, Blum explained. ""So, it's a business that operates a very plain-vanilla bank as well.""Schwab's stock is up a just 1.6% this year and has been nearing its 50-day average in recent days.ServiceNow (NOW), a developer of cloud-based IT software, has gained 19% year to date and is a stock that Blum has been buying since 2014. ""This is another one that's poorly understood, we believe, by a lot of folks out there. It's a rapidly growing business. ... They're driving better results at dramatically lower cost for the end user.""Blum says that the number of use cases has expanded to not just IT service management, but also operations management, security management and many other tools. ""The reason it's performed well — it's because investors are slowly beginning to understand that the total addressable market that faces the company is much larger than once thought.""RELATED:This Top Mutual Fund Exploits Market Inefficiencies.

87,CRM,"Microsoft (MSFT) unveiled Wednesday a new cloud service dubbed Azure IoT Edge, which can be used for industrial applications, as General Electric (GE) pushes its reinvention as a digital industrial leader.Microsoft's new technology delivers artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and advanced data analytics via the cloud to local computing devices. It will help companies increase operational efficiency or respond more quickly to events like machinery glitches, while potentially slashing their tech-related costs.Meanwhile, GE's Predix cloud-based operating system software allows companies to add intelligence to their equipment, monitor for problems, and enhance efficiency and savings.GE pointed out that it has sharpened its focus on the industrial IoT (Internet of Things) over the past year — and partnered with Microsoft in July 2016 in pursuit of that goal.""In this partnership, we are bringing GE's Predix platform for industrial IoT to Azure, to give our customers access to Microsoft's global cloud footprint,"" a GE spokeswoman told IBD via email. ""We are also leveraging applications available on Azure, combined with Predix, to bring these joint capabilities to our industrial customers.""She noted that GE acquired machine learning company Wise.io in November last year to accelerate development of advanced AI offerings on the Predix platform.Shares of GE closed down 0.8% at 28.69 on the stock market today, after Boeing (BA) halted test flights of its 737 Max jets due to an issue with engines from CFM, a joint venture of GE and France's Safran. Microsoft edged up 0.4% to 69.31. GE, Microsoft and Boeing are all components of the Dow Jones industrial average, which slipped 0.2% Wednesday.The industrial internet market is being eyed by both tech heavyweights such as Microsoft and industrial stalwarts like GE, Honeywell (HON) and Siemens (SIEGY).By GE's own estimate, that market is poised to be worth $225 billion by 2020, topping $206 billion for the enterprise cloud computing market and $170 billion for the consumer IoT market. Major providers of cloud infrastructure include Alphabet (GOOGL), Oracle (ORCL), IBM (IBM) and Salesforce (CRM).That growth potential has fueled GE's ambitions to become a hybrid tech-industrial powerhouse.""If you went to bed last night as an industrial company, you're going to wake up this morning as a software and analytics company,"" Jeffrey Immelt, General Electric CEO, said in 2015.While Microsoft missed sales forecasts in the March quarter, the tech giant highlighted cloud services as a pocket of revenue strength amid broad global demand.RELATED:How GE Could Become The Apple Of The Industrial InternetGE Sees Digital Revenue More Than Doubling To $15 Billion By 2020Amazon Cloud Services Under Growing Threat From Microsoft, Google, IBM

88,CRM,"IBM (IBM) is pushing higher into the cloud.In 2016, the tech icon reported revenue from cloud computing services of $13.7 billion, up 35% year over year. In the first quarter, cloud revenue rose 33% to $3.5 billion, standing out amid otherwise lackluster results, and providing an avenue of much-needed growth for Big Blue. The company has had 20 straight quarters of declining earnings.The cloud computing business is part of IBM's ""strategic imperatives,"" a grouping of businesses that includes Big Data analytics, security, and social and mobile computing. In the first quarter, revenue from strategic imperatives rose 12% year over year to $7.8 billion, led by IBM's cloud and mobile businesses.Cloud computing comes in various formats. There's infrastructure-as-a-service, led by Amazon.com (AMZN), and software-as-a-service, led by Salesforce.com (CRM). There's also a hybrid approach, which combines public and private clouds and where IBM is well positioned.Cloud computing is one of the hottest categories in technology today, and considered to be just in the early stages of growth. IBM competes with Amazon and its Amazon Web Services outfit, Microsoft (MSFT), with its Azure platform, and Alphabet (GOOGL), with its Google Cloud platform, among others.Don Boulia, IBM's vice president for cloud strategy and portfolio management, spoke with IBD about the company's cloud direction.IBD: What is IBM's approach to the cloud computing market?Boulia: We're looking at the cloud market from what we see with our customer base from a value perspective, and that revolves around a few things. First and foremost is the notion of hybrid cloud computing (a combination of a public and private cloud), which for most of our enterprise customers is the end space we expect them to get to. Now, the mix from what they decide to use from a cloud perspective in terms of public cloud and private cloud will vary. We focus a lot on a strong hybrid solution.The second approach is the data. This brings in everything from data analytics to the work we are doing on the cognitive front, with technologies like Watson, and really using data as one of the differentiators. And the final piece is industry expertise and what we apply to our cloud with our personnel, and what we can deliver in terms of vertical solutions — things that get you closer to the problems you're trying to address. That could be everything from technologies like blockchain technology all the way up to industry solutions — for example, with our Watson health unit.IBD: Where do you see the cloud industry headed?Boulia: It continues to evolve. When we first looked at what cloud computing meant to people, they really viewed it as a platform for cost savings. They didn't have to own their own data center, and the hardware and software. Where we really see people starting to get more value out of the cloud is using it as a platform for innovation. It's a core part of their business and it is the way where you get enhanced productivity, better innovation, and better competitiveness. So, it's moving from the notion where you are just using it as infrastructure to reduce costs and instead using it to innovate.IBD: How do you define IBM's hybrid approach?Boulia: A hybrid approach is fundamentally the notion that people are going to adopt more than one cloud. And our viewpoint is that, for most significant enterprises, is the reality. And that could be your own cloud, or a private cloud mixed with public cloud offerings. You could have multiple options. So as people leverage the cloud for more things, then different types of clouds are utilized. Therefore, you need to bring this all together. So, this notion of hybrid cloud, from a customer perspective, is about how they get what they need done with these multiple clouds. And that introduces a series, a set of challenges that we address.IBD: Why should a business use IBM over Amazon, Microsoft and other cloud providers?Boulia: It comes down to what I mentioned right at the beginning, which is this notion of an end-to-end solution, including helping people establish their own cloud. We provide a first-class public cloud experience. We have all the tools to manage connecting all those things together and manage the life-cycle of applications in the cloud. That notion of the hybrid cloud is definitely one of our differentiators, being an end-to-end hybrid provider. And we are very committed to open standards. Our clients have told us loud and clear that they need the flexibility and choice, having the ability use open standards and open source as a way to provide some of these capabilities. It gives people that flexibility to move workloads.IBD: How are you using IBM's Watson computer in cloud computing?Boulia: We continue to deliver it as a solution that can operate on a specific domain or data set. The famous Jeopardy/Watson example was in the area of trivia and that kind of format. But we have since applied Watson in the field of health care in terms of looking for certain kinds of cancer, for example. Watson can delve into specific domains, but what we've also done is broken Watson up into a set of APIs, things that people can use within their own application to add cognitive capabilities to what they are building. So, rather than it being just the solution in one domain, you now have a set of things you can access, where you can build your own solutions. And the sky's the limit. So using our cloud platform you can build new solutions that leverage cognitive computing, without having to establish your own cognitive system. That's the beauty of the cloud.IBD: And IBM has also added quantum computing to its cloud services abilities?Boulia: Quantum computers are not easy to maintain. So having access to a cloud type of interface gives a broad population access to resources, in this case the quantum computing resources, without having your own quantum computer.IBD: How large is IBM's cloud computing footprint?Boulia: As it stands today we have 50 data centers across 20 countries. From a footprint perspective that's more countries than anyone else has. Part of the reason we do that is because of the feedback we get from our clients, particularly in some of the geographies where data sovereignty is a key issue. So if you don't have a footprint in those countries you are going to be limited in terms of your ability to address that.RELATED:Google Plays Catch-Up In The Cloud With Amazon And MicrosoftRed Hat's Big Bet On The Cloud Seen As A Revenue Driver

89,CRM,"XAmazon (AMZN) is in a league of its own in the cloud-computing field but is being challenged by the fast-growing operations of other cloud service providers like Microsoft (MSFT) and Google.New data from Synergy Research Group, based on a reading of first-quarter reports, show that there are five major cloud infrastructure service providers that are growing more rapidly than Amazon Web Services, it said.Amazon Web Services, as the market leader, remains well ahead of the field, with a global market share that is holding steady at around 33%, Synergy said. Amazon, in its first-quarter report on Thursday, showed AWS revenue of $3.66 billion, up 43% year over year. The business is also highly lucrative for Amazon. Operating income of $890 million for AWS represented the bulk of its $1 billion in operating income overall.Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL), IBM (IBM), Alibaba (BABA) and Oracle (ORCL) all achieved growth rates in the first quarter ""that were substantially higher than that of AWS."" But AWS  is ""still comfortably bigger than the other five combined,"" Synergy said.It said Microsoft, Alphabet and Alibaba all achieved annual growth rates of 80% or more. Salesforce (CRM) and privately held Rackspace are the two other companies in the ranking of top cloud providers.Microsoft, in its first-quarter report,  said its cloud-computing platform, Azure, grew 93% year over year. The company did not disclose a revenue figure.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon hit a record high Friday, with Amazon Web Services playing a big role in why it beat estimates on the top and bottom lines.Synergy estimates that quarterly cloud infrastructure service revenue has now reached almost $10 billion, a figure that includes infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service as well as private cloud services. Synergy expects that to grow at more than 40% per year.While AWS, Microsoft and Google are the lead providers in IaaS/PaaS, IBM continues to lead in hosted private cloud, where Rackspace and some traditional IT service providers feature more prominently than they do in public cloud.Alphabet does not break out cloud revenue. It's included with its ""Google other revenues"" segment, which rose 49% year over year to $3.1 billion.Alibaba, for its fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 31, said revenue from its cloud-computing unit rose 115% to $254 million. It reports fiscal fourth-quarter results on May 18.Amazon shares rose 0.7% to 924.99, moving above a 923.82 buy point but closing well off record intraday highs of 949.59.RELATED:Google Plays Catch-Up In The Cloud With Amazon And MicrosoftRed Hat's Big Bet On The Cloud Seen As A Revenue Driver

90,CRM,"A recent survey conducted by SAP (SAP) found that two-thirds of small-to-medium-size businesses say they are only at the early stages of digital transformation.The payoff is that SMBs also reported 70% of their technological investments exceeded their expectations.""The opportunity to use data to develop customer loyalty, drive demand, and design products and services that customers want has never been greater,"" said Barry Padgett, president SMB at SAP. SAP is the world's third-largest independent software manufacturer by market capitalization.Tips on investing in technology that works:Leverage analytics. Move sales and marketing to data-driven decision-making, Padgett advises.With the right technology, companies can ""capitalize on better access to data to study and mine patterns, and gain actionable insights,"" he added.Padgett points to SAP client Leadbetter Golf, which provides golf instruction. With the help of predictive analytics Leadbetter Golf discovered new ways to reach out to franchises and customers, he says. ""This has enabled them to achieve substantial cost reductions and increases in revenue.""Target what matters most. The technologies that will have the greatest effect on the bottom line for SMBs include those that impact customer acquisition, such as software for customer relationship management, Padgett says.""Solutions like CRM simplify how work gets done so companies can focus on optimizing for impact,"" he said. ""And for high-growth companies, the right technologies can manage increasing complexity without adding staff to their IT organization.""He points to hair-care company Living Proof as an example. Since updating their technology through SAP, they now seamlessly run everything from time and expense reports to managing their supply chain and production planning. In 2015, Living Proof saw revenue growth of 300% and an increase of 400% in sheer volume of items produced and distributed, Padgett says.Use tools. Mandu Dragos, CEO and co-founder of the Dagadam smartwatch, designed to help its users save time, have a more active lifestyle, and stay connected, is conducting a 45-day Kickstarter campaign to raise funds and even more importantly, consumer awareness.""Kickstarter is a great crowdfunding platform,"" Dragos said. It's easy-to-launch a project and it's ideal for startups with limited money and to raise funds to finish projects without compromises. Their algorithm is very efficient and the community that forms after the campaign is much more attached to the product than regular consumers.To date, Dagadam's Kickstarter campaign has raised $160,000.Stay connected. ""Videoconferencing has become ubiquitous, and it provides one of the best paybacks when it comes to easily connecting the people you work with,"" said Jeff Rodman co-founder and chief evangelist of Polycom, which provides 400,000 companies with video- and voice-conferencing solutions.He adds that video is a great tool for managing remote employees because it gives you an easy, affordable way to remain in closer touch than just email or phone calls. ""It also gives everyone a way to connect with contacts and customers without worrying about where they're working from.""Test your setup. If you're joining a meeting through a web browser, Rodman says, make sure to try it out if it is the first time you are using any part of it — ""a new browser, a new app, a new network connection, a new service.""""Some technologies require plug-ins, and they may not be compatible with all browsers,"" he said. ""If you've checked it out first, it's a lot more likely that you won't wind up troubleshooting the technology in the middle of a meeting.""Set your pace. For some companies their technology changes could start with updating their websites, SAP's Padgett points out. For others it could mean upgrading their point-of-sale systems. He says when SAP works with customers, they seek to understand two things:""Take it one step at a time,"" Padgett said. ""Truly understand that digital transformation is a journey, not a destination.""MORE SECRETS TO SUCCESS:Power To Persuade Starts With Connecting To Others' AttitudesLeave The Office To Spread Your Message — And Hear What Others Have To SayAdd Meaning To Your Job By Discovering Your Core ValuesTurn A Vision Into Action By Showing The Way To Achieve It

92,CRM,"Shares of Kate Spade (KATE) nose-dived Tuesday after a report a day earlier indicated the apparel and handbag company would take more time to work out possible terms of a sale, while Ralph Lauren (RL) said it's examining new approaches to its retail stores.The moves are the latest that reflect the retail industry's struggles with physical stores amid competition from off-price chains, industrywide discounting and online retailers like Amazon (AMZN). Some analysts also say many retailers have far more stores than are needed.Reuters reported late Monday that Kate Spade would give those interested in acquiring Kate Spade more time to get a clearer picture of the company's finances, after Coach (COH) last week offered to buy the company. Michael Kors (KORS) has also expressed interest in buying Kate Spade, but it hasn't been aggressive about a purchase as Coach has, Reuters added.Shares crashed 14.7% to close at 19.46 on the stock market today, nearly wiping out the gains seen since buyout talk first surfaced, as any takeover price is expected to be below its market value of around $2.9 billion on Monday. Coach skidded by 2.6% to 39.56, and Michael Kors lost 3.2% to 36.82.IBD'S TAKE: Even as brick-and-mortar stores suffer due to weak mall traffic, in many cases, their online sales grew during the fourth quarter. News that Kate Spade was exploring a sale first surfaced in December. Coach, the Wall Street Journal noted at that time, had been considered a good match for the company. Shares got a lift then, and climbed further in February after the company said it was exploring ""strategic alternatives.""Ralph Lauren, meanwhile, said it would close its flagship Polo store on Fifth Avenue in New York, saying the closure would help it focus on new ways to ""pilot new and innovative customer experiences.""The company said it would integrate products from the Fifth Avenue location into its Ralph Lauren Men's and Women's flagship stores on Madison Avenue and elsewhere in the city.""We continue to review our store footprint in each market to ensure we have the right distribution and customer experience in place,"" Ralph Lauren CFO Jane Nielsen said in a statement.Those and other cost-cutting decisions would produce around $140 million in annualized savings, Ralph Lauren said and forecast restructuring costs of roughly $370 million from the efforts.The company said it would ""also explore new retail concepts, including leveraging Ralph's Coffee, and developing new store formats that connect the brand to loyal and new consumers.""Shares of Ralph Lauren plunged 4.5% to 77.74.Along with meeting e-commerce delivery needs, analysts have said retail outlets need to do more to appeal to consumers' desires for memorable experiences. Such companies as Apple (AAPL) and Nike (NKE) have stores that allow shoppers to try out products directly.Ralph Lauren also said it would collaborate with Salesforce's (CRM) Commerce Cloud service to offer what it described as a ""more cost-effective, flexible e-commerce platform.""RELATED:Sears: 'Substantial Doubt' Over Survival; Bebe, Payless Pushed To EdgeFinish Line's Dismal Earnings, Guidance Follow Nike's Retail Warning

Shares in software giant Oracle fell 0.4% to 44.52.""While Accenture has been growing its top line nicely, keep in mind that the company is one of the largest global partners and system integrators for the likes of SAP (SAP), Salesforce.com (CRM), and ServiceNow (NOW) to name a few. An acquisition by Oracle of one of these vendors' largest partners could put a meaningful amount of Accenture revenue at risk,"" said Brian Essex, a Morgan Stanley analyst in a report.""We view a combination between the two as unlikely as we believe the negatives in this case would outweigh the positives,"" he added.Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard has a similar view.""We believe services companies are viewed as credible with their customers when they are significantly independent. Accenture has relationships with nearly all software companies we cover, many of which compete with Oracle (SAP, Salesforce, Workday (WDAY)), making it difficult for an Oracle-owned Accenture to be viewed as independent,"" Pritchard said in a report.IBD'S TAKE: Oracle stock hit an all-time high of 46.99 in intraday trading on March 16 but has retreated 5% since then. Acquisitions have turned the database software vendor into a provider of many software tools. Learn more about Oracle's cloud computing strategy at IBD Stock Checkup. Moshe Katri, a Wedbush analyst, also views an Oracle-Accenture merger as problematical.""Being affiliated with a product company will impact Accenture's critical vendor-neutrality role, especially as Accenture consults clients undergoing technology transformation, which includes recommendations for using best of breed products/technology,"" Katri said in a report.Dublin, Ireland-based Accenture reported flat fiscal second-quarter adjusted earnings that topped views with revenue that just fell short of forecasts. For the quarter ended Feb. 28, Accenture earned $1.33 per share, down a penny vs. a year earlier.

""We believe SMBs remain particularly ripe for SaaS adoption given they tend to use standardized solutions that don't require customization.""Paycom on Feb. 9 reported fourth-quarter earnings that topped views and forecast 2017 sales slightly above consensus estimates.

""There is healthy and unfulfilled demand for its shares. Second, public equity investors are still very hungry to invest in growth stories.

104,CRM,"Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) have the most to gain if cloud computing evolves into an electricity-like service, while Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google cloud business could quadruple in size by 2020, Morgan Stanley said in a wide-ranging report issued Thursday.China's Alibaba Group (BABA) looms as the biggest potential share gainer in public cloud computing, the brokerage says, which also upped its price target on IBM (IBM) to 212 from 187 on views that its ""cloud strategy remains underappreciated.""IBM stock climbed 0.8% to close at 177.24 on the stock market today. Shares in Alibaba Group climbed 1.9% to 105.63, retaking a 104.67 buy point. Amazon edged up to 853.42, Alphabet ticked up to 870, a fresh high, while Microsoft lost 0.2% to 64.64 at the close.On the one hand, Morgan Stanley says corporate spending on public cloud computing services could slow after 2020, after enterprises move 50% of business workloads to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform and other providers.The report says, however, that ""a more bullish view of public cloud suggests broader upside across cloud vendors. If public cloud is a transformational technology like electricity, usage broadens and workload growth accelerates, implying cloud stocks are widely undervalued today.""While AWS is by far the biggest provider of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), where clients rent computing resources by the hour, Morgan Stanley's market definition includes cloud-based products such as Microsoft's Office 365. And, Morgan Stanley says Oracle (ORCL), SAP, Salesforce.com (CRM), ServiceNow (NOW) and Workday (WDAY) will be significant players in public cloud.Here are some of Morgan Stanley's forecasts and views.IBD'S TAKE: Alibaba has been taken off  IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping. Leaderboard's roster still includes steel maker Nucor, Marvell Technology, Veeva Systems and other fast-growing companies.Alibaba should be the largest share-gainer, growing to $10 billion in cloud revenue, from $1 billion in 2016. AliCloud will make up 18% of Alibaba's sales in 2021, vs. 4% in fiscal 2017.Google will more than quadruple the size of its cloud business by 2020, growing to $9 billion in revenue.Software players Workday, ServiceNow and Salesforce.com have the highest gross margins in the group (82%-85%) followed by SAP (64%), and Oracle (55%).IBM is transforming to a cognitive and cloud platform through investments. Morgan Stanley forecasts a $3 billion public cloud business at IBM, growing at a 33% annual compound rate through 2020.RELATED:Why You Need To Look At Apple, FANG Stocks Right NowAlphabet Trots Out New Cloud Clients For Amazon, Microsoft To SeeGoogle Plays Catch-Up In The Cloud With Amazon And Microsoft

Salesforce's business is becoming more seasonal (40%-45% of annual bookings in Q4) which creates tough sequential billings comparison.""Salesforce.com hiked fiscal 2018 revenue guidance to a range of $10.15 billion to $10.2 billion, up from its earlier forecast of $10.1 billion to $10.15 billion, representing about 21% year-over-year growth.Salesforce.com's software helps businesses organize and handle sales operations and customer relationships.

112,CRM,"Workday (WDAY) stock fell Tuesday after Citigroup downgraded the enterprise software maker, which is removing guidance on its billings as it adopts new accounting rules.Workday late Monday reported fourth-quarter revenue and profit that topped expectations and forecast full-year fiscal 2018 revenue slightly above views.Workday announced it adopted a new revenue recognition standard, known as FASB 606, a full year before required implementation. Workday said it is the first software company to adopt FASB 606, which makes revenue recognition consistent across U.S. industries. Guidelines specific to the software and defense industries, for example, are going away.""Management took away billings guidance for future periods and is making further changes to the sales force to incrementally focus on midmarket,"" said Walter Pritchard, a Citigroup analyst in a report. ""Both these could cause investor angst and we look at midmarket as a lower-return market vs. enterprise. The company is adopting 606 early, which will bring quarterly revenue backlog disclosure with a likely realization in Q1 that annualized backlog grew slower than total.""Morgan Stanley analysts noted: ""Unfortunately, early adoption of FASB 606 and the withdrawal of billings guidance results in lack of clarity on the near-term growth trajectory.""Shares of Workday sank 8% to close at 82.93 in the stock market today, tumbling well below a buy point of 88.10.IBD'S TAKE: Seacoast Banking, Western Alliance Bancorp, and Broadcom are among IBD's Sector Leaders, a list that highlights the best stocks in 33 sectors. All Sector Leaders show outstanding earnings and sales growth in recent quarters. Developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the 606 rule takes effect in 2018 or fiscal 2019. It will affect many companies but likely will have the most impact on businesses with multiyear contracts, licensing revenue, contracts that peg revenue to performance benchmarks, or third-party sales distribution channels.FASB 606 is the biggest change in accounting standards since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Workday, like bigger Salesforce.com (CRM), has a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, business model and customers buy renewable subscriptions, rather than one-time software licenses.Adobe (ADBE), Microsoft (MSFT) and Splunk (SPLK) are among software stocks that are transitioning to SaaS but still have considerable licensing revenue.Some analysts downplayed Workday's removal of billings guidance.""We believe that the removal of billings guidance only represents a temporary gap in transparency and expect the company to give further metrics around contracted revenue on the 1Q earnings call,"" said Alex Zukin, a Piper Jaffray analyst in a report.Justin Furby, a William Blair analyst, said in a report: ""Management elected to discontinue providing billings guidance, as 606 drives an even bigger disconnect between billings growth and future revenue growth (it can now recognize revenue ahead of invoicing for ramped deals).""RELATED:Workday Swings To Profit, Revenue Outlook Bullish, But Stock FallsWorkday Stock Pops, Signs Wal-Mart In Its Biggest Deal EverThese 4 Software Stocks Are In Buy Range Right NowMeet The 'Fastest-Growing' $1 Billion Enterprise Software Firm

116,CRM,"Google's 2004 initial public offering is ancient history in Silicon Valley time. But buried in an IPO prospectus this month from another tech wunderkind, Snapchat, were clues to the future growth of Google and its parent, Alphabet (GOOGL).Forget Google's much-touted but money-losing ""other bets,"" far-flung businesses ranging from home automation to the Google Fiber broadband service. The real story is in one of the tech giant's three ""big bets"" — cloud computing — which could become Google's first major revenue source not based on advertising.IPO documents filed by Snapchat's parent Snap revealed it has a $2 billion, multiyear contract with Google's cloud computing service to power the company's trendsetting social media network. The disclosure validated views that Google Cloud Platform, while smaller than Amazon Web Services and Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure, is prospering from its focus on ""born in the cloud"" high-tech startups. Aside from Snap, Google's cloud customers include Spotify, Evernote, Zulily and Niantic.And Alphabet has bigger plans. It aims to crack the enterprise market — large companies and government agencies — where AWS, part of Amazon.com (AMZN), and Microsoft's Azure dominate.""Cloud could represent the first material, non-advertising revenue stream for Google and is a key support for the stock multiple,"" said Daniel Salmon, a BMO Capital Markets analyst.Google has more than quadrupled in size since 2008. Its 2016 revenue rose by 20% to a hefty $90 billion.The big driver remains its core advertising business, encompassing its search engine and related web services as well as its YouTube video site, which analysts believe is a big growth contributor.Yet digital advertising growth is leveling off in the U.S., and the continued growth of mobile search could chip away at Google's search dominance. Another worry is the potential challenge from voice-based search from Apple (AAPL), Amazon and others.On Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call, Chief Executive Sundar Pichai highlighted Google Cloud and the other two ""big bets,"" which are YouTube and consumer products like smartphones.Cloud computing is mushrooming as customers ditch the hassles of running their own computers and seek better speed and performance. Cloud service providers lease number-crunching computers and data storage via the internet. They also sell applications and software that run on cloud infrastructure.AWS revenue jumped 55% in 2016 to $12.2 billion. Analysts estimate that Microsoft's Azure cloud service topped $2.6 billion in 2016 revenue while Google trailed at around $1 billion.But Google wants more. In 2015 it brought in Diane Greene — a co-founder of VMware (VMW), whose virtualization software is used in many corporate data centers — to head its cloud business.Greene spelled out Google's enterprise cloud strategy at a Goldman Sachs conference earlier this month. That same day, Google unveiled a new cloud service based on Spanner, a database technology that shares information in data centers spread out globally.Naysayers argue that serving the enterprise market is not in Alphabet's DNA. But Greene says Google aims to help cloud customers become more competitive using data analytics and artificial intelligence tools.""The enterprise has to lean into data and that's what Google was built for,"" Greene said. ""With machine learning and data analytics, we're in the sweet spot of where enterprise customers are going.""Dave Bartoletti, an analyst at Forrester Research, says Google could be on the right track.""Google's innovation in analytics and big data platforms could be the wedge that gets them into enterprises,"" said Bartoletti. ""There's gold inside loads of corporate data, and no one's won the battle to extract it yet.""More than 3 million businesses now use Google's Cloud G Suite software productivity tools — word processing, spreadsheet, calendar and other software that competes with Microsoft's Office 365.The competition is tough.Microsoft has a huge corporate customer base. And, Microsoft has been successful in getting Office customers to sign on for Azure services.Amazon has steadily added tools to make it easier for large companies to shift business workloads to its public, shared cloud infrastructure. Even so, AWS still lacks an ""anchor"" software platform to attract enterprise clients, says Bartoletti.That's where speculation arises could make a takeover bid for Salesforce.com (CRM), the leader in software-as-a-service. Such a combination could give Google Cloud a leg up against Amazon in wooing enterprise clients.Salesforce software helps businesses organize and handle sales operations and customer relationships. It has expanded into marketing, customer services and e-commerce.""I doubt they would try for Salesforce. It would be expensive. But that's not crazy,"" said Bartoletti. ""It's true that one way to buy a big load of enterprise users is to acquire a top SaaS product.""One hurdle for Google is that Salesforce last year selected AWS as its public cloud infrastructure provider in a deal said to be worth $400 million. The pact runs through 2020.But Google is arming for battle. In the fourth-quarter conference call, Pichai signaled bigger cloud investments as the company targets enterprise customers. By 2018, Google plans to operate 40 data centers, up from 15, says Pacific Crest Securities.""I think whatever investments Google makes in the cloud the market will be fully supportive of,"" said Mark Mahaney, analyst at RBC Capital, in an interview. ""It's perceived to be a huge TAM (total addressable market), especially looking at the track record of AWS. And, it's an extremely profitable business."" The operating margin at AWS was 26.2% in the fourth quarter.Higher investments to develop new revenue streams put Google in the same boat as rivals Facebook (FB) and Amazon, says Mahaney. Facebook plans to up spending on video content, data centers, engineering and sales, and virtual reality. Amazon is investing in logistics, cloud, media and other areas.""The common theme across all three names is they're all aggressively investing,"" Mahaney added. ""They're still deep in investment mode because they think there are high-growth opportunities that are early stage in their development.""If not the cloud, where will Google's growth come from, excluding search-related ads? On Google's fourth-quarter call, management cited ""very significant"" growth rates for YouTube.Some analysts are on the YouTube bandwagon.""We believe YouTube could be the next leg of earnings growth for Alphabet,"" said Ralph Schackart, a William Blair analyst, in a report. He says Alphabet shareholders ""could see $75 to $175 of share price appreciation from YouTube alone"" over the next two years.One question is whether YouTube will grow non-advertising revenue. Google launched YouTube Red, a subscription service, in 2015 but has not disclosed subscriber numbers.""It takes a while to build a subscription business,"" Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on Google's earnings call.Google is expected to roll out YouTube Unplugged, a subscription service with live broadcast content, in 2017. It will compete with on-demand video services like Netflix (NFLX) as well as live streaming services from AT&T (T) and Hulu.Google also has signaled higher spending on Pixel phones and smart consumer devices.Google's financial statements lump a number of businesses into the ""other revenue"" category. That revenue includes cloud computing, the Google Play store and consumer hardware, such as Pixel phones and the Google Home assistant, which competes with Amazon's voice-activated Echo smart speaker.In the fourth quarter, ""other revenue"" jumped 62% to $3.4 billion, blowing past consensus estimates. The company did not break out operating income. The segment, though, has lower margins overall than Google's core ad business, and contributes less to profits, says Mahaney.Revenue at smart home device maker Nest, the Verily Life Sciences health data and technology unit and the rest of the ""other bets"" rose 82% to $809 million in 2016. Their combined operating loss grew 4% to $3.6 billion.Verily announced in January that Singapore's sovereign fund, Temasek, will acquire a minority stake for $800 million.Alphabet has pruned other ventures. It spun off Waymo, its self-driving car project, as a stand-alone business in December. Alphabet also sold Terra Bella, its satellite imaging company, to startup Planet Labs.With Google pulling back on broadband investments, 2017 operating losses for the ""other bets"" could be lower.Mahaney says investors have low expectations for the ""other bets,"" though one of them could emerge as a multibillion-dollar business in years to come.""Even if 'other bets' were to shock people with falling losses and material revenue generation, it would be a small stock driver for Google,"" Mahaney said.Google stock slipped 0.37% to 847.81 on Friday. Shares hit a record high of 867 late last month and still are up 18% in the past 12 months.RELATED:Could Google Bid For Salesforce.com Despite Amazon Cloud Pact?This Is What Google Won't Tell You About YouTube's Financials

119,CRM,"Technology investors looking for high revenue growth often find their answer in software-as-a-service companies.ServiceNow (NOW) is one of the fastest-growing companies that fits that bill. ServiceNow's 2016 sales exploded 38% to $1.4 billion, and it has laid claim to being the ""fastest-growing enterprise software company with more than $1 billion in revenue.""It has set big goals, too. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company plans to nearly triple its revenue to $4 billion by 2020.""There's not another company that produces growth at our scale like we do,"" Frank Slootman, ServiceNow's chief executive, said in an interview. ""It's a trifecta — scale, growth and free cash flow.""ServiceNow faces fierce competition, though, most notably from Salesforce.com (CRM), currently the market leader in the industry known as SaaS. Salesforce.com's 2016 sales boomed 24% to $6.7 billion, and the San Francisco-based company is on track to hit $10 billion in revenue for the current fiscal year. It's aiming to hit $20 billion after that.Salesforce.com has the higher profile, being oft-mentioned in industry merger activity, whether it involves Microsoft (MSFT), LinkedIn, Twitter (TWTR) or another company. It specializes in software that helps businesses organize and handle sales operations.But ServiceNow stock has shot up 25% in 2017, while Salesforce.com is up 18% after lagging last year.SaaS companies sell online subscriptions to software, rather than one-time licenses. SaaS providers have high customer renewal rates and book recurring revenue over the long term. Most sell into the so-called ""enterprise market"" — large companies, government agencies and other big customers.ServiceNow has prospered by taking away the customers of BMC Software, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), CA Technologies (CA) and other ""on-premise"" software providers that shifted slowly to cloud-based SaaS business models.Founded in 2004, ServiceNow developed software for information technology service management, basically IT help-desk tools for tracking internal company issues. As Salesforce.com has expanded into marketing, customer service and e-commerce, ServiceNow has made a similar push into customer-service tools, heightening the rivalry between the two.Salesforce.com has been an acquisition machine, spending more than $4.6 billion in 2016 alone to buy companies.In ServiceNow's case, though, it can hit its $4 billion target by growing ""organically,"" meaning without big acquisitions, says Alex Zukin, a Piper Jaffray analyst.""There may be opportunities for them to enhance the breadth of their offerings with (small) tuck-in acquisitions,"" Zukin added.ServiceNow expects to reach its $4 billion revenue goal by expanding into new markets — human resources, customer service management and security, to name a few — and by landing bigger contracts while targeting the top 2,000 global companies.ServiceNow has bought small companies like Neebula Systems, iTapp and most recently DxContinuum to acquire ""talent and technology,"" said Slootman, who has been ServiceNow's CEO since 2011. He earlier headed Data Domain, which was sold to data storage networking giant EMC in 2009.""Technology is not as useful without the talent,"" Slootman said. ""We have the ability to sell, so I don't need to acquire revenue or customers. We can do that ourselves. We try to acquire small companies with promising technology before they go vertical and their revenue explodes, because then it's way more expensive (to acquire them).""ServiceNow still garners most revenue from service management, but the 2014 Neebula acquisition provided key technology for mapping a customers' IT infrastructure in case outages or other problems occur. That's a different market, called IT operations management. ServiceNow's 2016 purchase of ITApp provided cloud management tools.ServiceNow's operations management tools account for about 9% of subscription revenue, with that expected to grow to at least 15% by 2020.Slootman says the same software tools that automate information-technology workflows and record keeping can be applied for finance, legal, procurement and other corporate departments. Like Salesforce.com, ServiceNow is building a library of business apps that customers can download via the internet.The name of the game for many SaaS companies is building a cloud ""platform"" so they can sell multiple software tools to different industries.IBD'S TAKE: After a series of flat bases over the last 10 months, ServiceNow broke out last month and is staking out higher ground above the 90 level. ServiceNow is the eighth-ranked company in IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise Group. Tops on the list is Paycom Software (PAYC), which has a Composite Rating of 95 out of a possible 99.""In software everyone claims to be a platform play, but in reality there are only a few that can make that claim, and ServiceNow is one of them,"" said Matthew Hedberg, a RBC Capital analyst in a report.Much of ServiceNow's revenue growth has come from ""cross-selling."" Its sales staff aims to sell more products to existing service management customers. IBM has emerged as a key partner of ServiceNow, reselling its service management and other tools. Accenture has been a marketing partner in the government market.Alex Zukin, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, says IBM looms as a ""logical acquirer (of ServiceNow) over the longer term.""""ServiceNow's platform would be a logical extension of IBM's cloud infrastructure,"" Zukin said.In mid-2016, ServiceNow was among companies listed in a score card of possible Salesforce.com acquisitions that leaked from a board of directors meeting. Pegasystems (PEGA) and Tableau Software (DATA) also were on Salesforce's wish list, but ServiceNow's market cap is much bigger at more than $15 billion.ServiceNow generates hefty free cash flow, a feat that's not common among SaaS companies, and a plus for any potential acquirers. Free cash flow rose 40% to $322 million in 2016.The company reported unadjusted earnings of 71 cents in 2016 but it's still not profitable on an adjusted basis, which includes stock-based compensation. Shares of ServiceNow ended trading Friday up 1% to 92.74, and were up another 0.5% Tuesday to close at 93.18.ServiceNow has forecast 2017 revenue growth of 32% to $1.835 billion, at the midpoint of its guidance. Billing growth has stabilized after slowing in 2015, when the company reorganized sales. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are modeling 54% earnings growth to $1.08 a share in 2017.A roadmap to ServiceNow's $4 billion revenue goal was revealed in May 2016. A month earlier, it settled patent infringement cases with BMC and HPE. Analysts expect ServiceNow to continue taking share in the service management market from BMC and others, though privately held Cherwell Software is a strong rival.As ServiceNow expands into new markets, analysts say it could run into more competition from the likes of Atlassian (TEAM), Zendesk (ZEN) and Splunk (SPLK).Zukin says that in many cases ServiceNow's management software can work alongside other tools. He says human resources, where Workday (WDAY) is a leading provider, is one example.The Salesforce rivalry, though, seems to be growing.""Historically, ServiceNow's messaging has been that ServiceNow and Salesforce.com can coexist in accounts. The new message seems to be that customers are increasingly taking a 'CRM model' or 'service management' platform approach,"" Brian Schwartz, an Oppenheimer analyst, wrote in a recent report to clients. ""In other words, we believe the two platforms will increasingly be seen as future alternatives rather than running in parallel.""ServiceNow aims to leverage its database technology to provide more problem-solving tools in handling customer-service issues. Both Salesforce.com and ServiceNow are adding artificial intelligence to software. By embedding data analytics and ""machine learning"" into software, they aim to make it easier for customers to automate tasks.ServiceNow acquired AI startup DxContinuum in January. Slootman says he plans to utilize DxContinuum's  throughout ServiceNow's cloud platform. The tools will help customers build predictive models that make it easier to categorize incoming requests from company employees.Aside from HR, customer service and security, Slootman says SeriveNow could target other areas.""The good thing about this model is we can try things, we can be opportunistic,"" Slootman said. ""If something works, we'll do more. But we can also back out if it doesn't. There are no life-and-death bets. We can be very agile in how we move in or out of adjacent markets.""RELATED:Will Microsoft Stymie Salesforce.com's Stock Turnaround?

124,CRM,"Want to put Fidelity Investments' world-class research resources to work for your retirement accounts and your taxable portfolios? Of course you do.Knowing how the Boston-based asset management giant has deployed the assets of shareholders in its stock mutual funds and balanced funds can help you make decisions about your own buys and sells.For example, in the fourth quarter Fidelity trimmed its exposure to several big technology bellwether stocks. Not all Fidelity funds may act in lockstep, but overall the fund complex lightened its net share count in Facebook (FB) by 5.1%, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF & mutual fund research for CFRA, an independent research firm.Facebook is ranked No. 4 on IBD's Internet-Content industry group, thanks in part to a strong 91 Composite Rating from IBD and 87% average earnings per share growth over the past three quarters. 99 is the highest possible rating, which is on a scale from 1-99.Fidelity's Facebook holding is now at its lightest quarter-end level since the end of 2013, Rosenbluth says in a new report for MarketScope Advisor.Facebook has rallied 16% since the beginning in a year to an all-time high. Subsequent disclosures by Fidelity will reveal whether it's been a buyer of Facebook shares in the current period.The fund complex also trimmed its net share count in Google-owner Alphabet's C-class shares (GOOG) by 5.6% and its A-class shares (GOOGL) by 1.4%. Alphabet has rallied 6% so far this year. It faded after clearing the 816.78 buy point of a flat base on Jan. 23. It's retaken the buy point.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) was a third tech big name to be trimmed by Fidelity. Fidelity also trimmed Salesforce.com (CRM), a provider of customer relationship management software.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia ranks No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group, buoyed by a solid-gold 99 Comp Rating and six straight quarters of EPS growth acceleration. For details, check the stock's vital signs at IBD's Stock Checkup.Still, tech remained Fidelity's biggest sector, accounting for 26% of the fund family's shareholders' money. That was an increase from Sept. 30's 24% and June 30's 23% weighting.And many Fidelity funds, including some of its largest, remained owners of stock in which the overall complex made net trims.For instance, now-$35.3 billion Fidelity Growth Company Fund (FDGRX) held Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft, Nvidia and Salesforce.com in its top 10 at year-end.And there were several tech names in which Fidelity made net increases in its share counts during Q4.Fidelity boosted its share count in software giant Microsoft (MSFT) by 9.3% to 148 million shares. That was the highest share count since the end of 2014, Rosenbluth wrote.That was the highest share count since the end of 2014, Rosenbluth wrote.""A few other stocks that had double-digit percentage share increases include Autodesk (ADSK),"" Rosenbluth told IBD, referring to the developer of computer-aided design software applications.Financials were Fidelity's second-largest sector, with 15% of shareholders' assets. That increase took place as Fidelity increased its exposure to some big U.S. banks.Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) all saw double-digit percentage share count growth, Rosenbluth wrote. He added, ""CFRA thinks investor optimism for banks improved amid expectations for higher interest rates and regulatory reform.""President Trump and Congress are widely expected to lighten the regulatory restrictions on some banks.In addition, Fidelity made a double-digit percentage increase in its share count in Capital One Financial (COF).The $414.3 million Fidelity Blue Chip Value (FBCVX) held Alphabet, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo in its top 10 at year end.Fidelity had a 9% weight in industrials as of the end of Q4. Fidelity managers made a 53% net addition to their share count in aerospace and defense contractor Northrop Grumman (NOC) in the quarter. They added 6.7% to their shares in General Electric (GE).Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon (VZ) were two stocks in which Fidelity managers made double-digit share increases.Tech was not the only space in which Fidelity funds made cuts. Fidelity managers made double-digit decreases to telecom titan AT&T (T), energy explorer and producer Chevron (CVX), medical products maker Medtronic (MDT) and to athletic apparel, footwear and equipment maker Nike (NKE).Each of those decreases appears vindicated at this early point following the quarter. Comp Ratings for each of those stocks current range from an anemic 27 for Chevron to Nike's 59.All of Rosenbluth's data applies to Fidelity's 232 stock and balanced funds (mixtures of stocks and bonds), which together hold nearly $1 trillion in shareholder assets, according to Morningtstar Inc.Fidelity runs an additional 70 funds that hold bonds or commodities, accounting for an additional $233 billion in shareholder money.RELATED:P-s-s-st!

129,CRM,"In the old days, before the iPhone, a financial advisory firms could get away without updating their technology every year, but not anymore. As consumers go mobile, they expect advisors to be up-to-the-minute with the latest technology. Almost everyone uses the web or mobile technology and expects to get info on a 24/7 basis. If an advisor isn't providing that service, they can be sure their competitors are.But with all the tech tools out there, how do advisors sift through the clutter to determine which tech products and systems help financial advisors compete and which ones don't?""When tech works it's great, but not all tech works,"" said Joel P. Bruckenstein, president of consulting firm Technology Tools for Today and founder of the T3 Technology Conference. ""Advisors need a due diligence process to go through. When you use a system without vetting it, it can be embarrassing. You never want to put anything out there without testing it.""IBD'S TAKE: There are many ways to start and improve your financial advisory practice. Check out IBD's Financial Advisor Briefing coverage, which has articles on all topics of interest to FAs.Bruckenstein said common mistakes include advisors not realizing that a review of a technology product might not apply to their situation, and that there is no ""best"" customer relationship management (CRM) software, or any ""best"" technology for that matter. It all depends on your needs, what technology you're currently using, and which custodians you're using.""Advisors need to take everything into context,"" he said.The second thing advisors need to look at is the tech company itself. What is its history? Does it have a record of innovation going back many years or has it been cheap with research and development, which means their products will soon become obsolete.When evaluating new systems, Anthony Schembri says he reads a lot of white papers put out by custodians and third-party vendors. The director of investment operations at Clarfeld Financial Advisors in Tarrytown, N.Y., said he's constantly networking at conferences with other advisors and firms to see what they're using and what they've had success with.Then he talks to the technology experts at his custodian to find out what the top firms are using. Finally, he tries out demos to see which products will integrate with his system. After narrowing it down, he finally has his staff try it out. He said, if they don't embrace it, it will fail.Mark Friedenthal has a three-point checklist he addresses before buying any new technology. The founder of Friedenthal Financial, an RIA in Voorhees, N.J., wants to know if it will do one of three things. One, does it improve operational efficiency? Second, will in assist in business development? That is, will it generate more referrals, increase conversions and increase retentions? Third, will it reduce compliance risk?""Some firms invest in reducing compliance risk,"" said Friedenthal. ""One potential time savings is with regulators, to makes it shorter and smoother, also time savings in litigation. We make investments to reduce that risk. If we are less exposed that is worth something to us.""Finally, he tries to determine the true cost in both cash outlays and time. Will this new technology be worth the anticipated revenue and be more cost effective than alternatives?""Before you buy a new technology make sure the process is sound and that you're not automating something stupid,"" said David Edwards, president of Heron Wealth, an RIA in New York City. ""If you have a bad operations set up or a bad marketing set up, bringing in technology won't make it better.""Edwards makes a commitment to replace his technology every four years, and attends Bruckenstein's conference every February to keep up to date. He also has three criteria for purchasing new technology. First, is it better, faster and cheaper than something he already has. Second, does it integrate with his current system and current custody platform and financial planning platform, which are all tied together. The final criterion is security.""We've had vendors that were not maintaining their platforms with current standards for cybersecurity, which is so important,"" said Edwards. ""All the data that a bad guy needs is neatly packaged inside our systems. We need the highest level of encryption with duel factor authentication.""Bob Thielmann, the chief information officer for Philadelphia broker dealer Janney Montgomery Scott, puts is simply: ""When I look for new tech, we try to assemble the best of breed for a certain niche.""Much like the others, Thielmann wants his new purchase to integrate with everything he already has, eliminate duplicate data, match his firm's security needs and be simple enough that everyone at the firm gets it.RELATED:Advisors Adopt Strategies To Fend Off CompetitorsWhat's The Stock Market Doing Now?

130,CRM,"Hot startup and Microsoft (MSFT) rival Slack Technologies is pushing into the enterprise market, a move that will be closely watched by rivals and potential acquirers like Salesforce.com (CRM) and Cisco Systems (CSCO).Slack and its business messenger app have been valued at more than $3.8 billion, so the company is among the tech unicorns — startups valued at $1 billion-plus. Slack says it has more than 4 million daily active users, with 1.25 million paid.Slack on Monday said it's developing a new version of its communications software for large companies. Slack's team chat app has been popular with businesses with fewer than 100 employees.Microsoft is creating a new office chat app that competes with Slack, while Cisco reportedly also has a rival technology in the works. Microsoft aims to integrate its app with Office 365.IBD'S TAKE: Microsoft is trading near record highs. For a look at companies hitting 52-week highs, listed according to Composite Ratings, regularly check IBD's New Highs list.While Microsoft mulled an offer for Slack before buying LinkedIn last year, Slack makes a good fit for Salesforce.com, says Andrew Bartel, a principal analyst at Forrester Research.""Slack would make sense for Salesforce.com,"" said Bartel. ""Slack is a competitor to Microsoft Office. It would put Salesforce into a new category of communications software.""The Microsoft-Salesforce rivalry has been heating up.Slack has said it would not consider an IPO before 2018. Slack's chat app replaces emails by setting up textual conversations among groups involved in team projects.Slack in late 2016 partnered with Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), which is integrating the chat app with its G Suite cloud collaboration software.Salesforce.com doled out more than $4.6 billion in 2016 making acquisitions, including its $2.8 billion the purchase of e-commerce firm Demandware, which helps companies run their online shopping sites. Salesforce.com backed away from making an offer for Twitter (TWTR).Cisco in January acquired AppDynamics for $3.7 billion, sparking takeover speculation of other software companies, such as New Relic (NEWR) and Splunk (SPLK). AppDynamics provides cloud-based software that measures and analyzes the performance of business critical applications.Shares of Salesforce dipped 0.7% to close at 78.58 in the stock market today. Cisco lost 0.8% to 30.49. Both are relatively close to buy points. Salesforce stock moved up its 200-day moving average in mid-January and is eyeing a buy point of 84.58.

Arete Research speculates that a $73 billion offer by Google could bring Salesforce.com to the negotiating table, says a Bloomberg report. Separately, Arete Research says that a Spotify acquisition by Facebook (FB) also makes strategic sense.Google's cloud computing business lags Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) in the enterprise market — large companies and government agencies.Buying Salesforce.com, also a leader in cloud platform-as-a-service (PaaS), would boost Google, says Arete Research, according to a Bloomberg report. In PaaS, companies such as Salesforce.com and Microsoft sell applications and software that run on cloud infrastructure.Salesforce.com last year selected Amazon Web Services as its public cloud infrastructure provider, in a deal said to be worth $400 million.

ServiceNow has a new partnership with IBM (IBM).""ServiceNow is operating at a very high level as the flywheel of a true multiproduct platform company accelerates,"" said Matthew Hedberg, an RBC Capital analyst, in a report. ""Billings easily beat expectations and accelerated due in part to strong large deal activity, strong cross sell and high renewal rates.""ServiceNow said Q4 profit minus items rose 26% year over year to 24 cents a share, as revenue jumped 37% to $392 million.

For the year, ServiceNow forecast revenue of $1.82 to $1.85 billion vs. consensus estimates of $1.8 billion.Piper Jaffray analyst Alex Zukin maintained a neutral rating on the stock, citing its steep climb of late. ServiceNow stock is up 22% in 2017.""While we believe that the company is well-positioned to execute on its goal of $4 billion in revenue in 2020, we would remain sidelined at current valuation levels pending a better entry point,"" Zukin said in his research report.RELATED:How Cisco's AppDynamics Buy Could Impact New Relic, Splunk, IBM, HPESalesforce.com Stock Rallies In 2017 As Top Software Pick

133,CRM,"Salesforce.com (CRM) aims to more than double its annual revenue to $20 billion, but its shareholders might settle for a different, near-term goal: better stock performance after a disappointing 2016, marked by its first earnings miss in several years.San Francisco-based Salesforce.com seems on track to hit $10 billion in revenue in its fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2018, bolstered by numerous acquisitions. It's expected to end up with revenue of roughly $8 billion for its fiscal 2017 ending Jan. 31, up from just more than $1 billion as recently as 2009.Salesforce.com stock fell 12.6% in 2016, after hitting an all-time high of 84.48 in May, but it's up 15% in 2017, rising a fraction to near 78.73 in the stock market today.What's preventing Salesforce.com's from hitting $20 billion or of being a 2017 comeback stock?In both cases, Microsoft (MSFT) might be the better answer than Salesforce's two longtime top business-software rivals Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP). Increased competition from Microsoft as it integrates business social media platform LinkedIn, acquired last month for $26.2 billion, continues to loom over Salesforce.com.IBD'S TAKE: Microsoft is trading near record highs. For a look at companies hitting 52-week highs, listed according to Composite Ratings, regularly check IBD's New Highs list.It's not all about fighting Microsoft, though, says Andrew Bartel, a principal analyst at Forrester Research.""The real issue is what are the additional product categories that Salesforce.com can add that positions them for growth,"" Bartel said. ""Microsoft is a competitor, but there's more involved in Salesforce.com hitting that $20 billion target.""Salesforce.com's bread and butter remains its cloud software-as-a-service, sold under a subscription model and designed to helps businesses organize and handle sales operations and customer relationships. Software users track deals and manage client interactions.Microsoft, though, has been pushing into the cloud customer relationship management, or CRM, market itself, undercutting Salesforce.com's pricing.Analysts expect Microsoft to bundle more Office 365 and office productivity SaaS software with LinkedIn's enormous database and ""Sales Navigator,"" its sales lead and client interaction tools. Microsoft now can provide more products to help customers generate sales leads and close deals, analysts say.Keith Weiss, a Morgan Stanley analyst, says the Microsoft threat might not be overstated. In a recent research report, Weiss said Salesforce.com continues to add share at the high end of the CRM market. Microsoft, he says, has gained in great part with small and medium-sized companies, mainly at the expense of Oracle and SAP.Weiss says Salesforce.com's strength is its broad offerings that span sales automation, marketing and customer services.Walter Pritchard, a Citigroup analyst, says Salesforce.com's quest to the $20 billion revenue mark depends largely on share gains in marketing and customer services software, two areas where it can leverage its CRM customer base. Salesforce.com's $2.5 billion purchase of Exact Target in 2013 jump-started its move into marketing software.In marketing software, Salesforce.com's main rival is Adobe Systems (ADBE), but Pritchard expects Microsoft to make acquisitions as it aims to recreate the best parts of Salesforce.com.""We see the only way for Microsoft to make enough headway to be competitive with Salesforce.com — and this at the low end of the market — would be to acquire Zendesk (ZEN) and HubSpot (HUBS) — the only assets left with scale in customer service and marketing,"" Pritchard wrote. ""We expect the appetite to do this for the next 12 to 18 months is low, as Microsoft is likely focused on driving value from the purchase of LinkedIn before diving back into meaningful M&A.""Microsoft, though, already has something major that Salesforce rivals Oracle and SAP don't: a fast-growing cloud computing service branded Azure. With Azure, Microsoft is a leader in platform-as-a-service (PaaS), selling applications and software, including business management and database services, that run on cloud infrastructure.Salesforce.com last year selected Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services as its public cloud infrastructure provider. But the partnership could fray like the one-time close Microsoft-Salesforce.com relationship, analysts say. AWS leads in IaaS, infrastructure-as-a-service, with Azure No. 2.The battle between Salesforce and Microsoft is shaping up to be long term. both Microsoft and Salesforce.com are investing heavily in artificial intelligence. Salesforce.com debuted its ""Einstein"" AI initiative late last year.Salesforce.com aims to embed data analytics and ""machine learning"" into its CRM and marketing software, making it easier for customers to automate tasks. Microsoft launched its AI-based Dynamics 365 sales SaaS software late last year.While Salesforce.com has made at least nine AI-related acquisitions, Microsoft has gobbled up startups as well. And Microsoft's R&D budget, at $12 billion annually, is roughly 15 times that of Salesforce.com, estimates Pritchard.Salesforce.com doled out more than $4.6 billion in 2016 making acquisitions, including the purchase of e-commerce firm Demandware, which helps companies run their online shopping sites. At $2.8 billion, Demandware was Salesforce's largest acquisition. Salesforce.com has a cash balance of about $1.75 billion.Although Salesforce.com backed away from a Twitter (TWTR) purchase last year, concern lingers that any large deal would require a big chunk of stock that would dilute the equity of existing shareholders. The bear argument also says acquisitions might be artificially lifting bookings.""A clear management message that it will pause on large deals for the next 12 months … could go a long way in reassuring investors,"" said UBS analyst Brent Thill in a research report analyzing how Salesforce.com ""could be the turnaround story of 2017.""Morgan Stanley, in a report, said it expects ""more of the same"" from Salesforce.com, namely smaller ""tuck-in"" deals. In 2016, smaller deals included marketing data specialist Krux; business analytics platform BeyondCore; and Quip, a developer of a cloud-based word processing app that competes with Microsoft's Office.One startup that could interest Salesforce.com is Slack, says Forrester's Bartel.A list of the company's potential takeover targets, revealed in a resentation to Salesforce's board of directors, leaked in mid-2016. It included ServiceNow (NOW) and Pegasystems (PEGA) as well as much bigger rival Adobe Systems. ServiceNow's core business is software for information technology service management, or ITSM. ServiceNow has expanded into human resources, customer service and security.Salesforce.com last year shot down interest in Adobe, though there could be synergies. Adobe's Marketing Cloud is bigger than Saleforce.com's similar business and ""is expected to continue strong annual growth of 20% in revenue and 30% in bookings through 2018,"" said UBS' Thill.Aside from UBS, analysts from Canaccord Genuity, BTIG Research and Piper Jaffray also have called Salesforce.com, the leader in software-as-a-service, a top stock pick in 2017.Piper Jaffray and Drexel Hamilton, though, say Salesforce.com itself could be a takeover target. But Forrester's Bartel says the ""moment in time has passed"" for a Microsoft purchase of Salesforce.com. The pair reportedly broke off talks in May 2015.Salesforce.com has taken steps to stop relying on Oracle's database technology to run its business software. Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff, a 13-year Oracle executive before he left to start Salesforce, have exchanged numerous barbs over the years.In a Dec. 19 research report, though, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White says, ""Who is to say that Microsoft, Oracle or another large company would not be interested in acquiring Salesforce in the coming years.""RELATED:Salesforce.com Fiscal Q3 Beats, Sales Guidance Top Views, Shares UpMicrosoft Hits Record High On Bullish Reports

139,CRM,"Shortly after Donald Trump was elected, leaders from Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and many others met the president-elect for a cordial tech summit.But that honeymoon is over after President Trump's executive order to temporarily close off the U.S. to refugees and people from seven largely Muslim nations in the Middle East and Africa.Since the order was signed Friday, the tech sector has been particularly vocal in its opposition to the ban compared with other areas of the business world. Apple, Facebook (FB), Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft (MSFT) are among the chorus of firms denouncing the order or expressing concern and support for their employees.Software development company GitHub is reportedly organizing a meeting Tuesday in which tech leaders will discuss filing a friend-of-the-court brief to back a lawsuit against Trump's order.The meeting, reported by Reuters, marks the latest attempt by the tech industry, which has turned to workers outside the U.S. to fill highly skilled positions, to hit back at the ban. The White House says the order is intended to strengthen national security against terrorism, not to target Muslims.But tensions between the White House and Silicon Valley appear likely to become more charged. Bloomberg reported that a draft executive order from the White House would change work-visa programs in an attempt to steer businesses toward American workers when making hires.GitHub has invited Google (whose parent company is Alphabet), Netflix (NFLX), Adobe (ADBE), Salesforce.com (CRM), Box (BOX) and others to attend, according to Reuters. It's not clear which tech firms will send representatives.Amazon and Expedia (EXPE), both based in the Seattle area, have already sent in filings expressing their support for the Washington state attorney general's suit against the ban, and the Council on American-Islamic Relations has filed its own suit, Reuters noted. What lawsuit the companies might get behind is not clear, Reuters said.IBD'S TAKE: Trump's executive order also suspends the Visa Interview Waiver Program, which could slow the visa-renewal process for frequent international travelers, some analysts say, potentially leaving airlines exposed. Apple closed down 0.2% in the stock market today but rose late after reporting strong quarterly earnings and sales, while Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon lost 0.5%, 0.4% and 0.9%, respectively.  Alphabet shares have tumbled below a buy point this week following last week's earnings miss.

Canaccord Genuity recently rated Twilio a buy, while Twilio is a top pick at Drexel Hamilton and William Blair rates the stock outperform.Twilio stock fell 0.18% to 27.89 in the stock market today.Twilio, a once-hot tech IPO, sells cloud-based software that provides real-time messaging services for many businesses to alert clients.

141,CRM,"Silicon Valley, Motown and Wall Street all clashed with Pennsylvania Avenue as President Donald Trump's executive order banning refugees and travelers from seven Muslim nations reverberated throughout the U.S. business world Monday.Trump's Friday signing of the executive order also alarmed executives from big employers including General Electric (GE) and Goldman Sachs Group (GS). A chaotic weekend of protests, emergency court hearings and White House rebuttals left executives with a tricky choice: speak out and risk drawing fire from an outspoken president, or stay silent and face criticism from employees and activists.GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt's response underscored the delicate balance business will have to strike.""We have many employees from the named countries and we do business all over the region,"" he said in an internal email. While he called those staff ""critical to our success,"" he avoided direct criticism of Trump's policy. GE ""will continue to make our voice heard with the new administration and congress and reiterate the importance of this issue,"" he said.""We would never think this would become any kind of an issue,"" Ludwig Willisch, chief executive officer of North American operations at BMW, said at an automotive conference on Saturday. ""This country is a melting pot, freedom of speech, everybody gets together and creates this great country. So, we were not prepared for this kind of thing.""Trump's order shut the door to nationals of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — including refugees, visiting scholars and, at least temporarily, even permanent American residents who happened to be abroad for work or holidays. Confusion reigned in the first 48 hours of its implementation, with border agents and airlines unsure how to interpret the rules.Criticism from pockets of corporate America, which was matched by statements from the leaders of Germany, France, and Canada, stood in stark contrast to the warm words toward Trump just a week ago.Executives at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Switzerland, including AT&T's (T) Randall Stephenson and JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) Jamie Dimon, praised Trump's promises to overhaul corporate taxes and invest in infrastructure. Optimists suggested he would quietly drop pledges to tear up trade deals and reconsider defense commitments to allies.Trump has ""had this extraordinary honeymoon where Wall Street has kind of discounted all the negative aspects,"" Richard Fenning, the CEO of consultancy Control Risks, told Bloomberg Television. As companies react to the migrant ban, ""perhaps that honeymoon is starting to be over,"" he said.The about-face was epitomized by Tesla Motors (TSLA) founder Elon Musk; last week he praised Trump's nominee for secretary of state, former Exxon Mobil (XOM) CEO Rex Tillerson, as a potentially ""excellent"" pick. On Sunday, Musk tweeted that migrants ""don't deserve to be rejected"" and asked his 6.9 million Twitter followers to read the immigration order and suggest changes.Wall Street stayed out of the fray initially. Late Sunday, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein told employees that ""this is not a policy we support,"" criticizing an administration stocked with the firm's alumni, including Steven Mnuchin, Trump's pick to head the Treasury.It creates ""potential for disruption to the firm"" and staff, whom Goldman will seek to assist, Blankfein said in a companywide voice mail. JPMorgan also said it was working to help affected employees.Starbucks (SBUX) CEO Howard Schultz said Trump's move left him with ""deep concern, a heavy heart and a resolute promise."" The coffee chain will redouble efforts to hire as many as 10,000 refugees over five years in 75 countries, he wrote in a note to employees Sunday.Reaction was sharpest from the technology industry, with Twitter awash in reminders that Apple's (AAPL) late co-founder, Steve Jobs, was the son of a Syrian immigrant. Among the first to speak out was Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and himself an immigrant from India, who called the policy ""painful."" Another India-born CEO, Microsoft's (MSFT) Satya Nadella, took to LinkedIn to highlight ""the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, for the world.""Trump should expect sustained challenges from the tech industry in particular, said Ian Bremmer, CEO of political consultancy Eurasia Group, because it differs significantly with him on issues from net neutrality to immigration. ""While most every CEO wants to just 'get back to business' after Trump's election, that's going to prove much harder"" for technology leaders, he said. ""There's going to be a fight.""Compounding business leaders' unease was the order's confused implementation, which included unclear directives on how border agents should treat lawful permanent residents, and contradictory statements about how it would affect those who hold passports from two countries — for example, a dual citizen of Iran and the U.K.Others railing against the ban included Facebook (FB) and Salesforce (CRM), saying it violated the country's principles and risked disrupting its engine of innovation. But Trump's next steps could strike even closer to home: His administration has drafted an executive order aimed at overhauling the work-visa programs technology companies depend on to hire tens of thousands of employees each year.If implemented, the reforms could shift the way American companies like Microsoft, Amazon.com (AMZN) and Apple recruit talent and force wholesale changes at Indian companies such as Infosys (INFY) and Wipro (WIT). Businesses would have to try to hire American first and if they recruit foreign workers, priority would be given to the most highly paid.""Our country's immigration policies should be designed and implemented to serve, first and foremost, the U.S. national interest,"" the draft proposal reads, according to a copy reviewed by Bloomberg. ""Visa programs for foreign workers … should be administered in a manner that protects the civil rights of American workers and current lawful residents, and that prioritizes the protection of American workers — our forgotten working people — and the jobs they hold.""The foreign work visas were originally established to help U.S. companies recruit from abroad when they couldn't find qualified local workers. In many cases, the companies are hiring for highly technical positions in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM.But in recent years, there have been allegations the programs have been abused to bring in cheaper workers from overseas to fill jobs that otherwise may go to Americans. The top recipients of the H-1B visas are outsourcers, primarily from India, who run the technology departments of large corporations with largely imported staff.""Immigrant STEM workers have contributed an outsize share to founding new companies, getting patents, and helping build up American companies, which in turn because of their success have created tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of jobs,"" said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who does research in labor markets. ""Discouraging such people to apply for visas to enter the United States to work — I can't imagine how that can be considered to be in the American national interest.""The Trump administration did not respond to a request for comment on the draft. The proposal is consistent with the president's public comments on pushing companies to add more jobs to the U.S., from technology to auto manufacturing.And in Detroit, automakers are walking a tightrope as they court Trump, whose policies on clean-air standards, corporate taxes and trade will affect their fortunes.They have to balance that against other considerations closer to home: The traditional three U.S. automakers are based in Michigan, which backed Trump's surprise victory but also has a substantial Middle Eastern population troubled by his immigration order.Ford Motor's (F) hometown of Dearborn has been referred to as America's Muslim Capital, with more than 30% of the population of Arab descent. From 2005 to 2015, the state accepted 19,545 refugees from Iraq and Syria — two of the seven countries affected by Trump's ban.""People would say that if you landed here at 9 p.m., you can have a job at 9 the next morning,"" Ibrahim Kazerooni, the imam at Dearborn's Islamic Center of America, said in an interview. ""We have many people in our community who work at Ford. We're a part of this community.""Plans for 26 refugees to immigrate to the Detroit area from Iraq and Syria in the next week have been canceled, said Lynne Golodner, spokeswoman for Samaritas, formerly known as Lutheran Social Services of Michigan, which has a contract with the state to help asylum seekers settle and find employment.Trump took special aim at Ford during the campaign and the automaker has worked to get back in his good graces. Executive Chairman Bill Ford, a great-grandson of the founder Henry, has said he can always get a hold of Trump, or the president calls him. CEO Mark Fields visited the White House on back-to-back days last week to discuss jobs, fuel-economy standards and even Oval Office decor.Still, Ford and its auto-industry peers in the Detroit area have been largely silent on the immigration order. Christin Baker, a Ford spokeswoman, declined to comment. Representatives for General Motors (GM), Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU), Toyota Motor (TM), Nissan Motor (NSANY), Hyundai Motor and Honda Motor (HMC) also passed.""They should be proactive and stand up for the Muslim community,"" Mohammad All, a 26-year-old Ford engineer, said during a protest Sunday at Detroit Metropolitan Airport. He entered the U.S. from Iraq in 1997 after years in a Rafha, Saudi Arabia, refugee camp. ""The stand Mark Fields took was more about helping Ford and the bottom line than about human rights.""

156,CRM,"A lukewarm shopping environment hasn't put a blemish on the beauty industry, which has been the fastest-growing retail segment for the last three years, according to NPD Group.Specialty players Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and LVMH-owned Sephora are flourishing — and value cosmetics brand and recent issue e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) appears poised to take advantage of the on-fire trend.E.l.f., which sells its wares mostly via CVS (CVS), Target (TGT), Ulta Beauty and other national retailers, went public at 17 in late September, rising roughly 70% to about 29 a share as of Wednesday.In an email Q&A with Investor's Business Daily, e.l.f. CEO Tarang Amin outlined his approach to engagement, the significance of its small but growing brick-and-mortar presence, and the company's greatest growth opportunities in 2017.IBD: Social media — Instagram in particular — has become a hot spot for beauty enthusiasts. Following e.l.f.'s Beauty Scape activation, how does social media play into your engagement strategy in 2017, and how do you see that impacting the new loyalty program?Amin: Our approach to engage consumers is deeply rooted in social media and digital platforms, and will continue to be a main pillar of our engagement strategy. We were extremely pleased with the outcome of our e.l.f. Beauty Scape activation, which delivered a 25% increase in Instagram followers and reached a combined community of 53 million across social media platforms. We believe we can further build awareness and deepen engagement with our consumers in different ways, including our new Beauty Squad loyalty program. We enrolled 80,000 consumers in just the first six weeks and look forward to continuing to expand the program as we strengthen our CRM capabilities and deliver more fun, relevant content for our consumers.IBD'S TAKE: What's holding Amazon back from becoming a major player in beauty? For an in-depth look, read: ""Why Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.""IBD: You've previously said that the majority of growth will be driven by your presence in retailers such as Target and CVS? How do you see the sales mix of e.l.f. direct-channel, third-party e-commerce (such as Amazon) and national retailers shifting over the next few years, if at all?Amin: We expect the U.S. to be the largest source of our growth over the next few years as we grow space allocation with existing retailers, increase new customers and grow our direct-to-consumer business through elfcosmetics.com and e.l.f. stores. The majority of our growth will be driven by national retailers, given the white space that we see here in existing doors as well as new doors. That being said, our direct channel plays an incredibly important role in terms of validating our innovation and engaging with our consumers, and we believe there is significant room to grow here as well.IBD: There are fewer than 20 stand-alone e.l.f. brick-and-mortar retail locations. What's the significance of building out a brick-and-mortar presence?Amin: In Q3 of 2016, we opened seven e.l.f. stores, to bring our total to 15, including our first California stores, with two locations in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Our stores showcase a broad assortment of e.l.f. products, create an environment dedicated to play beautifully, and allow us to test and validate new products. We believe our stores provide a great opportunity for us to connect with our consumers in an experiential format, and drive both awareness and engagement.IBD: Cosmetic and skin care products are still selling well, even as other areas of retail have struggled. Do you see interest in beauty peaking any time soon?Amin: We believe that the cosmetics category is highly attractive given its scale, growth dynamics and consumer demand trends. And, given the importance of cosmetics in a woman's daily regimen and the availability of products across price points, the category has demonstrated resiliency through economic cycles. We expect cosmetics to continue to be among the fastest growing and most consistent consumer categories.IBD: What's the biggest area of growth and opportunity for e.l.f. in 2017?Amin: We believe we are in the early innings of growth as we continue to make progress on our four key strategies: Build a great brand, lead innovation, expand brand penetration and drive world-class operations. We continue to see momentum in both our direct channels and leading national retailers, as well as strong operational results and remain excited about our business as we head into 2017.RELATED:How Instagram, Twitter Beauty Selfies Are Changing The Face Of RetailRetailers Face 2017 'Reckoning,' More 'Sad Malls' As Amazon Keeps BoomingWhat's Driving The Success Of 'Un-Amazon-Able' Ulta Beauty?Domino's CEO Doyle On Netflix, Trump And Pizza's 'Jetsons' Future

158,CRM,"Optimism is high for increases in information technology budgets in 2017, with 80% of chief information officers expecting IT budgets to climb, the highest in eight years, says a report from Pacific Crest Securities.Last year, 66% of CIOs expected IT budgets to increase. Of the 80% that expect budget increases in 2017, 28% see an increase of 10% or more.Among large tech companies in a strong position to benefit from IT spending increases are Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), especially as it relates to the public cloud market, the Pacific Crest report said. Amazon and Microsoft are the No. 1 and No. 2 provider of public cloud services, respectively, followed by the Google unit of Alphabet (GOOGL).A separate report from Cowen said Amazon is gaining ground in large retail markets beyond its core markets of electronics and media, putting the e-commerce giant in position for a strong performance in 2017.Spending priorities also remain high in the area of IT security, with Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Fortinet (FTNT) among those standing to benefit. The survey said 58% of CIOs expect security spending to increase, while 42% expect it to stay the same.CIOs also expect to see the continued adoption of software-as-a-service, especially in the area of sales and marketing, giving an advantage to Salesforce.com (CRM), Hubspot (HUBS), Zendesk (ZEN) and Shopify (SHOP). Salesforce last month reported fiscal Q3 earnings and revenue that topped views and also forecast current-quarter and fiscal 2018 revenue above expectations, sending shares up.Among key IT vendors, expect Microsoft, Cisco (CSCO), Oracle (ORCL) and IBM (IBM) to be favored for budget spending increases.Amazon stock fell 0.4% to 767.33 in the stock market today. Microsoft stock dipped 0.6% to 61.01, but remains in buy range from a 58.80 buy point first cleared in late October.

159,CRM,"Cloud software vendor Coupa Software (COUP) has been unable to live up the promise of its huge stock market debut in October. The maker of a cloud-based software platform designed to help companies manage spending, cut costs and boost profitability priced its shares at $18 and rose as high at 41.61 on Oct. 6. It closed that day at 33.28, and then fell to an all-time low of 24.19 on Nov. 1. As of its IPO, the company said it had more than 460 customers, including Salesforce.com (CRM) and Juniper Networks (JNPR), and it listed enterprise software giants SAP (SAP) and Oracle (ORCL) among its competitors, though its services work in conjunction with the enterprise resource planning software platforms provided by SAP, Oracle and others. Coupa says it depends heavily on Amazon's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services to deliver its platform to its customers.Wall Street Q3, Q4 estimates: For Coupa' fiscal Q3 ended Oct. 31, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect a per-share loss minus items of 49 cents on revenue of $31.2 million. For fiscal Q4, analysts model of 23-cent loss on sales of $32.4 million. This will be its first quarterly earnings report, so comparisons aren't readily available. In its IPO prospectus, the company said its revenue for the six months ended July 31 rose 75% from the year-earlier period to $60.3 million. It said it lost $24.3 million in that span, down from a $25.1 million loss in the year-earlier period.Q3 results and Q4 guidance: After the close Monday, the company reported a per-share loss minus items of 22 cents, which it said was down from a $1.54 per-share loss in the year-earlier period.

Oracle, SAP (SA)P, Microsoft (MSFT) and Salesforce.com (CRM) are among companies that could have an interest in Workday, according to media reports over the years.IBD'S TAKE:  Many tech stocks have been hard hit in a second wave of selling since the Presidential election. But nontech companies, like Western Alliance Bancorp, are popping up in the IBD 50 and IBD Sector Leaders. ""We continue to think that Workday's best in class economics will convert into high margins over time,"" MacMillan wrote. ""Workday is an important SaaS (software-as-a-service) asset of scale and could have multiple suitors.""The M&A environment has been active among enterprise software companies.

162,CRM,"Cloud storage company Box (BOX) reports fiscal Q3 earnings after the close Wednesday, with analysts looking for the company to significantly pare its losses while maintaining solidly double-digit growth. The data storage and filing sharing services provider competes with Microsoft (MSFT) in general but also is a partner service available to users of Microsoft's Office 365 productivity suite. Its partners also include Salesforce.com (CRM) and IBM (IBM). ""We believe IBM views its Box partnership as highly strategic and a key component of maintaining customers ...,"" Rosenblatt Securities analyst Marshall Senk said in a pre-earnings research note Wednesday. He said IBM drove 20% of Box's top 40 deals last quarter.Wall Street Q3, Q4 estimates: Analysts expect Box to post a per-share loss minus items of 19 cents for the quarter ended Oct. 31, down from a 31-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect revenue to rise 28% from the year-earlier quarter to $100.6 million. For Q4 ending Jan. 31, they see the per-share loss ex items falling to 16 cents from 26 cents in the year-ago quarter, with sales rising 28% to $108.75 million.Q3 results, Q4 guidance: Per-share loss ex items of 14 cents on revenue of $102.8 million, up 31% from the year-earlier quarter.

164,CRM,"Data, data and more data.Many companies looking to scale-up in today's tech-focused business landscape are creating, manipulating or leveraging data of some kind, and fiber-infrastructure company Zayo Group Holdings (ZAYO) thinks it's at the center of this growing data network.On the company's quarterly earnings call earlier this month, Zayo Chief Executive Dan Caruso touted the company's prospects. He said that with such technologies on the market as augmented reality, cloud computing, data analytics, cybersecurity or — in the near future — quantum computing, there is a huge demand for ""tons"" more bandwidth.""In no scenario does anyone describe there being a technology other than fiber that will be the workhorse of solving for that,"" Caruso said.One of Zayo's largest customers is Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google Fiber, according to Cowen. And with seemingly endless opportunities to expand its clientele on the horizon, Zayo, one of the only independent nationwide owners of fiber assets, wants to make dark fiber its bread and butter.Dark fiber is essentially unused fiber that is controlled by the purchasing company. That segment accounted for almost 30% of total revenue last quarter, with the fattest adjusted earnings margin at 73%.Barclays analyst Amir Rozwadowski says Zayo's standing in the telecom and cloud ecosystem is strengthening because of fiber. When it comes to the cloud, much of the demand in that space is driven by major public cloud providers Microsoft (MSFT) Azure, Amazon (AMZN) Web Services, Salesforce (CRM) and Google Cloud.""The secular demand for fiber remains robust, and management has taken several steps that should position the company well over the longer term,"" Rozwadowski said in a Nov. 9 report.One of the most important steps the company has taken strategically is to beef up its local ground game while continuing its focus on attracting bigger, national customers.""We've changed the way we approach our local dark-fiber opportunities to have strong multifunctional regional teams under regional leaders, for them to work hard in the local markets in all the nooks and crannies of what it takes to exploit those opportunities,"" Caruso said on the call. ""At the same time, you're continuing to be real strong on the more national opportunities that allow us to win the bigger deals and further build out the network.""Zayo also has been aggressive with its capital expenditures, with a focus on fiber. JPMorgan analyst Philip Cusick notes that the company's capital program began to accelerate six to eight quarters ago, with expenditures hitting a new high of $208.3 million in the most recent quarter.""There is no end in sight to Zayo's aggressive build,"" Cusick said in a Nov. 9 report. ""While revenue has lagged given the long lead time of fiber and small cell programs, we are now approaching the end of some projects and should begin to see the fruits of the labor in the next few quarters.""The company's long-term growth prospects have certainly boosted the stock. Its October 2014 initial public offering has been on a steady climb this year, surging more than 75% since hitting an all-time trading low of 19.59 in February.In its latest breakout in September, shares dipped back below the buy point and tested support at the 50-day line before continuing to move higher — similar to action seen among other breakouts this year.The stock hit an all-time high of 35.33 on Nov. 21. Shares ended trading down 1% Monday to 34.70 on the stock market today and are currently 16% past a flat-base entry of 29.86. Once a stock is 20% to 25% past a buy point, that's a signal to take at least partial profits.IBD'S TAKE: While Zayo's stock movement has been strong lately, it still isn't at the top of IBD's computer-networking group. Zayo ranks fourth, with Arista Networks now at the top spot. Shares have been particularly resilient over the past few weeks as the major indexes dropped to nearly four-month lows ahead of the election. And though the company reported a revenue miss when it reported earnings on Nov. 8 — with a 38% gain to $505 million, missing views for $511 million — the stock didn't take much of a hit.Zayo also said in its fiscal first-quarter report that it swung to a profit of 6 cents a share vs. a 6-cent loss last year, beating expectations.But with the bar set high for the company's growth opportunities, analysts have the company's net new-installations figure in focus. For the most recent quarter, Zayo logged $2.3 million in installations, missing forecasts.""We believe the dark fiber business segment has been and will be what gets investors excited about Zayo,"" said Pacific Crest Analyst Michael Bowen in a recent report. ""However, we have seen dark fiber consensus estimates move lower for several quarters in a row.On the call, Caruso set a goal of consistently achieving $3 million in net installations. But how long it will take the company to get there is uncertain, and Barclays' Rozwadowski says ""the potential for accelerating growth seems to be shifting to a mid-to-long-term prospect (as opposed to within the next few quarters).""JPMorgan's Cusick believes Zayo is on track to reach double-digit revenue growth in the next year. He and Rozwadowski agree that record net bookings of $7.2 million last quarter can be used as a measure of healthy growth prospects.""As these bookings are converted to installs, and assuming Zayo's churn levels remain steady, the business could see an increase in its quarterly net install rate,"" said Rozwadowski.Other companies in the telecom-infrastructure space have been making acquisitions. Verizon Communications (VZ) in February agreed to buy XO Communications for $1.7 billion. And last month CenturyLink (CTL) and Level 3 Communications (LVLT) announced a $34 billion cash-and-stock merger deal.Rozwadowski sees the Century Link-Level 3 as another reason that points to ""fiber's rising value proposition to the market.""Caruso isn't concerned about the deal.""It leaves us as the only independent provider who has significant fiber across the broadly defined U.S., with deep, dense fiber network and intercity fiber, and across many of the city routes,"" he said on the call. ""I think that's really good for Zayo.""

165,CRM,"Look for more software partnerships to surface at Amazon.com's (AMZN) annual cloud computing conference this week, says Citigroup.Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing business of the e-commerce giant, will likely announce more products for the enterprise market as it battles Microsoft (MSFT), says Citigroup. Re:Invent, AWS' annual Las Vegas conference, runs from Tuesday through Friday. AWS has forged partnerships in 2016 with Salesforce.com (CRM), a leader in software-as-a-service, as well as VMware (VMW), whose software is widely used in corporate data centers.Rather than unveil products that compete with enterprise software providers, AWS is likely to tout its growing list of partnerships, Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard said in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon.com has dropped out of the IBD Leaderboard, which now includes Freeport-McMo-Ran, Jack-in-the-Box and tech stocks Broadcom, Veeva Systems and Celegene. Holiday season e-commerce activity will be a key for Amazon. ""The tide has shifted in 2016 with more AWS partnering with software vendors,"" wrote Pritchard. ""We believe the market may be overly concerned around impact on Red Hat (RHT), Splunk (SPLK) and VMware.""He noted that Salesforce.com, Splunk, VMware as well as Adobe Systems (ADBE), Autodesk (ADSK) and Intuit (INTU) are slated to take part is RE:Invent sessions.""We expect to hear AWS partnering more to keep up with Microsoft and IBM (IBM) in hybrid cloud deployment,"" Pritchard said.""We expect investor sentiment coming out of re:Invent to continue to focus on its disruptive impact on the enterprise market with significant traction with big-name customers,"" he said.

Shares closed at 77.77, up 3.4%.Salesforce.com stock swooned from July through August as an acquisition spree raised questions over the company's organic growth. Salesforce.com stock is almost exactly even for 2016, with a so-so IBD Composite Rating of 77 out of a possible 99.Salesforce.com's current-quarter and fiscal 2018 revenue guidance eased some concerns, analysts say, although the bear argument says acquisitions might be artificially lifting bookings, a sales growth metric, and making revenue growth look better, too.Steven Ashley, analyst at Baird, maintained an outperform rating on Salesforce.com stock.""Salesforce rebounded from their first ever miss in Q2 with a solid Q3 beat featuring billings growth of 19%, nicely above consensus of 13%, and implied Q4 billings growth guidance of 24% above consensus of 21%,"" Ashley said in a report.

""Guidance for the fourth quarter was above modest expectations.""We continue to hear of increased competitive pressure in the midmarket from Microsoft (MSFT) who now has a (customer relationship management) product that appears 'good enough' and is much cheaper than Salesforce.com.""Salesforce.com's 2016 acquisitions include marketing data specialist Krux for a reported $700 million; business analytics platform BeyondCore; startup Quip, a cloud-based word processing app, for $582 million; and e-commerce platform Demandware for $3 billion.Salesforce.com last month decided against making a bid to acquire social media firm Twitter (TWTR).RELATED:Salesforce.com Fiscal Q3 Beats, Sales Guidance Top Views, Shares UpSalesforce.com M&A Scorecard Raises Questions On Growth, TargetsSalesforce.com Officially Rules Out Twitter Bid

Remember, the typical decline from intraday high to intraday low within a proper handle is 8% to 12%.However, given the market's jitteriness in October to early November, it's understandable to see stocks such Macom, a small cap at $2.5 billion, see bigger shakeouts ahead of a strong breakout.Apple ended up more than 1.4% for the week and as a weekly chart shows, the megacap name also bounced positively off its rising 40-week moving average. You can see the 40-week line only on a weekly chart, but it does to some degree mirror the trend of a 200-day moving average on a daily chart.Apple's RS Rating of 54, as seen in IBD's Stock Checkup tool, is still mushy. You'd like most stocks to see an RS Rating of 80 or higher when they break out. But long bases of a year or more tend to squash the RS Rating down well below the 80 level.As IBD tech writer Patrick Seitz noted in a post earlier this week, Piper Jaffray analysts Gene Munster and Michael Olson told clients in a note that it was time to buy — amid the fear in Apple and other so-called ""FANG"" stocks that was generated by open speculation that President-elect Donald Trump would engage in unfriendly tax and trade policies aimed at the Silicon Valley tech giants.Also in tech, Salesforce.com (CRM) gapped up strong at the open and rose to a session high of 80.37, up nearly 7%, before cutting the gains down to 3% and closing at 77.77. Volume jumped more than 120% its 50-day average level. Despite the stock's reversal, it was a well needed rally for the big-cap software name following weeks of struggle below its 200-day moving average.Interestingly, the 200-day line flattened in October and began to slope mildly higher three weeks ago, a positive sign. For now, the stock needs more time to build the right side of a base that already features numerous sharp sell-offs in heavy volume. Fortunately, the Accumulation/Distribution Rating has improved to a B-, according to IBD Stock Checkup.Late Thursday, the expert in customer relationship management, marketing and sales-related business software posted a 14% increase in earnings to 24 cents a share in the October-ended fiscal third quarter. That marked a second straight slowdown in EPS growth, following gains of 36%, 50%, and 26% in the prior three quarters, but still beat the Wall Street consensus estimate by 3 cents.That 14% profit increase also was the smallest gain since a 10% rise in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 that ended in April 2014. However, prospects of a re-acceleration in EPS growth look good, as the Street sees January-ending Q4 earnings up 32%, to 25 cents a share.New small-cap consumer-stock leader Planet Fitness (PLNT) lost another 1%, to 20, holding above a recent cup-with-handle entry at 19.57.

173,CRM,"Twitter (TWTR) on Tuesday announced new steps to reduce abusive conduct on the microblog, something it concedes is becoming a bigger issue.Success in this arena could help the company once again attract possible suitors.When Salesforce.com (CRM) in September mulled acquiring the company, prodding others to also consider such a move, reportedly Walt Disney (DIS) and perhaps other possible buyers, such as Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL), reportedly backed off in part because of the rising problem of trolls, the nickname given to those who write abusive, bullying and harassing tweets, looking to sow discontent and rile people up.Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff last month said his company would not pursue an acquisition. He didn't give a reason, but analysts thought the lack of user growth at Twitter, and its high price, were the main reasons, though the troll issue continues to weight on Twitter, and all social media.IBD'S TAKE: Twitter has been a laggard stock for going on two years, but it does rate high in some areas. That's nothing to get excited about, but for a comprehensive overview on this, or any stock, IBD Stock Checkup is the place to check.On Monday, both Google and Facebook (FB) said they would ban fake news sites from using their advertising networks, after misinformation online become an issue during the presidential election.""Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property,"" Google said in a statement. Facebook added fake news sites to misleading, disruptive and illegal sites, which are barred from its Facebook Audience Network.Social sites have become ""have become a vital infrastructure for sharing knowledge and information,"" Cornell University professor Drew Margolin said in a statement. He says social media companies should do more to ""define a general standard (that) would inform a coherent set of policies around what can be shared, how filtering and censoring works ... .""In its announcement, Twitter said it would expand its mute option to notifications, so users can mute keywords, phrases or conversations that they don't want to see notifications about. It will also give users a more direct way to report hateful and discriminatory behavior. Twitter said it's also improved its software and ways to remove offensive content and will retrain its support staff about its new policies.In its blog post, Twitter said ""we've had some challenges keeping up with and curbing abusive conduct. We took a step back to reset and take a new approach, find and focus on the most critical needs, and rapidly improve.""Twitter stock dipped 0.8% to close at 18.98 on the stock market today, just above 19. Shares rose as high as 25.25 on Oct. 5, on those takeover rumors, which was an 11-month high.RELATED:Google, Facebook Act Against Fake News Sites

174,CRM,"Hedge fund Jana Partners revealed it took a small stake in Twitter (TWTR), acquiring 2.9 million shares, or less than 0.5%, of the struggling microblog website.Jana Partners is known to be an activist investment firm, so it could push for a sale of the company or for Twitter to make additional reforms.Twitter in late October reported quarterly earnings that topped estimates and announced a restructuring and 9% cut to its workforce. Revenue of $616 million, up 8% year over year, represented the ninth quarter in a row of sales deceleration. The microblog has struggled to recharge user growth.Twitter stock finished trading up 3.2% to 19.14 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Investors should focus on leading stocks, not laggards, even if the latter are ""cheap."" For a view of better-performing stocks, take a look at IBD's Tech Leaders.Twitter rose to an 11-month high of 25.25 on Oct. 5 amid speculation that Walt Disney (DIS), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Salesforce.com (CRM) and even, by some accounts, Apple (AAPL) might make a bid for Twitter. But they all appeared to drop out, with Disney apparently wary of the caustic comments and abuse from Twitter trolls.Salesforce officially ruled out a Twitter acquisition one month ago.In mid-October rumors surfaced that Japan tech giant SoftBank (SFTBY) was interested in buying Twitter. SoftBank is a Japanese telecommunications and internet corporation, with operations that include broadband internet, fixed-line telecommunications and e-commerce.RELATED:Disney Ditches Twitter, But Does Distribution Talk Point To Netflix

175,CRM,"Highflying maker of medical software Veeva Systems (VEEV) saw its shares gap up 11% Wednesday to a buy point, after its earnings and guidance late Tuesday handily beat Wall Street projections, as it continues to expand its product portfolio.With October's addition of EDC, or electronic data capture, to its suite of applications built on the Vault cloud content management platform, the company's total addressable market has now risen to $7 billion, Veeva CFO Tim Cabral told IBD following the earnings release.""We're in the early innings in terms of our opportunity; it's the early innings for some of our largest customers,"" Cabral said.Vault is geared specifically to life sciences companies, which face complex processes in managing drug trials and more. Veeva's fiscal Q3 was the first quarter in which Vault bookings surpassed the company's older CRM, or customer relationship management, products.IBD'S TAKE: Which NYSE and Nasdaq stocks have performed the best in the past 12 months, especially the most recent six? That's where the IBD 50 is your key tool, because those top performers are there. Veeva ranks No. 12 on the latest list, among a bevy of tech companies in the rankings.""A standout driver this year has been the continued strong uptake of new Vault products, which has now grown to represent about one-third of subscription revenue mix, up from 12% two years ago,"" Pacific Crest analyst Brent Bracelin wrote in a research note late Tuesday.Bracelin raised his price target on Veeva stock to 48 from 42. He rates the stock overweight, or buy.Veeva stock closed at 46.30 in the stock market today, hitting its highest price since its October 2013 IPO.""Vault continues to be the primary growth driver,"" Needham's Scott Berg said in his research report, maintaining a buy rating and 46 price target on Veeva stock.Analysts especially liked Veeva's revenue guidance for its fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2018. The company sees sales of about $650 million for that year, vs. Wall Street's $639.4 million estimate. That would be up 20.5% from the midpoint of its fiscal 2017 guidance, which the company hiked, of $539.4 million.""We were pleased with the revenue and operating income guidance, and believe investors will be reassured by management's confidence in continuing to grow the CRM business at 15% and non-CRM (Vault) business at about 100% while delivering margin upside,"" William Blair analysts Amanda Murphy and Bhavan Suri said in a research note. They rate Veeva stock outperform.""There are simply too many 'fans' who are dying to buy this stock the moment the shares dip, and that this dynamic puts the stock in a more or less permanent state of 'expensiveness,' especially based on what will likely be conservative consensus estimates,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis said in his research report. ""We believe VEEV shares are OK to buy here and should the overall market ever correct again, we would view exogenous weakness as a buying opportunity.""The rollout of its clinical data management Vault product next year will bring Veeva into competition with Medidata Solutions (MDSO) and Oracle (ORCL), Davis said. He maintained a buy rating but hiked his price target to 48 from 46.Veeva's main competition, though, is in moving legacy applications to the cloud, says Nitsa Zuppas, its chief marketing officer. The focus on cloud life sciences is simply not there for the big CRM and enterprise vendors, she told IBD.Besides Oracle, Veeva lists Microsoft (MSFT) and EMC, now part of Dell Technologies (DVMT), as among its biggest competitors.Veeva, however, says it counts more than 45 of the 50 largest pharma companies as customers of at least one of its products.Editor's Note: Corrects fourth paragraph to bookings in comparing Vault and CRM.RELATED:Veeva Posts Beat-And-Raise Fiscal Q3

177,CRM,"Walt Disney (DIS) missed fiscal fourth-quarter estimates after the close Thursday on more ESPN subscriber losses, but the media and entertainment giant sees earnings growth picking up in the coming years and some potential easing in ESPN subscriber losses.Earnings per share fell 8% to $1.10, missing views by 6 cents, as revenue slipped 2.7% to $13.14 billion, well short of estimates for $13.52 billion.Management said on the conference call that Disney will see modest EPS growth in fiscal 2017, calling it an anomaly, but more robust gains in 2018 and beyond. Fiscal 2016 was helped by the success of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" which was released in Q1 2016. Wall Street sees EPS growing 5% in 2017, then 11% in 2018 but slowing to 7% after that.Disney was optimistic about its recent investment in the streaming-service provider BAMTech, which will develop a sports streaming service that will show content from ESPN, and said that the causes for ESPN's subscriber losses had ""abated.""Estimates from Nielsen showed that the network had lost 621,000 subscribers in a single month, though Disney has disputed that data.Shares initially fell 3% in late trading in the stock market today but reversed higher to rise 3%.The company this summer said it would take a 33% stake in BAMTech, which was formed by Major League Baseball and was separated from MLB Advanced Media, the league's digital unit, as part of the deal.Disney reportedly flirted with a bid for Twitter (TWTR) recently as a digital distribution play. But, like Alphabet (GOOGL), Salesforce.com (CRM) and other big techs, it ultimately steered clear of that struggling social network. There was also speculation that Disney might want to buy Netflix (NFLX).Disney would not comment on its plans for an acquisition.In Q4, media networks revenue fell 3%, with cable networks revenue falling 7%. Operating income in cable fell 13%, with subscriber declines and higher costs at ESPN weighing. The higher programming and production costs were due in part to Olympics programming and World Cup of Hockey rights. Results from the Disney Channels were also weak.Studio revenue rose 2%, but that was down from a blistering 40% gain in the prior quarter, when Disney got a bump from movies like ""Captain America: Civil War"" and ""Finding Dory."" Operating income in the segment plunged 28% year over year.Parks and resorts revenue rose 1%, with the company's Shanghai Disney Resort helping to offset weakness elsewhere in operating income.While management said that terrorism and a weaker economy had hurt results at Disneyland Paris, Disney said it expected its new Shanghai Disney Resort to roughly break even in fiscal 2017.RELATED:John Malone Talks Up Apple Buy Of Disney, Likes AT&T StrategyTwitter Jumps Late On Report Disney Revives Takeover InterestNetflix Stock Gets Superhero Boost From Disney Takeover Talk

178,CRM,"Cloud software maker HubSpot (HUBS) saw its shares approach a buy point, and an all-time high, before reversing, as analysts said its analyst day Wednesday was spot-on, giving the company good reviews.HubSpot stock rose as much as 2.2% in early trading in the stock market today, but shares then fell more than 1% before ending the day up 1.4%, at 57.55. The shares have a possible buy point of 60.07, and HubSpot stock peaked at 60.11 last December.""We continue to view HUBS as a core cloud holding, and believe its full suite approach will allow it to continue taking share in the competitively open SMB front-office software space,"" UBS analyst Brent Thill said in a research report, maintaining a buy rating and 65 price target on HubSpot stock.The Cambridge, Mass.-based company provides marketing software designed to help mostly small and midsize businesses (SMB) better use social media, blogs and search engines to attract and retain customers.IBD'S TAKE: HubSpot went public in October 2014, pricing shares at $25. It's proved to be a good IPO, but which have been the best? IBD's IPO Leaders gives investors the rundown on top IPOs, crucial because many of the biggest stocks run-ups come from companies that have gone public within the past three years.  HubSpot's main theme, said Thill, is that it's making ""its first real distribution push to sell its sales products in combination with core marketing, where it will allow both its inside sales forces and its agency partner channel to sell the full suit — we believe that this will be a tailwind to help sustain strong top-line growth rates for the foreseeable future.""A new partnership with Facebook (FB) includes integration with Facebook ads expected to roll out early next year is a big plus, Pacific Crest analyst Brent Bracelin said in a research note late Wednesday. And he says the same about HubSpot's integration with LinkedIn (LNKD), which Microsoft (MSFT) is in the process of acquiring.""HubSpot is evolving into the modern front office for SMBs,"" wrote Bracelin, who has an overweight rating and 67 price target on HubSpot stock.HubSpot stock has more than doubled since early February, when the overall market hit an early-2016 downturn. One catalyst, though, is that HubSpot occasionally pops up in M&A speculation, with possible buyers mentioned including No. 1 cloud business software vendor Salesforce.com (CRM).In a recent report, Goldman Sachs analyst Jesse Hulsing said ""we expect M&A to remain a major factor in the sector,"" speaking of growing software companies.RELATED:Goldman Initiates On HubSpot With Buy RatingPacCrest Positive On SaaS Market, Hikes PT On HubSpot

180,CRM,"WeWork built its brand on the hustling energy of small startups, but the company is finding that boring corporate giants may be finally ready to embrace the idea of renting a desk next to a stranger.In the last year, WeWork has established a new team that caters to the needs of large companies. The New York startup, which keeps citrus spa water and beer kegs at the ready for its co-working customers, woos them with a hip, bustling workplace crowded with entrepreneurs and inspiration.WeWork said 14% of its 80,000 members are employed by a company with 500 or more employees. The list includes privately held tech icon Dell and consultant McKinsey & Co., as well as customer relationship software maker Salesforce.com (CRM). Of the world's 500 most valuable companies, 52 have employees working out of a WeWork. A year ago, fewer than five did.Tech giant Microsoft (MSFT) is the latest to sample the co-working craze: It will move 300 employees into two WeWork spaces in Manhattan during the coming months. The group totals 70% of Microsoft's Office 365 sales team in New York.Microsoft is also moving its 37-person Atlanta-based advertising team into a co-working building. The company is hoping to ""feed off the energy at every WeWork location you feel when you walk in,"" said Matt Donovan, general manager of office marketing at Microsoft.At 6 years old, WeWork is ahead of most kids its age. Investors valued the company at $16 billion this year to fuel an aggressive expansion into Asia. But WeWork must find ways to continue growing at home. The company slashed 2016 profit and revenue forecasts in an April review document and cut about 7% of staff in the summer.Larger companies may make more lucrative — and stable — customers. They're more willing to make long-term commitments than WeWork's traditional base of startups and freelancers. For example, Microsoft agreed to keep its Atlanta space for at least three years, said Dave Fano, the chief product officer at WeWork. He said WeWork offers discounts in exchange for longer contracts.""We still don't want to force commitments,"" Fano said. ""But obviously they are beneficial to us, so we want to provide incentives.""WeWork's focus on larger companies is altering how it approaches new locations.""The way we're starting to program the buildings when we develop them is changing: We're starting to bake in bigger inventory,"" Fano said. ""Buildings are coming online now with 50-person offices, 100-person offices.""RELATED:WeWork Cuts Forecasts As Staff Told To Change 'Spending Culture'

184,CRM,"Moderating growth sent Paycom Software (PAYC) crashing Wednesday, after the company late Tuesday posted Q3 earnings that beat Wall Street expectations but confirmed its slowdown.Paycom, a maker of HR and payroll processing software-as-a-service, targets companies in the 50-to-2,000-employee range, and it found a lucrative niche in helping companies comply with the complexities of the Affordable Care Act, known as ObamaCare. With many companies now squared away on the ACA, growth is slowing. Paycom's focus on smaller businesses has kept it out of the crosshairs of HR software giants such as Salesforce.com (CRM) and Workday (WDAY).Analysts differed with Paycom investors, saying the ACA slowdown was expected. Pacific Crest hiked its price target on Paycom stock to 57 from 55, while Credit Suisse raised its PT to 56 from 51. Both maintained the equivalent of buy ratings on the fast-growing company's stock.But Paycom stock ended trading down 16% to 43.70 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: It might not be so high for long, but Paycom ranks a heady No. 2 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks over the past year. The current list has everyone from tech giant Facebook to small Stamps.com, and it's well worth tracking to find stock winners.For Q3, Paycom posted still-strong 40% year-over-year sales growth, topping analyst estimates, but that was its smallest growth since Q2 2o14. And for Q4, it forecast 32% year-over-year growth, which would be its least in at least four years.The company also forecast Q4 adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of $14 million to $16 million. That would be down from $18.2 million in Q3, though that Q3 figure marks a strong 69% gain from Q3 2015.""Paycom is beginning to anniversary the ACA benefit, which is well understood, in our view,"" Pacific Crest analyst Brent Bracelin said in his research note late Tuesday. ""What is less well understood is that revenue beats and raises may be more modest going forward. Paycom's profitability should support its valuation.""He maintained his overweight rating on Paycom stock.Said Credit Suisse analysts in their research note Wednesday: ""We view PAYC shares as attractive due to: (1) the company's disruptive comprehensive HCM (human capital management, or HR) suite and cloud-based, single database architecture; (2) our belief that PAYC will continue to increase its market share of the large and growing outsourced payroll/HCM software market; and (3) our expectations for strong, sustainable ANRR (annualized net recurring revenue) growth driven by maturing sales offices productivity increases and aggressive new sales offices expansion. ...""RELATED:Paycom Software Posts Q3 Beat But Shares FallPaycom Profile: Keeping It Simple

187,CRM,"Longtime financial advisors marvel at how their business has evolved over the years. They serve more sophisticated clients, choose among an ever-expanding menu of investment products and face myriad compliance issues. But perhaps the greatest change has come from advances in technology.Today's financial advisors harness technology to enhance almost every aspect of their practice. They use customer relationship management (CRM) systems to collect client data and spur communication. They opt for financial planning software to help clients track their portfolios.And they invest in cloud-based data storage to access documents and encrypt them to ward off hackers.In addition, advisors favor simple, timesaving tech tools to boost their efficiency. These low- or no-cost apps include appointment setting software such as ScheduleOnce, online meeting programs such as TeamViewer, electronic signature tools such as DocuSign and even mileage trackers such as MileIQ to calculate miles driven for business purposes.As these tools proliferate, three challenges arise. First, advisors wind up spending more time sifting through their options. Evaluating products and services can become a full-time job in itself.Second, new technology requires education and training. Advisors' employees and clients face a learning curve as they fiddle with new systems and grow to accept and trust them.Finally, integrating wide-ranging tech platforms into a seamless system can prove frustratingly hard for advisors. Almost every tech vendor boasts about its feature-rich integrations with CRM, performance reporting software, Web-based conferencing and other online channels. But easy access to a central dashboard via a single log-in remains an elusive goal for many users.""The holy grail that everyone aims for is to streamline the data that flow back and forth from all the vendors so that they work as a team,"" said Tim Watters, a certified financial planner in Paramus, N.J.At its best, a new tech tool produces almost immediate returns on an advisor's investment. From saving time to improving client service, technology can upend traditional processes. Indeed, many advisors are establishing formal and informal partnerships with robo-advisory firms to help meet clients' needs and to help save time and costs of delivering investment advise.Watters, 57, has sought to improve his firm's use of technology in recent years. His openness to testing new products helps him discover promising breakthroughs.After using what he calls ""simplistic"" trading systems, he switched to Total Rebalance Expert auto-rebalancing software in 2011. He estimates that it saves him about five hours a week in planning and executing trades.""It has standardized my process, it's scalable and it lets me streamline our models better for the client's benefit,"" he said. ""It also helps us manage clients' tax liability more effectively to avoid wash-sale rules, sell the highest-cost trade lots first and watch out for short-term gains.""Advisors who work for large firms often rely on their information-technology support team to make wise buying decisions. But sole proprietors shop on their own.""I want tools that I can put to use right away without breaking the bank,"" said David Haas, a certified financial planner. Before becoming an advisor in 2012, Haas worked as a software engineer in the telecom industry.Haas, 56, started his own one-person firm in 2015. He's determined to harness technology to his advantage while keeping a close eye on costs.""With the advisors I've seen, they aren't tech-savvy on the whole,"" he said. ""They've been doing things a certain way and it can be difficult to change.""In establishing his own practice, Haas decided to splurge on website design. Rather than use what he calls ""a cookie-cutter approach with a little bit of customization,"" he hired an outside designer to produce a more ambitious result.""I want our website to look different and I want to control more of the content and its look and feel,"" said Haas, who runs Cereus Financial Advisors in Franklin Lakes, N.J. ""I think it's important to have a live, informative website that engages people, as opposed to a dead website that never changes.""Haas raves about an app called FullContact that provides a cloud-based address book. He uses it to store business cards.""It feeds right into my CRM,"" he said. ""I used to have stacks of business cards and I'd struggle to remember where I met people. Now it's easy to process every new business card I get.""Learning how to effectively use social media tools such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn link is also a must for a growing number of advisors.To maximize their use of technology, some advisors view their vendors as partners. Rather than simply purchasing a tech tool and then trying to make it work, these advisors strike up an ongoing relationship with their tech providers.Makers of tech wares usually welcome such dialogues with their customers. They crave feedback and strive to incorporate client input into new product releases.Timothy Brennan, an advisor in Pembroke, Mass., cites such tools as eMoney Advisor, the financial planning software he uses. He says that eMoney representatives respond to his ideas and suggestions.""Certain tech tools are continuously improving,"" he said. ""I find that the best technologies make it more convenient for you and for your client, and the vendors listen to you.""Like many advisors, Brennan has learned to look beyond the bells and whistles that accompany a new, much-hyped technology. When assessing a new product, he asks himself two questions: ""Will I use it?"" and ""Will it provide value to my clients and my practice?""""Early on, I spent money on stuff I didn't really use,"" he admitted. ""Don't get drawn into a cool technology just because it looks cool.""For example, he bought expensive office management software that included an online schedule feature that he liked. He subsequently realized that the software offered far more than he needed, so he found a basic scheduling tool at a much lower cost.Stepping into the client's shoes helps as well. Technology that impresses you may not necessarily resonate with your clients, whether they're tech-savvy millennials or from more digitally challenged generations.Ben Malick, an advisor in Grain Valley, Mo., used to send clients an elaborate financial report generated by his eMoney software. But he noticed that most clients didn't review it closely.""It looks great to me, but they don't even look at all the numbers and Monte Carlo simulations,"" he said. ""They just want to know what they need to do.""RELATED:Financial Advisor Guide: Jumping In, Gliding OutFinancial Advisor Guide: OutsourcingFinancial Advisor Guide: Niche Play

188,CRM,"Struggling Twitter (TWTR)  reported quarterly earnings Thursday morning that topped estimates and announced a restructuring and 9% cut to its workforce. Shares opened higher but gains quickly faded.Twitter said the restructuring would focus mainly on reorganizing its sales, partnerships and marketing efforts, ""intended to create greater focus and efficiency to enable Twitter's goal of driving toward GAAP profitability in 2017,"" the company said.Twitter posted quarterly revenue of $616 million, up 8% year over year and above the consensus estimate of $606 million. It was the ninth quarter in a row of revenue deceleration. It reported earnings per share of 13 cents, topping the consensus of 9 cents, as polled by Thomson Reuters. Twitter did not provide specific guidance for the fourth quarter.Twitter rose as high as 18.12, but closed up just 0.6% at 17.40 on the stock market today.

Alphabet (GOOGL), Walt Disney (DIS), Salesforce.com (CRM), Softbank (SFTBY) and even Apple (AAPL) were reported as possible suitors, sending Twitter as high as 25.25 on Oct. 5. But they all decided to give the microblog a pass.

190,CRM,"Twitter (TWTR) shares rose late after a report that Walt Disney (DIS) is once again interested in buying the struggling social network.The website Betaville reported, citing sources, that Twitter and Disney are ""thrashing out a deal"" after agreeing on a price ""thought to be in the high 20s per share"" late last week.Later, Benzinga, citing a source ""familiar"" with the matter, downplayed the ""chatter"" and questioned the source.Twitter shares rose 3.2% to 17.82 in late trading on the stock market today. But that followed the 4.3% regular-session decline to 17.26 amid a report of big job cuts this week. Twitter rose as high as as 25.25 on Oct. 5, the best since December 2015, amid  speculation that Disney, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Salesforce.com (CRM) and even, by some accounts, Apple (AAPL), might make a bid for Twitter. But they all appeared to drop out, with Disney apparently wary of the caustic comments and abuse by Twitter trolls.Yet Disney CEO Bob Iger has made no secret of his desire to boost Disney's digital distribution channels.Meanwhile, Apple CEO Time Cook, on the tech titan's post-earnings conference call late Tuesday, said the iPhone maker is ""open to acquisitions of any size that are of strategic value.""

191,CRM,"Third-quarter earnings per share at ServiceNow (NOW) viewed by some as possible a takeover target of Salesforce.com (CRM), are expected to pop 38%, continuing its trend of rising earnings. The company posts Q3 earnings after the close Wednesday.The enterprise software provider — along with Pegasystems (PEGA) and Tableau Software (DATA) -- was among companies listed in a score card of possible Salesforce.com acquisitions that surfaced this month, after Salesforce said it would not bid for microblog Twitter (TWTR), amid much speculation. The list also included HubSpot (HUBS) and Adobe Systems (ADBE).ServiceNow's Q3 EPS minus items is expected to jump 38% from the year-earlier quarter, to 21 cents. That would be up from 15 cents in Q2 and 9 cents in Q1. The company, which went public in 2012, didn't notch its first positive EPS ex items number until Q3 2013, at a penny, and only last year recorded its first EPS ex items in the black.Revenue growth, though, is slowing. Analysts expect Q3 year-over-year revenue growth of 35% to $352 million, slowing from 38% in Q2 and 44% in Q1.In the December quarter, analysts estimate 32% revenue growth to $378 million and EPS ex items growth of 14% to 22 cents.

192,CRM,"Twitter (TWTR) may cut some 300 workers, or 8% of its workforce this week, Bloomberg reported, citing sources, as the  social network's growth and possible bidders dry up.The struggling social network may announce the cuts before its earnings report Thursday, Bloomberg said, stressing that the actual number hasn't been decided. Twitter on Monday moved up its third-quarter earnings report to before the market open from after the close.Earnings per share are expected to fall 10% vs. a year earlier to 9 cents, with analysts also forecasting EPS declines in Q4 and Q1 2017. Revenue should rise about 6% to $606 million. That would be the ninth straight quarter of decelerating revenue growth, from 124% in Q2 2014.Those growth woes are why Twitter's board was open to takeover bids. But while Alphabet (GOOGL), Walt Disney (DIS), Salesforce.com (CRM) and even Apple (AAPL) were reported as possible suitors, sending Twitter as high as 25.25 on Oct. 5. But they all bowed out. Walt Disney and Salesforce, in addition to concerns about Twitter's price tag, apparently worried about Twitter's reputation for vicious comments.IBD'S TAKE: Investors should focus on leading stocks, not laggards, even if the latter are ""cheap."" Bigger, stronger Facebook broke out to a new high on Monday, in buy range.Twitter did pop 7% on Friday on a report that Japan's Softbank (SFTBY), fresh off its ARM Holding takeover, might be interested.Twitter fell 0.3% to 18.03 on the stock market today.RELATED: Twitter Spikes On Reports SoftBank Is Considering Acquisition BidSalesforce.com Officially Rules Out Twitter BidDisney, Salesforce Didn't Bid On Twitter Because Of 'Haters'

193,CRM,"Microsoft (MSFT) stock climbed to an all-time high Friday after the software giant late Thursday posted better-than-expected September-quarter results on strength in its cloud computing businesses.Microsoft stock jumped as much as 5.6% to 60.45 on the stock market today, ending the day up 4.2%, at 59.66.IBD'S TAKE: Microsoft shares have been building a flat base over the past 39 days, with a possible buy point of 58.80. For more details on Microsoft stock, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Microsoft earned 76 cents a share excluding items, up 7% year over year, on sales of $22.33 billion, up 3%, in its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Microsoft to earn 68 cents EPS on sales of $21.71 billion. Microsoft has a reputation for conservative guidance.Microsoft beat forecasts thanks to its cloud offerings, which include Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics CRM Online.""Microsoft's strength in cloud is about more than shifting on-premise workloads to the cloud,"" Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brent Bracelin said in a research report. ""Microsoft benefits from customers moving production workloads, but the larger benefit is increased use of new services, such as Service Fabric, microservices and serverless infrastructure.""Bracelin says the big three in cloud computing — Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft and Salesforce (CRM) — will get bigger and capture the lion's share of spending in the category.Meanwhile, Microsoft's More Personal Computing unit saw sales decline 2% to $9.3 billion in Q1. In addition to Windows PC software and Surface computers, the unit includes Xbox video games and internet search advertising.Microsoft did not give an EPS target for fiscal Q2, but forecast sales of $25.05 billion, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Wall Street had been modeling Microsoft to earn 79 cents a share minus items, up 1.3%, on sales of $25.84 billion, up 0.6%, for the December quarter.Microsoft's Q1 results made believers out of some skeptics on Wall Street. Wunderlich Securities upgraded Microsoft stock to buy from hold and raised its price target to 70 from 60. William Blair analyst Jason Ader upgraded Microsoft stock to outperform from market perform.Microsoft stock received at least nine price-target hikes post-earnings.Jefferies analyst John DeFucci, however, remains on the sidelines, continuing to rate Microsoft stock underperform. He says Microsoft stock is ""grossly overvalued,"" and has a target price of just 43.RELATED:Microsoft Signs Deal With Workday, Ramps Up Cloud Partnerships

194,CRM,"Twitter (TWTR) rallied in the stock market late Friday on rumors that Japan tech giant SoftBank (SFTBY) is interested in buying the struggling company, after other possible buyers reportedly have decided to give the microblog a pass.Twitter stock, after hitting a low of 16.73 midday, spiked from that point to close at 19.09, up 7%, on the stock market today.Walt Disney (DIS), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Salesforce.com (CRM) are among the companies said to have considered acquiring Twitter. They've all reportedly decided against pursuing a deal, in part because of the social network's ongoing problem of finding a way to deal with abusive posts and comments.At the peak of the Twitter buyout buzz, Twitter's market cap was nearly $18 billion. It's currently valued near $13 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Alphabet is among the internet giants currently finding a home on the IBD Big Cap 20 list of large companies still capable of outsize gains. See who else makes the list.SoftBank is a Japanese telecommunications and internet corporation, with operations that include broadband internet, fixed-line telecommunications and e-commerce. In July, SoftBank last month completed its $31 billion acquisition of U.K.-based ARM Holdings, a top designer of chips used in mobile devices. SoftBank also owns a majority stake in U.S. wireless services provider Sprint (S).Twitter is slated to post Q3 earnings after the close Thursday.RELATED:Salesforce.com Officially Rules Out Twitter BidDisney Ditches Twitter, But Does Distribution Talk Point To Netflix

195,CRM,"Spending on research and development has leveled off as companies increase stock buybacks and dividends, says Goldman Sachs, but some companies do better than others in getting the most bang for their R&D buck.In a new research report, Goldman names companies that it says are ""best positioned to make their R&D dollars work.""Making that list are: Align Technology (ALGN,) Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), GrubHub (GRUB), Incyte (INCY), Universal Display (OLED), Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN).Meanwhile, Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon and drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) lead the way in total R&D spending. Goldman Sachs, though, also analyzed R&D intensity (measured as percentage of sales) and other metrics.Since 2005, ""Regeneron, Salesforce.com (CRM), Apple (AAPL), Amazon and Netflix (NFLX) have experienced outsized growth when it comes to gross profit and R&D, as well as price returns over the same period,"" said the Goldman report.IBD'S TAKE: Of Goldman Sach's R&D favorites, Palo Alto Networks belongs to the IBD 50, where you can learn about many growth stocks. GrubHub sports a highest-possible Composite Rating of 99, while Align Technology has a CR of 97. Composite Ratings are part of CAN SLIM Investing.""R&D's share of the total spend pie has been pretty stable since 2010, suggesting that corporations have likely been in maintenance mode with their R&D spend as opposed to being in expansion mode,"" said the report.Tech companies lead in R&D spending, followed by the health care, consumer discretionary and industrials sectors, says Goldman.RELATED:Do You Tend To Buy Stocks Too Late?

196,CRM,"A Salesforce.com (CRM) score card for possible acquisition targets, as of May, included ServiceNow (NOW), Pegasystems (PEGA) and Tableau Software (DATA), but not Twitter (TWTR).The list of potential targets, part of an emailed presentations to Salesforce's board of directors, were among hacked emails belonging to former Secretary of State Colin Powell, a Salesforce.com director. The Wall Street Journal late Tuesday reported the email breach and  M&A targets, which it said was published in September in a ""hacktivists"" website called DCLeaks.While the leaked, 60-page presentation to Salesforce.com's board in May also included HubSpot (HUBS) and Adobe Systems (ADBE).In an email to IBD seeking comment, a Salesforce.com spokesperson shot down interest in Adobe, best known for Photoshop and other software for creative professionals such as graphics artists.""Salesforce has a disciplined and thoughtful M&A process where we routinely survey the industry landscape across a wide range of companies, but acquire very few. The presentation is a broad survey of publicly traded companies in May 2016, and the appearance of company names on the list doesn't imply Salesforce ever intended to acquire them,"" the Salesforce.com email said.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Salesforce.com rebounded last week after the company CEO ruled out a bid for social media firm Twitter. Shares in Adobe have climbed 13% in 2016, as its cloud strategy jells, making it a member of the IBD Big Cap 20 list of top-performers among the biggest companies. See what other companies, including one other software maker, are on the list.One worry among analysts is that Salesforce.com's core growth could be slowing faster than expected, forcing management to look at acquisitions aggressively. But other analysts said many big companies often are active in such practices.""Given CRM has stated it looks at everything, we think this is a natural list, excluding Adobe,"" Alex Zukin, a Piper Jaffray analyst, said in a research report.Salesforce.com has been on an acquisition spree, spending some $3.4 billion over the summer. One analyst speculated that out of the leaked potential targets, ServiceNow might be the best fit for Salesforce.com. Analysts said the price could range from $97 to $139 per share.ServiceNow stock rose 3.6% to 78.92 trading in the stock market today. Shares peaked in December, at 91.28. Pegasystems shot up 8.2% to 32.35, while Tableau leapt 3.6% to 48.91.Salesforce stock was flat Wednesday. ServiceNow has a market cap near $12.5 billion, compared with $50 billion for Salesforce.""We think a combination of Salesforce.com and ServiceNow makes sense on multiple levels and we would not be surprised if something materializes over the next couple of years. Its (ServiceNow's) scale, growth rates and attractive metrics will be preferred by Salesforce.com,"" Abhey Lamba, an analyst at Mizuho Securities, said in a report.In the email to IBD, the Salesforce.com spokesperson said that ""Adobe appeared only as a benchmark to provide context.""Other companies on the Salesforce.com M&A score card included Workday (WDAY), Box (BOX) and Zendesk (ZEN).Salesforce.com had been interested in acquiring LinkedIn (LNKD), but the social network this year instead reached an agreement to be acquired by Microsoft (MSFT) for $26 billion.Salesforce.com in early October agreed to buy marketing data specialist Krux for a reported $700 million.Salesforce.com in August purchased business analytics platform BeyondCore. In July, Salesforce.com bought startup Quip for $582 million.

197,CRM,"In the Walt Disney (DIS) classic, ""Peter Pan,"" the hero urges the audience to believe to bring Tinkerbell back to life. One can only imagine how a #SaveTinkerbell hashtag would go over with the trolls on Twitter (TWTR).Twitter's nasty reputation is a key reason why Walt Disney and Salesforce.com (CRM) reportedly backed off making bids for the social network.CNBC's Jim Cramer said Monday that one reason why Salesforce passed on Twitter because the social network has a problem with abusive posts and comments.""A lot of the bidders are looking at people with lots of followers and seeing the hatred,"" Cramer said on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, adding that Twitter's ""filter filters out a very small amount of the haters, and I know that the haters reduce the value of the company.""Walt Disney had similar qualms, according to a Bloomberg report after the close on the stock market today.  Disney had hired investment bankers to mull a bid, but Twitter's bullying and other nasty content helped convince the media giant to pass, Bloomberg said, citing sources.Other considerations turned off would-be suitors. Salesforce shares sold off hard on Twitter takeover talk, with major investors urging CEO Marc Benioff not to make a bid. Walt Disney, along with rumored possible acquirers Apple (AAPL) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), could have afforded a Twitter purchase, but it's would have been cheap.IBD'S TAKE: Walt Disney, seeking digital distribution, has also been linked to Netflix takeover talk. Netflix earnings and subscriber growth easily beat Q3 forecasts late Monday, sending shares soaring after the market close.At the peak of the Twitter buyout buzz, the company's market cap was nearly $18 billion, with the sense that an actual price tag would be higher. Even with the stock's recent dive, Twitter is valued at $11.8 billion.Twitter shares sank 0.9% to 16.73 on Monday. Salesforce fell 1.9% after soaring more than 5% on Friday. Disney dipped 0.5% to an 8-month closing low. Apple edged down 0.1% to 117.55, near 2016 highs.RELATED:Salesforce.com Relief Rally Rages As Twitter Stock FallsPinterest User Growth Shows Strength In Face Of Twitter, FacebookSnapchat Said To Select Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs To Lead IPO

198,CRM,"Like many professional service providers, financial advisors tend to enjoy interacting with clients and solving their problems. But they dread the paperwork.Completing forms accurately and promptly demands ongoing diligence. And compliance requirements elevate paperwork from an important nuisance to an essential element of a successful financial advice practice.Tackling administrative and support tasks, such as filing and archiving digital communications, can seem manageable for advisors who are just starting out. But as a practice grows, high volume can put your paperwork systems and procedures to the test.Technological advances are leading some independent advisors to go paperless. But the initial investment in time and money — and the learning curve associated with transitioning to online communications and documentation — remains an obstacle for many financial planners.""I don't like paperwork,"" said Dan Carter, an advisor in Oxnard, Calif. ""I'm more of an extrovert. But we have to do all the paperwork in a timely manner for our clients.""In his 18 years as an advisor, Carter has learned to delegate support tasks to a reliable assistant who has a keen eye for detail. When meeting new clients, Carter introduces his assistant — who's also his wife — as a key member of his team.""That way, they get to know her and she builds rapport with them,"" he said.Carter uses Dropbox, a cloud-based file-sharing and storage service, to leave notes for his assistant. She checks them daily and follows through, often by submitting client data to third parties, such as insurers.In working with financial institutions and insurance companies on behalf of his clients, Carter knows that paperwork errors can occur despite his best efforts. When his assistant gets backed up and he completes client forms, he can hit a few temporary roadblocks.""Sometimes I fill out a new client application and it gets kicked back to me,"" he said. ""It's almost like a tennis game.""Rather than enter client information multiple times in multiple fields, for example, Carter may provide it in the first section of the application and then write ""See Section 1"" when asked for the same data again. That rarely works.""They don't like that,"" he said. ""They don't want to fill out my paperwork for me.""In 2014, Carter stumbled when trying to help his clients — a wealthy married couple — apply for life insurance. The carrier's medical underwriters repeatedly attempted to schedule a meeting with the couple to no avail.""Some of it was our fault,"" he admitted. ""We weren't on top of it and we didn't follow it all the way through. The process took three to four months, and I got weary of apologizing.""Carter wound up losing the clients. But he tightened his procedures after the incident and now monitors communications with insurers more closely.The simplest paperwork tasks can pose some of the greatest challenges. Every year, advisors track the required minimum distribution (RMD) that certain clients must withdraw from their retirement accounts. It's straightforward, but problems can erupt.Robert Braglia, a certified financial planner in New York City, cites a rare case when he realized belatedly that he didn't prepare for a client's RMD well before the Dec. 31 deadline.""It created last-minute stress,"" he said. ""Now I have a spreadsheet with every client that has a RMD. I'm ready as the fourth quarter rolls around.""As an advisor's practice grows, the office staff's role grows as well. Managing the many details of client accounts demands clear communication among an advisory firm's employees.Michael Resnick, a certified financial planner in Deerfield, Ill., appreciates the value of completing paperwork with accuracy and timeliness. In his five years as an advisor, he has sought to continually refine his internal processes to prevent paperwork errors.About three years ago, Resnick helped a client purchase a large life insurance policy. He asked his assistant to fill out the application.""The owner of the policy was supposed to be my client's trust,"" Resnick recalled. ""But my assistant mistakenly made my client the owner.""Resnick caught the error at the last minute and fixed it. But had the mistake gone unnoticed, it could've triggered adverse tax consequences for the client.""After that, we changed how we communicate,"" he said. ""I learned when I ask an assistant to do something, I need to be very clear on the circumstances behind it so that everything is done properly.""He also credits his customer relationship management (CRM) system for helping him track client communications and process paperwork. And after recently reading ""The Checklist Manifesto"" by Atul Gawande, Resnick is creating checklists to avoid errors.RELATED:Advisory Firms Find Success In Attracting Smart InternsHow A Top Financial Advisor Turned A Lemon Investment Into A Successful Career

199,CRM,"Salesforce.com (CRM) CEO Marc Benioff has officially ruled out a bid for Twitter (TWTR), sending the social media firm's stock down again now that no possible buyers appear to be in sight.Twitter is ""not the right fit for us for many different reasons,"" Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff told the Financial Times. Salesforce later confirmed Benioff's comments to IBD.Salesforce.com stock has rebounded since a bid for Twitter seemed less likely, following its Dreamforce customer conference last week.Apple (AAPL), Walt Disney (DIS) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) also have been ruled out as buyers of Twitter, at least until its valuation and asking price become more appetizing.Twitter stock lost 5.1% to 16.88 in the stock market today, after the story surfaced.

200,CRM,"Investors will find quite a few leading stocks in Fidelity Trend Fund (FTRNX), but it's taken more than just owning the likes of Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook for fund manager Dan Kelley to keep his fund apace or ahead of peers and the stock market.Much of the fund's success can be traced to what goes on behind closed doors: depth of research, fund manager experience, investment philosophy and the timing of buys and sells.And Kelley's views about several of his top holdings, appearing below, reveal a good deal about his plan of attack for beating the market.The $1.6 billion large-cap growth fund was up 3.43% year to date, through Wednesday, well ahead of its peers' 1.7%, and a bit behind the S&P 500's 6.52%. But its long-term track record is also looking good: Average returns over the past three, five and 10 years amount to 9.05%, 13.88% and 8.54%, respectively. The S&P 500 turned in 9.0%, 13.91% and 6.68% for those periods.IBD's TAKE: Stock holdings of top-performing mutual funds are a great place to look for investment ideas. But before buying any, you should thoroughly analyze them using such tools as IBD Stock Checkup.Fidelity Trend is also an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Award-winner, having beaten the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31.Kelley, the fund's manager since 2012 and with Fidelity since 2005, says Trend's main differentiating factor is it selects stocks with mispriced growth. ""I don't really care as much about how fast the growth is, I care about what I'm paying for the rate of growth.""As a result, he likes ""being paid twice, with both positive earnings revisions and a valuation re-rating if I'm right on those positive earnings revisions."" Estimated P-Es of stocks are adjusted lower when expected earnings are revised upward. This improves the attractiveness of such stocks.Kelley segments growth stocks into three buckets: quality, secular and opportunistic growers. Quality growth companies have proven management teams, stable earnings-growth profiles and strong balance sheets. Examples include Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) and Visa (V).Secular growers ""are companies where I get a little discomfort in the valuation on near-term numbers, but they have the ability to grow at a very high organic growth rate for quite some time, and usually for longer than the market expects."" Salesforce.com (CRM) and Facebook (FB) fall in this category.Asked for his view on top holding Apple (AAPL), which just reported fiscal Q4 earnings and its first decline in annual profit in 15 years, Kelley said he could only comment on the situation as of the fund's last filing, Aug. 31.""In general, Apple needs to continue to innovate further on the smartphone for customer demand to remain high and earnings to grow,"" he said. ""The smartphone has become the most important device in most people's lives as the average person checks in 100 times a day. Hence, Apple needs to continue to provide customers with the best user experience, leading operating performance, and exciting new features to drive growth.""On Amazon (AMZN), he said the company, as of the fund's latest filing, still looked cheap vs. its long-term growth potential. ""What has changed from prior years, is the market has come to further appreciate the Amazon Web Services business and the long-term opportunity for that business, both from a revenue growth and earnings potential,"" he said. ""In addition, with respect to the core retail business, more retailers have embraced Amazon as a powerful distribution platform, which has allowed the company to operate more as a marketplace and enhanced the company's margin profile.""The third bucket includes opportunistic growth companies such as Williams Cos. (WMB). ""Those are companies that tend to trade at cheap valuations due to some concern — whether it be a cyclical company and the market gets worried about excess capacity, whether it be some sort of company-specific issue — and those names usually have the highest probability of being re-rated once we see some positive change,"" he explained.In the case of American natural-gas producer Williams, Kelley says that once they didn't get acquired, they started to make some corporate governance moves — changing the board and reducing their risk profile — which led to a re-rating of their stock.""Williams stock increased 28% in price from the end of July through Sept. 30,"" Kelley noted. ""It was the second-biggest contributor to fund performance during 3Q16. Before owning WMB, the fund had a preference to hold WPZ (Williams Partners (WPZ), a Williams affiliate), which also benefited from some of the same de-risking and commitment to balance-sheet improvement that Williams did.As a general rule, Kelley tries not to take huge sector bets. However, earlier in the year he did allocate about a 500 basis point overweight vs. the fund's Russell 1000 Growth index benchmark in the energy sector, which significantly contributed to the fund's performance.As to the three buckets, he usually lets the market dictate where the most compelling value is. That said, the quality bucket has probably been the largest one over time, comprising about 60% of the fund.Metal-packaging maker Ball (BLL) and water-pump and valve producer Xylem (XYL) both strongly contributed to last quarter's fund performance.Xylem has pulled back 9% from its early October peak and has fallen below its 50-day moving average.Kelley's take: ""While I can't comment on specific market moves that have happened since our latest public holdings disclosure, I think it's important to note that I take a long-term perspective when making investments on behalf of fund shareholders and look to take advantage of possible short-term market dislocations.""Global food-and-ketchup manufacturer Kraft Heinz (KHC) is a company that may have low organic growth and a high multiple, but it has a management team that are great capital allocators, points out Kelley. ""When they combined Kraft and Heinz, they took out a lot of cost. ... the management are really known to be really good operators of companies and they can go in and run them much leaner than they were run before. And so, what's happened historically, is that the synergies from these large-scale acquisitions had been much greater than initially expected.""RELATED:Amazon, Facebook, Alibaba Drive USAA Growth FundWhy A Top Columbia Fund Likes These Stock Leaders

201,CRM,"Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Microsoft (MSFT) saw their stocks hit record highs on Monday as both companies continue to earn praise for their transition from licensed desktop software to cloud computing services.Adobe shares rose 1.6% to 110.81 on the stock market today. Intraday, Adobe notched an all-time high of 111.09.Microsoft shares on Monday climbed 2.3% to close at 61, its highest price ever.IBD'S TAKE: Adobe Systems is the top-rated stock in IBD's Computer Software-Desktop industry group. It has an IBD Composite Rating of 96, meaning it has outperformed 96% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. To learn more about Adobe and its industry group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Adobe stock hit its previous record high of 45.12 on Sept. 22, a day after it posted a beat-and-raise Q3 earnings report. The San Jose, Calif.-based company is a leader in software for digital media creation and online marketing.Microsoft has been riding high since it reported better-than-expected September-quarter results last Thursday. Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft beat forecasts thanks to its cloud offerings, which include Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics CRM Online.Last month, Microsoft and Adobe Systems announced a strategic partnership in cloud computing.

202,CRM,"Stocks cooled off a bit in early afternoon trading Monday, then resumed their rally to keep its decent gains. Tesla Motors (TSLA), meanwhile, pulled back off its intraday high of 204.14 yet managed to keep a gain of nearly 3% as it tries to reclaim the psychologically key 200 price level.The former big winner surged at the open following a tweet by CEO Elon Musk over the weekend saying that the EV maker won't need to raise cash in Q4, contradicting a recent filing to the SEC. Tesla is also planning a new product announcement Oct. 17.The Nasdaq composite led the major indexes, up  0.8% and hovering near its intraday high. The tech-rich index cooled off last week with a measly loss of less than 0.4%.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials rallied about 0.5%, boosted in part by gains among the bank, tech and oil-related components. The Russell 2000 advanced 1.2%.Dow 30 component Goldman Sachs (GS) rose nearly 1% and is poised for a fifth straight gain. A sharp dive since November 2015 created an elongated double bottom base with the second low of 138.20 just nipping the first low of 139.05.In addition, the Wall Street firm has constructed a handle on its bottoming-style base, setting up a potential new buy point at 172.52. If the stock can muscle a breakout, watch to see if volume rises vs. its 50-day average turnover, currently at 2.4 million shares.JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which is trying to emerge as a new market leader, rallied 1% to 68.78. Shares are now up more than 3% from a 66.58 cup-with-handle entry.The cup with handle is one of the most common patterns that great stocks build before breaking out to new highs and big gains over a relatively short time frame.Besides the banks, airline, automaker, biotech and generic drugs paced the upside, as did oil and gas firms. WTI crude oil futures continued to rally past $51 a barrel. Natural gas jumped 1.8%.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Salesforce.com (CRM) helped the upside among big-caps with a more than 6% gain to as high as 75.74 That sent the cloud-based business software giant in touch with its 200-day moving average for the first time since Sept. 2, a day after shares gapped down hard on quarterly results.Watch the stock's action closely on both a daily chart and weekly chart, as Salesforce has shown wild and erratic action since its mid-May breakout attempt past a 77.92 buy point in a six-month cup with handle pattern. While that base was first stage, it comes following a huge run of 1,490% since the stock's low of 5.90 back in 2008. Stocks that have made big rallies are more prone to sell-offs soon after a breakout.One could have sold Salesforce shares short near 72.46 when it triggered the 7% loss rule following the May breakout. The stock fell 8.5%, powered in part by reports that the company may be considering a bid to acquire Twitter (TWTR), but is now rebounding. However, the 50-day moving average is falling rapidly and appears set to cross below the 200-day moving average. In technical analysis parlance, that is called the ""death cross."" A failed attempt to retake the 50-day line that spurs a negative reversal in heavy volume would trigger a new short-sale entry.Salesforce hosts a weak 16 Relative Strength Rating from IBD Stock Checkup, meaning it's outperforming only 17% of all companies in IBD's database over the past 12 months. A minor portion of the stock's float of 637 million shares — 14 million as of Sept. 15 — is currently sold short.RELATED:Why Oracle Showed How The Late Stage Base Is A Short Seller's Good FriendUse The 10-Week Moving Average To Correctly Time A Good Short SaleElon Musk Says Tesla Doesn't Need Fresh Cash After AllWhen Did JPMorgan Chase Shares Break Out?What Does A Superb Cup With Handle Look Like?

203,CRM,"Twitter (TWTR) stock fell again Monday as takeover talk died, and Salesforce.com's (CRM) ""relief rally"" continued on views it will not buy the struggling social media firm.Apple (AAPL), Walt Disney (DIS), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and others have been ruled out as buyers of Twitter, at least until its valuation and asking price become more appetizing.Twitter stock closed down 11.5% to 17.56 in the stock market today, after plunging to a two-month low of 16.93 intraday. Shares had jumped 21% on Sept. 23 when reports of Salesforce.com's interest surfaced.Salesforce.com stock, meanwhile, rallied 5.9% to close at 75.10.After the market close, however, Salesforce fell fractionally as Reuters reported that Salesforce is still mulling a Twitter bid. Twitter rose fractionally late.Marc Benioff, Salesforce.com's CEO, cooled speculation during the company's Dreamforce customer conference last week about any pending offer for Twitter.Citigroup's Walter Pritchard is among analysts who say Salesforce.com might renew its interest at the right price. And Pritchard says Salesforce.com could make another sizable acquisition, even if it's not Twitter.Steve Ashley, an analyst at RW Baird, said in a research note: ""We believe Marc Benioff could not have been more clear during his (Dreamforce) Q&A session: Twitter called them, they did not call Twitter; they look at all deals that come across their desk; and they will only do deals that are in best interest of shareholders.""IBD'S TAKE: Even with the Twitter relief rally, Salesforce.com stock is well below its late May all-time high of 84.5. Facebook and some other top stocks have paused after recent breakouts.

204,CRM,"While the possibility of Salesforce.com (CRM) acquiring Twitter (TWTR) attracted most of the buzz at last week's Dreamforce, Salesforce's annual user conference, a number of analysts were just as intrigued by the cloud software pioneer's relationship with frenemy Microsoft (MSFT).Salesforce and Microsoft announced a broad-based strategic partnership in 2014, with Microsoft integrating its cloud-based Office 365 software with Salesforce.com's apps. But while Microsoft — which in early 2015 reportedly came close to seeking to acquire Salesforce — had a booth at last week's Dreamforce, there wasn't much Microsoft presence, analysts noted.This comes after Microsoft in June announced an agreement to acquire social network LinkedIn (LNKD) for $26.2 billion. The following month, LinkedIn revealed in a regulatory filing that Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff had said he would have been willing to pay even more.The battle for LinkedIn is just one issue between the two companies. There also is Microsoft's ramped up efforts to beef up its Dynamics customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. Salesforce focuses on CRM and ERP software.In addition, Microsoft last month inked a strategic partnership with Adobe Systems (ADBE), in which Adobe will deliver its Adobe Marketing Cloud on Microsoft's Azure cloud services platform. Also, the Adobe product will be the preferred marketing service for Microsoft's Dynamics 365 Enterprise edition. Adobe Marketing Cloud is a Salesforce rival.In addition, Salesforce reached a cloud services pact in May with Microsoft Azure's top rival, Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services.IBD'S TAKE: Microsoft is among the big caps, and big companies can still make big moves, while also being less volatile than smaller stocks. While Microsoft is not a member of the current IBD Big Cap 20, Adobe is. Take a look at that and other big boys on the list.Like many tech companies, Microsoft and Salesforce have partnerships with companies that they also compete against, but the rising level of conflict between Microsoft and Salesforce has Wall Street's attention.""The combination of the drama around LinkedIn, a significantly stepped up investment in Dynamics and the just announced Microsoft/Adobe partnership has customers questioning if the relationship has soured and, if that even matters,"" Rosenblatt Securities analyst Marshall Senk wrote Monday in a research report reviewing Dreamforce.He points out, though, that Salesforce has managed to be an occasional partner of Oracle (ORCL), one of its main rivals.The conflict between Salesforce and Microsoft ""merits watching over the next year,"" Senk wrote, ""although we point to the company's success with Oracle 'coopetition' as evidence that the company can navigate these waters.""In the meantime, though, rumors of Salesforce buying Twitter have cooled, which had Salesforce stock rising 6% and Twitter stock falling 11.5% in the stock market today. Wall Street generally disliked the idea of such a merger. Microsoft stock rose a fraction Monday.RELATED:Salesforce-Microsoft Office 365 Partnership 'Delivering Real Dividends'Microsoft, Adobe Partner In The Cloud, Is Full Merger Next?Salesforce Relief Rally Rages As Twitter Rumors Cool

205,CRM,"After more than a year of field testing, Facebook (FB) has officially taken the wraps off the long-awaited version of its social network for businesses communications.Called Workplace, formerly known as Facebook at Work, the new site is a separate version of Facebook that can be accessed only from a company's internal technology systems and is not connected to a user's existing Facebook account.Organizations have used Workplace on an invite-only basis for the past 18 months. Facebook said more than 1,000 organizations worldwide now use Workplace, with the largest concentration in the U.S., India, Norway, U.K. and France. Current users include Starbucks (SBUX), Royal Bank of Scotland, Priceline Group's (PCLN) Booking.com and international nonprofits such as Oxfam,""We're excited by the progress we've made and the level of adoption and engagement we're seeing,"" according to an official Facebook blog post. Workplace is now available for ""any company or organization that wants to use it.""The new service is primarily set up as a business communications tool, with features that include group chats and live video, and with extra security features. Facebook expects Workplace will help companies discover new ways of working and making faster decisions.Workplace will cost $3 per user per month, with the cost declining for users above 1,000. There are no current plans to sell ads, Facebook said. It's free for nonprofits and educational institutions.In the workplace communications market, Workplace will compete with offerings from Salesforce.com (CRM), Slack Technologies and Microsoft (MSFT), which is in the process of acquiring LinkedIn (LNKD).Facebook stock rose 1% to 130.24 in the stock market today. The stock hit a record high of 131.98 on Sept. 7 and broke out the previous day at a 128.43 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: New products or services are part of the N in IBD's CAN SLIM investing system. Strong earnings growth (the C and A in the CAN SLIM System) is the No. 1 factor to look for in a stock, but new products or services ultimately generate stellar profitability. Facebook is an IBD Leaderboard stock, with a Composite Rating of 99, the highest possible, as well as an EPS Rating of 99. To help more companies get started with Workplace, Facebook announced its  Workplace Partner Program, a group of technology and professional service organizations such as Deloitte that will help Workplace businesses across the globe.RELATED:Facebook Is 'Still King' With Young Adults Despite Snapchat: CowenFacebook Earnings Beats Are Consistent But Will Get HarderFacebook Instagram Keeps Clicking As Advertisers Double In 6 Months

But the company in June already had tried to acquire social network LinkedIn (LNKD), which instead agreed to be acquired for $26.2 billion by Microsoft (MSFT).The big worry for Salesforce.com shareholders is that a Twitter offer would be structured as mostly stock.

Benioff regards Twitter as an ""unpolished gem,"" said one report.Salesforce.com has been on an acquisition spree. Salesforce.com on Monday agreed to buy Krux for a reported $700 million, with nearly half in cash.""(The Krux deal) would take Salesforce.com's net cash to a negative $500 million, and would make it more difficult to pursue a potential Twitter deal that has been speculated in the media,"" said UBS analyst Brent Thill in a report.IBD'S TAKE: Salesforce.com's acquisition spree and speculation over big deals have raised questions about the company's organic growth.

Alphabet's Google has hired M&A specialist Lazard to work on a Twitter bid, according to Bloomberg.

But Facebook has been rising on its strong growth and new products. Facebook stock is holding near a buy point.Twitter has a market cap of $17.6, though that's inflated by merger speculation.

221,CRM,"Twitter (TWTR) buyout speculation continues to run lukewarm at best, but an investment bank has brought another possible buyer into the speculation ring: AT&T (T).""It could make sense, but it would be an expensive acquisition and we do not have good insight as to how serious AT&T management is with respect to owning Twitter,"" Mizuho Securities analyst Neil Doshi wrote in a research note Wednesday in which he downgraded Twitter stock to underperform.To be sure, though, Doshi doesn't think an acquisition by anyone makes a real lot of sense at Twitter's valuation. Looking at all the possible names that have emerged, he singled out three. ""Salesforce (CRM), Alphabet (GOOGL) and AT&T emerge as modest possibilities, but that is about it,"" he said.Further, he said ""only Alphabet makes sense from a strategic perspective.""IBD'S TAKE: Alphabet is a huge company, which in general makes for a stock that is less volatile than small stocks. Alphabet has been near a breakout, and it's a member of the current IBD Big Cap 20 list of top-performing large-cap stocks.Speculation on other companies at least semiseriously kicking the Twitter tires include Verizon Communications (VZ), Walt Disney (DIS) and Microsoft (MSFT). But Doshi wrote that ""much of this speculation seems unfounded in practicality, strategic vision and financial consideration.""Moreover, he wrote that ""the stock is overvalued as business fundamentals have deteriorated significantly over the past 12 months.""Looking at the stock price using a value-to-profitability measurement called EV/EBITDA (enterprise value/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), Doshi says Twitter trades near 16 times its 2017 EV/EBITDA. But he says Microsoft is in the process of buying LinkedIn (LNKD) for $26.2 billion, or 20 times EV/EBITDA, but it's growing much faster in all respects than is Twitter. And Verizon is paying $4.8 billion, or six times EV/EBITDA for the core business of Yahoo (YHOO), which is growing almost as fast as Twitter in many respects.Doshi has a price target of 15 on Twitter stock, which he says implies a 9.5 times 2017 EV/EBITDA.Twitter stock fell 3.2%, to 22.96, in the stock market today, but it's up 45% since reporting weak Q2 earnings that sparked the latest round of buyout rumors.That price gives Twitter a market cap of more than $16 billion. Some reports have said Twitter is looking for a price closer to $25 billion.RELATED:Disney-Twitter Acquisition Chatter Gets The Twitter TreatmentSalesforce.com Twitter Tweet Raises Worries Over Acquisition

224,CRM,"A tweet by Salesforce.com's (CRM) chief digital evangelist, Vala Afshar, on why a potential Twitter (TWTR) acquisition could make sense has raised eyebrows on Wall Street, where analysts say CEO Marc Benioff's appetite for deals remains an overhang on Salesforce.com stock.Afshar published a tweet, ""Why @twitter,"" on Friday listing four reasons the social media firm could be an attractive takeover candidate, the same day reports surfaced that Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, Salesforce.com or others might acquire Twitter.The tweet said: ""1) personal learning network, 2) the best real-time, context rich news, 3) democratize intelligence, and 4) great place to promote others.""In a research report Monday, a Morgan Stanley analyst cited Afshar's tweet in noting that Salesforce.com has not shot down the speculation, which has sent its shares lower.""Frankly, we struggle to see any near-term revenue opportunities from the combination of Salesforce.com and Twitter that aren't available today via the current partnership,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss wrote. ""Just the fact the company refuses to shut the door on this potentiality likely weighs on the shares as shorter-term-focused investors avoid the potential risk of a large dilutive acquisition; the fact Salesforce.com is pursuing large acquisitions again raises the issue of market saturation; and longer-term investors question the company's decision making in their use of capital.""IBD'S TAKE: Salesforce.com's acquisition spree and speculation over big deals have raised questions about the company's organic growth. Salesforce.com stock has dropped 17% since mid-May. Its current-quarter guidance disappointed. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup. Brent Bracelin, a Pacific Crest Securities analyst, also is not crazy about any such merger.""The extent to which Salesforce could leverage and monetize Twitter's data is still mostly unclear to us, but several Salesforce blog posts from the past few years help shed some light on how integrating social data into a CRM system could be valuable,"" Bracelin said in a research report.Salesforce.com was interested in buying LinkedIn, which Microsoft snapped up in June for $26.6 billion. Salesforce, according to a regulatory filing, told LinkedIn it would have paid more than Microsoft.Salesforce.com in August purchased business analytics platform BeyondCore. In July, Salesforce.com bought startup Quip for $582 million.

225,CRM,"Could Walt Disney (DIS) really acquire Twitter (TWTR)?Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Salesforce (CRM) have all been reported as possible buyers. Now Wall Street pros are weighing in — often on Twitter — on Monday's reports that Disney is interested in the social network.Monness, Crespi, Hardt analyst James Cakmak noted that Disney is the likeliest of the names being bounced around, according to MarketWatch, reportedly citing Disney's distribution needs. Cakmak told Bloomberg on Monday that the House of Mouse is ""investing in technology for distribution — and this would give them the platform to reach audiences around the world.""Investors and analysts alike have made no small fuss about Disney's ESPN subscriber losses amid the growth of Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN) Video and other streaming channels. Disney comments last August about modest ESPN subscriber declines sparked full-on media-stock mayhem.But it's unclear whether the merger would help Disney's cause. Case in point: While Twitter's first ""Thursday Night Football"" live stream drew in more than 2 million unique viewers, Variety noted that the NFL game averaged about 243,000 viewers on the social network vs. more than 15 million viewers on CBS (CBS) and the NFL Network.""...

They did a good job.""IBD'S TAKE: While Twitter struggles, Facebook has a ""competitive moat"" in social media that makes it a ""blue-chip company built for the long term,"" according to JPMorgan.Disney has a one-third stake in streaming service BAMTech.

227,CRM,"Snapchat has more than 60 million daily users in the U.S. and Canada, underscoring the plight of Twitter (TWTR), which has rallied amid speculation that several tech and media giants are circling the struggling social network.Snap -- the new corporate name -- touted its new figures at Advertising Week, Bloomberg reported. That's almost certainly more than Twitter, which has said it has 66 million monthly U.S. users, with little change since the end of 2014. Ad revenue is much higher for North American users than in the rest of the world.Twitter still has a large, devoted user base that's attractive for ad revenue and data mining. Twitter stock shot up 21% on Friday on reports, led by CNBC, that Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Salesforce.com (CRM) were interested in a possible takeover. Twitter rose 3.3% to 23.37, a nine-month high, on the stock market today on a Bloomberg report that Walt Disney (DIS) is mulling a potential bid.Disney shares fell 1.4% Monday. Alphabet, which barely budged Friday amid a general market sell-off, fell 1.5% to 802.65, below an 813.98 buy point. Salesforce dipped 0.3% Monday after tumbling 5.6% to a six-month low on Friday.IBD'S TAKE:  Several megacap tech stocks have hit pivot points recently.

229,CRM,"One analyst poured cold water on expectations of a big premium for Twitter (TWTR) in a potential takeover. Disney (DIS) shares were downgraded, while a host of analysts updated their views of Marriott International (MAR) after its recent merger. Analysts supported Oshkosh (OSK) after the heavy truck manufacturer sold off on its earnings guidance.Oppenheimer downgraded the social media shares to underperform with a 17 target, after shares spiked on reports that Alphabet (GOOGL) property Google and Salesforce (CRM) were both in talks to buy the company.Analyst Jason Helfstein sees the likely buyer as a media company and doesn't expect an elevated valuation given slowing user growth and decreasing user engagement. He said he doesn't expect an Twitter buyer to pay ""meaningfully more"" than the 17 price target.Twitter shares reversed higher to close up 3.3% at 23.37 on the stock market today, on reports that Disney is weighing a possible bid for Twitter.Drexel Hamilton downgraded the media and entertainment conglomerate to hold from buy, cutting its price target to 102 from 112. The research firm lowered its subscriber targets, citing threats to the ""traditional ecosystem"" as video programming distributors integrate more content options.Meanwhile, Disney faces tough comparison to beat in its prior studio results and faces a 190% jump in its new NBA deal that's about to take effect.Disney shares slipped 1.4% to end at 91.96 Monday.Analysts think it's a better time to check into the hotel chain after completion of its $13 billion merger with Starwood last week. Morgan Stanley upgraded Marriott to overweight from equal weight, Goldman gave it a buy with an 81 target in new coverage, while Stifel kept a hold but bumped its target to 66 from 65.Marriott fell 1.9% to 67.15.IBD'S TAKE: Analyst ratings and price target changes sometimes move a stock or might be lagging indicators. It's worth considering what research firms have to say, but stock-chart analysis and an understanding of the market's trend give you the best chance to succeed. For a primer, visit IBD University and read IBD's Big Picture every day. JPMorgan Chase analysts upgraded Oshkosh to overweight from neutral, while Credit Suisse raised its rating to neutral with a 54 price target.Shares sank 10% on Friday after Oshkosh offered 2017 earnings guidance that was below analysts' estimates.

230,CRM,"Twitter (TWTR) stock soared Friday after CNBC and the Financial Times reported the company could soon receive takeover bids.CNBC said Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) and Salesforce.com (CRM) are among companies interested in buying the microblog, which has struggled to recharge user growth.Twitter stock rose 21% to 22.62, hitting an eight-month high in the stock market today. The stock, though, has traded in a narrow range for more than a year as the company strives for a turnaround behind co-found Jack Dorsey, who returned as CEO in June 2015 but has so far had little luck.Google or Salesforce buying Twitter ""would have strategic merit"" for either company, Scott Rostan, CEO of Training The Street, a corporate training provider for Wall Street firms, told IBD. ""It would give them more heft to keep up with Facebook and Microsoft/LinkedIn.""Microsoft's (MSFT) is in the process of acquiring LinkedIn (LNKD), a social network for business professionals, for more than $26 billion, a deal announced in June.Salesforce had attempted to buy LinkedIn, and it ""could go to a second choice or shift tactics"" by acquiring Twitter, says Rostan, a former analyst at Merrill Lynch. ""The big picture is that there is an arms race"" going on, and Twitter could boost a buyer's arsenal.In a research note Friday, City analyst Walter Pritchard said a Salesforce bid for Twitter is unlikely, and he said Salesforce wouldn't seem to be hurt if Twitter was acquired by another company.""But my question is that, since Twitter speculation dates back two years or so, how much of that is already baked into the stock?"" Rostan said. ""It's impossible to answer, but Twitter already trades at a high valuation and you have to figure it would sell for a 25%, 30%, 40% premium to its pre-speculation price.""Twitter's market cap is near $15.5 billion, so it really is pretty much out of the range of any private-equity firms or any leveraged buyout, Rostan says.""At a certain price, an Alphabet acquisition could make sense as Twitter would help the core Google platform become more competitive with Facebook ...,"" Stifel analyst Scott Devitt said in a research note Friday. But Devitt maintained a sell rating on Twitter stock and a price target of 9, saying ""we do not have a strong view on Twitter being acquired before the end of the year.""Twitter's board reportedly met this month with options on the table apparently including putting the company up for sale, but directors instead reportedly opted to give Dorsey a little more time.Just since then, Twitter has seen success with its live streaming of NFL Thursday Night Football games and last week launched an app for Apple (AAPL)TV, Amazon (AMZN) Fire TV and Microsoft's (MSFT) Xbox One that lets anyone with these devices get Twitter's live streaming video and other Twitter content.The microblog is desperately striving to recharge growth as its loses mind share to Facebook (FB), Instagram, Snapchat and other social media outlets.Alphabet's Google, meanwhile, has failed to gain steam with its Google+ social network, and Salesforce.com has a social network for enterprises, called Chatter. Salesforce lost out to Microsoft in June for professional networking firm LinkedIn (LNKD).Twitter has a couple of pacts with Google, dating to early 2015. That's when Twitter Tweets began appearing in Google search results. And Twitter's Promoted Tweets ads are sold in part via Google's online ad operation.Vala Afshar, Salesforce's chief evangelist, Friday morning sent out a tweet extolling Twitter.Why @twitter?1 personal learning network

I simply love Twitter.— Vala Afshar (@ValaAfshar) September 23, 2016Salesforce stock fell 5.1% by midday to 70.76, dropping to its lowest level since late March. Alphabet fell fractionally to 814.96, just above a 813.98 buy point that it cleared on Thursday.Late Thursday, RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney cut Twitter to underperform from sector perform, and lowered his price target to 14 from 17, saying advertisers are losing interest despite the social network's many hard-core fans.IBD'S TAKE: One challenge for Twitter is that it's compared, mostly unfavorably, to fellow social network Facebook, which leads the field. In fact, Facebook now boasts an astounding 1 billion-plus daily active users, which is boosting its growth and has landed it on two key IBD lists: the IBD 50 ranking of top-performing stocks in the past 52 weeks and Leaderboard, top performers at or near a breakout.RELATED:Twitter Stock Put On Injured Reserve By RBCFacebook Inflated Key Advertising Metric For Two YearsTwitter Scores With NFL Live Streaming

""We also believe this increases the likelihood for M&A in the future, with Microsoft being the most likely acquirer of Adobe due to this current partnership and the fact that Microsoft is only one of a few vendors that would be able to absorb a company of Adobe's size.""Zukin rates Adobe stock as overweight with a price target of 130.Adobe and Microsoft each have shifted their businesses from licensed software to cloud computing services. And both have seen their shares rise to record levels. Adobe hit an all-time high of 108.50 on Sept. 22. Microsoft notched its record high of 58.70 on Aug. 26.To promote Azure, Microsoft forged partnerships with enterprise software firm SAP (SAP) in May and industrial giant General Electric (GE) in July.RELATED:Adobe Systems Riding Strong Tailwind In Online MarketingMicrosoft Stock Gets Bullish Report On Cloud Prospects

247,CRM,"Among the major stock indexes, the tech-heavy Nasdaq is in focus after pushing this week to all-time highs. It's little surprise then that technology ETFs are setting records too.Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) made a 52-week high of 47.97 Thursday and was modestly lower on the stock market today. This $13.1 million ETF is the largest in its category and offers broad exposure to the sector. Its holdings span the computer, software, IT services, semiconductor and communication industries.Thirty-two other tech ETFs also set fresh highs Thursday, out of roughly 48 exchange traded funds offering either broad exposure to technology equities or to specific industry segments within the tech sector.XLK is up 13.5% year to date through Sept. 22. That's better than the broad market's 8.2% gain but worse than some peers in the tech sector.For ETF investors, the biggest rewards within technology so far in 2016 have come from the semiconductor space.PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors (PSI) is the year's best-performing tech ETF, up 28.5% through Sept. 22.Larger peer VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH), up 27.2%, gathered more assets though. Investors poured $40.4 million into SMH in the first eight months of 2016.This chip ETF holds a portfolio of 25 chip makers, including Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Broadcom (AVGO), Nvidia (NVDA) and Analog Devices (ADI).One of its two largest holdings, industry giant Intel (INTC), last week hit its best level in a year after the company raised its Q3 sales outlook, citing improvement in the personal computer market.IBD'S TAKE: VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF taps into many innovative chip companies and is benefiting from new areas of growth within this tech sub-industry.Another top-performing tech ETF this year is Global X Social Media (SOCL), up 25.2% so far in 2016. On Friday, a rumored Twitter (TWTR) deal saw the stock fly as much as 20% higher.Hand in hand with Twitter, SOCL made an all-time high, reaching 25.33. The ETF is up roughly 75% since launch five years ago.The social media industry represents a more pure-play growth opportunity within technology, says Jay Jacobs, director of research for Global X. For ETF investors, that may mean more risk for potentially bigger rewards.Jacobs sees the broad sector increasingly bogged down by lower growth segments such as printing and computer hardware, while the social media industry is enjoying tail winds from internet penetration around the world.In particular, there's more interaction with brands on social media, rather than through traditional advertisements, spurred by greater adoption of mobile phones around the world and spending by digital-savvy millennials, according to Global X.""Going forward, we believe these trends will continue to propel top-line revenue growth, which will continue to make social media companies attractive targets of software and internet companies looking to spur growth,"" Jacobs told IBD in an email.Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) and Salesforce.com (CRM) are reported to be among companies interested in buying Twitter. The microblog firm has struggled to grow users,  but is seeing success with its live streaming of NFL Thursday Night Football games.Investors yanked $14.4 million from SOCL in 2016 through August. Only a dozen technology ETFs out of 48 saw net inflow over the same period -- a sign of the sector's troubles over the first half of the year.Flow of fresh investor money has recently started to turn around for SOCL, according to Global X.Massive Yahoo Hack Raises Questions, Says CEO Of Cybersecurity ETF

248,CRM,"The stock market caught its breath early Friday as the major indexes slipped a bit. But some techs surged, including Twitter (TWTR) following news that the short-text social network is reportedly mulling a sale, perhaps to Salesforce.com (CRM), according to CNBC.The Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average lost about 0.3%, with the S&P 500 down around 0.2%.The NYSE composite fell harder, off nearly 0.4%. Dairy products, trucking, auto replacement parts, gaming, property REIT and foreign bank shares led the downside. But security software, metal ore, department store and steel shares advanced.Before the Friday morning headlines, Twitter shares have actually been on the mend for months since bottoming at 13.72 in May. The stock plunged more than 14% on July 27 even after reporting a sterling 86% rise in second-quarter earnings to 13 cents a share, smashing Wall Street views at the time. Yet the stock immediately began a steady recovery; less than two weeks later the big cap internet play regained its 200-day moving average.Twitter rose 20% in late morning trade, hitting an 8-month high.Wall Street sees Q3 earnings falling 10% to 9 cents a share, but it's misleading since in the year-ago quarter, Twitter's profit ballooned 900% to 10 cents.For the year, the Street sees Twitter growing its profit 27% to 51 cents a share.Elsewhere in the stock market today, CyberArk Software (CYBR) rebounded more than 2% to 51.90.

Bloomberg reported that the security software firm has drawn acquisition interest from IBM (IBM) and Cisco Systems (CSCO).Imperva is still in basing mode after correcting as much as 60% from a 2015 peak of 77.99. The Redwood Shores, Calif., firm earned 12 cents a share in 2015, ending a nine-year profit drought. However, analysts on consensus see Imperva losing 80 cents a share in 2016. Revenue jumped 43% last year to $234 million.Apple (AAPL) edged 0.1% lower to 114.49. The tech giant is within 5% of a 110.33 cup-with-handle buy point, so it's still in buy range. A rise past 115.85, or 5% past the 110.33 pivot point, would put Apple shares in extended territory.RELATED:Twitter Sale Finally Here?

250,CRM,"The Federal Reserve said the case for a rate hike had ""strengthened,"" but stocks rallied as policymakers indicated the path of increases would be even slower. Congress grilled two big CEOs, the federal government announced autonomous driving guidelines, while Yahoo (YHOO) and Facebook (FB) made embarrassing disclosures.The Nasdaq climbed to an all-time high, fueled by the Fed's decision to further lower the likely rate-hike trajectory.

261,CRM,"Salesforce.com (CRM) is set to report quarterly earnings after the close Wednesday, as the software company continues to expand its product offerings and pose a greater threat to business-software leaders Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP).Salesforce is a pioneer developer of customer relationship management software made available to business customers via the cloud as a software-as-a-service. The company has made several acquisitions this year that has raised questions about earnings dilution. In July, Salesforce.com acquired startup Quip for about $582 million in stock, stepping up competition with Microsoft  (MSFT). And in May, Salesforce.com bought e-commerce platform Demandware for $3 billion.The consensus is for Salesforce.com to report revenue of $2 billion, up 23% year over year, for the quarter ended on or near July 30.

Excluding one-time items, the consensus on earnings per share is 22 cents, up 16%.Brean Capital analyst Yun Kim has a buy rating on Salesforce stock, with a price target of 110.""We are expecting Salesforce.com to report at least in-line Q2, driven by continued strength in its enterprise business and increasing traction with large global system integrators,"" Kim wrote. ""Our checks indicate that Salesforce is beginning to replace SAP and Oracle as the de facto standard status in enterprise business applications, which is reflected in large global system integrators aggressively building out their Salesforce practices.""BMO Capital Markets analyst Keith Bachman has an outperform rating on Salesforce and price target of 98.""Though we think revenue and billings upside this quarter could be less than in recent quarters, which includes the impact of foreign exchange, we believe that longer-term potential and valuation are compelling,"" Bachman wrote in a research note.Salesforce stock closed Friday at 80.03, down a fraction for the day but rising 3.3% for the week.IBD'S Take: Salesforce has a strong IBD Composite Rating of 91, meaning it has outperformed 91% of stocks in the past 12 months.

In July, Salesforce.com acquired startup Quip for about $582 million in stock, stepping up competition with Microsoft (MSFT). And in June, Salesforce announced it was buying e-commerce platform Demandware for $3 billion.""The most common question we are fielding from investors is whether what looks like a newfound affinity for acquisitions is a sign of slowing core growth,"" said Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard in a research report. ""Our key question is whether CEO Marc Benioff is now on a quest to build the foundation for $20 billion in revenue, which would involve further acquisitions and potentially a departure from disciplined, largely organic growth that included margin expansion.""Salesforce posted revenue of $6.67 billion for its fiscal year ended Jan. 31.Keith Bachmann, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, says expectations are low heading into the fiscal Q2 earnings report, which will include 19 days of Demandware's financials.""We think investors are expecting a weaker reported quarter compared to Salesforce.com typical upside,"" he said.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters project revenue growth of 24% for the quarter ended on or near July 31 vs. the year-earlier quarter, to $2.02 billion. That's down from 27% year-over-year growth in the preceding quarter. Analysts see EPS growth of 16%, to 22 cents, which would be its smallest growth since the April 2014 quarter.Billings, a sales growth metric, also might weaken in fiscal Q2, says Bachmann.""Revenue and billings upside this quarter could be less than in recent quarters, which includes the impact of (currency exchange rates),"" he said in a report.IBD'S TAKE: Salesforce.com stock this week slipped below its 50-day moving average. That's usually not good. As more revenue comes from large companies rather than midsize businesses, Salesforce's reported revenue is becoming more ""lumpy"" as big contracts are awarded. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.""Unlike prior quarters, we see lowered investor expectations on Salesforce.com's fundamentals heading into Q2 results,"" Keith Weiss, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a report.But he was generally upbeat.""Despite the increased pace of acquisitions year to date (nine companies acquired in 2016), we see organic growth trends remaining healthy, with billings growing more than 20% at least through fiscal 2018, based on our estimates,"" he wrote.Jefferies analyst John DiFucci rates Salesforce stock a hold.""While fiscal Q2 headline numbers are likely to be fine, our field checks and partner survey indicate that new subscription ACV (annual contract value) growth likely slowed. It appears that the vertically focused enterprise business continued to do well, though overall enterprise momentum moderated from stellar performance in the last two quarters,"" he said in a report.Salesforce.com shares rose a fraction on the stock market Friday to 77.48. The stock carries a poor IBD Relative Strength Rating of 41, but shares touched a record high of 84.48 on May 26, about a week after the company reported a fiscal Q1 beat that sent the stock rising more than 4%.RELATED:

266,CRM,"Financial advisors today have an unprecedented number of options. Sophisticated technology and increased access to financial products make it easier than ever to explore independence. An expanded array of Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) business models and support services has enabled advisors to look beyond traditional wirehouses and independent broker-dealers (IBDs).At the same time, options for clients have grown as well, with online financial management becoming more mainstream. Delivering genuine investment advice is more important than ever. This is where independent RIAs can excel. Savvy clients recognize this and are moving their assets accordingly.More and more advisors are seizing the opportunity to create the future they imagine for themselves and their clients. Independence can offer unparalleled freedom and control. As an RIA, you have the potential to keep up to 100% of the revenue. You determine the shape of your business. You serve clients the way you know is best.Have questions about the RIA model? Get answers.It's been a turbulent decade for wirehouses and IBDs. Industry research indicates that the number of financial advisors overall has steadily declined since 2005—a decrease exacerbated by the 2008 financial crisis. The wirehouse and IBD channels have been hit particularly hard, decreasing 2.8% and 4.0% year-over-year, respectively, since 2004.1The outlook is far more positive for the RIA channel. In fact, research indicates that the RIA channel is one of the only channels showing sustained growth. It added more than 30,000 advisors from 2004 to 2014, including dually registered.1 The growth in assets within the RIA channel was even more pronounced, increasing 174% from 2005 to 2014.1Amit Stavinsky, CEO of Tamar Securities in Woodland Hills, California, is upbeat about where the channel is headed: ""I became an RIA because this is the future."" And he's not alone.Advisors continue to flock to the RIA model for a variety of reasons:They are entrepreneurs. Many advisors have an enterprising mindset. They're self-starters, organizers, and motivators who are invigorated rather than intimidated by challenges. To many entrepreneurs, starting their own firm is a lifestyle choice as much as a business decision.They want to build their own brands. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, many investors soured on the big Wall Street firms. Independent advisors can build their own brands from scratch, matching them to client priorities and advisor goals.They want access to best-of-breed technology and support. Some advisors may be limited by their options for technology, compliance, and management support—and sometimes report paying for services they don't want or need. These advisors are increasingly turning to the RIA channel, which can give them the freedom to choose the platform and services that best fit their firms' unique needs.In addition, advisors are growing more confident that they have what it takes to be their own boss. They see their colleagues enjoying success with the RIA model and are inspired to go into business for themselves.Choosing independence as an RIA is good for business. Advisors cite numerous benefits to becoming an independent advisor, including greater autonomy and the potential for a larger income. However, much of it boils down to a single concept: control.In a 2012 study, Schwab asked advisors at large firms why they found the RIA model appealing. Although the responses varied, they all shared a common theme: Advisors wanted a bigger say in how the business was run.2 Here are some of the benefits they identified.Autonomy. RIAs have the final word on all decisions related to the business. They decide everything from the compensation structure to the technology platform to the sign on the office door. Colin Higgins, president of Golub Group in San Mateo, California, finds autonomy to be a defining benefit of independence. ""It's really about the freedom to make decisions—not only for the business but for your clients,"" he says.Income potential. RIAs determine how much of their revenue they keep—up to 100%, depending on the model of independence they choose. They can assert complete control over fees and expenses, choosing only the products and services they need. Owners can also build equity as their firms grow, leading to a higher long-term payout should they choose to monetize or sell the business down the road.Client flexibility. While most advisors say they put a high priority on client relationships, the RIA model helps them deliver on that promise. Independent advisors can decide how to engage and communicate with clients—from building a marketing plan to creating a customized product portfolio for each client.By contrast, some advisors are confined to their firm's business model, which could include a limited number of products or services or prepackaged communications strategies. In addition, the net compensation of some advisors is tied to the products they sell. RIAs are under no such restrictions. However, independent advisors are subject to the many risks and responsibilities of being a business owner. These may include oversight of the business strategy, business management, personnel management, compliance, and financial performance.Access to the right tools. RIAs can choose the technology and platform that best suit their specific needs. The latest portfolio management and customer relationship management (CRM) systems make it easier to streamline workflows, access crucial information, and serve clients—all while adapting to an advisor's key priorities.Opportunity to keep commission-based business. RIAs with successful brokerage businesses don't have to choose one model over another. With the hybrid model, advisors can offer advisory services as an RIA while keeping their commission-based business by affiliating with a third-party IBD.Compliance options. RIAs have more options when it comes to managing compliance. They can conduct compliance in-house or turn to a third party for help, freeing up more time for clients. For advisors, acting in their clients' best interests is a key principle. But pressure to sell particular products or deliver returns to shareholders can take priority in some firms. Independent RIA firms face no such pressures. They have the freedom to put clients and their goals above all else.Karen McCloskey, principal and founder of CMH Wealth Management in North Hampton, New Hampshire, appreciates the difference. Formerly a bank employee, she now runs her own RIA firm. ""Our independence benefits clients every day because I can act on their needs, their instructions, and what's going on in the world around us,"" she says. ""I can make that adjustment without having to go and get layers of approval.""Clients have been steadily moving assets to the RIA channel for the past few years. The median firm in Schwab's 2016 RIA Benchmarking Study ended the year with $588 million in assets under management (AUM) and $3.5 million in revenue.3 The RIA model tends to create a special kind of advisor-client relationship because:""Advice is the most important thing you offer to your clients,"" says Leo Arms, who owns Thomas Leo Advisory, an RIA firm in Minneapolis. ""They can get the transaction at many different places."" The role of an independent advisor, he says, is to listen to what clients need, help them, offer advice, and ""ultimately be compensated for the advice you offer.""Curious about making the RIA transition?

267,CRM,"Software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider Salesforce.com (CRM) fell Monday after getting a downgrade and cautious comments in two separate research reports that both reportedly cited weakness in the sales channel.Separately, Salesforce said early Monday it had delayed its earnings report for its fiscal Q2, ended on or near July 31, to Wednesday Aug. 31 after the market close. The results were previously due Aug. 29, and the company said the delay was to accommodate a scheduling conflict.IBD'S TAKE: The SaaS market is seen as ripe for mergers and acquisitions, and Salesforce.com has already made some moves, as you can learn from a recent IBD Industry Snapshot.Salesforce.com stock was down 3.3% to 78.92 at Monday's close the stock market today. Roughly flat for the year, Salesforce.com stock has been forming a flat base, with a possible buy point at 84.58.""Our checks indicate a somewhat lighter new business quarter than prior periods with typical Q2 seasonality combining with a few one-time factors,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Alex Zukin wrote in a research report Monday.Zukin, however, also said that ""we do not believe these issues to be structural or competitive in nature and, therefore, are not adjusting our thesis, rating or price target.""Piper Jaffray rates Salesforce.com stock overweight, with a price target of 100.Marketplace and channel intelligence firm OTR Global, however, lowered its rating on the company to mixed from positive, according to financial news site The Fly. OTR Global did not respond to an IBD request for comment, but The Fly said OTR Global cited ""weak mid-tier partner checks that fell below expectations.""On an up-day for markets overall, Salesforce stock had the second-biggest decline of all names in the S&P 500, with only Endo International (ENDP) down more, off nearly 4% Monday to 23.23.

And in May, Salesforce.com bought e-commerce platform Demandware for $3 billion.Microsoft, meanwhile, in June announced an agreement to acquire LinkedIn (LNKD) in a $32 billion deal. Salesforce.com also held talks with LinkedIn and might have been willing to pay a higher price, according to a regulatory filing.But Salesforce.com's appetite for acquisitions raises questions over its priorities, says Abhey Lamba, an analyst at Mizuho Securities.""(Salesforce.com's) pace of acquisitions clearly raises concerns about its ability to grow margins meaningfully from the current level,"" Lamba said in a research report.""While the (BeyondCore) acquisition is very small and is in line with Salesforce.com's historical practice of buying technology tuck-ins, we think such a rapid pace of acquisitions, combined with recent information that it could have paid more than Microsoft for LinkedIn, have clearly offered a valid reason for a pause among investors as they assess risk to the company's future performance,"" he wrote.IBD'S TAKE: The computer software enterprise market has been busy with acquisitions of private and public companies. Learn more from this recent IBD Industry Snapshot.Quip, founded by a former Facebook (FB) chief technology officer, sells cloud-based products that helps users write and share documents on a smartphone or other devices.Salesforce.com is slated to report its next earnings on Aug. 31.

269,CRM,"Veeva Systems (VEEV), an IBD 50 stock that supplies software to the biopharma industry, on Tuesday is expected to report a quarter of continued revenue growth but flattened earnings.For its fiscal second quarter ended July 31, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate that revenue increased 29% year over year while profit remained the same at 13 cents a share. That's a slowdown from the last few quarters, but on the Q1 conference call in May, CFO Timothy Cabral warned of lumpiness.""This outperformance (in Q1) was a function of a strong bookings quarter which included deals disclosed earlier in the year than expected,"" Cabral said. ""For Q2, we expect calculated billings of roughly 110 million which represents about 14% growth year-over-year.""As was the case with our first-quarter result of 62% growth, year-over-year comparisons on a quarterly basis are not always indicative of the underlying momentum of the business because of our billings dynamics.""IBD'S TAKE: Veeva is No. 7 on the IBD 50, but is it time to take profits? Check with Leaderboard to find out.Analysts expect growth to pick up going forward, although the current fiscal year is expected to be a relatively slow one with 12% profit growth. That's seen picking up to 26% next year.Veeva's long-term goal is to hit $1 billion in annual revenue in 2020, which would be more than double the current run rate. In a June 29 research note, Needham analyst Scott Berg wrote that that seems doable, especially since there isn't much competition.""Within CRM (customer relations management), Oracle (ORCL) appears to be sunsetting its CRM for Life Science product,"" Berg wrote. ""Box (BOX) often gets mentioned as a competitor but their lack of a document management application sitting on top of their document repository system and lack of ability to meet validation requirements likely to keep Box or like competitors away from the document management space.""Veeva stock hit a three-year high of 39.93 on Tuesday before dipping Wednesday along with other drug-related stocks.

278,CRM,"Amazon Web Services and Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure cloud computing services can unlock the small- and medium-sized business market for software companies such as HubSpot (HUBS), Zendesk (ZEN), Paycom Software (PAYC) and Shopify (SHOP), says Pacific Crest Securities.AWS, part of Amazon.com (AMZN), and Microsoft's Azure provide the computing infrastructure that small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) need, says Brendan Barnicle, a Pacific Crest analyst, in a research report.In the infrastructure-as-a-service market, customers lease computer servers and data storage to run business workloads. Renting computing resources from Amazon or Microsoft is a good option for SMBs, says Barnicle, because they might not be able to buy the infrastructure to support software-as-a-service (SaaS) products from the likes of HubSpot, Zendesk, Paycom or Shopify. Paycom ranks No. 2 on the latest IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks. Paycom stock was up a fraction, above 51, in afternoon in the stock market today. HubSpot stock was up 0.6% intraday and Zendesk 0.2% while Shopify fell 0.5%.The SaaS vendors, meanwhile, make their products available on the cloud platforms.""In the past, enterprise applications required expensive hardware and IT consulting for implementation and support. As a result, the SMB market was priced out of the enterprise application market,"" wrote Barnicle. ""But with the low-cost infrastructure from AWS and Azure, SaaS vendors can now offer SMB customers low-cost applications that do not require the customer to invest in their own infrastructure.""IBD'S TAKE: Takeover activity has been rife among SaaS companies. Learn more from a recent IBD Industry Snapshot.Amazon expanded into cloud computing as a way to use efficiently the massive e-commerce infrastructure it had built up for its own needs. AWS initially targeted SMBs, but more recently it has focused on the enterprise market -- large companies, government agencies and medical institutions.Salesforce.com (CRM), the biggest SaaS company, recently partnered with AWS in the enterprise market. Salesforce fell 3.3% by the closing bell to 78.92 amid cautious analyst comments.

280,CRM,"Salesforce.com's (CRM) acquisition of startup Quip for about $582 million in stock steps up its competition with Microsoft (MSFT).Salesforce.com announced the Quip deal late Monday. Quip, founded by a former Facebook (FB) chief technology officer, sells products that helps users write and share documents with others on a smartphone or other devices. It competes with Microsoft Word, as well as Google Docs from Alphabet (GOOGL).""While Quip's functionality is not as fully featured as Microsoft's Office products or even likely Google Apps, the strategy could be pegged around providing good enough functionality at a disruptive price point that enables Salesforce to suck up more budget oxygen,"" said Alex Zukin, a Piper Jaffray analyst, in a research report.Zukin says Quip founder Bret Taylor has had a ""long-standing relationship"" with Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff.

282,CRM,"When health care behemoth Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) decided last year to use Veeva Systems' (VEEV) software for gathering data from clinical trials needed to get a new drug approved, Veeva's rivals took notice.For good reason. Thanks to J&J, it wasn't long before Veeva's content management application turned the heads of its potential customers as well.""They (J&J) said we're going to standardize this globally, and within 12 months we had 6 customers (among the 20 biggest drugmakers) do the exact same thing,"" Veeva Chief Financial Officer Timothy Cabral told a Stifel technology conference in June.In this case, though, imitation wasn't just the sincerest form of flattery; it was pretty much according to plan. The cloud-based software company's insiders call it ""the Veeva way.""By that, they mean rapidly developing industry-specific applications with functionality that is miles ahead of the legacy offerings. Then they use positive customer outcomes to take the market by storm.When Chief Executive Peter Gassner left Salesforce.com (CRM) to start Veeva in 2007, he launched the company with one primary goal in mind -- replace biopharma companies' legacy systems with cloud-based software designed to make their painstaking regulatory requirements a lot less painful.Veeva's first product was a customer relationship management offering for pharma sales reps. Then it started targeting the research and development side of the business with its clinical trial content management application. Now, after a rapid six-month development period, it's launching a new application to track quality control processes for drug manufacturing.Veeva's drug and biotech customers ""are in a race against time -- in two directions,"" Gassner told Investor's Business Daily. On one hand, they need to expedite regulatory approval to bring their cures to market and keep people from suffering or dying. Then there are the business-driven reasons for fully capitalizing on a market opportunity before patents expire.That race has become even more critical over time. The cost of developing a new drug has soared to $2.6 billion, up from about $1 billion in 2000 in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. Because the stakes are so high, more large drug developers have decided in rapid succession to junk their prior technology investments and embrace Veeva as a critical ally in their race against the clock.GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is ramping up adoption of Veeva's customer relationship management product among all its 20,000-plus drug sales team members. Most customer relationship deployments aren't yet global in scale, but most big drug and biotech companies are now Veeva customers.The company has about 16% of what is roughly a $2 billion market providing customer relationship solutions to 450,000 global sales reps. Those reps are tasked with teaching 20 million doctors how and when to prescribe their drugs effectively. If all its customers embrace Veeva across their sales geographies, the company's market share could approach 70%.One relatively new customer relationship feature from Veeva is called Approved Email, which allows drug sales reps to send marketing and educational materials to doctors by email. That had been rare because of regulatory concerns until Veeva provided templates that let the communication happen in a compliant way.As dominant as Veeva's customer relationship product looks on track to become, management thinks the company's Vault content management platform has an even bigger advantage over the competition.A pharmaceutical giant might have 10,000 people, both inside and outside the company, collaborating on clinical trials for 20 different drug candidates at a time. Sharing, commenting on, updating and record-keeping of all the actions involved in a trial and drug application used to involve couriers, multiple file-sharing systems and document repositories.Those were hard for some participants to access. Now, Vault makes it possible to have a central hub in the cloud where everyone can connect in a way that streamlines regulatory compliance.Vault launched in 2013, generating $9 million in subscription revenue in 2014. This year, Vault should generate $52 million in subscription revenue, doubling to $104 million in 2017, according to William Blair analysts Bhavan Suri and Alper Tuken.""They're winning because of better usability,"" Suri told IBD. He noted that Vault revenues are growing so fast that the Veeva may continue to see revenue growth accelerate a little.Overall revenue rose 33% from a year ago to $119.8 million in the first quarter, Veeva announced in May. About 80% of revenue now comes from ongoing subscriptions. Adjusted earnings rose 23% to $21.2 million. On a per-share basis, earnings rose to 15 cents a share from 12 cents.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Veeva Systems surged on its May 27 earnings news, breaking above a long basing pattern, though they remain below levels hit just after the 2013 IPO. Shares are still close enough to a buy point to merit consideration. For a closer look at the right timing for buying a stock after a breakout, see this Investor's Corner.""We are more confident than ever that we are on track to achieve our stated revenue run rate target of $1 billion in 2020, selling just our current solutions within life sciences alone,"" Gassner told analysts on Veeva's first-quarter earnings call, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.Shares broke out well past 30 in late May, built a base and then surged again to eclipse the 35 mark in early July. At the close Monday, shares were up incrementally to 38.27.The key to Veeva's success is that it has brought together enterprise software expertise with industry-specific expertise. That expertise and their applications don't just permit regulatory compliance with the FDA but with regulatory bodies around the world. About 45% of Veeva revenue comes from outside the U.S. Now the company is just beginning to expand its industry expertise beyond life sciences.""We have a tremendous platform involved and we can build applications on it rapidly as we've done with QMS (Veeva's drug manufacturing quality management application), and many of those applications are applicable outside of life sciences,"" Gassner said.Gassner announced on the latest earnings call that Veeva has a small team now dedicated to selling Vault to other industries.""We plan to undertake this new effort in the Veeva way with growth, profit and customer success,"" he said.Because Veeva's strong suit is ease of use in a heavily regulated industry, a lot of investors think it may have a future providing cloud-based applications to the financial services industry, including the brokerage business, Needham & Co. analyst Scott Berg told IBD.But Berg sees more near-term potential in industries ""the FDA actually works with,"" namely food manufacturing, which is vulnerable to costly and reputation-damaging recalls. He mentioned Hormel Foods (HRL) and Cargill as two possibilities.Suri sees Johnson & Johnson, because of its existing relationship with Veeva, as a candidate to adopt its Vault platform for managing quality in other regulated industries. Baby food manufacturers such as Nestle also would be a natural market for Vault to penetrate, Suri said.

"
285,CRM,"A common pitfall for new and experienced investors alike is to buy a stock just ahead of its earnings report because it's ""acting right."" Fundamentals are top-notch, there's a compelling growth story, and the stock is in a bullish setup.Sometimes, the strategy works. Other times, it can end badly, especially if the stock gaps down on earnings.Buying shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ) when it was in a cup-with-handle base ahead of its July 21 earnings report turned out to be the right call. Shares gapped up on the news. But it didn't work out with Mobileye (MBLY) recently when shares crashed 8% on the day it reported its quarterly results. The company delivered another strong quarter of earnings and sales growth, but news that the company would be ending its relationship with Tesla Motors (TSLA) rattled investors.IBD recently introduced an options strategy to limit risk around earnings. The strategy provides a way to capitalize on the upside potential of a stock's move around earnings, while reducing the risk of a negative reaction to an earnings report. Weekly or monthly options can be used -- so long as the cost for the option is right.The options market might sound a bit daunting, but the strategy isn't complicated.First, look for stocks at or near proper buy points. Most will be building bases. After that, look for a slightly out-of-the-money weekly or monthly call option. This means the strike price is just above the underlying stock price. Every strike price comes with a premium, or the cost of the option. Divide the premium by the stock price, and multiply by 100; this gives you the downside risk for the trade in percentage form. Looks for trades with downside risk of 4% or less.The strategy is detailed every week in the Earnings Preview column of the IBD Weekly edition on page B2. Several stocks featured in recent weeks delivered nice options wins.One of the early winners was Nvidia (NVDA), featured in the May 9 edition of IBD Weekly as it got support at the 10-week moving average. When shares were trading around 35.50 on May 12, a slightly out-of-the-money weekly call option with a 36 strike price (May 13 expiration) came with a premium of $1.27. That offered a trade with 3.6% downside risk.Shares gapped up May 13 on earnings and closed at 40.98. The option could have been exercised that day at 36. If you didn't want shares, you could have sold the option itself for a nice profit.Other winners in recent weeks included Salesforce.com (CRM), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Lululemon (LULU), Paychex (PAYX), Yum Brands (YUM) and Domino's.Of course, earnings option plays aren't always going to work, but they're a lower-risk alternative to buying a stock outright ahead of earnings because risk is predefined.

286,CRM,"Oracle (ORCL) early Thursday announced an agreement to acquire NetSuite (N) for $109 per share in cash, in a deal valued at $9.3 billion, continuing a wave of acquisitions in the software space and other tech sectors.Last month, Microsoft (MSFT) announced an agreement to buy LinkedIn (LNKD) for $26.6 billion, and Salesforce.com (CRM) announced its agreement to buy Demandware for $2.8 billion.Salesforce, according to a regulatory filing, told LinkedIn it would have paid more than Microsoft. Private equity firms have also been active in gobbling up companies.NetSuite stock surged 18.4% to close at 108.41, while Oracle stock rose 0.6% to 41.19.Shares of enterprise software companies Workday (WDAY), Splunk (SPLK) and Tableau Software (DATA) rose 2.3%, 4.4% and 1.5% in the stock market today. Shopify (SHOP), Zendesk (ZEN) and Atlassian (TEAM) rallied 3.2%, 5.6% and 2.55%, respectively.IBD's TAKE: While IBD tracks 197 industry groups, those companies also are divided into 33 sectors. Atlassian is among the IBD Sector Leaders, a stringent and powerful screen for finding top stocks.Oracle's $109-per-share offer marks a 19% premium to NetSuite's closing price on Wednesday. But since NetSuite jumped 9.1% Wednesday on rumors of the Oracle buyout, the price is also a 30% premium to NetSuite's Tuesday close.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected 3 cents and $230.6 million. NetSuite did not give guidance in its earnings release, but analysts expect Q3 EPS ex items of 13 cents, up from 3 cents, on another 30% jump in revenue, to $250.4 million.Oracle founder and Executive Chairman Larry Ellison co-founded NetSuite in 1998 and has long had a stake in the company. As of March 31, Ellison and his family owned a 45.4% stake in NetSuite.The Oracle-NetSuite deal is expected to close this year.

287,CRM,"The biggest change in accounting standards since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will shake up how public companies book revenue, in many cases resulting in earlier recognition of sales.And the ripple effects could touch everything from earnings and taxes to bonuses, commissions and buyout decisions.The new FASB ""606"" rule developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board takes effect in 2018 or fiscal 2019. It will affect many companies but likely will have the most impact on businesses with multiyear contracts, licensing revenue, contracts that peg revenue to performance benchmarks, or third-party sales distribution channels.In the short term, stock market investors will sometimes have a tougher task in discerning corporate trends because current financial results might not be comparable to previous quarters. Sales and earnings also might be more volatile, potentially affecting stock prices.""The new revenue recognition standard is one of the biggest accounting events we've ever seen,"" said Dusty Stallings, a partner at accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers. ""It's going to be a tough exercise for most companies.""IBD'S TAKE: The best stocks to buy usually are powered by a strong revenue stream. But smart investors look at revenue within the context of a company's overall financial performance. IBD calculates a unique rating for every stock that does just that. For an explanation and a list of stocks that rate highly now, read Paul Whitfield's new article ""Don't Judge Sales In A Vacuum.""Some of the businesses that could be most impacted are telecom stocks AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) and computer software stocks such as Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Microsoft (MSFT), analysts say. AT&T stock rose 0.2% Friday to 43.16, while Verizon shares were off 0.5%. Adobe climbed 2% Friday and Microsoft 1%.Just about every tech company has said in regulatory filings that it's evaluating how the new standard could impact financial statements. That includes Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Facebook (FB), Intel (INTC), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Qualcomm (QCOM).But the new FASB 606 revenue standard will affect most other industries as well, including media, entertainment, aerospace, biotech, health care, construction, auto, defense, real estate and franchisers, such as restaurants. Boeing (BA), Walt Disney (DIS) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are among stocks assessing the standard's impact.And companies will need to adapt more than just their financial statements. The revenue standard could impact sales commissions, bonuses, corporate taxes and debt covenants.RELATED COVERAGE:Verizon Brings In British Mobile War Veteran As T-Mobile And Sprint Pick Off SubscribersDisney And Comcast Pull Out Their Wallets To Get Ready For The 'Netflix Of VR'Microsoft Stock Breaks Out To New Highs, One Of 5 Big Stock Moves (Video)Sarbanes-Oxley financial reforms targeted fraud in the wake of accounting scandals at Enron, WorldCom and others.FASB 606 will make revenue recognition consistent across U.S. industries. Guidelines specific to the software and defense industries, for example, are going away.""Revenue recognition is all about when and how much,"" said Prabhakar Kalavacherla, a partner at another Big 4 accounting firm, KPMG. ""There is now going to be a unifying principal that is agnostic to industries.""For many software and some other tech stocks, the new standard might speed up the timing of revenue recognition vs. today's GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) guidelines. They'll have to recognize revenue immediately, not over the broad length of some contracts. Often, the companies won't know exactly what revenue to disclose, so they'll be asked to make more estimates and judgment calls rather than rely on the old rules.Computer makers and other companies that sell products through distributors likely will book more revenue upfront. They'll need to estimate, based on historical data, how much product will eventually be sold to end users through the distributors, and then book that amount.""Certain industries will recognize revenue sooner than they have in the past, and software is one example,"" Stallings said. ""But the change in guidance from the very strict rules today to the (new) requirement to make estimations is going to go across a lot of industries.""Key to the new accounting rules is that revenue must often be booked right away and not stretched out over time. AT&T and Verizon will likely book more revenue from smartphone sales upfront, rather than over the course of a lease contract or payment plan.If software companies fast-forward revenue recognition, there could be an uptick in acquisitions, says Todson Page, another partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers. That's because smaller companies may be more attractive takeover targets if deals are earnings-positive immediately, or at least within a few quarters.""From a deal justification point of view, it may help some buyers because it would allow them to reach GAAP accretion numbers quicker,"" said Page, PWC's U.S. technology deals leader.Changes on the top line, of course, can affect a stock's earnings.""The new revenue standard has the potential to change not only the top line, but also the bottom line,"" Wesley Bricker, deputy chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said in a May speech.Earlier recognition of sales would help the bottom line at first, but it would lead to lumpier earnings overall, as more revenue is booked upfront and less over the duration of a contract or long-term license.Companies might have less deferred revenue that they book over time. Thus, the FASB 606 standard means they might have less leeway to manage earnings and meet consensus estimates by accelerating or deferring revenue.One broad aim of FASB 606 is to bring U.S. revenue recognition in line with international financial reporting standards, which are also being overhauled. A goal is to make it easier for investors to compare stocks across industries and countries, says KPMG's Kalavacherla, also a former member of the International Accounting Standards Board.Companies will have to chose just how to comply with the new standard. Some companies will opt to restate sales for some prior years, while others will take a modified compliance route, applying the new rules only to existing and future contracts as of the effective date.Telecom, media and entertainment companies are among those most likely to restate revenue, analysts say.And that likely would be the cleaner tack, says Kalavacherla. With the modified route, he says, less trend information will be available to investors and analysts. ""That comparative data will be lost,"" he said.In 2015, FASB delayed the effective date of the new revenue standard for one year to 2018 after companies asked for clarifications. Some companies are still griping.FASB has said it is not considering another delay. Some analysts, however, say the rules are still in flux.""The rules simply don't make sense right now,"" said John DiFucci, a software industry analyst at Jefferies.At a JPMorgan conference in May, some software companies hedged when asked how soon they'll be affected by the standard.The accounting changes come amid a huge change in the computer industry that finds software companies shifting from one-time licensing fees to subscription-based, software-as-a-service business models. Under the FASB 606 standard, only software that is ""continuously updated"" can be recognized over time — and that applies for most SaaS.Companies that have had SaaS business models from the start, such as Salesforce.com, might be less impacted by this change than others, analysts say. Adobe, Microsoft and Splunk (SPLK) are among software stocks that are transitioning to SaaS but still have considerable licensing revenue. The timing of revenue recognition for software licenses could be accelerated, says Citigroup.A KPMG survey found many companies are taking a wait-and-see approach. They haven't upgraded IT systems, recalculated contracts or taken other steps to comply with the new standard. Such companies are more likely to take the modified approach in complying with the standard, rather than restating financial statements.Since companies will need to make more estimates in revenue recognition, they'll need to disclose more historical and other data in footnotes, says KPMG, which will improve transparency, a plus for investors.The new standard also is a business opportunity for startups that offer financial software designed to help in revenue recognition. Among such companies are Leeyo Software, Zuora and Revstream.As Leeyo CEO Jagan Reddy told IBD: ""This is going to be a real challenge for auditors.""

"
289,CRM,"About half of the names on the IBD 50 list of leading growth stocks are extended from buy points, as the health of the overall market continues to improve. While those shouldn't be considered for purchase, there are still plenty of stocks that are near buy points and could soon provide buying opportunities.Apple (AAPL) supplier Broadcom Limited (AVGO), Salesforce.com (CRM), Adobe Systems (ADBE), Smith & Wesson (SWHC) and Home Depot (HD) are just five of 20 names that are currently on the screen of stocks near buy points on MarketSmith.IBD'S TAKE: Apple may be a widely held tech stock, but its recent fundamental performance has been lacking, and the stock is in an extended downtrend. To easily find lists of stocks with outstanding fundamentals that are near buy points, check out our research tools Leaderboard and MarketSmith.IBD 50 member Broadcom ended trading Thursday 3.4% below a 166.10 buy point from a cup base after climbing back above the 50-day line, down 1.4% for the day. Volume has been tracking lighter than average in July, so look for heavy volume if and when the Apple chip supplier breaks out.Meanwhile, Apple shares fell 0.6% to 99.40 at the close Thursday.Broadcom earns a highest possible IBD Composite Rating of 99, and so does Salesforce.The enterprise software firm was able to reclaim its 50-day line earlier this month, and it is now trading 3% below a flat base buy point at 84.58.Shares dipped 0.5% Thursday to end the day at 81.70.Design software company Adobe, which has a 77 Composite Rating, is trading 4% below a flat-base buy point of 100.66. The stock finished Thursday's regular session down 2.1% to 96.34 in above-average volume and fell below its 50-day line.Gunmaker Smith & Wesson ended Thursday trading down 0.9% to 28.47, 4.6% below a 29.85 buy point from a deep cup-with-handle base that had shares testing support at their 200-day line. The stock has a Composite Rating of 97.And Home Depot wound up the day down 1% to 136.07, 1.3% below a cup-with-handle buy point of 137.92 after retaking its 50-day line earlier this month. It has a Composite Rating of 87.

290,CRM,"Advanced chart readers who use IBD often pay extra attention to the stock that has the rare power to stage the breakaway gap.All fine, all dandy. Except when you are hunting for such names during a period of choppy action, or the market is in the late stage of its bull cycle, know this: These strong breakout moves may not work as beautifully as you might expect them to do.The latest breakaway gap on May 19 by the big-cap business software powerhouse Salesforce.com (CRM) drives this point home.On that day, the bulls snorted a rejoicing tune after Salesforce.com reported a nearly breathtaking fiscal-first-quarter report (earnings per share up 50% to 24 cents, revenue up 27% to $1.92 billion). The stock moved swiftly past a 77.92 cup-with-handle buy point. But as the chart shows, the quick gains got reeled back in as the broader market began slipping.The breakaway gap is a unique style of breakout. First, you need the setup. A stock with excellent growth characteristics forms a solid base. Then, typically on a surprise of good news, it breaks out of the base by opening the trading session at a price high above the proper buy point -- so high, in fact, that the stock forms a gap between its lowest price during the day and the highest price seen in the prior trading session.Stocks can gap down too. That's a telltale sign of price weakness.While IBD research on this manner of breakout is ongoing, IBD markets writers have discovered that among companies with superior fundamentals, many breakouts that start with a big gap higher never fill that price gap as they rally 20%, 40% or more. This is why you can buy the stock with conviction, even if it has already risen more than 5% past the proper buy point, on the gap-up day. Those who judge the stock ""over-priced"" or ""over-heated"" miss a wonderful opportunity to grab a winner that is clearly demonstrating rare market power.So, why did the recent breakaway gap by Salesforce.com fall flat?If you invest for a while and go over your past bum trades, you learn that a bad market can swallow up a good stock. You learn that nothing in the market is mightier than the market itself. The market is the M in CAN SLIM; it is the last letter of IBD's investment acronym, but in no way last in importance. In fact, your results in stocks will more than likely improve if you show the discipline to buy good-quality stocks only in pronounced market uptrends, and the uptrend is still relatively young in age. Read the Big Picture column each day to uncover the market's trend.So, if the market decides to zigzag up and down, it's going to force most stocks to follow its step. And that's exactly what's happened to one of the most innovative software firms born right before the dawn of the 21st century.After its May 18-19 breakout, Salesforce.com gained 8% in a week. Not bad in seven days of work following the start of the move on May 18, followed by the breakaway gap a day later. The market was in a confirmed uptrend. However, it wasn't that big of a gain either. And in June, distribution days (signs of intense professional selling) began to pile up on the S&P 500; the large-cap benchmark fell significantly in higher volume on June 3, 7, 10 and 17. Salesforce.com's gains began to shrink as well.On June 24, the stock made another price gap -- this time a gap down, falling 4.6% in heavy volume on the U.K.'s surprise vote to leave the European Union. The breakout gains got scotched. This week, Salesforce.com is trying to break out again past the same 77.92 entry.Let's look at another prior breakaway gap by the same stock. In the third quarter of 2013, the markets were still humming. The Nasdaq was on its way to one of its best years since 2000. Salesforce gapped up on Aug. 30 that year, gliding well past a 46.20 pivot point in volume exploding six times its 50-day average.In that day's newspaper, the IBD ratings were solid overall: A 91 Composite and 90 EPS Rating offset a mediocre 54 RS Rating, which reflected the stock's long sideways action. Salesforce shot 45% higher in just six months, rising to a high of 67 on Feb. 28, 2014, before correcting.

291,CRM,"ServiceNow (NOW) said Q2 earnings per share minus items tripled as revenue topped Wall Street views, but shares of the business software company fell in after-hours trading Wednesday as its Q3 sales guidance barely beat views.Shares of the cloud-computing software company were down 5% in late trading, after falling a fraction in the regular session in the stock market today.""We think expectations were likely high going into the print,"" Abhey Lamba, a Mizuho Securities analyst, said in a research note emailed after the earnings release.ServiceNow posted Q2 EPS ex items of 16 cents, up from 5 cents in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 38% to $341 million. Analysts had modeled revenue of $334 million and EPS ex items of 9 cents. ServiceNow's revenue growth slowed from 44% in each of the previous two quarters.""Our business mix continues to diversify with emerging products representing 40% of our new business, up from 24% during the same period last year,"" company CEO Frank Slootman said in a statement. ""Two-thirds of our customers now license more than one product, and 15 of our top 20 new deals included three or more products.""In the current quarter, ServiceNow forecast revenue of $350 million and $354 million, the midpoint slightly above consensus estimates of 34% revenue growth to $350 million. Analysts had modeled Q3 EPS rising 40% to 21 cents. For the year, ServiceNow expects revenue of $1.75 billion vs. consensus estimates of $1.367 billion.ServiceNow's core business is information technology service management (ITSM). At its analyst's day in May, ServiceNow touted its plan to reach $4 billion in revenue by 2020, a big leap from its $1 billion in 2015 sales.ServiceNow aims to expand into management software for human resources, customer service and security. By moving in customer service management tools, ServiceNow would be competing more with Salesforce.com (CRM), analysts say.

292,CRM,"Morgan Stanley hiked its price targets on software companies HubSpot (HUBS) and Zendesk (ZEN), citing their revenue growth potential as they expand into new markets and internationally.Analyst Stan Zlotsky raised his price target on HubSpot stock to 60 from 55 and on Zendesk stock to 33 from 30. HubSpot stock rose 5.1% to 51.76 on the stock market today, while Zendesk fell 1.3% to 28.79.Zlotsky says both HubSot and Zendesk should be valued in part on their TAM (total addressable market), the same as much bigger Salesforce.com (CRM).IBD's TAKE: Salesforce.com is trading near record high and late last month it had a nice breakout -- that kind of fizzled. What went wrong? You can read about in this Investor's Corner.Neither Zendesk, a provider of customer-support software, nor HubSpot, a marketing software maker, has turned profitable. Zendesk's March-quarter revenue rose 62% to $68.5 million, while HubSpot's rose 54% to $59 million.""We see the majority of HubSpot's greenfield opportunity in international markets,"" wrote Zlotshy in his research report.He says Zendesk might expand into new product areas, beyond customer service software.For both HubSpot and Zendesk, Zlotsky estimates TAMs of $20 billion. That's sizable, but smaller than the TAM for Salesforce.com and its suite of products.

298,CRM,"Walk down Seventh Avenue in downtown Seattle and you can't miss them: three gigantic spheres resembling melted-together Milk Duds rising in the shadow of Amazon.com's (AMZN) new 500-foot-tall office tower. The architectural oddity has already become a tourist attraction and social media phenomenon. Passers-by snap photographs and watch construction crews attach glass panes to the steel frames. Images stream through Instagram and Twitter.When they open in 2018, the 100-foot-tall orbs -- Amazon calls them Biospheres -- will host more than 300 plant species from around the world, creating what the company sees as the workplace of the future. Amazonians will be able to break from their daily labors to walk amid the greenery along suspension bridges and climb into meeting spaces resembling bird nests perched in mature trees, where the company expects them to brainstorm -- and perhaps even invent the next billion-dollar opportunity.Amazon's new headquarters was designed to project a forward-thinking company eager to help employees be more productive, creative and happy by providing a connection to nature. But the most trendsetting and appealing feature of the new complex is most likely its location: plopped between glass and steel high-rises on a busy street in downtown Seattle where food trucks are abundant, apartments are within walking distance and Happy Hour greets employees at quitting time.Over the years, founder and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos has made clear his disdain for the free lunches, massages and other perks commonplace in the suburban enclaves of Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB). His big advantage in the amenities arms race is a commitment to preserving an urban campus, no matter how big his company gets.Other tech companies are following his lead by squeezing new offices into cities where millennials prefer to live. LinkedIn (LNKD) consolidated staff scattered around San Francisco into a 26-story tower in March. Salesforce.com (CRM) will be the anchor tenant in a 61-story skyscraper a few miles away that will be the city's tallest upon completion in 2018. Uber has plans for a new headquarters in San Francisco's Mission Bay. Industrial-age leviathans are doing it, too. General Electric (GE) is shifting from suburban Connecticut to Boston, while McDonald's (MCD) is moving from Oak Brook, Ill., to Chicago.Amazon's is the most ambitious gambit of them all. When its spheres and three surrounding towers are completed, the company will have 10 million square feet of office space in Seattle, more than 15% of the city's inventory, on a campus that occupies more than 10 square blocks. That will provide space for Amazon to more than double in size, to 50,000 Seattle workers in the next decade. ""How big can Amazon get and stay in Seattle? That's what they're trying to find out,"" says Glenn Kelman, the CEO of online real estate company Redfin. ""Can you create a massive company in the middle of a city?""Amazon's commitment to Seattle began long before the spheres were conceived. In 2010, the company moved to South Lake Union from leased space it was outgrowing in an old medical building. Amazon leased retail space on the ground floor of its office buildings to hand-picked bars, restaurants and coffee shops, speeding the neighborhood's transformation from a hodgepodge of car dealerships and secondhand stores into a vibrant business district where people could work, live and hang out.Veteran fine-dining restaurateur Tom Douglas was among the businesses lured by a growing concentration of well-paid tech workers. His survey of Amazon workers indicated they wanted cheap burgers and beer, which encouraged him to break from his traditional model and open the Brave Horse Tavern with a wide assortment of local brews, pub fare and long tables for family-style seating. ""I'm sure glad we did that survey, because we might not have gone with this concept otherwise,"" Douglas said. ""At the time, none of us realized how big and fast Amazon would grow."" The economic ripples from Amazon have since pushed beyond burger joints and cafes. Yellow cranes mark the skyline where new office towers, hotels and luxury apartments are rising.Just six years after relocating, Amazon has outgrown South Lake Union and is marching toward the city's urban core. The spheres, designed by architecture firm NBBJ, are Amazon's boldest statement yet in the first project it's building from the ground up.They were inspired by Amazon research indicating that a key thing missing from typical work environments is a link to the natural world, said John Schoettler, the company's global real estate director. The challenge was creating an environment conducive to plants without being hot and muggy like a greenhouse; the spheres had to be comfortable for humans.A staff horticulturist scoured the globe for species that can thrive in a cool, dry environment. Many of the plants are endangered species, meaning that the spheres double as a conservation project. Schoettler said the design was chosen to be an architectural focal point in the city, similar to the iconic Space Needle. ""We wanted to create a place employees would be proud of and proud to bring their families,"" he said.Inevitably, the company's growing presence is making it a scapegoat for common urban woes such as traffic jams and rising rents. New, luxury, one-bedroom apartments packed with amenities that appeal to young urban tech workers fetch upward of $4,000 a month, putting them out of reach of the Starbucks barista.To some longtime Seattleites, the new South Lake Union feels sterile, like an open-air mall. Wide sidewalks are devoid of cigarette butts and shattered beer bottles. Street people banging bongos and strumming acoustic guitars with mangy dogs in tow, a common sight in Seattle's retail and financial districts, are conspicuously absent. South Lake Union has become ""a dormitory for Amazon and now Facebook and Google,"" said Jeff Reifman, a tech consultant.Meanwhile, the Space Needle's owners have complained that all the towers being thrown up by Amazon and developers hoping to house its workers are crowding out views of the aging tourist attraction.For now, Amazon's growth seems unstoppable, and it will continue to redefine Seattle, one of the nation's fastest-growing cities. Nathan Wilhite, 36, helped fuel that growth when he moved from Chicago to Seattle four years ago. He rides his bike to work, parks it in an Amazon bike locker and showers before starting at about 8 a.m. He'll break for a spinach, avocado and almond milk smoothie while catching some sun in a courtyard where other Amazonians congregate to eat lunch.Wilhite is glad he picked the Amazon job over opportunities he considered in Silicon Valley that would have required long commutes by car. The way he sees it, ""one of the best recruiting tools Amazon has is if people come interview on a nice day, and people are sitting outside having lunch from a food truck.""Related:Chic Co-Working Spaces Now Drawing A Corporate CrowdL.A.

It posted 2015 sales of $209 million, up 64%.The goal is a tall order, said UBS analyst Brent Thill in his research note, which set a price target of 32 on Zendesk stock.""There have only been two front-office sales/service software vendors that have ever made it to $1 billion in annual revenues – Salesforce.com (CRM) and Siebel Systems,"" said Thill in his research report. Oracle (ORCL) bought Siebel Systems in 2006.He says Zendesk does not plan on an acquisition spree to hit its target. Zendesk does plan on selling more products to larger companies and enterprises, expanding from its base of smaller and midsize businesses. Thill says Zendesk will likely expand into sales or marketing software.Zendesk has provided customer support via email, live chat and phone.To help its customers interact with consumers via social media, Zendesk plans to roll out a messaging product by early 2017. It announced a messaging platform at Facebook's F8 conference in April. Salesforce.com also plans a similar product using Facebook's messenger.""Zendesk's platform will increasingly be viewed as a strategic differentiator and an asset that drives revenues from consumers who interact with support teams,"" wrote Thill.

301,CRM,"Palo Alto Networks' (PANW) low 18% exposure to Europe, Middle East and Africa earned it a top spot alongside Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) on FBN's list of tech stocks to scoop up in the wake of the U.K.'s vote to exit the European Union.""Although we still like Google (GOOGL) very much, it does have a higher exposure to EMEA (30%) and the U.K. (10%),"" FBN analyst Shebly Seyrafi wrote in a research report. ""Amazon (AMZN) remains a top pick of ours, but its exposure to EMEA (28%) and the U.K. (8%) are not insignificant.""The market toppled broadly Friday following the 52%-48% Brexit vote to leave the EU, with the Dow Jones industrial average down 3.4% and the Nasdaq composite off 4.1%. IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group was among groups hard hit, down 5.3%, despite the vote of confidence for Palo Alto.Palo Alto Networks stock, though, was down as much as some others in its group, down 3.85% on the stock market today. Rivals Symantec (SYMC) and Check Point Software Technology (CHKP) were down a respective 3.8%. Harder hit Imperva (IMPV) and Fortinet (FTNT) stocks were down 5.4% and 7%, respectively.Seyrafi suggests that investors look at stocks with higher sales growth, free-cash-flow yields and strong EMEA moats. On those factors, Seyrafi suggests that investors dig their heels in on Facebook, Salesforce.com (CRM), Palo Alto, Cisco, Apple and FitBit (FIT) stocks.In terms of sales growth, Palo Alto Networks is likely to trail Facebook. Their estimates call for 28% and 33% growth in 2017, respectively. Palo Alto's sales have slowed recently from its typical 50%-plus rate. Seyrafi expects Cisco and Apple to see the slowest growth rates, at 3% and 2%, respectively.FitBit and Salesforce have the smallest EMEA exposure at 15% and 17%, to Palo Alto's 18%, among the companies that FBN reviewed. More than 20% of Apple, Facebook, Cisco, Twitter (TWTR), Tableau Software (DATA) and Splunk (SPLK) sales are tied to EMEA. Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE) and Microsoft (MSFT) tip the boat with a 30%-plus exposure across the pond.However, Apple has the strongest free-cash-flow yield at 11%, leading Palo Alto at 10%, Cisco at 9.2% and FitBit at 7.6%.

305,CRM,"Safra Catz and Mark Hurd, the co-CEOs of Oracle (ORCL), were the two highest-paid tech executives of 2015, pulling in $53.2 million each, followed by Brian Roberts of Comcast (CMCSA), Marissa Mayer of Yahoo (YHOO) and Marc Benioff of Salesforce.com (CRM), according to an annual study by Network World.Comcast's Roberts received both the highest salary, at $2.9 million, and the largest cash bonus, at $9.8 million. His total pay was valued at $36.2 million, placing him third in the Network World survey. In 2013, Comcast completed its $16.7 billion acquisition for the 49% of NBC Universal it didn't already own, making it a leader in both content and distribution.Yahoo CEO Mayer came in fourth despite a $6 million pay cut -- but also despite problems recharging growth that were well apparent in 2015. She completed that year with a pay package valued at $36 million, down 15% from 2014. The company is in the final stages of selling its core internet business, with Comcast rivals AT&T and Verizon Communications (VZ) widely considered front-runners.Salesforce CEO Benioff came in fifth with a $33.4 million pay package, as he's made the cloud software pioneer the No. 1 seller of the key business product called customer relationship management software, and he's done so against much bigger rivals, led by Oracle.Benioff was followed by AT&T (T) CEO Randall Stephenson at $25.1 million, IBM (IBM) CEO Virginia Rometty at $19.8 million and Cisco Systems (CSCO) former CEO John Chambers at $19.6 million.Oracle founder Larry Ellison frequently made the list of highest-paid CEOs, but he gave up that job in 2014. Nearly all of the compensation to Hurd and Catz came in the form of stock and option awardsAt the low end on the Network World analysis of 62 tech CEOs were Alphabet (GOOGL) CEO Larry Page, who earned $1 in cash, and Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey, who received $68,506 in perks such as personal car service and residential security. The two opted for token cash and no new equity grants.Facebook (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg also took just $1 in cash but received another $5 million in extras. At the Facebook annual meeting on Tuesday, shareholders approved a new class of shares that will keep Zuckerberg in control as long as he is associated with the social networking giant.IBD Take: Facebook ranks fifth in its group but scores well in many areas.

306,CRM,"If reports that Salesforce.com (CRM) angled to buy LinkedIn (LNKD) before Microsoft (MSFT) swooped in with a bigger offer are accurate, what could be another target for Salesforce as it aims to scale up in the enterprise market?Analysts say that cash-rich tech companies are likely to chase after startups as long as the IPO market remains tepid. Privately held Slack Technologies comes to mind as a possible fit for Salesforce.com.Microsoft this year reportedly mulled an $8 billion offer for Slack, an enterprise messaging startup. Slack's app is used by businesses to exchange messages and share files. The startup says it has some 800,000 paid users.Slack's investors include venture capital firms Index Ventures, Social Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and Accel, as well as Comcast Ventures (CMCSA).Microsoft on Monday announced it had agreed to buy LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in cash. Swallowing the professional social network would have been a huge task for Salesforce.com, Bloomberg reported late Thursday, even with Goldman Sachs (GS) as an adviser.Slack's valuation has kept rising even as some unicorns -- privately held companies valued at $1 billion or more -- flounder, but it seems a do-able for Salesforce.com, which has a market cap of $54.6 billion.What's clear is that the Microsoft-Salesforce.com rivalry has intensified.Microsoft reportedly tried to acquire Salesforce.com in early 2015 with a bid that topped $50 billion, but it was rebuffed. After that, Microsoft stepped up its push into the customer relationship management (CRM) market. Salesforce is the No. 1 seller of CRM enterprise software.With LinkedIn, Microsoft will get more tools to compete with Salesforce. Microsoft will be able to use LinkedIn's Sales Navigator as a social selling tool integrated with its Dynamics CRM software.Salesforce.com fell 1.4% in the stock market today. Microsoft lost 0.5% Friday, and 2.6% this week.

307,CRM,"Goldman Sachs slashed its price target on Alphabet (GOOGL) stock and reduced its targets on a slew of other tech companies, including Facebook (FB), citing U.K. revenue exposure and volatile currencies in the wake of the U.K. vote for Brexit.Goldman Sachs late Tuesday cut its price target on Google parent Alphabet to 810 from 850. Google stock closed at 691 on Tuesday, down 11% so far in 2016, though shares rose 0.6% to 695.19 in the stock market today.According to Goldman Sachs, tech companies with the most sales exposure to the U.K. include Mimecast (MIME) (39% of its total sales), Rackspace Hosting (RAX) (22%-25%), Zendesk (ZEN) (15%), Accenture (ACN) (13%), BlackBerry (BBBY) (12%), Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) (12%), Facebook (10%) and CyberArk Software (CYBR) (10%).Goldman Sachs lowered its price target on Facebook to 142 from 146. Facebook rallied 1.3% to 114.16 on Wednesday.The investment bank also reduced targets slightly on Adobe Systems (ADBE), Akamai Technologies (AKAM), Salesforce.com (CRM), Workday (WDAY) and Microsoft (MSFT).""We expect an active pre-announcements season potentially beginning next week, with the largest negative impact on companies with back-end loaded license revenue models with June-quarter ends, and companies with high U.K. revenue exposure,"" said the Goldman research report. ""For subscription-based companies, we anticipate a potential impact to deal signings, though note the impact will first be seen on deferred revenue and then flow to revenue.""We anticipate a more modest impact for companies with notable financial hedging, although we still see an impact on deal closures.""Goldman Sachs economists said on Monday that the U.K. could enter a mild recession by early 2017. On Thursday, Britain voted to exit the European Union within two years, though the exact timing is still unclear.Analyst estimates of U.K. revenue exposure vary. MoffettNathanson on Tuesday estimated Facebook's U.K. sales in the ""mid-single-digit range."" Google's U.K. revenue accounts for 9% of total sales, estimated MoffettNathanson, while it's 12% at Priceline (PCLN) and 10% at Twitter (TWTR).

308,CRM,"Amid its major shift to cloud computing, longtime database leader Oracle (ORCL) is set to report quarterly earnings after the market close Thursday.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Oracle to report a 4% year-over-year increase in earnings per share minus items, to 81 cents, for its fiscal Q4 ended on or near May 31. That would reverse four straight quarters of EPS declines. Analyst expect revenue to fall 2%, to $10.47 billion, the fifth straight quarter of declines.Oracle is transitions to selling more of its business software on demand via the internet cloud, a huge change for a company built by selling billions of dollars of traditional, on-premise software that clients license for the long term.Oracle stock was down 1% to 38.44 at the closing bell on the stock market today. The stock is down 7% since hitting an 11-month high of 42 on March 21. It's formed a cup-with-handle base with a 42.10 buy  point.Oracle has been on a rocky road over the last few years, as the company was late to the cloud. While the company's business is rising, its legacy database business is under major pressure.RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan said in a research note that he expects more information on Oracle's cloud shift and updates on its acquisition of Textura and Opower. He rates Oracle stock outperform, with a price target of 43.“Competition from leading software-as-a-service vendors such as Salesforce.com (CRM), Workday (WDAY) and others creates the risk that new customers will be tougher to find and existing on-premise customers could move to different vendors when they shift to the cloud,” MacMillan wrote.UBS analyst Brent Thill has a buy rating on Oracle stock and a price target of 44.Oracle’s cloud transition appears promising, Thill says. While cloud offerings account for only about 8% of Oracle's revenue, they're growing at a compound annual rate of 30%, he wrote. An accelerated pace will be necessary to sustain investor conviction in Oracle’s evolution, he said in a research report.“Oracle is still in the early innings of transitioning its entire business model and operational mindset to cloud-first,” Thill wrote.

309,CRM,"Salesforce.com (CRM) can be a leader in e-commerce through its Demandware acquisition, says BMO Capital Markets, which initiated coverage on the enterprise software provider on Wednesday with an outperform rating.BMO also started coverage on Workday (WDAY) and NetSuite (N), both with neutral ratings. And analyst Keith Bachman raised his price target on Splunk (SPLK) stock to 62 from 58.Shares of Salesforce finished 1.1% higher, Workday lost 0.8%, NetSuite gained 1.7% and Splunk rallied 2.2%.Salesforce.com, the cloud software leader, is the No. 4 enterprise software company by market value, following much older Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP), but its organic revenue growth tops its bigger rivals.""Saleforce.com will benefit from two scale issues,"" wrote Bachman in his research report. ""We think customers favor buying sales force automation, service, and marketing suites that are well integrated, while Salesforce.com's scale provides brand, sales and cost advantages.""Bachman estimates revenue of $8.37 billion for the company's fiscal 2017 ending Jan. 31, and fiscal 2018 revenue of $10.28 billion, vs. Wall Street consensus estimates of $8.3 billion and $10.1 billion, respectively.San Francisco-based Salesforce.com is the No. 1 provider of customer relationship management software. It garners mainly subscription revenue from on-demand software-as-a-service delivered via the internet cloud.Salesforce.com said on June 1 announced it had agreed to buy e-commerce software maker Demandware (DWRE) for $2.8 billion. Bachman says Salesforce.com can build upon its success with an earlier acquisition, ExactTarget. ExactTarget is now the Salesforce Marketing Cloud, providing software that helps companies with their e-mail, social and online marketing.“Based on Salesforce.com’s prior ventures in entering new markets like marketing cloud and service cloud, we think that Saleforce.com will be able to capture significant market share with its commerce cloud,"" he wrote. ""We think Salesforce.com will generate revenue growth while integrating Demandware similar to how it did while integrating ExactTarget.”BMO Capital set a price target of 98 on Salesforce.com stock, which fell a fraction, to 81.09, in Tuesday trading.On HR and finance software maker Workday, Bachman said, “We like the story but would advise looking for a better entry point.”He says Splunk’s July-quarter guidance might be conservative. Bachman also says NetSuite “does a lot of things well but does not have product leadership in any area.”Salesforce.com has an IBD Composite Rating of 99, the highest possible, while Workday also has a high CR of 95. NetSuite's CR is 68, and Splunk has a CR of 50.

311,CRM,"Stocks continued to trade lower on Wall Street Monday afternoon, but business software giant Salesforce.com (CRM), which has been the focus of some speculation of being a potential M&A target, held its ground following a May 18 breakout.The Nasdaq composite saw its losses narrow slightly to 0.5% after briefly rebounding into positive territory in late-morning trading. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.3% each. The Nasdaq and Dow did find support, at least intraday, at their 50-day lines. The Dow transports were down 0.5%, led by a sharp sell-off in airline shares.In the stock market today, airline stocks fell in unison amid the persistent rebound in crude oil prices and the mass shooting by a lone gunman pledging allegiance to the ISIS terrorist organization early Sunday morning at an Orlando, Fla., downtown gay nightclub.Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines (DAL) dropped 3% in active trading. Hawaiian Air (HA) slid 5% in heavy trade. The former big winner in 2015 is now reaching new lows in its current base-building efforts. Watch to see if the stock tests buying support at its 200-day moving average, seen in red on an Investors.com daily chart. Hawaiian Air is 25% below a 50.95 all-time peak.Department store, dairy product, meat and supermarket stocks are also leading the market's downside. Yet software stocks are generally stronger Monday in the wake of the Microsoft (MSFT) plans to buy social networking firm LinkedIn (LNKD) for $26.2 billion cash.Salesforce is fractionally higher at 82.10, 5.3% above a 77.92 cup-with-handle buy point. In other words, the big-cap cloud-based software provider is now out of buy range once again. An investor seeking profits in the best growth stocks should not chase a leader more than 5% beyond a proper entry.Salesforce has shown a propensity to round-trip all of its gains from recent breakouts, such as the move in October 2015 past a 76.31 early buy point within an undefined base. The stock rallied just 9% past that pivot point in five weeks, then gave back all of those gains during the market's December-to-January correction.Salesforce, which grew earnings per share 46%, 50%, 36% and 50% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters, earns an enviable 99 Composite Rating at IBD Stock Checkup.Is your stock is best in class within its industry group in terms of profit growth, margins, sales, return on equity, institutional fund sponsorship and relative price strength?

312,CRM,"Software giant Microsoft (MSFT) on Monday announced a deal to buy professional social network LinkedIn (LNKD) for $26.2 billion in cash.Microsoft will pay $196 a share for the Mountain View, Calif.-based company. LinkedIn shares closed Friday at 131.08, so the offer would represent a nearly 50% premium over that price.The acquisition is part of Microsoft's transformation from a desktop-and-server software firm to a cloud computing services provider. The deal is expected to close this year, pending approvals.LinkedIn will retain its distinct brand, culture and independence, Microsoft said in a press release. Jeff Weiner will remain CEO of LinkedIn, reporting to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.Microsoft shares fell as much as 4.7% in early trading on the stock market today, closing down 2.6% at 50.14. LinkedIn stock jumped 47% to 192.21.Shares of social network Twitter (TWTR) closed up 3.8% at 14.55 on speculation that it could be the next takeover target. However, Salesforce.com (CRM) stock, down in premarket trading on disappointment that Microsoft apparently isn't interested in acquiring it, fell 0.4%.Microsoft’s purchase of LinkedIn is its biggest to date, topping the $8.5 billion it spent on Skype in 2011 and the $7.2 billion it paid for Nokia’s mobile phone unit in 2014.Microsoft will finance the acquisition primarily by issuing new debt.On a conference call with analysts, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the LinkedIn deal provides everything the company looks for in a strategic acquisition. The purchase of LinkedIn expands Microsoft’s total addressable market, plays into current technology trends, and bolsters Microsoft’s core businesses, he said.“When I look at those three dimensions, LinkedIn really checks all the boxes,” Nadella said.Microsoft looks to integrate LinkedIn with Office 365 and Dynamics as well as applications like Cortana.LinkedIn has annualized sales of $3.2 billion. It has more than 433 million members worldwide and over 7 million active job listings.

313,CRM,"Microsoft's (MSFT) deal to buy online professional social network LinkedIn (LNKD) for $26.2 billion took many on Wall Street by surprise. Most analysts thought it was more likely that Microsoft would acquire a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company like Salesforce.com (CRM) or Workday (WDAY). Many say the deal could spark more mergers and acquisitions in enterprise software.Microsoft announced its agreement to purchase LinkedIn early Monday. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the deal ""brings together the world’s leading professional cloud with the world’s leading professional network.""Microsoft stock, which fell 2.6% Monday, closed 0.6% lower at 49.83 on the stock market today. Workday rose 2.5% Tuesday, while Salesforce.com stock dipped 0.5%.Microsoft reportedly tried to acquire Salesforce.com in early 2015 with a bid that topped $50 billion, but it was rebuffed. With LinkedIn, Microsoft will get tools to compete with Salesforce. Microsoft will be able to use LinkedIn's Sales Navigator as a social selling tool integrated with its Dynamics customer relationship management software.“Microsoft’s agreement to purchase LinkedIn came as a surprise -- we thought a SaaS application M&A strategy was more likely,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan said in a research report.He said he sees the logic of the deal -- combining LinkedIn user data with Microsoft’s Office 365 and Dynamics CRM -- but he is not clear on how it materially expands Microsoft’s total addressable market.“The good news is this takes the risk of an even bigger deal off the table and (we think) implies Microsoft’s core business remains healthy,” MacMillan said. He rates Microsoft stock as outperform, with a price target of 61.The LinkedIn deal could spur more mergers and acquisitions in the cloud computing sector, Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis said in a report.“This acquisition increases the likelihood of more M&A in enterprise and systems software,” he said.The question is which companies will step up. Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), IBM (IBM), Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP) are among the potential acquirers, he said.Microsoft eventually will consider buying a firm with exceptional sales talent, such as Salesforce, Workday, Adobe Systems (ADBE), ServiceNow (NOW) or Splunk (SPLK), he said. Davis rates Microsoft stock as hold, with a price target of 55.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brendan Barnicle also sees more M&A ahead in internet cloud applications.“As Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft and Google compete more aggressively in the cloud, applications provide a means of differentiation,” Barnicle said in a report. “Microsoft leads in applications because of Office. LinkedIn would provide additional differentiation.""It is likely Amazon and Google will also look to acquire large application companies, like Salesforce.com, Adobe, Autodesk (ADSK) or Workday. They are less likely to buy the smaller or more vertical SaaS vendors because those companies are too small to make a big difference for Amazon or Google, in our view.""Barnicle rates Microsoft stock as overweight, with a price target of 65.While some analysts on Wall Street were cautiously upbeat about the Microsoft-LinkedIn tie-up, others said Microsoft paid too much.“While we believe there is some strategic rationale supporting the deal, we question at what cost,” Jefferies analyst John DiFucci said in a report. “We view this acquisition as similar to other major acquisitions that Microsoft has made over the years, including aQuantive, Skype, and Nokia.”The purchases of aQuantive and Nokia were costly failures, and Skype’s performance is an unknown quantity, he said.“Microsoft has historically gotten a free pass from investors, since these deals typically only represented about a quarter of free cash flow, vs. more than a year’s worth for LinkedIn, which may force accountability,” DiFucci said. He rates Microsoft stock underperform with a price target of 40.RELATED:Public, Private Software Firms May Compete In M&A, Says CanaccordSalesforce-Microsoft Office 365 Deal ‘Delivering Real Dividends’Is Salesforce Big Enough To Avoid Amazon, Oracle Overtures?

314,CRM,"Investors should realize that cash-rich technology companies will target privately held business software companies, as well as their public counterparts, a Canaccord Genuity analyst said in a new research report.“The good news for public company money managers is that the profitable platform firms are about to get a bunch of 'booster shots' of new technology via acquisition,” wrote Canaccord analyst Richard Davis. “That means companies such as Salesforce.com (CRM), Adobe (ADBE), Microsoft (MSFT), SAP (SAP), IBM (IBM), Google (parent Alphabet (GOOGL)), and perhaps Workday (WDAY) if that firm gets more expansive in M&A.”Microsoft on Monday turned its attention elsewhere, agreeing to buy professional social network LinkedIn (LNKD).Salesforce.com recently acquired Demandware (DWRE), while Oracle (ORCL) bought Textura in April. Also, private equity firm Thoma Bravo this month bought Qlik Technologies.While Davis explores the possibility of small software firms such as Benefitfocus (BNFT) or SPS Commerce (SPSC) being acquired, he notes that privately held companies might consider selling themselves if the outlook for initial public offerings remains tepid.“While we are nearly certain to improve on the 2016 pace, there is essentially zero chance that the 1990s’ IPO pace will return,” Davis said.Privately held companies that bear watching, says Davis, include: Adaptive Insights, Apttus, Avalara, Cloudera, DocuSign, FinancialForce, Hootsuite, InsideSales, Medallia, MuleSoft, Nintex, Okta, ServiceMax, Slack, Spredfast, Sprinklr, Tanium, Telogis, and Zuora.“Areas ripe for the consolidation we foresee include the most over-funded segments, such as analytics, point solution security tools and marketing tech. Inasmuch as more than 90% of software companies in operation are private, most of the action should occur there,” Davis added.

318,CRM,"Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google could step up the pace of acquisitions now that valuations are falling in Silicon Valley for hot, pre-IPO startups, says a Bloomberg report.Google, Facebook and Amazon.com (AMZN) have been called digital conglomerates, as they gobble up startups in artificial intelligence, virtual reality and other tech areas. Apple has been more reserved, although it's slowing growth may spur more acquisitions.The cash-rich internet giants are not the only ones that may go shopping. Analysts also expect Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE), Alibaba (BABA), Salesforce.com (CRM), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and IBM (IBM) to be among the buyers. Meanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT) last week acquired LinkedIn (LNKD) for a hefty $26.2 billion.It's an era of ""unicorns"" -- startups valued at $1 billion or more, based on venture capital and private investments. The biggest names among unicorns include resource-sharing businesses such as Uber, Airbnb and Lyft, as well as social online companies Snapchat, Spotify and Pinterest.While unicorn valuations have been tempered recently, that's also a trend among smaller startups, says the Bloomberg report.Mutual funds including Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price (TROW) recently have marked down the value of their holdings in startups such as Hootsuite Media, Dropbox, CloudFlare, Cloudera, DocuSign and Zenefits.Annual U.S. VC funding more than doubled to $63 billion from 2013 through 2015, but now capital has begun to flow more slowly to startups, and valuations are falling, says the report.Facebook and Amazon remain IBD Leaderboard stocks. Facebook stock ended trading up 0.9% to 114.38 on the stock market today. Amazon stock was up 0.3% to 715.82. Facebook could be forming a flat base, with a 121.18 buy point.

320,CRM,"Salesforce.com’s (CRM) new cloud partnership with Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services has yet to kick in, but its alliance with Microsoft (MSFT) is “delivering real dividends,” says UBS.Microsoft reportedly tried to acquire Salesforce.com in early 2015. Salesforce.com rebuffed the takeover offer, which reports said topped $50 billion. With its stock gain in 2016, Salesforce.com’s market cap now tops $56 billion.Salesforce.com last week agreed to buy Demandware (DWRE) for $2.8 billion. Despite Salesforce.com's size, though, some still see it as a possible buyout candidate, though the buyer would have to be very big.UBS analyst Brent Thill, who attended Salesforce.com’s two-day TrailheaDX developers conference, which ends Wednesday, says Microsoft has closely integrated its cloud-based Office 365 software with Salesforce.com’s apps.San Francisco-based Salesforce.com is the leading provider of customer relationship software. Salesforce.com garners mainly subscription revenue from on-demand software delivered via the internet cloud. Salesforce.com competes with such enterprise software providers SAP (SAP), Oracle (ORCL) and ServiceNow (NOW).“The Microsoft partnership is delivering real dividends,” Thill said in a research report Wednesday. “Integration with Salesforce has improved since last October, when Office 365 started to support two-way integration with Salesforce.com apps -- a big step forward from the non-real-time integration with Outlook.”In a blow to Microsoft’s Azure-branded cloud computing service, however, Salesforce.com has forged closer ties to AWS. Salesforce.com last month said it would offer a new “Internet of Things” service for web-connected devices using the AWS cloud computing platform.Shares of Salesforce ticked up to to 83.35 while Microsoft dipped to 52.04 by the close in the stock market today.

322,CRM,"Salesforce.com (CRM) is fortifying its kingdom on a cloud, but now the question is whether that automatically comes with an acquisition-proof moat.Salesforce's $2.8 billion buyout last week of e-commerce platform Demandware (DWRE) beefs up its arsenal as Silicon Valley continues to engage in turf battles atop virtual thunderheads. The rumored bidding war over Demandware is said to have included Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE), which both compete -- to varying degrees -- with Salesforce’s cloud-based customer-relationship-management software.But few players now seem to have the full suite of enterprise tools that Salesforce offers. By adding an enterprise cloud e-commerce platform to its product lineup, it allows Salesforce to ""own the entire customer journey,"" as Piper Jaffray analyst Alex Zukin put it. Salesforce's products involve the first contacts with customers to sales and transactions and on to service issues.""That’s the holy grail,"" Zukin told Investor's Business Daily.Is it enough to put Salesforce out of reach? With Salesforce's market cap at well over $56 billion, and with an increasing number of acquisitions under its belt, it might be getting too formidable to be a takeover target.The Demandware buy comes on the heels of Salesforce’s announcement that it has chosen the web services unit of Amazon (AMZN) as its ""preferred public cloud infrastructure provider,"" expanding its existing partnership and using Amazon’s cloud provider in certain markets abroad to ""help bring new infrastructure online more quickly and efficiently.""Deutsche Bank analyst Karl Keirstead called the agreement a ""big deal.""""It is a major endorsement of (Amazon Web Services), and Salesforce becomes the first of the larger 'incumbent' (software-as-a-service) vendors to give up on the idea that they need to own/control their own data center infrastructure footprint,"" he wrote. Keirstead added, though, that the deal materially shrinks the chances of Microsoft (MSFT) acquiring Salesforce, a rumored partnership in years past.Piper Jaffray's Zukin isn't so sure. He recalled chatter of years past that has included not only Microsoft but Oracle as a potential Salesforce buyer.""I think Salesforce is a unique strategic asset and I wouldn’t put it past someone else from buying them over the next couple of years,"" Zukin said.Zukin speculated in early May that a separate deal, in which Salesforce would build its new Internet of Things service on Amazon’s cloud, could lead to a ""cozier"" relationship between the two, perhaps in the form of a strategic sales partnership. Amazon also could spin out its web services unit and merge it with Salesforce, or even acquire the company outright, with the latter being the least likely, he speculated.""Fundamentally we view (Salesforce) as a clear beneficiary of a larger 'Cloud Game of Thrones' being waged among (Oracle, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet (GOOGL)'s Google) for the Cloud Platform 'Iron Throne,'"" Zukin wrote on May 12. (Coincidentally, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is a distant cousin of ""Game of Thrones"" co-showrunner David Benioff.)Zukin still thinks Amazon could annex Salesforce in some capacity, though. When asked if the Demandware acquisition put Salesforce at odds with Amazon -- given that Demandware builds e-commerce solutions for individual businesses, ostensibly guiding them away from selling their wares on Amazon -- he demurred.""You could almost argue the opposite case,"" he said. ""It almost makes Salesforce an interesting acquisition to Amazon.""While Amazon is the rumored Salesforce acquirer du jour, Zukin’s money is on Google’s name being added to the mix next year.""Depending on who bought them, it would make tremendous sense,"" said Zukin. ""A combination of (Amazon Web Services) and Salesforce.com is a killer combination that would put (others) on the defensive.""""That would make Amazon the new IBM (IBM),"" he said.Salesforce’s deal with Amazon Web Services is believed to clock in at $400 million through 2020, according to a Wall Street Journal report citing someone familiar with the matter, plus a recent SEC filing that refers to a purchase commitment with an unnamed third-party provider for ""certain infrastructure services for a period of four years.""""As Salesforce looks to leverage their services internationally, I think they’re going to do so utilizing that Amazon infrastructure rather than going out and leasing data centers in international markets,"" said Morningstar analyst Rodney Nelson. ""It’s a lot easier to just rent capacity from Amazon, where they already have a presence overseas.""He called the deal the ""right move,"" but said it’s hard to predict how that relationship could expand down the road.At the very least, Salesforce's moves are well-timed. More businesses are feeling comfortable moving their data to the public cloud as well as looking to save on technology costs, Nelson says. That has resulted in an accelerated migration to cloud services.Salesforce, which is seen hitting the $8 billion mark in revenue this year, is largely expected to benefit as Amazon, Google, Microsoft and others stake out their space in cloud computing.And for its part, Salesforce right now sees itself as more the hunter than the hunted.""The M&A season right now is the most intense, most exciting I have ever seen,"" Salesforce Chief Executive Marc Benioff said last week on CNBC. ""I have never seen more deals and more things happening. We’re not winning every deal; this is just a deal that we were actually able to get done. We’re excited that we could actually get Demandware, and it’s tough to get deals done in this environment because everybody’s positioning for growth for next year.""Still, it wouldn’t be a true game of thrones unless more land grabs were on the horizon.""I think we’re already seeing the M&A market heat up,"" said Nelson, noting Oracle’s acquisitions in recent weeks of Opower, which provides cloud services to utilities, and Textura, a construction software firm.""We’ve also already seen the privatization market intensify,"" said Nelson, highlighting Marketo and Qlik’s recent moves to go private, ""So I think we’re going to see activity remain high for a while.""The service and app clouds are Salesforce’s fastest-growing products, say analysts, and Zukin says its new Demandware-based ""commerce cloud"" could become its fastest grower. The company says it expects to create ""yet another billion-dollar cloud"" with the purchase.Salesforce’s clients span across industries and include the likes of GE (GE), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Comcast’s (CMCSA) NBCUniversal.Shares now trade in the lower end of buy territory after breaking out of a period of consolidation with an 83 entry point and recovering from an early February dive that sent the stock tumbling 20% over the course of two trading sessions to a 16-month low.The plunge was prompted by Tableau’s (DATA) disappointing full-year earnings guidance that sliced Tableau’s shares nearly in half on Feb. 5, which weighed heavily on software stocks, including ServiceNow (NOW) and Splunk (SPLK).Tableau’s shares have only recovered slightly, while Salesforce shares came back to hit a new high of 84.48 on May 26.

323,CRM,"Salesforce.com's (CRM) growth in billing, a key sales metric, was a bright spot in Q1 earnings, analysts say.Salesforce.com late Wednesday reported Q1 earnings and revenue that topped expectations, while also raising its full-year revenue guidance. The business software provider’s stock rose 4.1%, to 81.09, in the stock market today, blowing past a 77.92 point point and nearly hitting its record high of 82.90 touched Nov. 19.IBD's Take: How healthy is Salesforce.com stock and how does it stack up vs. rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupBillings rose at nearly twice the rate of the consensus estimate of 16% growth in Q1.“Billings grew to $1.63 billion, or 31% year over year, which was better than consensus of $1.45 billion and accelerated from 28% growth in Q4,” Brendan Barnicle, a Pacific Crest analyst, said in a research report.San Francisco-based Salesforce.com garners mainly subscription revenue from on-demand software delivered via the Internet and over the cloud. The company continues to move up-market, making bigger deals with bigger companies, says Jefferies analyst John DiFucci.“We believe something has changed on the margin for Salesforce -- that is, the willingness of large enterprises to engage on a more strategic level with SaaS (software-as-a-service) solutions,” DiFucci wrote in a research note.Salesforce.com, the leading provider of customer relationship software, said Q1 profit jumped 50% to 24 cents per share minus items. Revenue in the three months ended April 30 rose 27% to $1.92 billion, the company said. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had modeled 23 cents and $1.89 billion.In the current quarter, Salesforce.com forecast earnings ex items of 24 cents to 25 cents per share, up from 19 cents in the year-earlier quarter, and revenue of $2.005 billion to $2.015 billion, up 23%. Analysts had estimated 25 cents and $1.98 billion, respectively.Salesforce.com increased its full-year revenue guidance to $8.2 billion from $8.16 billion.“Following a very strong fourth quarter, where the company signed a nine-figure transaction and saw its volume of seven-figure deals increase more than 60%, the company continued its momentum of large deal activity in the quarter -- closing another nine-figure transaction and again increasing the volume and size of its large transactions as compared with the year-ago period,” Bhavan Suri, a William Blair analyst, said in a report. “Not only did this lead to another strong billings beat, but it also further supplements Salesforce’s position as the cloud platform of choice.”

329,CRM,"Stock futures were down but steady early Wednesday, as weak manufacturing data weighed on global markets. Futures action for the Dow industrials, the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 all were hanging 0.3% below fair value.Early movers included Michael Kors (KORS), Under Armour (UA), Nike (NKE), Salesforce.com (CRM) and DemandWare (DWRE).June appeared set for a weak launch, although Tuesday's session posted a bullish turnaround late in the day. Meanwhile, the global rollout of Purchasing Managers' Index reports from London-based researcher Markit made economic news an early factor in the stock market today.Markit reports showed further slowing in the eurozone and China and accelerating declines in Japan. Japan's Nikkei average ended Wednesday down nearly 2%. Benchmark indexes in Europe showed losses just shy of 1% at midday. Markit releases its U.S. manufacturing PMI for May at 9:45 a.m. ET.At 10 a.m. ET, the Institute For Supply Management reports its May manufacturing index, and the Commerce Department serves up construction spending estimates for April. Automakers will be reporting May sales figures throughout the Wednesday trading session, and the Federal Reserve releases its June Beige Book report at 2 p.m. ET.In stocks, Michael Kors kicked up 8% in premarket trade after its fiscal fourth-quarter sales and profit narrowly topped expectations. Strong online sales and the addition of 142 new stores during the quarter helped boost results. Management's first-quarter earnings and revenue guidance was well below analyst consensus views. Shares remain deep in a 27-month correction.Under Armour groaned nearly 4% lower after updating some second-quarter and full-year guidance late Tuesday. The company said it would take a $23 million write-down related to loss of sales caused by the bankruptcy of retail chain Sports Authority. Nike also felt some of the undertow, slipping more than 3%.

330,CRM,"Jump-starting its push into e-commerce, Salesforce.com (CRM) on Wednesday said it has agreed to buy Demandware (DWRE), a partner, in a deal valued at $2.8 billion.Cloud-based software maker Salesforce.com said it would pay $75 per share for Demandware, a 56% premium to its closing price on Tuesday. Demandware shares shot up 56% to 74.75 in morning trade on the stock market today, near 75.The company provides software to design e-commerce websites, and at least one analyst says Adobe Systems (ADBE) also might have had its eye on Demandware.Now, “It’s possible Adobe looks at other assets in e-commerce, although others with large customer scale are scant,” Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard said in a research note.San Francisco-based Salesforce.com is the leading provider of customer relationship software. It competes with such enterprise software leaders as Microsoft (MSFT), SAP (SAP), Oracle (ORCL) and ServiceNow (NOW).“The deal will also offer Salesforce.com an opportunity to expand its presence in the B2C (business-to-consumer) space where it has had limited success so far,” Abhey Lamba, an analyst at Mizuho Securities, said in a research report. “Given Salesforce’s financial strength, we do not expect another bidder to emerge.”Salesforce.com stock was down a fraction in morning trade Wednesday, near 83.50. Salesforce.com stock hit an all-time high of 84.48 on Thursday and is up 6.5% in 2016 after having touched a 19-month low of 52.60 on Feb. 8.The Demandware acquisition is expected to close by the end of July. Salesforce.com said the acquisition ""is expected to increase fiscal 2017 total revenue by approximately $100 million to $120 million. This estimate reflects an approximately $50 million reduction relating to fair value adjustments to deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue.""Demandware’s Q1 revenue rose 33% to $67 million. It swung to a 6-cent profit minus items from a penny loss in the year-earlier period.Burlington, Mass.-based Demandware’s customers include Lands' End, L'Oreal and Marks and Spencer Group.Salesforce.com's  Q1 profit jumped 50% to 24 cents per share minus items. Revenue in the three months ended April 30 rose 27% to $1.92 billion.Salesforce.com had partnered with Demandware, Pritchard pointed out. Salesforce rival SAP in 2013 acquired e-com software maker Hybris.“The strategic fit is sound, although we expected partner strategy to persist for longer,” Pritchard wrote. “There is no question in our minds that e-commerce makes sense as part of a Salesforce.com suite.""Salesforce has had a “blank” square in its market coverage map for a number of years in e-commerce.  We believe it is likely that SAP’s success with Hybris put some pressure on Salesforce to bring e-commerce in-house.”

331,CRM,"Salesforce.com (CRM) expects to pay Amazon $400 million over four years for cloud services, striking a blow to Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) in a hotly competitive field.After the market close Wednesday, Salesforce.com announced it selected Amazon Web Services as its preferred public cloud provider for its core services. Salesforce, the No. 1 provider of customer relationship management software, a key tool for businesses and other enterprises, already uses AWS for other services.Amazon stock ended Thursday trading up 0.9% to 714.91 in the stock market today, after touching a record high above 722 on May 12. It’s an IBD Leaderboard stock.IBD Take: Why does Salesforce.com rank No. 1 in its group? IBD Stock Checkup helps explain.“Based on quarterly filings, it appears that the Salesforce-AWS agreement could consume $400 million in cloud services over the next four years,” wrote Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brent Bracelin in a research note. Bracelin rates Amazon stock overweight, with a price target of 800.His remarks referred to the latest 10-Q filing by Salesforce for its fiscal first-quarter earnings. Salesforce said it had entered into an agreement with a third-party provider, determined to be AWS, for cloud services. The agreement provides that Salesforce will pay $70 million in fiscal 2017, $96 million in fiscal 2018, $108 million in fiscal 2019 and $126 million in fiscal 2020, the filing said.AWS revenue is on pace to reach $12.5 billion in revenue this year, based on Q1 results. Amazon competes with Microsoft, Alphabet, IBM (IBM) and others in cloud services. Amazon has a four-year and six-year first-mover advantage, respectively, over Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud in cloud services, Bracelin wrote.“The fact that the largest software-as-a-service vendor (Salesforce) has the scale to deploy private clouds but is making a multimillion-dollar commitment to rent AWS infrastructure services reinforces the bull case, in our view,” Bracelin wrote. “AWS remains a key upside lever to revenue and profits this year and next, in our view.”Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, in prepared remarks, said about AWS: “There is no public cloud infrastructure provider that is more sophisticated or has more robust enterprise capabilities for supporting the needs of our growing global customer base.”Amazon is also pushing deeper into business-to-business e-commerce, which one analyst estimates could add $18 billion in revenue by 2020.

335,CRM,"Medical software provider and IBD 50 stock Veeva Systems (VEEV) beat fiscal Q1 estimates and raised guidance after the close Thursday, sending the stock up 12% in after-hours trading.Veeva stock fell a fraction in Thursday's regular session but earlier touched a 14-month high of 30.Veeva's main business is cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software specialized for the medical industry, but it's been branching out with its Vault offering, guiding clinical development, quality management and other applications for the life-science industry. In a preview note Monday, William Blair analyst Amanda Murphy wrote that she expected a good quarter.""Our sense is that the core fundamentals remain strong and we expect Veeva’s multitenant cloud offerings to continue to take share from Oracle (ORCL) and IMS Health (IMS) within the CRM space and Documentum within the document management space,"" Murphy wrote.Veeva made 15 cents a share in the quarter ended April 30, up 25% from the year-earlier quarter and 4 cents ahead of analysts' consensus, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 33% to $119.8 million, more than $4 million ahead of consensus.Veeva guided Q2 earnings in line with Wall Street at 13 cents a share, and revenue guidance of $125 million to $127 million was above expectations.

337,CRM,"Adobe Systems (ADBE), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Symantec (SYMC) are among smaller sharks that could get involved in the ongoing acquisition spree of software companies, says Pacific Crest Securities.Salesforce.com (CRM) last week acquired Demandware (DWRE), sparking speculation over what other companies could be acquired. Playing matchmaker, Pacific Crest says in a research report that Adobe could target Shopify (SHOP). One analyst last week said Adobe could have been in the hunt for Demandware.Adobe Systems stock closed up 0.4% in the stock market today. Shopify rose 1.4%. Symantec ended essentially flat, but Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock climbed 3.3%.Other possible targets, speculates Pacific Crest, include such ""minnows"" as  Tableau Software (DATA), Zendesk (ZEN), Apigee (APIC) and Imperva (IMPV).While Microsoft (MSFT) was not active in the 2011 round of software-related M&As, Pacific Crest says it looms as a buyer in the current cycle. Microsoft in early 2015 tried to buy Salesforce.com, said reports. Some rumors of late, though, have Amazon.com as a possible Salesforce.com buyer.Hewlett Packard Enterprise on May 25 said it would spin off and merge its enterprise-services division with Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC), a move that could put pressure on IBM (IBM) to respond, analysts say. HPE holds its Discover 2016 conference this week in Las Vegas, where new partnerships may be announced.Pacific Crest speculates that IBM could be a suitor for a security software firm or Apigee.“The 2016 M&A cycle includes a larger pool of minnows, but also more sharks,” said the Pacific Crest report. “Not only do we see the size of the software M&A pool expanding into analytics and security this cycle, we also believe the vertical software market is ripe for consolidation, particularly within health care.”Pacific Crest also includes Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) in its pool of potential sharks.

338,CRM,"A bullish Morgan Stanley reports calls Salesforce.com (CRM) the most likely software company to next hit the milestone of a $100 billion market valuation, though it says security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is also in the hunt.Salesforce.com, a top provider of cloud-based software-as-a-service, has a market cap of $56 billion, while Palo Alto’s valuation is nearly $13 billion.“With the most customer data in the cloud and multiple solutions targeting over 62 million users, we see Salesforce.com as the clear leader in SaaS-based applications and well on their way to a $100 billion market cap,” Keith Weiss, a Morgan Stanley analyst, said in a research report.Salesforce.com stock has rallied since early February, after plunging at the start of 2016. Salesforce stock ended trading up 1.3% to 82.75 in the stock market today. Salesforce.com has an IBD Composite Rating of 99, the highest possible.IBD Take: How does Salesforce.com rate a 99 CR? Find out with IBD Stock Checkup.As for Palo Alto Networks, Weiss wrote that “to achieve the revenue scale necessary to become a $100 billion market cap company, Palo Alto must successfully expand their focus from the network security segment to the broader pool of overall security spending.”Weiss says Red Hat (RHT) is also well positioned in the cloud market but might not reach the $100 billion valuation mark. It's now less than $14 billion.As for a couple of other fast-growing SaaS providers, Weiss points to stiff competition.“In our view, the problem with Qlik Technologies (QLIK) or Tableau Software (DATA) becoming the next $100 billion company is the competitive environment,” he wrote.Salesforce.com will remain strong in SaaS, Weiss says, despite cloud competition from the likes of Amazon.com (AMZN), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT). San Francisco-based Salesforce.com garners mainly subscription revenue from on-demand software delivered via the Internet cloud. It's the No. 1 provider of customer relationship software.“With SaaS-based applications' faster innovation cycles and easier integration of new functionality, it becomes harder for vendors to sustain differentiation and enables (broad product) vendors to garner broader ecosystems and higher market share -- as seen by Salesforce.com's 40%+ share of the sales force automation market,” Weiss wrote.

339,CRM,"ServiceNow (NOW), at its analyst day Monday, touted its plan to reach $4 billion in revenue by 2020 by expanding into management software for human resources, customer service and security. The company posted sales of $1 billion last year.The push into customer service software likely means more competition with Salesforce.com (CRM), analysts say. Cloud software leader Salesforce.com is scheduled to report earnings after the market close Wednesday.At its analysts day, ServiceNow forecast expanding profit margins.""New this year, management now assumes FCF (free cash flow) margins of 30%-32% by 2020, which is a nice positive in our opinion. Overall we believe ServiceNow has the opportunity to become a multi-product platform, with 30%-plus revenue growth and expanding margins through 2020,"" Matthew Hedberg, an RBC Capital analyst, said in a research report Tuesday.The cloud-based software provider’s core business has been information technology service management (ITSM).ServiceNow’s 2015 revenue jumped 47% to reach the $1 billion mark. Its Q1 2016 revenue rose 44% to $306 million.“Management reiterated its goal to reach $4 billion in revenue in 2020, with free cash flow of at least $1.2 billion as FCF margin expands 1% to 3% annually,” Rob Owens, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, said in a report. “While not giving specific free cash flow guidance for 2017, the company did release a guideline for understanding how the growth and profitability trade-off could play out. ITSM was 70% of bookings in 2015, and management believes it should decrease further toward 50% as we head toward 2020 and new solutions ramp.”ServiceNow stock is down 20% in 2016 despite rising more than 4% on Monday, but shares soared 14% on April 21 after its Q1 earnings and revenue beat expectations. Shares are forming a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 76.94. Shares fell 1.2% Tuesday, to 69.50. ServiceNow has an IBD Composite Rating of 85 out of a possible 99, putting it among the top 15% of all stocks in key metrics such as sales and earnings growth.“Management reiterated 2020 revenue goal of $4 billion, with ITOM (IT operations management) software driving 15% of revenue and solid contributions from security, customer service, HR, facilities and other non-IT apps,” wrote Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard in a research report.ServiceNow will continue investing in building up its salesforce, he said. Pritchard estimates ServiceNow will generates near $1 billion in FCF in 2016.

343,CRM,"Markets finished the week in disarray after a shockingly weak jobs report upended what had been an increasingly clear case for another increase in benchmark interest rates -- just days before Federal Reserve policymakers meet.Meanwhile, the future of the auto sector came into focus as Tesla Motors (TSLA) offered clues to its ambitious production goals, and Uber got a massive investment that values the ride-hailing service at $62.5 billion.May's 38,000 net hires were the worst since September 2010. Even adjusting for the roughly 35,000 workers affected by the strike at Verizon (VZ), the payroll gain was still far below the 158,000 hires that economists had expected.The jobless rate fell to 4.7% from 5%, but that was due to a plunge in the number of people looking for work.The jobs shocker overshadowed more positive data earlier. Consumer spending in April jumped 1% from a month earlier, the biggest increase in six years. Personal incomes rose 0.4%. ISM's manufacturing index climbed to 51.3 in May from 50.8 in April, topping estimates for a dip to 50.6. The Fed's Beige Book noted modest to moderate economic growth in most regions, with tight labor markets pushing wages higher.The major averages ended the week mixed, giving up modest gains, as the dismal jobs report triggered a sell-off Friday. Economic data earlier in the week seemed to bolster arguments for a Fed rate hike in June or July, but Friday's report may now push back the timeline.Weekly losses by Apple (AAPL) and Nike (NKE) further weighed on indexes. The S&P 500 finished flat for the week, after hitting a seven-month closing high on Thursday. The Nasdaq rose 0.2%, and the Dow industrials lost 0.4%.Shares of Apple closed down 2.4% from a week ago, and Nike fell 4.9%.Tesla Motors co-founder and CEO Elon Musk, speaking at the company’s annual shareholder meeting, said he’s “absolutely convinced” that dramatic  manufacturing improvements can be achieved. Musk said he is completely rethinking Tesla’s current factory process and hopes to improve efficiency by “factors of 10 or even 100 times.” Many analysts are skeptical that Tesla can boost production to 500,000 vehicles by 2018.He also said future owners of the Tesla Model 3 could pay a premium for supercharging packages. ""It will still be very cheap and far cheaper than gasoline to drive long distances with the Model 3,"" Musk said at the meeting. “But it will not be free long distance for life unless you purchase that package.""Later, Musk said Apple would likely build a quality vehicle, but said the Apple car might be ""late"" to the autonomous rush.Tesla stock finished down 1.8% for the week.The Saudi Public Investment Fund invested $3.5 billion in Uber, following a stream of ride-hailing investments and alliances by automakers and tech giants.Toyota (TM) last week announced a strategic investment in Uber, which has teamed up with Baidu (BIDU) in China.As for China, Apple has invested some $1 billion in Didi Chuxing, the dominant ride-hailing app in that country. Didi is backed by Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (TCEHY).General Motors (GM) previously invested in Lyft, Uber's top U.S. ride-hailing rival.Volkswagen (VLKAY) made its own investment in Gett, which operates  in Europe, Israel and New York City.Athletic apparel maker Under Armour (UA) trimmed 2016 sales guidance to $4.925 billion from $5 billion due to Sports Authority's liquidation (vs. a restructuring or sale), while Nike received downgrades from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley.Under Armour also will reportedly be launching a fashion line -- Under Armour Sportswear -- in the fall, with Tim Coppens as executive creative director.Under Armour shares dropped 4% for the week.Broadcom reported fiscal Q2 sales of $3.56 billion, up 117% vs. a year earlier in its first report since its Avago merger. Earnings per share rose 19% to $2.53, ending a three-quarter string of decelerating growth, despite tumbling Apple iPhone sales.Sales edged the consensus view for $3.55 billion, but EPS topped by 15 cents.Broadcom sees current-quarter sales ex items for $3.75 billion, plus or minus $75 million, up 114%. Analysts expect $3.71 billion.Broadcom stock climbed 6%.GoPro (GPRO) supplier Ambarella (AMBA) reported $57.2 million in sales and 34 cents earnings per share minus items, down 19.5% and 52%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Analysts had expected Q1 sales of $57.01 million and EPS of 28 cents. GoPro's Hero 5 action-camera release is expected in September.Ambarella CEO Fermi Wang acknowledged the wearables headwind and told investors to expect further hold-ups after an earthquake rattled Japan in April.Ambarella stock surged 13%. GoPro gained 5.1%.The oil cartel failed to agree on a collective production ceiling after a previous failed effort in December, as Iran insisted any OPEC-wide limit must also come with output caps on individual members. Top OPEC members, including de facto leader Saudi Arabia, had made a late push for a ceiling ahead of the meeting, but markets weren't surprised by the lack of action.Also, the Energy Information Administration reported U.S. oil inventories fell by 1.4 million barrels, the third decline in the last four weeks. Production continued to drop, falling to 8.735 million barrels a day, the lowest since September 2014, down from 8.767 million in the prior week.For the week, U.S. crude lost 1.4%, settling at $48.62 a barrel on Friday. Brent dropped 0.6% to $49.64 a barrel.Salesforce.com (CRM) agreed to buy Demandware (DWRE) for $2.8 billion, or $75 a share in cash, pushing into the e-commerce market. Demandware is viewed as a leader in the $5 billion digital commerce market, which Gartner expects to grow to $8.5 billion by 2020.“Similar to the ExactTarget acquisition, Salesforce.com is buying the best available asset to serve as the cornerstone of a new cloud offering,” said Steven Ashley, an analyst at R.W. Baird.Salesforce stock ended down 1.5% for the week, while Demandware shot up 61%.The human resources software maker delivered fiscal Q1 non-GAAP profit and revenue that topped views, but billings growth -- a key sales metric -- decelerated from the previous quarter. Workday (WDAY) CEO Aneel Bhusri signaled a greater focus on profitability in fiscal 2018. On the earnings call, he noted that software peers such as Salesforce.com experienced less volatility than Workday during the January market sell-off, which he attributed in part to Salesforce's profitability.Workday stock gained 5.4% for the week.Teen value retailer Five Below’s (FIVE) Q1 EPS leapt 50% to 12 cents, above views by 2 cents, as revenue gained 25% to $192.7 million, also topping. Same-store sales grew 4.9%. But Q2 and full-year guidance fell short of estimates. Shares rose 5%.Michael Kors' (KORS) Q4 earnings and sales topped forecasts. The luxury handbag, apparel and accessories maker and retailer said it would sell fewer products to wholesale department stores as mall traffic falls and discounting rises. That will likely weigh on sales, but it should boost profit.Shares jumped 15.9% for the week.Ollie’s Bargain Outlet (OLLI), which sells a variety of marked-down home goods, reported Q1 EPS of 20 cents on sales of $193.7 million, both topping. Full-year guidance missed. The company also warned that weather at the start of Q2 was “less than desirable for seasonal sales.” Shares fell 0.3%.Shares of Cracker Barrel (CBRL) popped 8.8% this week after the home-style restaurant chain declared a special dividend of $3.25 per share, hiked its quarterly dividend and reported Q3 EPS that topped views. Sales were shy of estimates. Cracker Barrel gave mixed full-year guidance.General Motors said May U.S. sales plunged 18% to 240,753, with retail sales down 13%. Ford (F) U.S. sales fell 6% to 235,997. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) saw a 1% sales increase to 204,452 vehicles, as Jeep sales climbed 14% to 90,545 units. The weak sales -- despite rising incentives and ever-longer and ever-larger auto loans -- added to fears that demand is slowing after several years of robust growth. Still, industry annualized sales for the U.S. were 17.45 million, according to AutoData, up from 17.4 million in April and above estimates for about 17.3 million.

""We forecast billings +14% to $1.43 billion, at the high end of guidance.”For the June quarter, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate EPS growth of 30% and sales to rise 21%.

361,CRM,"Wednesday was shaping up to be a solid session for the stock market, that is, until the minutes from the late-April Fed meeting were released at 2 p.m. ET.The minutes showed that committee members weren't averse to a rate hike in June if economic data continues to be strong. At the start of the week, the odds of a rate hike at the June meeting, according to CME Group FedWatch, were 4%. Now they're at 34%.

The tech bosses, money men and well-educated workers who have flocked to San Francisco have been called ""some of the most ruthless capitalists around,"" and they have transformed the city's character in a few short years.""The historic power center, the traditional political interests in San Francisco have been destabilized by tech becoming very political in San Francisco,"" said San Francisco Supervisor Aaron Peskin. ""Historically, the landlord industry had power in the city, the traditional Chamber of Commerce had power. But all of them have been eclipsed by the tech juggernaut. It’s as simple as money.""Privately held Airbnb -- a website that lets people rent their homes and apartments to travelers -- is one such recent example of the tech industry's political influence. During the last election cycle, the company spent more than $9 million to defeat a measure seeking to expand regulation over the firm's activities in the city (illegal rentals make up 76% of the listings, according to a local news report). Its opponents spent less than $500,000. Ultimately the company defeated the legislation.And according to city data, Airbnb recently added $245,000 to its campaign war chest, days after elected officials announced another legislative effort to more tightly regulate short-term rentals -- the bread and butter of Airbnb's sales. The company did not respond to several requests for comment. Sf.citi, a nonprofit lobby group backed by tech companies and venture capitalists, also declined to comment.To be sure, Airbnb's business model relies on friendly legislation more than most others do, but the dollar amount of the contributions has raised eyebrows.The tech industry was largely unwilling to discuss the issue on the record with IBD, though some firms issued prepared statements that pointed out charitable donations and volunteer work performed by the companies and their employees.Twitter (TWTR) declined to make executives available for comment but provided IBD with a written statement, as did Salesforce (CRM) and privately held ride-hailing app Uber. Like Uber, Twitter and Salesforce are based in San Francisco. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is a San Francisco native, and his father ran a chain of apparel stores. However, the company would not make Benioff available for comment.Cisco Systems (CSCO), Facebook, PayPal (PYPL) and privately held companies Dropbox and Stripe are among those that, through spokespersons, declined to comment.But for people in certain jobs, it's not easy to avoid commenting on a hot-button issue. Jim Lazarus, senior vice president of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, pointed to Salesforce's charitable contributions as an example of how a number of tech companies are giving back to the community. (Salesforce.com, Alphabet (GOOGL) and many tech companies are members of the S.F. Chamber.) But he acknowledged that the younger people employed by tech companies are, in general, ""not as engaged"" in the community as some would like, though he expressed hope that would change.Lazarus concedes there is a divide, stemming from the significant wage disparity between those employed in high-pay tech and those not so employed.""That's tech in California,"" he said.Lazarus says it's wrong to look at the divide solely through the narrow lens of technology. He says big job growth in sectors such as biotech, health care and education also contribute to the income inequality. And he notes that the services industries also bring some higher-paying jobs for lawyers, accountants and others. ""There is a significant professional service economy,"" he said.Regardless of the complexities of the divide, city residents often express frustration with the high cost of living by protesting -- either in court or on the street -- one of the most visible symbols of the tech industry's supposed hubris: the commuter shuttle. The shorthand is ""Google buses,"" but they are not just shuttles provided by Alphabet's Google.""At least once a week, someone on the street makes an obscene gesture toward our shuttle,"" Genentech employee Michael Stevens wrote to the Board of Supervisors in an email obtained through a public records request by IBD. ""I don't understand this, but I think that kind of behavior is typical of those who resent the shuttles.""IBD obtained more than 1,200 pages of documents about the shuttles, which included dozens of complaints from residents, unions and neighborhood associations. At their core, the idea of the shuttles is to reduce freeway traffic -- which is legendary in Silicon Valley -- as well as pollution, while also providing a perk to tech employees, of course.Google's liaison to the San Francisco government, Rebecca Prozan, declined to comment, referring IBD to the press unit, which did not respond to multiple email messages.Of the buses, Lazarus says that they're a sign that San Francisco is highly desirable place in which to live. ""It's a problem most American cities would love to have,"" he said.The shuttles are often the target of derision, however, and longtime city residents say they helped change the character of the neighborhoods, along with the new residents who have moved in.""It's a top-down, structured environment,"" Erich Werner said, referring to how new communities are being planned. Werner is an electrical contractor who has lived in the city for 32 years. ""What would keep a hamster happy? In this case, the hamster would need a restaurant, some place to party, some kind of light rail to take them there. All the attention is geared toward analysis and addressing perceived needs of a demographic. That's conceptual and literal engineering.""More than changing neighborhoods, the influx of young, well-educated tech workers has created a new breed of tech companies that serve a niche of customers in a city that in many ways is not representative of the broader market. ""There are a lot of products and services being created for San Francisco, and I'm not sure that's sustainable,"" said Myles Weissleder, who has lived in the Bay Area and worked in technology since the 1990s. He's founder of SFNewTech, which puts together monthly networking events focused on technology.""Are there efficiencies in private transportation services?,"" he said. ""Certainly. But there are impacts on neighborhoods, there are costs -- all of those little things are impacts, they are unforeseen consequences.""Despite increasing wariness among venture capitalists to fund startups, rents keep rising, and business carries on as usual. But even people connected to the technology industry feel some uncertainty.""These companies will run out of steam,"" Weissleder said, ""and I foresee some kind of shake-up as the money dries up.""

363,CRM,"Medical-device giant Medtronic (MDT) narrowly beat Wall Street's Q4 expectations Tuesday, but its stock slipped as margins continued to weaken.Expectations were fairly high going into the quarter, with Medtronic stock trading near all-time highs and competitors' Q1 reports indicating market-share gains.""Read-throughs from Boston Scientific (BSX) and St. Jude Medical (STJ) indicate that Medtronic continues to gain ICD (implantable cardioverter defibrillator) market share with its MRI-safe labeling, and pacing share with Reveal LINQ and the Advisa MRI-safe pacer,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro wrote in a May 12 research note.That appeared to be borne out in the report on the quarter and the fiscal year ended April 29, released early Tuesday. Medtronic's sales rose 4% over the year-earlier quarter (when adjusted for last year's Covidien acquisition) to $7.57 billion, about $80 million ahead of analysts' consensus, according to Thomson Reuters. Earnings, excluding one-time items, climbed 9% to $1.27 a share, a penny above Wall Street's average estimate.Medtronic guided fiscal 2017 EPS on the low side of consensus, at $4.60 to $4.70. It said revenue on a constant-currency basis should grow 4% to 6%, which was on the high side.""Gross and operating margins again fell below not only us and consensus but also management guidance for the quarter, which could reinforce what we believe are ongoing investor concerns about the company's ability to deliver on its positive operating leverage targets post-Covidien,"" wrote Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy in a research note.She added that in the second half of the current fiscal year, ""Medtronic will be facing ramping top-line headwinds in some key business, not least of which include the competitive launch of new CRM (cardiac rhythm management) and DES (drug-eluting stent) products as well as continued pressures in Spine and Neuromodulation.""Medtronic stock closed down 1.5% on the stock market today at 80.48. The stock hit an all-time high of 81.99 on May 16, and has since traded near that range. It has a strong IBD Composite Rating of 91, putting it among the top 9% of stocks in such key metrics as sales and earnings growth.

365,CRM,"There are two possible explanations for why markets so badly misjudged how close the Federal Reserve is to resuming interest-rate hikes.One possibility is that investors misread Fed Chair Janet Yellen's speech on March 29 asserting that ""caution is especially warranted"" when it comes to raising rates with global risks so high and policymakers so low on conventional ammunition to counteract a downturn.Yet it seems much more likely that markets received the surprisingly dovish message as it was intended and responded just as Yellen hoped, easing global stresses that had grown as the dollar's rise exacerbated pressure on China to devalue its dollar-linked currency.Wednesday's release of the minutes from the Fed's April 27 meeting -- less than a month after Yellen's market-shifting speech -- suggest another explanation. Yellen went out on a limb. While she was able to move markets, she couldn't get other generally dovish policy-committee members to follow her.Now the U.S. dollar index is rebounding, reaching its highest point since -- you guessed it -- Yellen's March 29 speech, which isn't great news for U.S. multinationals like General Electric (GE) and Apple (AAPL), whose foreign earnings take a hit when the dollar rises. On an otherwise good-news day thanks to earnings surprises from Wal-Mart (WMT), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Cisco Systems (CSCO), the S&P 500 is testing lows also not seen since her New York Economic Club appearance.IBD's Take: How strong is Salesforce's stock -- and how does it stack up vs. rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupIn recent weeks, markets had pegged December or possibly next February for the likely timing of the Fed's next rate hike, with the odds of June falling close to zero. Now the odds favor a July hike and there's a roughly 40% chance of a second hike by December, according to the CME Group FedWatch page.""A June hike ... seems to be a very realistic scenario,"" wrote Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research. ""The only real question remains whether the last round of data is enough to convince the more cautious FOMC members, most likely including Chair Yellen ... that the growth rebound is more than a fluke.""On Thursday, New York Fed President William Dudley said at a press briefing that ""a tightening in the summer, the June, July time frame is a reasonable expectation.""He noted that market expectations of a summer rate hike were ""way too low"" in recent weeks. That echoed other Fed officials this week.Probably the most surprising part of the April meeting minutes was the characterization that ""Most participants judged ... it likely would be appropriate for the Committee to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in June,"" provided that economic growth picked up after a slow first quarter, labor market conditions continued to strengthen and inflation moved closer to 2%.Even though most members credited the Fed's dovish inter-meeting communications for the easing of global financial conditions, most Fed policymakers were anxious to begin removing policy accommodation, ignoring Yellen's call four weeks earlier to tread with extra care.It seems likely that Yellen -- unless she backed away from her strong stance in such short order -- wasn't part of the majority thinking a June rate hike might be appropriate. That would be quite a change from her predecessor Ben Bernanke's apparent ease in building a consensus.Yellen's speech had essentially positioned the Fed, at least temporarily, as the world's central bank, making global growth economic and financial risks from China and other emerging markets just as much a part of the rate-setting calculus as inflation at home.But while her stance seemed prudent in light of the market turmoil that followed closely after the Fed's move to raise rates in December for the first time in a nearly a decade, her colleagues showed that they're not prepared to play central bankers to the world -- unless it's clear that the world is falling apart.

375,CRM,"Zendesk (ZEN) is expected to elaborate on plans to compete with bigger rivals Salesforce.com (CRM) and Oracle (ORCL) when the provider of customer-support software holds its investor day on Tuesday.Zendesk in November expanded a partnership with Microsoft (MSFT), whose Office 365 is the most widely used cloud app by businesses. Providing support for Microsoft’s cloud platforms could help Zendesk vs. Salesforce.com and Oracle, analysts say. Oracle acquired RightNow in 2011 to boost its efforts in customer-support software.Zendesk, which aims to sell more to larger companies and enterprises, as well as to its longtime base of smaller and midsize businesses, also competes with Freshdesk and Desk.com.Research firm Gartner estimates that 80% of Zendesk’s customer base has 20 users or less. With $209 million in 2015 revenue, Zendesk has touted a $1 billion target by 2020.“We expect much investor interest around the trajectory of Zendesk's path toward their $1B revenue goal in 2020,” wrote Stan Zlotsky, a Morgan Stanley analyst, in a research report out Monday. “With the unveiling of the new CFO, Elena Gomez, we think investors will be looking to better understand her thinking around the $1B target and any potential upside/downside risks.“Given the renewed market focus on profitability, in addition to growth, we believe an update on the company's plans for cash generation and reaching positive operating margins would be very helpful in framing investors' expectations.”Zendesk stock jumped last week after the enterprise software company reported a smaller-than-expected Q1 loss and raised its full-year 2016 revenue guidance, breaking out of a cup-with-handle base at a 23.87 buy point. Zendesk stock was up more than 1% in early afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 23.75.Zendesk, with its shares up less than 3% in the past 12 months, has a so-so IBD Composite Rating of 64 out of a possible 99.

Amazon stock surged to an all-time high on Tuesday, as the Wall Street Journal reported that Salesforce.com (CRM) was building a new service that uses AWS.AWS was a big reason Amazon reported its highest sales growth in nearly four years when it posted first-quarter earnings on April 28, sending the stock up nearly 10% the following day.Amazon is an IBD Leaderboard stock, with a strong IBD Composite Rating of 95, where 99 is highest. Akamai has a 59 CR.Bellini, who has a sell rating on Akamai stock, attended the 2016 Content Delivery Summit in New York on Monday, gaining views on market trends.“A key takeaway was that the competitive landscape remains intense, as Comcast looks to triple its CDN capacity next year,” wrote Bellini.Comcast, the No. 1 cable TV company, has been expanding commercial services to businesses. Comcast moved into CDN services in late 2014, Bellini noted.One market trend could work in Comcast’s favor, said the Goldman Sachs analyst. “Multi-CDN deployments were a key theme of the conference,"" she wrote, ""with new startups making it easy to route traffic across multiple CDNs.”Cambridge, Mass.-based Akamai is the No. 1 provider of CDN services. Worries that big customers such as Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) are shifting more of their data traffic to their own CDNs have pressured Akamai stock.Aside from AWS and Comcast, Akamai competes with Level 3 Communications (LVLT), Limelight Networks (LLNW), and Verizon Communications (VZ), as well as startups Fastly and CloudFlare.

380,CRM,"The Federal Reserve convinced markets that a June rate hike is on the table. Warren Buffett disclosed a big Apple (AAPL) stake. Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW) and Wal-Mart (WMT) reported strong results, but Target (TGT), Gap (GPS) and Ross Stores (ROST) were among those with weak results or outlooks. Cisco (CSCO) and Salesforce (CRM) had upbeat reports that were good news for IT spending. General Motors (GM) and Uber tested self-driving cars on the road, joining Alphabet (GOOGL) Google cars, while Google held a major developers conference.The major averages continued to move sideways in a choppy fashion as the market remains under pressure. The Nasdaq rose 1.1% for the week after falling for the prior four weeks. The S&P 500 eked out a 0.3% rise while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.2%, its fourth straight weekly decline. The S&P 500 and Dow moved back above their 50-day moving averages on Monday as Apple rose on Buffett's stake, but then fell back as near-term Fed rate hike buzz took hold, pushing up the dollar. Thanks to Friday gains, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq are slightly higher for the week.While some stocks broke out -- Salesforce and Lowe's -- older breakouts struggled. Facebook (FB) closed just below a buy point Thursday, though it regained its entry point on Friday. McDonald's (MCD) fell below its late March entry area.Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s April meeting showed policymakers are close to raising benchmark interest rates again next month, surprising Fed watchers who priced in an increase later in the year. But before raise rates for a second time, the Fed wants to see signs growth is picking up in Q2, along with stronger labor markets and inflation heading for the 2% target.New York Fed President William Dudley said the next day a rate hike in the June-July timeframe is reasonable, unless the economy stumbles.

Buffett's investment reflects confidence in Apple's pipeline of products, including future iPhones or even a rumored Apple Car. But it also suggests a shift in Apple's lifecycle from a growth company to a value play.Apple stock rose 5.2% for the week after hitting a 23-month low in the prior week.Playing catch-up, Alphabet's Google introduced a voice-activated Wi-Fi speaker system with built-in search.

Profit and sales guidance was also bullish. Analysts had lowered expectations ahead of Cisco earnings due to the growing number of companies outsourcing to cloud computing service providers such as Amazon Web Services, reducing demand for Cisco’s networking gear. The lowered expectations also reflected lower spending on information technology overall.Well aware of the trends, Cisco is diversifying into newer, higher-growth segments such as software, data centers, security, wireless and the Internet of Things market.Cisco stock rose 5.4% for the week.The Energy Information Administration reported a domestic stockpile increase of 1.3 million barrels vs. a 3 million barrel decline expected by analysts.

But sales dropped 5% to $16.2 billion, missing estimates. Same-store sales grew 1.2%, short of predictions for a 1.6% gain.

Sales rose 0.9% to $115.9 billion vs. forecasts for a drop to $113.2 billion. U.S. same-store sales climbed 1%, the seventh straight gain.

Uber on Thursday also posted a photo of a hybrid Ford (F) Fusion outfitted with self-driving technology that it said would be undergoing testing.GM and Lyft plan to road-test autonomous Bolt taxis in the coming months, and Ford has established a subsidiary focused on autonomous-car technology and ride-sharing. But the carmakers face stiff competition from the likes of Toyota (TM), Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet, which recently inked a tech deal with Fiat Chrysler (FCAU).Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (RRGB) plunged 21% this week to a 3-year low on weak sales and slashed revenue guidance. Sonic (SONC) said it would miss its own fiscal Q3 same-store sales target, triggering an 8.65% weekly stock loss. The reports, which followed a weak May 11 sales outlook from Wendy’s (WEN), intensified fears about burger competition as both value and upscale offerings spread. Wendy’s stock fell 2.8%. Shake Shack (SHAK), which popped on solid results earlier this month, slid 6.9%. McDonald’s lost 4.9%.Campbell Soup (CPB) and Hormel (HRL) reported disappointing quarterly results, perhaps indicating that sluggish consumer spending is spilling over into the foods group. Hormel, the parent of Spam lunch meat, Skippy peanut butter and other leading brands, plunged xx% for the week to a 2016 low. Q2 earnings growth was strong as sales in 4 of 5 product groups rose, Hormel also raised guidance. But its Q2 profit margin shrank to 11.9% before interest and taxes, down from 14.4% in the prior quarter. Campbell said fiscal Q3 EPS rose 5% to 65 cents, beating by a penny. But sales fell 1.6% to $1.87 bil, missing Wall Street’s target. Shares fell 6.4% Friday and 9.4% for the week, falling to a 3-month low.

381,CRM,"Ten years ago Amazon (AMZN) launched Amazon Web Services, one of the earliest experiments with cloud computing that Chief Executive Jeff Bezos recently described as the planting of a ""tiny seed.""That seed has turned into a giant beanstalk. Sales for the unit, known as AWS, now are on pace to reach $12.5 billion for the year, based on first-quarter results.And thanks to its early entry in the business, AWS is now the leader in cloud computing, with a market share of 31%. The next closest competitor is Microsoft (MSFT) with 9%, followed by IBM (IBM), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Cloud unit, and Salesforce.com (CRM).""This year, Amazon became the fastest company ever to reach $100 billion in annual sales,"" Bezos said in his April 6 letter, reflecting on the 2015 fiscal year. ""Also this year, Amazon Web Services is reaching $10 billion in annual sales, doing so at a pace even faster than Amazon achieved that milestone.""AWS is a collection of services, including storage, networking, application services and other features businesses pay to use on an as-needed basis via the cloud. It's a business that Bezos says has been built organically without significant acquisitions.In the first quarter, the unit had sales of $2.56 billion, up 64% year over year, compared with 28% growth in total company sales. AWS comprises 15% of total sales for the period, up from 11.7% a year ago.""The reason to hold Amazon stock is AWS,"" said Dan Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Co., which owns 41,802 Amazon shares. ""AWS is the gem in the haystack.""Microsoft and Alphabet, in particular, are being aggressive with increased investments in cloud technology, said Morgan, which could create some risk of future pricing pressure. But it’s not a big concern in that Amazon has demonstrated the ability to weather price wars in times past, he said.AWS was a big reason Amazon reported its highest sales growth in nearly four years when it posted first-quarter earnings on April 28. The e-commerce powerhouse swung to a first-quarter profit of $1.07 a share, which crushed the consensus estimate of 58 cents, and swung from a loss of 12 cents a share a year earlier.Revenue jumped 28% to $29.1 billion, ahead of the $28 billion view. Amazon sees total second-quarter revenue of $28 billion to $30.5 billion, with the midpoint 26% above Wall Street forecasts of $28.3 billion.""Amazon has, in a lot of ways, become a part of everyday life,"" said David Smith, a vice president and analyst at research firm Gartner. ""It’s not just through the purchase of goods and entertainment. Even with AWS, people are in contact with Amazon in ways they don’t even know.""Amazon stock broke out April 13 and is up 10% since then, despite a selloff in the Nasdaq overall. Shares slipped in mid-April, then jumped 10% the day after Amazon reported first-quarter earnings. The stock ended Friday trading up more than 2% to 673.95 in the stock market today.Amazon received several price upgrades following the earnings report. One came from John Blackledge, a Cowen analyst, who upped his price to 830 from 750. Another was from Shebly Seyrafi, analyst at FBN Securities, who raised his price target to 800 from 685, with a research note titled ""Hitting on All Cylinders.""""This was a very strong report from Amazon,"" Seyrafi wrote, which he said was the result of strong top- and bottom-line growth, strong gains with AWS and international growth, which rose 26% to $9.6 billion. There is ""ample room ahead"" for continued growth in its core retail business, he wrote.That primary source of Amazon's revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers through its Amazon.com website, both in the U.S. and abroad. Revenue from this category, referred to in its earnings reports as electronics and other general merchandise, rose 31% in the first quarter to $20.55 billion.Growth was fueled by the increasing number of annual subscribers to Amazon Prime. Initially a free-shipping service, Prime's membership base has been a source of extensive and envious consumer loyalty for Amazon. The membership now includes access to Prime Video, a Netflix-like service, Prime Music, which provides free music streaming, and unlimited photo storage with Prime Photos.Nomura analyst Robert Drbul says Prime has helped Amazon in several ways.""We believe Amazon has established significant brand equity here in the U.S. and that its leadership position remains quite secure."" Drbul said in a research note after first-quarter earnings. ""While the size of its Prime base remains undisclosed, we believe the loyalty rivals that of the Costco Executive Membership base.""A part of Amazon’s success is its willingness to experiment in many ways with new products and services, something that Bezos says has been essential to the company's success.""To invent you have to experiment, and if you know in advance that it’s going to work, it’s not an experiment,"" Bezos wrote in the shareholder letter. ""We want to be a large company that’s also an invention machine.""Some experiments have flopped, like the Amazon Fire smartphone, while others have become unexpected hits, like the Echo, an in-home, voice-activated device that connects to WiFi. On request it plays music, read books, provides traffic and weather, helps people order pizza or request service from Uber, among many other features.Eventually, some analysts think Amazon could elect to get into the shipping business, much as it entered cloud computing services business with AWS. Like Amazon’s growing delivery capacity, AWS began out of necessity as the company built up its infrastructure to fulfill its own growing needs and expanded to serve other companies from there.There's evidence already that Amazon is on the road to compete with the likes of FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS). For one, the company has announced the purchase of a fleet of trucks to ferry goods between fulfillment centers. Plus, Amazon announced an agreement to lease up to 20 Boeing 767s from Air Transport Services Group, in an effort to expedite delivery of goods.Amazon has said the additional shipping capacity is especially helpful during peak delivery times, which other shippers are overloaded.“This gives us extra capacity and we think it's good to be able to deliver to customers,"" Phil Hardin, Amazon director of investor relations, said on the company's earnings call, ""and we think it makes sense over the long term.""

385,CRM,"Apple (AAPL) needs to jump into “bot” platform development or its app-based software ecosystem will be threatened, says a UBS report.Facebook (FB) recently introduced “chatbots” built into its messaging service while Microsoft (MSFT) launched its “Bot Framework” software tools for developers, putting pressure on Apple to respond, says the UBS report.Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google, like Apple, has lagged amid a flurry of bot announcements. But Google plans a bigger push into artificial intelligence, its CEO recently said.A bot is software that automates tasks. Consumer applications for bots include buying movie tickets or making hotel reservations. Businesses are using bots to handle things such as customer service or scheduling meetings. Chatbots, meanwhile, are software programs that simulate conversation about a range of topics.The UBS report is based on a meeting with Bruce Wilcox, director of natural language strategy at Kore, a startup developing bots for enterprise platforms such as Salesforce.com (CRM). Apple has been moving into the enterprise market — large companies and government agencies — by partnering with IBM (IBM).According to Wilcox, bots will displace apps in many tasks if using them is made simple.“Do I think that Apple’s in trouble if it doesn’t do something in a bot’s world? Sure, because why would you want to download and install all sorts of apps from the App Store when you can get access to bots effectively through one app?,” Wilcox told UBS.“iPhones have had a charisma of a better user experience,” he added. “Bots are going to be wiping out user interface distinctions. The App Store will sell fewer things. People will have less reason to buy an iPhone. So yes, Apple’s going to have to do something.”Apple may be able to use its Siri voice recognition technology along with artificial intelligence to catch up in bots, says the UBS report. Amazon.com (AMZN) is expected to forge ahead with its virtual assistant, called Alexa.""Apple’s Siri is a question/answer bot. You ask it a question, it gives you an answer. End of discussion. She finds the answer to questions but does not control the world. Bot platforms try to do both,"" said Wilcox. ""Alexa is sort of a bot platform. You can route your requests through her to some specific bot effectively. So it is a bot platform. Facebook is in a good position because they have a dominant messaging platform. Facebook has zillions of users. Developers have a strong incentive to get that user base available to themselves.""

Microsoft (MSFT) was off 1%.One stock in IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise industry group, that of cloud advertising software developer Rubicon Project (RUBI), enjoys a slightly better IBD Composite Rating than Ultimate: Rubicon's best-possible 99 vs. Ultimate's 98. Salesforce carries a 93 CR and SAP 72. Outside the group, Oracle is rated 60 and Microsoft 43.Ultimate's 40% EPS growth rate was the best in eight quarters, but its 29% sales pace was the best in at least 19 periods.For the second quarter, Ultimate guided its adjusted operating margin to 20% and total sales to $187 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are expecting earnings of 77 cents per share minus items on revenue of $185 million. A year ago in Q2, Ultimate earned an adjusted 62 cents per share on sales of $147 million.Needham analyst Scott Berg said he was ""impressed"" that Ultimate reported consecutive quarterly deferred revenue growth exceeding 30% in the first quarter and year-to-year deferred revenue up 34.5%, its best in at least six years. He reiterated a buy rating with a 220 price target.

387,CRM,"Realizing that more big customers than ever are paying bigger dollars for ServiceNow (NOW) software in the cloud, investors bought up ServiceNow stock Thursday, healing much of the pain that they endured through the infamous Software Slump of January and February.ServiceNow stock shot up 18% in morning trade on the stock market today before easing back to a 15% gain, near 74.50, Thursday afternoon. It's 18% off a record high at 91.28 set Dec. 4, but it's more than 60% up from the nearly two-year low of 46 reached Feb. 8.ServiceNow late Wednesday issued first-quarter earnings and sales that exceeded Wall Street estimates.Shares of rival SAP (SAP) were down a fraction Thursday afternoon, but Salesforce.com (CRM) stock was up 1%.""We now have 249 customers each paying us more than $1 million in annualized contract value, an increase of 48% year over year,"" ServiceNow CFO Michael Scarpelli said in the company's earnings release. ""We also landed a record 13 upsells in the (first) quarter, each with an annualized contract value greater than $1 million.""Those results helped drive Q1 revenue up 44% to $305.9 million vs. the $301 million expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) EPS rose to nine cents from a penny in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts had expected seven cents.Excluded from the adjusted earnings, among other things, were $270 million in legal expenses to settle patent infringement lawsuits that BMC Software and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) brought against ServiceNow. It brought the bottom line to a $333 million net loss vs. $58 million lost a year earlier, or a $2.06 GAAP loss per share vs. a 38-cent loss in 2015's Q1.Analysts and investors prefer to concentrate on the apples-to-apples non-GAAP comparisons.William Blair analyst Justin Furby reiterated his firm's outperform rating on ServiceNow without a price target, though he said, ""The stock can double (or more)"" over the next five years.""All other first-quarter metrics (revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS, deferred revenue, free cash flow) came in ahead of guidance and the Street, and the company's second-quarter billings outlook of 31%-33% growth (37%-39% subscription billings growth) bracketed the consensus view of 32%,"" said Furby in a Thursday research note.Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis maintained a buy rating with a 90 price target on ServiceNow. ""We believe full-year guidance is likely conservative and sets the company up to outperform for the remainder of the year,"" he said in a Thursday note.FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi raised his price target on ServiceNow stock to 90 from 80.

388,CRM,"Investors are hoping fast-growing supply-chain software developer Manhattan Associates (MANH) will say something Tuesday to help re-accelerate growth. Not that Manhattan is any slouch, but the 15% improvement in first-quarter earnings that it's expected to disclose after Tuesday's market close would be its slowest year-to-year growth rate in 15 quarters. Six of those 15 quarters have topped 30% earnings growth, including Q3 and Q4 2015, and all but two of the last 15 topped 20%.While still 25% off a record high 77.75 set Dec. 7, Manhattan Associates stock was up more than 1.5% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 58 and 31% above its 44.27 nadir hit Feb. 8 during this year's software slump. Most of its bigger enterprise-software rivals have been faring better, with the biggest, Oracle (ORCL) up fractionally, 9% off recent highs. Enterprise software maker SAP (SAP) was also up fractionally and just 2% off a recent high, while Salesforce.com (CRM) was up more than 1%, just 7% off its recent high.The entire IBD Computer Software-Enterprise industry group, which does not include Oracle as a member, is about 9% off its Nov. 9 high. Oracle is a member of IBD's Computer Software-Database group, which is 22% off an August high.Among the re-accelerants that management might discuss Tuesday is just how much its new distribution management (DM) tools announced last week might contribute to revenue. Its new DM Mobile platform gives users ""the ability to address any operational issues, including inventory issues, directly from the floor via their tablet devices, increasing mobility and driving productivity and efficiency,"" the company announced at the MODEX supply-chain management show in Atlanta.On Feb. 3, just before Manhattan stock tanked more than 20% in three trading sessions, William Blair analyst Matthew Pfau said in a research note that ""the 2016 EPS guidance that management provided is conservative, and through a combination of revenue growth, operating expense leverage and share repurchases we expect Manhattan to continue to increase its EPS in excess of 15% over the next several years.""We recommend shares to long-term investors looking for a midcap software company with a strong record of execution and sustainable earnings growth opportunity.""By consensus, Pfau and four other Wall Street analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Manhattan to deliver Q1 earnings up 15% to 39 cents per share minus items, on revenue up 8.9% to $145.5 million. That would be a record quarter in hard dollars, but the year-over-year rate would be only slightly better than Q4's 8% growth to $141 million and only the third time in 15 quarters that its sales growth had slipped into single digits. Over the past five years, it's averaged 14% sales growth annually and 15% earnings growth.Manhattan guided full 2016 non-GAAP EPS to a range of $1.69 to $1.72, the midpoint slightly below analysts' $1.71 consensus, or up 12.5% from 2015. It guided 2016 sales to a range of $609 million to $615 million, its midpoint coinciding with analysts' $612 million consensus, up 10% from 2015.""Although the retail environment remains challenging, Manhattan has not seen a material change in IT purchasing trends from retails and the pipeline is still strong,"" Pfau said. ""However, we believe that management's guidance takes into account a cautious retail IT spending environment for 2016.""While Manhattan's core software manages warehouse inventory, its visualization tools allow users to see everything from the manufacturer's supplies to the consumer's purchase at the checkout counter. Pfau noted that 70% of its total license revenue comes from its basic warehouse management systems (WMS) license revenue, so WMS is a ""leading indicator for sales of Manhattan's other solutions."" License revenue, however, amounts to only 14% of its total revenue. Most of its sales, 77%, come from services related to its software licenses.""We will continue to be a serial investor in innovation,"" Manhattan CEO Eddie Capel said in February.

389,CRM,"Workflow software developer ServiceNow (NOW) lightened its wallet by $270 million, then lightened its stock price Thursday.ServiceNow stock stumbled 3% after the bell in the stock market today before recovering. It was down a fraction, above 63, in afternoon trading Thursday, 30% off its record high of 91.28, set Dec. 4. ServiceNow went public in December 2012 at 18.Investors seemed none too pleased with the size of ServiceNow's disclosure to the Securities and Exchange Commission, filed after Wednesday's close, to settle patent infringement litigation with BMC Software and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). ServiceNow had disclosed in early March that at least some settlement was imminent.Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock was down more than 1% Thursday afternoon. ServiceNow rivals SAP (SAP) and Salesforce.com (CRM) were both up a fraction, with SAP just 2% off recent highs and Salesforce 8% off an all-time high 81.24 set March 31.ServiceNow, which delivers its software via the cloud, said that it is taking the $270 million charge in its first quarter, which it's slated to report Wednesday after the market close.""The settlement terms are rather significant, at over one-third of ServiceNow's net cash balance as of Dec. 31, 2015, but still represent less than one year's free cash flow (management has guided for $325 million of free cash flow in 2016), and both management and investors should welcome having these lawsuits in the rearview mirror,"" said William Blair analyst Justin Furby in a research note Thursday.He said, ""The company should benefit from the removal of ongoing legal fees that have been included in non-GAAP expenses."" Furby said that he won't be changing his Q1 estimates for ServiceNow but will look for ""additional detail"" on Wednesday.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected ServiceNow to report earnings per share minus items of seven cents, up from a penny in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue is expected to rise 42% to $301 million. With revenue rising 47% for 2015, the company topped $1 billion in sales for the first time last year, contributing to its three-year 60% sales growth rate.RBC Capital Management analyst Matthew Hedberg estimated that the settlement would cost $1.50 per share off ServiceNow's presettlement cash balance of $7 per share.Hedberg, who still rates ServiceNow a ""top pick,"" said in a Thursday research note, ""There could be slight upside to forward margin expectations given an early resolution, as management likely planned for a longer trial and additional expenses."" He noted ""no future royalty payments"" from the settlements.""Overall, we are glad to put this issue to bed and believe focus can now return fully to execution, which had been less than ideal in 2015,"" he said.Despite its fast growth, ServiceNow experienced growing pains in 2015, so analysts will look for clues that might firm up expectations for 2016. For the year, Wall Street expects EPS of 60 cents minus items on sales of $1.36 billion, up from 40 cents on $1 billion in 2015.After meeting with ServiceNow CFO Mike Scarpelli Feb. 2, Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne said in a research note that the company is going to remain in the penalty box until investors feel more comfortable about the 2016 forecast. He pointed out that ServiceNow had missed its own annual contract value target in 2015 due to ""elevated sales turnover"" and a pause in hiring in Q2.Sales staff hiring ramped up late last year, but billings guidance of 33% to 34% growth for 2016 ""assumes very little/no sales productivity improvement and modest growth expectations for EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) as the new regional sales head ramps up,"" Materne warned.Still, he had a buy rating and 83 price target on ServiceNow stock, seeing growth in its market and in adoption rates for its platform. The company now averages seven custom apps per customer, up from 5.6 a year ago, Materne pointed out.

390,CRM,"With its stock trading within shouting distance of its all-time high, Adobe Systems (ADBE) earned a price-target hike on Tuesday from investment bank FBR Capital Markets.Adobe stock was up a fraction to above 93 in midday trading on the stock market today. The provider of cloud-based media and marketing software hit a record high of 98 on March 18. It sports a good IBD Relative Strength Rating of 85, putting it among the top 15% of all stocks in performance the past 12 months.FBR analyst Samad Samana raised his price target on Adobe stock to 115 from 110 and reiterated his market perform rating.He predicts Adobe will see 20%-plus revenue growth and 30%-plus EPS growth for the next two years. Adobe has shifted its business from perpetual license software to software-as-a-service delivered over the Internet.“We believe the transition to a subscription model has yielded a more attractive business model,” Samana said. “We expect this to be reflected in fiscal 2016 and beyond.”Adobe has three cloud computing businesses: Creative Cloud, Marketing Cloud and Document Cloud. The biggest is Creative Cloud, which includes software for creative professionals such as Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign.Marketing Cloud provides online marketing and advertising services. Document Cloud leverages Adobe’s popular online document-sharing product Acrobat and its ubiquitous PDF format.The company’s Creative Cloud business earns most of the attention, but its Marketing Cloud is maturing at the right time, Samana said.“Digital marketing is at or near the top of the priority list for enterprises, and Adobe appears well positioned to help companies transform their businesses to be more engaging with end customers,” he said in a research report.Adobe should be able to continue posting healthy growth in the digital marketing business despite competition from Alphabet (GOOGL), Oracle (ORCL), Salesforce.com (CRM) and others, he said.RELATED:Adobe Driving Third Wave Of Enterprise Software Disruption

391,CRM,"While SAP (SAP) late Friday preannounced Q1 earnings and revenue that missed Wall Street views, investors Monday were buoyed by the German enterprise software company's assurances that its pipeline is flowing strongly into Q2.SAP stock was up a fraction, near 77, in afternoon trading in the stock market today, just 7% off an 18-month high of 82.70 set July 25.In its release Friday, SAP CEO Bill McDermott said he expects ""increasing momentum"" in 2016. Shares of rival Salesforce.com (CRM) were down a fraction Monday afternoon, but rival Oracle (ORCL) was up a fraction.With final Q1 results scheduled for release April 20 before the open, SAP issued preliminary earnings of 0.64 euros per share minus items (73 cents at Monday's exchange rate), up 9%, where Wall Street analysts expected 0.70 euros. It said revenue rose 5% to 4.73 billion euros (or $5.39 billion), short of the 4.85 billion euros and 4.82 billion euros that Evercore ISI and Wall Street projected, respectively, observed Evercore ISI in a research note.One euro was worth about $1.14 Monday.In a research note Sunday, Evercorse ISI analyst Kirk Materne said he's looking for ""more color"" from SAP on April 20,  but ""we expect the (Q1) license shortfall and comments around a slower start in the Americas are going to pressure shares on Monday despite SAP reiterating its full-year guidance and the comments around a 'strong (Q2) pipeline.' ""Materne maintained a buy rating on SAP stock, but said ""we continue to favor Oracle (ORCL) and Microsoft (MSFT) in  mega-cap software.""RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan maintained a sector perform rating on SAP stock but lowered his price target to 78 from 81.MacMillan noted that SAP's Q1 cloud bookings of 140 million euros rose 22% year over year, and more than 25% in constant currency.""We view this as slightly disappointing"" following Q4's 75% ""organic growth,"" less than 50% in constant currency, ""although do note that (Q1) is a seasonally weak quarter,"" MacMillan said. ""SAP also added over 500 new S4HANA customers, of which around 30% (i.e. about 150) are net new. While well below about 1,400 customer adds in (Q4), we would expect (Q1) to be seasonally weaker.""He said weakness in the energy sector and ""some pull forward of demand"" in Q4 due to S4HANA product promotions drove SAP's softness in Q1. ""As a result, we think there is limited read-through for other companies in enterprise software.""Got that, Salesforce.com sellers?""SAP’s fundamental growth drivers are rock solid, from our best-in-class S4HANA applications to our completeness of vision in the cloud,” said SAP's McDermott in Friday's release. ""We expect increasing momentum as the year progresses, fully consistent with our guidance for the full year. SAP continues to be a highly profitable growth company.”HANA is SAP's linchpin business software suite.CFO Luka Mucic said the Americas, dragged by Brazil, ""got off to a slower start.""

392,CRM,"Grain and soybean prices tumbled amid speculation that ample global supplies will be enough to make up for losses in South America, where farmers are contending with dual threats of flooding and dry weather.Wheat futures plunged the most in three years as winter-crop concerns eased in the U.S., one of the top exporters. Soybeans headed for the biggest drop since August, a day after entering a bull market on estimates that floods will reduce output in Argentina, the world’s third-biggest grower. Corn dropped after rallying in recent weeks as dry conditions threatened crops in Brazil.The recent rally marked a reversal for agriculture markets that have slumped for much of the past three years amid consecutive bumper harvests worldwide. Gains may have been exaggerated, with grain stockpiles at the highest in three decades, while weather conditions improved in the U.S. and Russia.“We are going to see some reductions in South America for soybeans, but we still have ample stocks,” said Benjamin Bodart, a director at CRM Agri-Commodities. “It’s back to reality now. Back to the fundamentals. The market’s just got crazy, and it has probably been slightly overdone.”Wheat futures for July delivery tumbled 5.6% to $4.755 a bushel at 11:14 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. A close at that price would mark the biggest drop for a most-active contract since March 28, 2013.Soybean futures for July delivery slumped 3.5% to $9.9175 a bushel. On Thursday, the price touched $10.4375, the highest since July, and closed up 20% from a low in November, meeting the common definition of a bull market.Image provided by Shutterstock.

393,CRM,"Microsoft (MSFT) late Thursday reported fiscal third-quarter sales and earnings that missed Wall Street’s targets, as did its sales guidance, prompting investors to sell off shares of the software giant.The Redmond, Wash.-based company earned 62 cents excluding items, flat with the year-earlier quarter, on sales of $22.08 billion, up 2%, in the quarter ended March 31. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected 64 cents EPS and $22.09 billion in sales.For the current quarter, Microsoft expects sales of $22.05 billion, based on the midpoint of its guidance. That would be down slightly from $22.18 billion in sales in year-ago quarter, and it’s nearly $1 billion below the $23.04 billion modeled by Wall Street.It did not give an EPS target for its fiscal fourth quarter, but analysts polled by Thomson Reuters have modeled 66 cents EPS, up 10%.Microsoft stock was down more than 5% in after-hours trading, following the earnings release. During the regular session, Microsoft rose a fraction to 55.78 on the stock market today. Microsoft stock had been trading just below its all-time high of 56.85, reached on Dec. 29. Investors have been upbeat over Microsoft’s transition from desktop software to Internet cloud computing services, such as Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics CRM Online. Microsoft’s commercial cloud business in Q3 reached an annualized revenue run rate of over $10 billion.“Organizations using digital technology to transform and drive new growth increasingly choose Microsoft as a partner,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. “As these organizations turn to us, we’re seeing momentum across Microsoft’s cloud services and with Windows 10.”Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Microsoft reported earnings per share of 47 cents, down 23% year over year, on sales of $21.73 billion, down 6%. Microsoft’s non-GAAP results included a $1.5 billion revenue deferral primarily related to Windows 10.Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, Microsoft’s sales would have risen 5% on a non-GAAP basis.“Overall we had a solid quarter,” Nadella said on the company’s earnings conference call with analysts.Microsoft earnings per share were negatively impacted by a higher tax rate in the quarter as well as foreign exchange rates. In constant currency, Microsoft’s non-GAAP EPS was up 10% year over year.“Our customers continue to make long-term commitments based on our compelling roadmap,” Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said on the call.Of Microsoft’s three business segments, Intelligent Cloud was the top performer. Its sales rose 3% (up 8% in constant currency) to $6.1 billion. The Intelligent Cloud segment includes server products and services such as Windows Server, SQL Server, System Center and Azure.Microsoft’s Productivity and Business Processes unit saw sales rise 1% (6% in constant currency) to $6.5 billion. Office 365 consumer and commercial offerings and Dynamics CRM Online were big contributors in the quarter.Microsoft’s More Personal Computing unit increased sales by 1% (3% in constant currency) to $9.5 billion. The unit includes Windows software, PC and phone hardware, Bing search and Xbox gaming.Microsoft’s Q3 results were hurt in part by a weak personal computer market. Microsoft’s Windows revenue declined 2% in constant currency. The company, though, said Windows outperformed the overall PC market because of a higher mix of premium sales.Sagging PC sales also pinched chipmaker Intel (INTC), which on Tuesday missed Wall Street’s Q1 revenue target.

394,CRM,"Technology companies such as Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google and Facebook (FB) were among 20 of the top 25 highest-paying U.S. companies in 2016, employment-related website Glassdoor said Wednesday.Competition for talent is especially fierce in the tech sector, adding pressure to pay. In recent years, tech giants like Apple (AAPL) and Google have settled claims that they conspired to avoid poaching each others' workers.Apple reportedly hired Tesla’s (TSLA) former vice president of vehicle engineering, according to a report in Electrek Tuesday. Last week, Facebook said it hired Regina Dugan, who worked on ""moonshot"" projects for Google. And GoPro (GPRO) hired Danny Coster, a 20-year Apple design veteran, to be the action-camera maker's vice president of design.Despite the arms race in tech hiring, privately held consulting firm A.T. Kearney topped Glassdoor's list, with median total compensation at $167,534 and median base salary of $143,620. PwC subsidiary Strategy&, also a private consulting firm, came in second, with median compensation at $160,000 and media base salary at $147,000.From there on, tech dominated. Juniper Networks (JNPR) tops the list for techies with $157,000 in compensation and $135,000 in salary. Google came in fifth, with $153,750 in compensation and $123,331 in salary.Facebook (median base salary $127,406), Twitter (TWTR) ($133,000), LinkedIn (LNKD) ($120,000), Microsoft (MSFT) ($125,000), Adobe Systems (ADBE) ($125,000) and Salesforce.com (CRM) ($120,000) were other tech companies on the list.Among financial companies, Visa (V) made the lone appearance, though the credit card giant is listed under the information technology sector on the S&P 500. Visa's median compensation is $150,000, and its median salary is $130,000, according to Glassdoor.The admittedly unscientific report is based on company-specific salary reports that have been anonymously shared by company employees. Apple wasn't on the list.In addition to traditional forms of compensation, many tech companies have offered other perks to woo employees.Free gourmet food and ping pong tables are now passe. Newer perks include on-site doctors, free plane tickets anywhere, free Uber rides to and from work, carts that bring beer to employees' desks, and free overnight shipping of breast milk back home while new moms are on business trips.Facebook and Apple also offer to pay for egg-freezing procedures for females employees who want to delay motherhood.

395,CRM,"Software leader Microsoft (MSFT) is expected to return to revenue growth on a year-over-year basis in the March quarter, after posting declines for three straight quarters.The Redmond, Wash.-based company is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter earnings after the market close Thursday.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Microsoft to earn 64 cents a share, up 5% year over year, on sales of $22.09 billion, up 2%, in fiscal Q3.For the June quarter, Wall Street is modeling for Microsoft to earn 66 cents a share, up 10%, on sales of $23.04 billion, up 4%.Microsoft stock is trading just below its all-time high of 56.85, reached on Dec. 29. Microsoft was down a fraction, near 56, in midday trading on the stock market today.Investors are upbeat over Microsoft's transition from desktop software to Internet cloud computing services. Raymond James analyst Michael Turits on Tuesday boosted his price target on Microsoft stock to 65 from 62 and maintained his strong buy rating.Turits based his price target hike on Microsoft’s prospects for revenue and earnings growth from its cloud computing businesses, including Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics CRM Online.But he said that Microsoft will face near-term pressure from weak PC sales, which affects its Windows operating system business.“We view Microsoft as one of the few ‘hyperscale’ cloud vendors able to integrate infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and software-as-a-service (SaaS) with a vast installed base of server/client software,” Turits said in a research report.On Monday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan reiterated his outperform rating on Microsoft stock with a price target of 63.“We continue to believe that Microsoft will see acceleration in revenue, EPS and (cash flow from operations) over coming quarters, driven by the diminishing drag of the cloud transition, strength in Azure and the potential for PC declines to moderate,” MacMillan said in a report. “As (foreign-exchange) headwinds diminish, we think underlying growth will come into view.”RELATED:Microsoft Stock Gets Price Target Hike From Build Conference News

396,CRM,"Nothing quite like a BPA -- blanket purchase agreement -- from the federal government to pick up your Wednesday.So on Thursday morning, investors in enterprise software developer  Salesforce.com (CRM) didn't seem overly impressed with IBM's (IBM) vote of confidence in Salesforce by buying a loyal Salesforce business partner. After riding Salesforce stock up 2.8% to 74.30 on the BPA announcement Wednesday, sellers let the stock ease back a fraction, as of early afternoon in the stock market today, to near 74 -- still only 11% off a record high of 82.90 set Nov. 19.""While neither announcement is necessarily ‘needle moving’ on its own, we believe the combination helps to support our long-term view that CRM is becoming an increasingly strategic partner to its customers, driving ‘stickier’ relationships and larger deal sizes,"" Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne said in a Thursday research note.IBM confirmed Thursday it will buy New York City-based Bluewolf, Salesforce's first consulting service partner in 2001, now with 500 employees and 12 global offices. It's still one of Salesforce’s top cloud implementation services. Terms were not disclosed.The leader in customer relationship management software, Salesforce is one of the highest-rated enterprise software companies.IBM stock was up 2.5%, near 152.50, in afternoon trading Thursday.""I'm so proud of Eric, who built Bluewolf from a startup,"" said Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff in IBM's announcement, referring to Eric Berridge, CEO of Bluewolf.Bluewolf will join IBM Global Business Services' Interactive Experience (iX) practice ""to form a deeper consulting capability for clients adopting the innovative Salesforce solutions,"" IBM said.Salesforce on Wednesday said the federal Health and Human Services Department's BPA was worth $100 million. ""HHS operating staff and divisions can purchase Salesforce through a central purchasing vehicle to help digitally transform and connect with their citizens in new ways,"" Salesforce said in its announcement.The $100 million pact is equivalent to about 1.5% of Salesforce's $6.67 billion in annual sales. In December, Salesforce announced it had landed a $503 million BPA from the federal General Services Administration.Evercore ISI maintains a buy rating on Salesforce.com, with a 95 price target.""We believe the continued roll-up of systems integrators specializing in Salesforce deployments is a positive sign in terms of the demand for the company’s solutions among larger enterprises, while the government contracts highlight the continued success of CRM’s vertically focused go-to-market strategy,"" Evercore ISI's Materne said. ""All in all, we continue to believe that the long-term narrative based on (about) 20% top line growth, 100-200 (basis points) of annual operating margin expansion, and mid-20% (operating cash flow) growth remains intact and continue to see a compelling risk/reward when looking out over the next 12 months.""

397,CRM,"At the rate Workday (WDAY) is growing its core human capital management (HCM) software, combined with its new financial management products, analysts Ross MacMillan and Matthew Hedberg can see Workday's path to $5 billion in yearly sales by 2021. The company just hit it first billion-dollar year, closing its fiscal year ended Jan. 31 with sales of $1.16 billion.The pair of RBC Capital Markets analysts on Sunday raised their price target on Workday stock to 92 from 72 and affirmed their outperform rating.Workday stock rose a fraction Monday to a 2016 high, making its seventh consecutive up-day, closing at 78.92. Last week, Workday stock broke out of a cup-with-handle at a 75.60 buy point.Workday wasn't alone Monday. Rival ServiceNow (NOW) rose 3.6%  to 64.28 on a bullish report from William Blair on its long-term fundamentals.Bigger enterprise software rivals Salesforce (CRM), Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP) all slipped a fraction.RBC's MacMillan and Hedberg drew confidence by comparing Workday to PeopleSoft in 2001, four years before its HCM and financial management (FM) software businesses were acquired by Oracle for $10.4 billion. PeopleSoft co-founder David Duffield, who fought the Oracle takeover, went on to co-found Workday.""A look back at PeopleSoft is striking,"" they said. ""Workday today has (less than) 25% of PeopleSoft’s customer count in 2001, yet Workday has (more than) 50% of PeopleSoft’s revenue at that time. This is particularly interesting, given Workday has yet to generate any meaningful financial management revenue today and which (according to management) was (more than) 50% of PeopleSoft’s revenue at the time of acquisition by Oracle.""In other words, the RBC analysts say, Workday has plenty of room to grow. ""Success in financials would support a path to $5 billion,"" they wrote. ""While financials (are) not the focus in this note, we think the path to $5 billion revenue remains underpinned (split less than 50% HCM, more than 50% FM) which we think can be realized in the next 5-plus years.""For its fiscal 2016 ended Jan. 31, Workday revenue rose 48% to $1.16 billion. It lost 1 cent per share minus items, a huge improvement from a 33-cent loss in fiscal 2015.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect a Q1 per-share loss minus items of 2 cents, on revenue up 35% to $339 million.

398,CRM,"Allergan (AGN) tumbled on new tax inversion rules, Tesla Motors (TSLA) skidded on weak Q1 deliveries and Walt Disney (DIS) retreated as a key executive exited, raising doubts about who might be the eventual successor to CEO Bob Iger.Allergan stock fell 21% after the Treasury Department issued new rules to curb so-called tax inversions. That includes steps to curb earnings stripping, a method used to reduce taxes after an inversion. Pfizer (PFE) and the Ireland-based Allergan plan to merge, with Pfizer's takeover structured to reduce U.S. tax liability. Pfizer stock edged higher late after closing up 2.3%. Allergan had closed 3.5% higher.Tesla Motors said that it delivered 14,820 vehicles in Q1, up nearly 50% vs. a year earlier but below the company's February forecast for 16,000. Tesla blamed ""severe"" parts shortages for the Model X crossover -- and its own ""hubris."" Tesla shares fell 4% late, erasing nearly all its 4% regular-session gain on huge preorders for the Model 3.  The Model 3 is supposed to go into production by late 2017, with total vehicle production hitting 500,000 by 2020.Walt Disney said after the close that COO Thomas Staggs, who was seen as a possible successor to CEO Bob Iger, is leaving May 6. Staggs will serve as a special advisor to Iger. Disney stock fell 2% after closing down 0.4%.Meanwhile, Salesforce.com (CRM) agreed to buy artificial intelligence startup MetaMind for undisclosed terms, the latest big tech to step up AI takeovers and investments. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff invested in MetMind back in December 2014. Salesforce stock was little changed late.

399,CRM,"Building momentum from a week of positive trade, cloud software developer Workday’s (WDAY) stock gained another 1% Friday morning -- nearly 8% for the week -- after FBR Capital Markets satisfied itself that Workday's financial software may ""achieve the same level of success as (or greater than) its HCM (human capital management) product suite.""In a research note issued Friday, FBR analyst Samad Samana said that he visited Workday's Pleasanton, Calif., headquarters in Silicon Valley this week and cornered Betsy Bland, vice president of financial management products, and Robynne Sisco, chief accounting officer, who let him ""dig deeper into what we have found to be the single most important issue on investors' minds.""The issue: Will Workday's financial software do great?""We walked away more confident that the financials business is positioned to have a strong (fiscal 2017) as the product suite has improved significantly, more WDAY reps are now selling financials, a critical mass of live customers is providing positive references for potential customers, and the willingness to adopt cloud-based financials has increased,"" Samana said.Investors responded by pushing Workday stock up 2% to 78.34 before easing back to a 1.6% gain above 78 by midday in the stock market today. On Wednesday, Workday stock broke out of a 12-week, first-stage cup-with-handle base with a 75.60 buy point.Workday competes against no shortage of rivals, including SAP (SAP), Salesforce.com (CRM) and legacy software developer Oracle (ORCL). Salesforce stock was up 1.6% to 74.98 at midday Friday, and Oracle was up fractionally at 40.96. But SAP stock was down 0.8% to 79.74.Samana said he learned that Workday had added more than 45 financial software customers in the fiscal fourth quarter ended Jan. 31, ""the most ever in a single quarter."" At 207 financial customers, it's more than double the base of a year before.For Q4, Workday earnings beat Wall Street views, but its Q1 revenue outlook missed estimates.For fiscal Q1, ending in April, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Workday to lose an adjusted two cents per share minus items, flat with a year earlier, on revenue up 35% to $339 million.Workday went public in October 2012, priced at 28.

400,CRM,"When you're ""a small player in a large market that is still new, fragmented and growing,"" a key to success is ""staying one step ahead of the competition,"" and that's what workplace software developer Zendesk (ZEN) is doing, said Summit Research analyst Jonathan Kees.Following the upbeat commentary in Kees' research note, issued Sunday, Zendesk stock was up a fraction in early afternoon trading in the stock market today, but it's still more than 25% below a 17-month high at 27.52, touched Dec. 4.Like other players in the infamous Software Sag of 2016, Zendesk fell hard in January and early February, hitting a 21-month low of 14.39 low on Feb. 9.Zendesk, which specializes in customer relationship management (CRM) software, went public in May 2014, priced at 9.Initiating coverage, Summit Research gave Zendesk a buy rating with a 25 price target.Zendesk is ""executing on its growth strategy in a largely untapped $7.6 billion market, moving successfully toward positive (free cash flow) and profitability, and maintaining revenue growth in the 30%-plus (rate) over the next several years,"" Kees said.""Most of Zendesk’s customers are SMBs (small to medium-size businesses), though the company has been moving upmarket, with customer deals with more than 100 seats now almost a third of monthly recurring revenues. Among other benefits, larger customers buy more, tend to purchase annual contracts and raise overall ARPU (average revenue per user). Founded in 2007, Zendesk is the oldest of the vendors targeting SMBs.""Big rivals such as Microsoft (MSFT),   Salesforce.com (CRM) and Oracle (ORCL) also target midsize businesses. Shares of all three were down a fraction Monday afternoon.""As ZEN moves upmarket, (it) faces deep-pocketed competitors like Salesforce.com and Oracle that can easily bundle customer engagement functionality with their total offerings,"" Kees warned.Zendesk is targeting positive free cash flow by 2017, profitability by 2020 and $1 billion in sales by 2020, he noted.For its Q1 ending Thursday, 12 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect a consensus 10-cent loss, flat with a year ago, on revenue up 56% to $66 million.Zendesk CFO Alan Black is expected to leave this year. Kees said, ""We are always a little cautious and little worried when a CFO leaves a company. However, we are cautiously optimistic Zendesk will take appropriate steps to identify a CFO who can take the company to the next level ($1 billion in revenue by 2020).""

401,CRM,"Fast growth hasn’t vanished.Despite this uptrend’s defensive tilt, a handful of stocks in the Big Cap 20 show strong fundamentals.Cloud player and software provider Adobe Systems (ADBE) is on a roll. In the past five quarters, earnings jumped 47%, 30%, 93%, 59% and 50%. Revenue grew 11%, 9%, 21%, 22% and 25% in the same quarters.How many big-cap stocks can claim that kind of earnings and revenue growth? Not many. Toss in a factor to weed out thin stocks, and only one other big cap pops up: Salesforce.com (CRM), which last appeared in the Big Cap 20 on Dec. 29.The Street expects Adobe to stay in the fast lane in fiscal 2016, which ends in November. Earnings are expected to grow 37% this year and 33% in fiscal 2017.Pretax margin was 27.8% last year, but return on equity was only 15%. Research shows that history’s greatest stocks carried an ROE of at least 17%.Adobe sketched a cup-with-handle base and broke out March 17. Volume was 73% above average. The buy point was 88.65. The stock is about 7% extended from the entry.However, the left-side high could provide another buy point -- this one at 96.52, unless a handle forms.The weekly base shows plenty of accumulation. Funds adding to their position in Q4 include Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX), which increased its stake by almost 19% in the fourth quarter.Meanwhile, business software provider Intuit (INTU) is in the midst of a turnaround and shakeup.Earnings in fiscal Q1, which ended in October, rose to nine cents a share vs. a loss of 11 cents a share in the year-earlier period. Then in fiscal Q2, which ended in January, Intuit booked a profit of 25 cents a share vs. a year-earlier loss of six cents a share.Revenue stepped up from 7% to 17% to 23% in recent quarters.The Street expects earnings to advance 34% in fiscal 2016, which ends in July. Revenue is seen rising 9%.The company’s products include TurboTax. In recent weeks, Intuit reached agreements to sell its online application software QuickBase, personal finance software Quicken and marketing software Demandforce.Intuit bought back $455 million’s worth of shares in fiscal Q2.Shares dived sharply in August when the plan to divest non-core segments was first announced. Since then, the stock has rebounded and built a base within the larger consolidation. Intuit is climbing the right side and is 3% off the 108 high of the pattern.Tyson Foods (TSN) might sound defensive, but the meat provider grew earnings 49% in fiscal Q1, which ended in December. For fiscal 2016, earnings are expected to advance 25%. The stock is in a profit-taking zone from a February breakout.In most cases, a stock should be sold after it reaches a 20% to 25% profit. Most stocks will begin to consolidate after such a gain.Image provided by Shutterstock.

402,CRM,"Enterprise software developer ServiceNow (NOW) advised the Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday that a federal court in Texas has granted a 30-day stay of all deadlines -- notably this Friday's deadline to start trial -- in its defense against patent-violation claims by BMC Software.ServiceNow and BMC requested the stay ""so that the parties may document the agreement and submit appropriate dismissal papers,"" ServiceNow said in an 8K filing with the SEC.What now?ServiceNow stock was down 1%, below 60, in early afternoon trade in the stock market today, after rising 3.6% Tuesday as word spread that a legal settlement was in the works. ServiceNow stock still is up for the week and could notch its fourth consecutive week of gains, after shares hit a 22-month low in early February. Shares are still 34% off a record high of 91.28 set Dec. 4. ServiceNow went public in June 2012, priced at 18.More-established rivals Salesforce.com (CRM) and SAP (SAP) were making their own moves. SAP, the largest in IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise industry group by market cap, was up a fraction, near 77, Wednesday afternoon, just 5% off a nearly two-year high of 81.21 set Dec. 29. No. 2 player Salesforce.com was up 1.5%, near 71, 14% off a record high of 82.90 set Nov. 19.With a market cap of $9.6 billion, a tenth the size of SAP, ServiceNow is the fifth-largest member of the industry group.Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne, in a research note Wednesday, said that the dispute with BMC is ""more of a short-term concern ... than a wall of worry related to a possible penalty or injunction.""Nevertheless, we believe the (pending) settlement between the two companies does remove a near-term overhang and should allow investors to refocus attention on the longer-term opportunity,"" he wrote. ""We do not believe that the trial with BMC was impacting sales cycles. ... We continue to like the risk/reward longer-term, but as we noted after meeting with the company in early February, NOW is likely to remain in 'show me' mode until it reports"" its Q1 results.ServiceNow stock crashed 16% on Jan. 28 after the company reported Q4 billings below expectations, though EPS ex items jumped 533% to 19 cents, twice analysts’ expectations, and revenue rose 44% to $285.6 million, also topping Wall Street views.Materne maintained a buy rating on ServiceNow stock, with an 83 price target.Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) also has patent infringement claims pending against ServiceNow, filed originally by the former Hewlett-Packard company.

403,CRM,"Microsoft (MSFT) received a vote of confidence Thursday from investment bank Oppenheimer & Co., which assumed coverage of the software giant with an outperform rating.Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan set a 12- to 18-month price target of 62 on Microsoft stock. Microsoft shares were up more than 1% to near 55 in midday trading on the stock market today. Microsoft gets a 75 Composite Rating from IBD out of a possible 99; the Composite Rating looks at earnings growth, stock price gains and a raft of other factors.Microsoft “is putting the right strategy in place to be at the forefront of the next generation of computing and to defend and grow market share,” Horan said in a report. “Instead of fighting the inevitable shift to the cloud, Microsoft is fully embracing it.”The company is offering enterprise customers a fully integrated hybrid cloud system that connects on-premise hardware and software with Internet cloud services, he said, adding that Microsoft has a competitive advantage through its large installed base of enterprise customers.“Microsoft controls over 90% of the enterprise office suite and about 75% of the enterprise operating system market,” he said. “As workloads shift to the cloud, we believe Microsoft will be successful in bundling in premium (software- and platform-as-a-service) products, enabling it to defend its market share and expand its total addressable market with new product offerings.”Oppenheimer believes that most information technology functions will shift to cloud services by 2020.Horan believes that Microsoft will be able to reach its goal of $20 billion in cloud revenue by fiscal 2018, up from a current annual run rate of $9.4 billion.Microsoft’s major cloud products include Office 365, Azure and Dynamics CRM Online. It competes in cloud computing with Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google, Salesforce.com (CRM) and others.RELATED: Microsoft Azure Cloud Service Seen Turning Profitable This Year

404,CRM,"After the hell that many hotshot software stocks have put investors through this young year, Wall Street analysts got a break.""Listening to Oracle (ORCL) conference calls is always a hoot,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis in a research note Wednesday, following Oracle's late-Tuesday Q3 earnings that beat analyst estimates. ""In the 16 years we’ve followed this firm, we can’t remember a quarter when management wasn’t wildly bullish. This quarter was no different, with Trump-like phrases like 'slaughter,' 'better and better,' 'game over,' etc.""The good news for our now almost exactly 3-year-old buy rating is that Oracle’s execution has begun to catch up with its verbiage. Indeed, this was the first quarter in four in which Oracle did not scuffle somewhere -- bookings, revenues, earnings or whatever. Investors are still jumpy after the January panic, so this means they are flocking to moneymakers like Oracle.""Oracle stock was up 4% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 40, and touched an eight-month high. Rivals Microsoft (MSFT), Salesforce.com (CRM) and SAP (SAP) were up about 1% Wednesday afternoon.Not that Davis was totally giddy: ""Should ORCL decisively penetrate the $40 price level, we will declare victory and seriously consider downgrading the stock from today’s buy to a possible hold.""What's all the fuss?They can visualize Oracle's cloud-revenue skyrocketing, while traditional database-software sales shrink.Oracle and its traditional enterprise-software customers have faced a tough conversion, but now Oracle is developing serious momentum with its own cloud and hybrid-cloud growth, shepherding the transition of its customers while absorbing the shrinkage of its still-dominant traditional enterprise sales.""With 310,000 on-premise database customers, the company sees an enormous potential TAM (total addressable market), as database customers continue to shift to the cloud,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne in a research note Wednesday. ""Management also noted that renewal rates were higher than in previous years.""Materne put annual recurring revenue from cloud software-as-a-service (SaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) sales up 77% in constant currency in Q3, with billings up 32%, ""and importantly, this strength is expected to translate into accelerating revenue growth going forward,"" he said.In Q3, Oracle said it added 942 new SaaS customers, more than half of which were Oracle Fusion ERP (enterprise resource planning) software subscribers. SaaS clients now total more than 11,000 with more than 2,000 on Fusion, Materne noted.Oracle sold customer experience (CX) SaaS to 465 new customers and 500 existing ones in Q3. Human capital management software was sold to 213 new customers. Oracle's ERP Cloud attracted 334 new clients, ""175 of which did not have an Oracle on-premise app before,"" said Materne, for an installed base exceeding 1,800 clients.Still, for all the excitement of watching Oracle's cloud revenue fly 40% to $735 million in Q3, that only amounted to 8% of Oracle's total $9.01 billion in sales for the quarter. Revenue fell 3% from the year-earlier quarter.Traditional software revenue slipped to $6.34 billion from $6.64 billion, as the legacy line slipped to 70% from 71% of total revenue. Likewise, legacy hardware sales slipped to $1.13 billion, or 13% of Q3's total sales, from $1.29 billion, or 14% a year before.""This is obviously a continuation of execution of their pivot toward the cloud pursuit,” Gartner analyst Charles “Chad” Eschinger told IBD via email. “Top line is better than I expected, even with the transition, especially with the increase in margins, where there have been many curmudgeons.""
"
405,CRM,"Enterprise software developers Workday (WDAY) and especially profitable Salesforce.com (CRM) have gotten this far without any love from software king Oracle (ORCL), so a little verbal swagger from Oracle's executives this week isn't going to stop them.But Oracle's 40% growth in cloud software revenue to $735 million in its third quarter, with a promise of more in Q4, can't bode well for the smaller rivals.Accelerating cloud sales, mostly for software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS), were Oracle co-CEOs Safra Catz and Mark Hurd's favorite topics in a post-earnings conference call with analysts Tuesday.Oracle's cloud growth, while approaching Workday's recent 43% sales growth rate, has already puffed Oracle's cloud to more than double Workday's total revenue of $323 million in Workday's last quarter. More deceleration seems inevitable from Workday's triple-digit growth as recently as 2013.As for Salesforce.com, its year over year sales growth has slowed to the 23%-29% range for six straight quarters, following 13 out of the prior 14 quarters of 31% to 38% growth. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters put it on a 25% sales growth trajectory to $1.89 billion in the current quarter ending in April vs. 23% revenue growth in the year-ago quarter.Still, ""competition from leading SaaS vendors such as Salesforce.com, Workday and others creates the risk that new customers will be tougher (for Oracle) to find and existing on-premise customers could move to different vendors when they shift to the cloud,"" warned RBC Capital Markets analyst Matthew Hedberg in a research note issued Wednesday.""This was not a quarter to change the competitive concerns,"" he summarized.Not to worry, suggests Oracle Executive Chairman Larry Ellison. In the Q3 earnings conference with analysts Tuesday, Ellison said: ""Oracle is now selling more new SaaS and PaaS annually recurring cloud revenue than any other company in the world including Salesforce.com. We are growing much faster than Salesforce.com, more than twice as fast, because we sell into a lot more SaaS and PaaS markets than they do. We compete directly with Salesforce.com in every segment of the SaaS customer experience (CE) market including sales, service and marketing.""He went on to say: ""But Oracle also competes in huge SaaS markets where Salesforce.com does not compete at all, such as ERP (enterprise resource planning) and HCM (human capital management). It took many years for Oracle to develop the most complete ERP suite in the cloud including Fusion Financials, procurement, supply chain, logistics, manufacturing and much, much more. That long effort is now paying off.""In the conference call, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Kash Rangan, discussing the huge database software bulk of Oracle's business, addressed Ellison by noting that Amazon (AMZN) Web Services ""wants to go after your business.""""Microsoft (MSFT) just announced a SQL server running on Linux,"" Rangan continued, ""and everybody seems to be . . . swapping out your Oracle license for their license. Why are they doing this, Larry? Is it just because the industry views Oracle as this big giant that is less flexible with pricing? Is that right, that the industry feels like they need to take you guys on? How should we be thinking of Oracle’s presence in the database market a few years from now, given these threats?""Ellison replied:""Well, our PaaS business grew at 150% this past quarter. I mean, it’s interesting that Microsoft is now offering SQL Server on Linux. But people want Oracle in the cloud. People have a huge investment in Oracle products. I mean, people are coming after us because we are by far the market leader in database. So, of course, Amazon, (if) they’re going to be in the database business too, is coming after us, and of course (if) Microsoft wants to be bigger in the database business, they have to come after us. We’re the biggest player.""We see our customers -- literally millions of applications and millions of users of those applications built on top of the Oracle database -- wanting to move those applications into the cloud and we do that very well. Our PaaS service is even easier to use and better than Oracle is on-premises.""Or, as Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne put it in his Wednesday research note: “With 310,000 on-premises database customers, the company sees an enormous potential TAM (total addressable market), as database customers continue to shift to the cloud.""Workday stock at midday was trading up about 3% near 72 in afternoon trading in the stock market today, 23% off its 52-week high set May 26 at 93.62 and about halfway back from its dive in January and early February to 49.5% below that high mark. Salesforce stock was flat near 73, just 12% off an all-time high 82.90 set Nov. 19.Oracle was up about 1.7% in afternoon trading Friday near 41, just 9% off its 52-week high of 45.24 touched June 17.Oracle stock carries a relatively weak IBD Composite Rating at 56, partly because of its 6% earnings shrinkage and overall 3% revenue slip to $9.01 billion in Q3 -- as that fast growth in the cloud pulls sales and profitability away from its own legacy on-premises lines. That cloud revenue only amounted to 8% of Oracle's total Q3 sales, up from 6% a year earlier.Workday carries a 50 Composite Rating and Salesforce.com stock an 83.  
"
406,CRM,"Analysts expect Oracle (ORCL) to show a fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings and sales declines in its Q3 fiscal 2016 report after the close Tuesday.The business software giant rose 2.4% to 38.95 Friday, hitting a 3-month high and rising back above its 200-day moving average. Oracle stock fell 0.6% to 38.70 in the stock market today, holding above the 200-day.Oracle stock remains 14% off a more than one-year high set June 17, and nearly even with its 38.91 close on Dec. 16, right before its fiscal Q2 earnings release showed shrinking earnings and sales. That report sent the stock sliding to a 25-month low of 33.13 on Jan. 20.""The stock is down 1.1% since (fiscal 2016's second-quarter) earnings, outperforming the S&P 500, down 4.0%, given the general rotation out of growth stocks into more value names like Oracle,"" wrote Nomura analyst Frederick Grieb in a research note Thursday. ""While metrics for cloud revenue growth have been solid, investors remain concerned by what the potential cost will be to the legacy business, as well as the potential impact to margins during the transition.""Meanwhile, Pacific Crest Securities says more business users expect to increase spending on software-as-a-service (SaaS) from Microsoft (MSFT) than any other vendor, followed by spending increases for Oracle, then rivals SAP (SAP),  Salesforce.com (CRM) and others.Microsoft stock closed up 2% to 53.07 Friday, then advanced 0.2% on Monday. SAP gained 2.3% to 78.65 on Friday, tacking on 0.1% on Monday. Salesforce rose 1.3% to 71.63 on Friday, then climbed 0.8% on Monday, finding resistance at the 200-day line.Analysts expect Oracle's legacy-software license sales to continue falling faster than increasing cloud-subscription sales will rise, at least in the short term. Those polled by Thomson Reuters now model total Q3 revenue down 2% from a year earlier to $9.13 billion, revised down from $9.28 billion, estimated when Q2 earnings were released. They see adjusted EPS of 62 cents, down 9% from a year earlier and down from the 65 cents they estimated three months ago for Q3.In a conference call with analysts after the Q2 release, CEO Safra Catz guided Q3 revenue to a $9.08 billion midpoint and earnings to a range of 60 to 63 cents per share minus items.Anticipating more acceleration of cloud revenue in the second half of the fiscal year for Oracle, Nomura's Grieb said: ""It will be important to make sure that the company is not losing share to the competition. Strong cloud growth rates supported the business until the steep license revenue declines in the last few quarters suggested that the company may not be successfully converting on-premise customers to the cloud.""Investors are concerned that Oracle is not only cannibalizing the on-premise license business, but also offering aggressive incentives to sign cloud customers.""Nomura maintains a buy rating with a 44 price target on Oracle.Aggressive discounting of subscription sales might be why Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brendan Barnicle found feedback from Oracle customers better than expected.""Even though cloud is lagging with existing customers, it is doing better with new customers and cloud revenue recognition on existing deals is likely to drive upside to cloud expectations,"" Barnicle wrote in a research note Thursday. ""Among SaaS vendors, Oracle showed well in the recent Pacific Crest CFO survey.""He added that feedback about on-premises ""applications was surprisingly positive,"" particularly in the installed base.""We had little feedback on the database and infrastructure businesses. As a result, we see upside to the Cloud SaaS and PaaS  (platform-as-a-service) revenue expectation of $554 million and overall revenue expectation of $9.127 billion,"" Barnicle wrote. ""We are less confident on EPS upside. EPS consensus of 62 cents seems a bit high, so we expect in-line EPS.""Pacific Crest carries Oracle with a sector weight rating, akin to a hold rating.In his recent survey of CFOs, Barnicle said that 46% plan to increase SaaS spending in 2016 with Microsoft, followed by 26% with Oracle, 25% with SAP, 16% with Salesforce.com, and about 12% each with HubSpot (HUBS) and Paylocity (PCTY).Image provided by Shutterstock.

407,CRM,"Digital media software giant Adobe Systems (ADBE) is well-positioned to drive the third wave of disruption in enterprise software, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kirk Adams said in a report Monday.The first software wave was enterprise resource planning (ERP), which transformed back-office operations. Then came customer relationship management (CRM), which changed front-office operations. Adobe is calling the third wave ""experience business,"" which aims to reinvent how companies create, deliver and market products and services.“Adobe believes that this third wave could be bigger than both ERP and CRM,” Adams said. He reiterated his buy rating on Adobe stock and price target of 112.Adobe was down a fraction to above 92 in midday trading on the stock market today. Its stock hit an all-time high of 98 on March 18, a day after it reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and raised its guidance.Adobe outlined how it is pursuing experience business last week at its Adobe Summit 2016 conference in Las Vegas. This year's conference drew 10,000 attendees, up from about 7,000 at last year's show.“Adobe is focused on helping enterprises deliver consistent, high-quality experiences for their customers,” Adams said. “There are many point products and solutions from other companies, but only Adobe provides end-to-end solutions from content creation to marketing execution to measurement.”Adobe is the leader in digital content creation with its Creative Cloud offerings. Now it is moving aggressively into the marketing world with its Marketing Cloud, Adams said. Marketing Cloud includes tools for tracking the popularity of online content and the effectiveness of advertising and marketing campaigns.At its Summit conference, Adobe announced an audience measurement partnership with ComScore (SCOR) as well as new services and enhancements to its cloud platforms.“The Summit reinforced our view that Adobe continues to distance itself from competing digital marketing platforms,” Baird analyst Steven Ashley said in a report Wednesday. He rates Adobe stock as outperform with a price target of 105.Image provided by Shutterstock.

408,CRM,"The Big Daddy of business software, Oracle (ORCL) made it four consecutive quarters of shrinking year-over-year earnings, but the company posted a big increase in its cloud software and shares rose after hours despite a slight revenue miss.For its fiscal Q3 ended Feb. 29, the company late Tuesday said earnings per share minus items fell 5.9% from the year-earlier quarter to 64 cents. That nevertheless beat the 62-cent consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. And Oracle stock was up more than 4% in after-hours trading, after its earnings release.Revenue fell 3% to $9.01 billion, where analysts had modeled $9.13 billion.The company had guided Q3 revenue to a $9.08 billion midpoint and earnings to a range of 60 to 63 cents per share minus items.Cloud software revenue, however, jumped 40% to $735 million, and would have been up 44% in constant currency. Oracle does about 55% of its business outside the U.S., so it's hurt more than most by the strong U.S. dollar.Oracle said its software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service revenue jumped 57%. The third cloud software component, infrastructure-as-a-service, fell 2%.The legacy software developer is transitioning more of its business to the cloud, while still managing billions of dollars in traditional, on-premise enterprise-software license sales, making for an often rocky transition.""Our Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue growth rate accelerated to 61% in constant currency in Q3,"" said co-CEO Safra Catz in the earnings release. ""This dramatic revenue increase drove our non-GAAP SaaS and PaaS gross margins up to 51% in Q3 as compared with 43% in Q2. Our cloud business is now in a hyper-growth phase.""Oracle had closed up a fraction in Tuesday's regular session. Rival Microsoft (MSFT), which does many things other than developing software, also rose a fraction as did enterprise software rival SAP (SAP), while cloud rival Salesforce.com (CRM) fell a fraction Tuesday.""In absolute dollar terms, Oracle is already selling more enterprise SaaS and PaaS new cloud revenue than any other company in the world, including Salesforce.com,"" Executive Chairman Larry Ellison said in the earnings release and later reiterated in a conference call. ""We are growing much faster than Salesforce.com. We also have many more SaaS products than Salesforce.com. In some of our most important SaaS markets, such as ERP (enterprise resource planning), HCM (human capital management), supply chain and manufacturing, Salesforce.com does not participate at all.""By successfully competing in all of these markets, Oracle has the ability to sustain its high growth over a long period of time. That should make it easy for us to pass Salesforce.com and become the largest SaaS and PaaS cloud company in the world.""On the call, the competitive Ellison added that ""it took many years for Oracle to develop the most complete ERP suite in the cloud. Oracle Fusion ERP is the overall market leader in the cloud ERP market . . . more than 10 times more ERP customers than Workday (WDAY). And ERP has always been a much larger market than CRM (customer relationship management software). Salesforce is missing all of that ERP market opportunity.""Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect fiscal Q4 EPS to fall 20.5% to 62 cents, minus items, on revenue down 14.8%, to $9.12 billion. That compares with year-ago performance of 78 cents per share ex items, down 15%, on revenue off 5%, to $10.7 billion.Offering ""non-GAAP, constant currency"" guidance for Q4, Catz said EPS might reach 82 to 85 cents, ""depending on the mix of revenue and tax rates."" She guided total revenue in constant currency to a range of down 2% to up 1%. Oracle posted non-GAAP EPS of 78 cents in the year-ago quarterAlso, the Oracle board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 15 cents per share, payable April 28, and authorized repurchase of an additional $10 billion of common stock. Oracle enjoys a $162.5 billion market cap, among the biggest in technology.Oracle said Q3’s non-GAAP operating income and margin improved from Q2 but slipped from a year earlier. Non-GAAP operating income reached $3.8 billion and operating margin hit 42%, vs. $3.7 billion and 41% in Q2. A year earlier, Q3 2015 non-GAAP operating income had fallen 4% to $4.2 billion, when the non-GAAP operating margin was running at 45%.

409,CRM,"CyrusOne (CONE) stock hit an all-time high on the heels of Tuesday’s investor day, where the data center operator outlined goals to double the company’s revenue by 2020.Cloud computing and corporate outsourcing of IT infrastructure has increased demand for data center space. Data center operators -- including DuPont Fabros Technology (DFT), Digital Realty Trust (DLR) and CoreSite Realty (COR) -- are among the top performers in IBD’s Finance-Property REIT group. It’s ranked No. 46 out of 197 industry groups that IBD tracks. Many data center operators are real estate investment trusts.Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB) and Salesforce.com (CRM) are among tech companies expanding data centers.Data center operators provide space, power and cooling. Customers pack the warehouse-sized data centers with their own computer servers and other gear. The data center market has been divided among wholesale providers -- such as Digital Realty and DuPont Fabros -- and retail operators such as Equinix (EQIX), though some lines are blurring.CyrusOne stock was up a fraction in midday trading in the stock market today, above 42, but earlier rose nearly 5% to 43.42, its record high. Shares have gained nearly 13% in 2016.At its investor day event, CyrusOne said that it aims to double its enterprise value from around $4 billion to $8 billion by 2020, said Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen & Co., in a research report.“The company plans to achieve this goal by doubling its revenue, EBITDA and normalized FFO from 2016 to 2020 while being prudent to maintain (debt) leverage at 4.5 times or less, so that it can achieve an investment grade credit rating over that period,” added Synesael.REITs use a cash flow metric called funds from operations, or FFO.DuPont Fabros stock has shot up more than 25% this year, while CoreSite has gained about 20%. Digital Realty is up 15%. Equinix, part of IBD’s Internet-Infrastructure Solutions group, has gained 5%.Capital spending has been rising at data center operators. DuPont Fabros, aiming to raise $275 million, announced a stock offering on March 17.“New leasing volume suggests that demand remains robust and should support DFT’s growth plans with low leverage,” said Barclays analyst Ross Smotrich in a report. “However, the trade-off is that DFT had made it abundantly clear at their November 2015 investor day that their growth strategy would not include new equity. When future capital needs arise, therefore, investors may anticipate an equity raise.”Image provided by Shutterstock.

410,CRM,"ServiceNow (NOW) stock rose Tuesday, with word out that it might be able to settle some of its patent litigation with privately held BMC Software, avoiding a trial scheduled to start Friday.A cloud-based business software rival of SAP (SAP) and Salesforce.com (CRM), ServiceNow shares were up more than 4% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 60.70. William Blair analyst Justin Furby suggested the possible settlement may “be a mild positive, as the prospect of a jury trial and the potential appeals process ... would have likely created overhang on the stock.“More importantly, until this point, we believe the litigation has not affected ServiceNow’s sales cycles,” Furby wrote in a research note Tuesday. But the increased public attention of a trial “could have delayed sales for SerivceNow, particularly if the court would have ruled in BMC’s favor.“Lastly, BMC had sought injunctive relief, and had the lawsuit and subsequent appeals process gone against ServiceNow, it could have faced the prospect of discontinuing or rewriting certain of its applications,” Furby said.BMC sued ServiceNow in September 2014, claiming seven patent violations. Courts dismissed two claims, and BMC withdrew a third. But last month, BMC filed a second lawsuit against ServiceNow, claiming infringement of five patents, two of which were included in the original litigation, Furby said, adding that he didn’t know if the proposed settlement included this second case.He said he spoke with someone at ServiceNow who told him that “all matters in controversy between the parties have been settled, in principle.” ServiceNow did not immediately respond to IBD’s request for comment.The four remaining claims of the original lawsuit involve ""managing a computer network via hierarchy,"" collecting performance management data, determining the root cause of a problem, and ""spotlight visualization"" for IT service models, Furby noted.As for separate litigation filed against ServiceNow in February 2014 by the former Hewlett-Packard Co. -- now represented in the action by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) -- claiming eight patent infringements, the court threw out four claims, stayed litigation on two, and scheduled an April 29 hearing and a May 22, 2017, trial date for the remaining two claims, Furby said.“The BMC settlement has yet to be finalized, and we are unclear what the amount will be and whether ServiceNow will be paying ongoing licensing fees to BMC as part of a potential settlement,” Furby wrote.ServiceNow has not been accruing reserves for damages but has been “expensing significant ongoing attorney fees ... incorporated into guidance,” he said. Furby put the company’s net cash pile at about $700 million and estimated $325 million in free cash flow in 2016 prior to any settlement.ServiceNow stock is trading 34% off a record high 91.28 set Dec. 4. Its stock plunged 15.7% on Jan. 28 after reporting billings below expectations, although fourth-quarter non-GAAP EPS was up 533% to 19 cents, doubling analysts' consensus, and revenue was up 44% to $285.6 million, also topping Wall Street.The IBD Computer Software-Enterprise industry group, led by SAP and Salesforce.com, has fallen 18% from its November highs. With $91.9 billion in market cap, SAP leads the group, followed by Salesforce’s $46.8 billion market value. ServiceNow's market cap stands at $9.6 billion.Shares of SAP and  Salesforce were up a fraction Tuesday afternoon, but Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock was down 2.5%.

411,CRM,"IBM (IBM) is helping Box (BOX) notch some big deals, analysts say, and Box’s partnership with Microsoft (MSFT) could also provide a lift.Box stock gapped up 15% at the open in the stock market today, nearly touching a 14.62 buy point out of a cup base. But in morning trading Thursday, Box stock was up just 2.5%, below 13.The online data storage and file-sharing service provider late Wednesday posted a narrower-than-expected fiscal Q4 loss, as revenue growth of 36% topped expectations.Box said that it had closed 13 customer deals valued at more than $500,000 each in the three months that ended Jan. 30, up from nine such deals in the year-earlier period. Box also said that it had closed 66 deals valued over $100,000 each, up from 57 in the year-earlier period.“The IBM partnership showed early signs of traction with a few of the largest deals in the quarter,” said Richard Davis, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, in a research report Thursday.Box partnered with IBM in June 2015 to develop new applications and jointly market products and services. The companies expanded their partnership in December.“Box beat fiscal Q4 estimates with continued momentum in enterprise, strong traction with IBM and better-than-anticipated upsales of (content management product) governance,” said Rob Owens, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, in a report.Box competes with Microsoft, though it’s now a partner for Office 365 products as well. It also counts as rivals Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google, privately held Dropbox, Amazon.com (AMZN) and others.At Credit Suisse, analyst Philip Winslow said in a report last week, “We remain encouraged by the growing traction of Box's new products in addition to its partnerships with IBM and Microsoft.”Wrote Pacific Crest's Owens: “We believe enterprise traction is improving as companies see a need for a unified content management platform across cloud applications, which is helped by technology integrations with Office365 and Salesforce (CRM).”

412,CRM,"Hit anti-superhero flick ""Deadpool"" got made with what's been called an all-Adobe workflow. No wonder Adobe Systems (ADBE) CEO Shantanu Narayen sounds a fan.In a keynote address kicking off the Adobe Summit 2016 digital marketing conference Tuesday, he used the cheeky comic book movie to illustrate how the content world's gone digital.Adobe, of course, makes the Creative Cloud digital tools, such as Photoshop and Premiere Pro video editing software, and the Adobe Marketing Cloud tools used to track online content popularity and to power advertising decisions. The company gets a near-top IBD Composite Rating of 97, and the stock hit a new high in high volume Friday, after Adobe beat analyst views in its first-quarter earnings report and lifted its annual sales and earnings guidance. After February's market dip, Adobe stock is back where it was in early January.""Last year one of the biggest media companies in the world decided to make an unknown superhero as big as Captain America without the usual big media and TV spots,"" Narayen said in a livecast keynote from the event in Las Vegas that he said drew more than 10,000 attendees. ""Deadpool, a brash antihero most people had never heard of, wove his way into their lives through using one of the most innovative digital and social media campaigns ever.""""Deadpool,"" by film folks at Twenty-First Century Fox (FOX), ""shattered all box office records and is on the way to becoming the highest-grossing R-rated movie in film history,"" Narayen said. He went on to talk about how MasterCard (MA), too, had moved to ""pivot"" a bit from traditional ad strategy toward online and social forms, exemplified by its #Priceless Surprises campaign that included things like winning a trip to the Grammy Awards.""Businesses must re-imagine how they interact with customers in a digital-first and digital-enabled world,"" Narayen said, adding that ""getting content to the right person at the right place at the right time takes data"" -- that is, the ability to analyze and target.Adobe made several announcements in conjunction with its annual Summit show, including these three Adobe Marketing Cloud enhancements, among others:After viewing started migrating away from the television itself toward online viewing via devices such as mobile phone screens and tablets, some online video viewing is now ""going back to the living room,"" Jeremy Helfand, Adobe's vice president of video solutions, told IBD. ""Over 20% of 'TV Everywhere' viewing is happening on (television-) connected devices -- Apple (AAPL) TV, Roku or (Sony (SNE)) PlayStation or (Microsoft (MSFT)) Xbox, which is quite remarkable.""Historically, ""there was one currency -- it was Nielsen -- that's what was used in order to purchase advertising,"" Helfand said, ""largely through upfronts and some residuals -- that's how advertising was bought and sold.""But tracking how many people are watching what these days, across a bunch of devices and websites, hasn't been easy and that has hampered online video monetization efforts. Adobe Certified Metrics, which involves a developing partnership with ComScore following last year's link-up with Nielsen, is one way that Adobe aims to make audience measurement easier and more standardized.""You've seen ComScore merge with Rentrak trying to bring digital and linear together just as Nielsen is,"" Helfand said. ""And you're also seeing some media companies build their own definitions of who their audiences are, and go out to (ad) buyers and say 'here's my audience'.""The partnerships and platform development further Narayen's goal of Adobe products and services being able to ""make, monetize and measure"" the digital experiences that people have in today's world of content. The hope is that in turn will make Adobe software more crucial across a breadth of industries.In its Q1 report last week, digital marketing segment revenue at Adobe reached $406.2 million, which Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brendan Barnicle said, in a research note, was ""better than the expectation of $402.7 million."" He added that the Summit event this week was ""likely  to  provide  additional  positive  announcements  on  the marketing business.""Adobe added 798,000 new subscribers for its Creative Cloud businesses last quarter, and Barnicle noted that 30% of them were new to Adobe. He sees more CEOs driving adoption of Adobe products.""Like Salesforce.com (CRM) and Workday (WDAY), Adobe is seeing more CEOs make purchasing decisions,"" he wrote. ""In the 2016 Pacific Crest CFO Survey, both CIOs and CMOs saw a decline in the portion of the IT budget that they control. We believe that CEOs are making more IT decisions than ever before. They are looking to move their businesses to digital and to the cloud, and Adobe is one of several beneficiaries.""The Adobe Summit runs through Thursday, with actor George Clooney among speakers listed for the event -- albeit most come more from the tech side than from Tinseltown.San Jose, Calif.-based Adobe has offices around the globe, including in Diegem, Belgium. It's just outside Brussels, where terrorist attacks hit the airport and a subway station early Tuesday. Narayen started his talk with condolences, and despite its Summit event @Adobe said it was keeping its Twitter account silent for the day, in light of the Brussels situation.

413,CRM,"There's a notion out there, says Deutsche Bank analyst Karl Keirstead, that Amazon’s (AMZN) flavor of the Linux open-source operating system is about as good as other Linux distributions -- and since it's free and Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers good support, converting is cheap.So does that stand to hurt Red Hat (RHT), which reports its fiscal fourth-quarter 2016 earnings after the stock market close Tuesday?""Bottom line, we conclude that the number of migrations from RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) to Amazon Linux remains quite modest and mostly confined to small enterprise customers,"" Keirstead wrote in a research note March 13. ""Larger RHEL-centric customers have only a small mix of workloads on AWS, they value OS consistency across their hybrid infrastructures, they prefer support from RHT and/or view the cost savings of a switch as being too modest to be worth the hassle.""These advantages appear to more than offset a view that AMZN Linux is at/near functional parity with other Linux distributions.""Keirstead reiterated Deutsche's buy rating for Red Hat with a 95 price target, which might take Red Hat a couple of months to achieve if it stays on the same upward trajectory that it's maintained since bottoming out Feb. 8 at a two-year low of 59.59.Red Hat stock was unchanged at 74.90 on Monday after rising 3.2% last week, closing just below its 200-day moving average. Shares are just 12% off a 16-year high set Dec. 30, 24% above its Feb. 8 low.But it looks like Red Hat is rebounding firmly from the Software Sag of '16 that battered many of Red Hat's rivals and tech players in January through early February.Red Hat stock gets an IBD Composite Rating of 84 out of a possible 99, factoring in earnings, sales, stock performance, institutional ownership and other metrics. Enterprise software developer Salesforce.com (CRM) carries an 81, Microsoft (MSFT) ranks 76, software giant Oracle (ORCL) earns a 61 and SAP (SAP) a 70.For its Q4 ended Feb. 29, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Red Hat earnings per share up 9% from a year earlier to 47 cents minus items, matching the company's guidance. Analysts expect revenue up 16% to $537 million, which also would match the midpoint of the company's guidance of between $535 million and $539 million, and rival the year-ago sales growth rate of 16%.At those levels, Q4 would be Red Hat's first quarter decelerated to single-digit growth since EPS flattened at 42 cents in fiscal 2015's Q3. It would be the 16th consecutive quarter of mid-to-high-teens sales growth.In a research note issued Thursday, Robert W. Baird analyst Steven Ashley warned that Red Hat's long-term revenue growth in Q4 could have fallen below expectations as seen in historical, sequential long-term growth weakness every three years, going back to Q4 2007. This is due to what he theorizes as three pools of larger deals that renew every three years in Q4, with the most recent cohort in Q4 being smaller than the others.""We believe this nuance (if correct) is truly just 'noise' and short-term billings should remain strong,"" Ashley said.He models Q4's total billings growth (long-term and short-term) at a 10% year-to-year improvement vs. the 12% consensus.""Where could we be wrong?"" Ashley asked. ""Signing a bunch of 'new' large three-year deals could augment the smaller renewal pool.""He tipped his hat to Baird's outperform rating on Red Hat with an 80 price target.

414,CRM,"While investors applauded Hewlett Packard Enterprise's first quarterly performance as an independent company -- beating Wall Street estimates and driving its stock up more than 13% Friday -- some analysts and owners are pushing CEO Meg Whitman to compete harder.That means more aggressively taking on cloud enterprise leaders Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), and buying up software  rivals such as Workday (WDAY) or Salesforce.com (CRM), rather than directing cash to shareholders.""I think we need to give Meg a chance to see if she can take advantage of the opportunities in servers with the cloud migration led by Amazon Web Services, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Microsoft on the service and software side,"" said Daniel Morgan, vice president of Synovus Trust, which holds 251,971 shares of HPE, in a Friday interview with IBD.""Further, the 54% year-over-year growth in the Q1 2016 quarter in networking allows HPE to build more momentum in this space"" vs. rivals Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Juniper Networks (JNPR), he said.""And finally as we discussed before, the huge opportunity to expand the software unit with its 17%-plus operating margins (enables) a large acquisition in the cloud space. Right now software is just 8%-10% of total HPE revenues.""Buying enterprise software rivals Salesforce or Workday specifically is ""a chance to make that unit significant by bringing it up to 20%-25% of revenues,"" he said. ""Post-split, Hewlett Packard Enterprise was supposed to be the growth portion of the Hewlett-Packard Co., (creating) a reinvigorated growth company.""Nevertheless, happy with HPE's earnings performance issued after Thursday's market close, investors bid up its stock up 13.5% to close at 15.44 in the stock market today. That's less than 3% below its Dec. 1 high since splitting from its parent Nov. 1.For now, HPE stockholders interested in growth of any kind will need patience because the company is still shrinking, despite the slight Q1 beat.Hewlett Packard Enterprise reported earnings of 41 cents per share in the fiscal Q1 ended Jan. 31, on sales down 3% to $12.72 billion vs. pro forma figures from a year earlier. The results slightly beat the average view of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, which called for EPS of 40 cents on sales of $12.68 billion. The non-GAAP 41 cents EPS is down from 47 cents a year earlier. (However, if HPE had been a standalone company at the time, Q1 2015 adjusted EPS would have been 44 cents, the company said in a March 1 note.)That's pretty much as planned, with HPE not projecting much growth until fiscal 2018. For Q2 ending in April, HPE expects EPS ex items of 39 cents to 43 cents.  Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Q2 EPS ex items of 42 cents on sales of $12.297 billion before Thursday's earnings release, but on Friday, the revenue consensus was revised up to $12.332 billion.For the entire fiscal 2016 ending Oct. 31,  analysts  polled by Thomson Reuters projected $1.87 EPS ex items for fiscal 2016 ending Oct. 31, on revenue revised up Friday to $50.805 billion. HPE earlier had modeled $50.81 billion in revenue in fiscal 2016, down 2.5% from a $52.12 billion pro forma in fiscal 2015.The slightly smaller half of the old Hewlett-Packard Co., now called HP Inc. (HPQ), kept the legacy PCs, printers and ticker. HP Inc. lifted 0.6% to 11.18 Friday. Hewlett Packard Enterprise kept the enterprise software, servers, networking and financial services businesses.To encourage patience among Hewlett Packard Enterprise shareholders, CFO Tim Stonesifer said HPE will “return at least 100% of our free cash flow outlook to shareholders” in fiscal 2016, after devoting $1.3 billion to share repurchases and dividends in Q1. In ""addition,"" Stonesifer said, shareholders will receive a ""majority"" of proceeds from the sale of a 51% stake in its Chinese server and storage business to Tsinghua Holdings, valued at $2.3 billion at the time the deal was announced last May. The transaction was supposed to be done by February, but Whitman said regulatory delays have pushed back closing to May, after which the cash will flow to shareholders.To UBS analyst Steve Milunovich, who complained in the post-earnings-release conference call that HPE shares were priced too low, Whitman chuckled: “We appreciate that, which is why we’re backing up the truck” to buy back more shares, which helps boost the price.Whitman advised analysts that by investing internally and encouraging organic growth “you don’t end up with a Frankenstein of architecture"" as the company would risk doing by  growing through acquisitions. She cited HPE for pursuing both paths.“Our innovation engine is firing on all cylinders, and you're going to see some amazing new introductions in the coming quarters in key areas of the portfolio, including servers, cloud, high-performance computing, IoT (Internet of Things), all-flash storage, Aruba and converged systems.” Aruba Networks is a networking leader in mobile enterprise that the old Hewlett-Packard agreed to buy last March for about $3 billion, strengthening the new HPE's rivalry with Cisco Systems and Juniper Networks.As for ""taking advantage of the disruption in the marketplace,"" Whitman said, ""we learned a lot about how to do this in the context of IBM's (IBM) sale of their server business to Lenovo. ... We have a big opportunity to go take (merging) Dell and EMC (EMC) business, much as we took a lot of the Lenovo business that would have gone to Lenovo.”She told CNBC on Friday that ""in the last quarter, we had about 107 deals that we actually took from Dell/EMC.""She also told analysts that HPE has become the ""leading infrastructure provider for SAP (SAP) HANA (application server) with nearly twice the number of shipments over the next competitor.”In the cloud, she said, ""following a major wave of product releases across our HPE Helion portfolio in the second half of 2015, we are seeing strong customer traction. In fact, since separation, Helion has gained over 200 customer wins, including some of the world's largest banks, service providers and industrials.”It just wasn't enough for Needham analyst Richard Kugele, who chided the company in a research note issued Friday, arguing that the $2.3 billion windfall from Tsinghua should be spent on organic or M&A growth, not shareholders' short-term benefit.""We had hoped that post-split, HPE would be able to focus on getting its house in order and leverage its cash and balance sheet to buy/invest in solutions that solve their product gaps,"" Kugele said. ""Instead, the company seems intent on continuing financial engineering by doubling its cash return to shareholders (including the pending Tsinghua cash). In our view, this creates no sustainable value for the company or its investors but merely provides a floor for the stock during a period of poor enterprise spending.""With no material growth, revenue improvement or product strategy to build a buy thesis around, we reiterate our hold rating on the stock.""Said Morgan, the Synovus Trust portfolio manager who wants to give Whitman time to execute: ""I did hear HPE management touting its share repurchases and FCF (free cash-flow) generation capability on the call. And this is very reminiscent of when Mark Hurd was leading HPQ  (the former Hewlett-Packard Co.) and grew the share price through financial engineering and not new product growth.""Hurd is now co-CEO of Oracle (ORCL), one of HPE's toughest software rivals, and another legacy giant growing slowly.

415,CRM,"Are long-lagging software stocks ready to rebound?With the major stock market indexes rallying about 2%, even Tableau Software (DATA) was up 4% by early afternoon Tuesday. But the real mover is enterprise software developer Workday (WDAY), back to work after an anxious Leap Year workday when it unveiled Q4 earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street -- for the 13th time in 14 quarters -- but then sucked some oxygen out of the room by guiding the current Q1 sales below analyst estimates. The stock edged down in after-hours trade Monday.No matter. Workday stock gapped up 9.1% after the morning bell, then slipped slightly, then rebounded to sit 9.8% higher at 66.40 in midafternoon trading in the stock market today, heading for a fifth straight up day, its ninth in the last 11. Workday stock is still 29% off a three-month high made last May.The entire IBD Computer Software-Enterprise industry group was up 2.3% by midafternoon, also on a five-day win run, boosted by Salesforce.com's (CRM) big 11% jump after issuing solid earnings and outlook after the close Feb 24. Salesforce was up 2.3% in afternoon trade Tuesday, while legacy software king Oracle (ORCL) was up 2.9% to 37.85.Salesforce is the highest-ranked of the bunch, with an IBD Composite Rating of 88 out of a possible 99, tracking metrics such as earnings growth, stock market performance and other measures. But the Computer Software-Enterprise industry group as a whole ranks just 90th in performance out of 197 tracked by IBD. The Computer Software-Database group, where low-rated Tableau resides, ranks near the bottom, at 184, though both groups have been on an upswing since the second week of February, clambering back from steep losses the prior week. Oracle, Tableau and Workday still hold relatively low IBD Composite Ratings in the 40s.A little momentum at Workday? Analysts differ. They're impressed, but also cautious.Citing Workday's ""strong billings"" -- up 44% -- with financial management software customers ""roughly doubling"" year over year to 207 clients, FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi lowered his price target to 75 from 80 and retained his sector perform rating on Workday, not so much on any weakness at Workday but ""due to recent market multiple contraction.""And while revenue guidance for Q1 came in below analyst expectations, ""billings guidance was above,"" Seyrafi wrote in a research note issued Tuesday.""We are also impressed by WDAY’s strong degree of visibility,"" he said. Unearned revenue of $900 million grew by 42%, but noncancelable backlog -- not on the balance sheet -- grew by 62% to $1.56 billion, he noted.""This results in the combination of unearned revenue and backlog at $2.5 billion, up 54%. Since this represents 82% of our estimated next-eight-quarter subscription revenue, up from 72% at the end of fiscal 2015, WDAY’s visibility has increased.""Similarly, analyst David Hynes lowered Canaccord Genuity's price target to 75 from 95 but reiterated a buy rating for Workday.""Lots of things happening at Workday,"" he wrote in a research note, citing ""record new customer adds, Fortune 500 go-lives, triple-digit pipeline growth, improving competitive win rates, increasing attach rates, new SKUs set to hit the market in (the current) fiscal 2017, and the list goes on.""Those new SKUs -- stock keeping units, or individual products -- in planning, learning management and student software are expected to add ""more than"" a $5 billion total addressable market for Workday to work over, co-founder and CEO Aneel Bhusri told analysts in a post-earnings conference call late Monday. That's on top of Workday's core financial management and human capital management (HCM) software product markets.Then again, Brean Capital analyst Yun Kim warned that billings growth decelerated to 42% in fiscal 2016 from 69% in 2015. ""Its fiscal 2017 billings guidance calls for modest 31% growth,"" Kim wrote in a research note issued Tuesday.""While overall FY17 revenue and billings guidance was mostly positive, we believe its outlook for flat margins could disappoint some investors,"" Kim said.Brean Capital rates Workday a hold with a 60.45 price target.""Overall, given lack of transparency into its new business bookings, we believe there will likely be a high degree of uncertainty that exists among investors regarding its true sales momentum,"" Kim wrote.Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne lowered his price target to 75 from 95 but maintained a buy rating.""Overall, we believe the longer-term trends in the business remain positive, and WDAY remains one of the best multiyear growth stories in software,"" he said in a Tuesday research note. ""But given that the market remains wary of high valuation SaaS  (Software as a Service) names, investors will need to take a long-term view.""For the current Q1 2017, Workday guided revenue below analysts' views to a range of $337 million to $339 million but didn't forecast earnings. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect on average a Q1 per-share loss minus items of 2 cents, flat with a year ago, on $343.3 million in revenue vs. Q1 2016's $251 million.

416,CRM,"Stocks were pressured for a second day near midday Wednesday, once again following the lead of oil.The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq gave up 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq volume was tracking higher than Tuesday's levels in the stock market today.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, April WTI crude oil slumped another 3% to $30.80 a barrel after losing nearly 5% Tuesday.In economic news, January new-home sales came in at 494,000, below the consensus estimate for 520,000. The data came on the heels of existing-home sales data Tuesday that came in above expectations. IBD's home-building group was mostly unfazed by the news, falling much less than the broad market.In earnings news, home-improvement retailer Lowe's (LOW) gapped down after hitting resistance at its 50-day moving average Tuesday. A 28% rise in quarterly profit and 6% increase in sales weren't enough to impress Wall Street.First Solar (FSLR), meanwhile, soared 11.5%. Earnings and sales declined from the year-ago quarter, but profit of $1.60 a share more than doubled expectations. First Solar is closing in quickly on a 72.22 buy point in an eight-week consolidation. But the market hasn't been all that friendly to breakout attempts lately. In the growth space, few are working.Chip firm Mellanox Technologies (MLNX) bucked the trend, rising 4%. It's been one of the more resilient names in the growth space. As of Tuesday's close, its industry group -- Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless -- ranked No. 29 in IBD's 197 industry group rankings. The company's interconnect products are found in the storage, enterprise data center and cloud markets.Salesforce.com (CRM) gapped down ahead of its earnings report after the close. Despite still-strong growth prospects, the stock has suffered a lot of technical damage in recent weeks. At 25% off its high, Salesforce faces overhead supply (potential selling pressure) as it tries to work its way higher. Quarterly profit is seen rising 36% to 19 cents a share.

417,CRM,"All in a Leap Year workday's work, Workday (WDAY) late Monday issued its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street views, though its Q1 revenue outlook missed forecasts. Shares were up in early trading Tuesday.The company's CEO said that Workday will expand its total addressable market in fiscal 2017 by pushing products in its planning, learning management and students areas, beyond its core financial management and human capital management applications.And the Q4 that ended Jan. 31 marked the 13th time in 14 quarters that Workday beat consensus on earnings and revenue since going public in October 2012, priced at 28.But CFO Mark Peek forecast Q1 revenue of $337 million to $339 million, up 35% at the midpoint but below the $343.3 million modeled by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Workday stock was up 8% in early trading in the stock market today, near 65. Workday stock hit a 39-month low at 47.32 on Feb. 9. The stock climbed over the past two weeks but is still down 18%  this year.Investors in software stocks, battered in recent months, had hoped Workday might encourage upward movement in the sector like Salesforce.com (CRM) did last week when its stock jumped 11% after its fiscal Q4 earnings and its outlook beat expectations. The enterprise software sector dived Feb. 5 after Big Data developer Tableau Software (DATA) issue a disappointing Q4 and gave soft guidance. Tableau crashed 49.5% that day to 41.33 and has recovered just 10% since its plunge.""We ended FY16 on a high note, with a very strong fourth quarter across product lines and around the world,"" Workday CEO Aneel Bhusri said in the earnings release. ""Demand for our financial management and HCM (human capital management) products continues to rise, as do our competitive win rates. The year ahead brings us an expanded addressable market with the delivery of Planning, Learning Management and Student applications that allow customers to drive employee engagement and productivity in new and transformative ways.""Big legacy software developer Oracle (ORCL) unwittingly might be helping Workday by somewhat reducing its automatic promotional Software as a Service to customers,  D.A. Davidson analyst Jack Andrews wrote in a research note before Workday's earnings release.JPMorgan analyst Mark Murphy asked about that topic during Workday's earnings conference call late Monday, prompting Bhusri’s competitive bluntness: Oracle has “had time to get customers into production and hasn’t been able to, (while) 75% of our customers are in production. That’s actually the real driver behind win rates.”Among big recent wins, Bhusri cited transportation firm J.B. Hunt (JBHT) for going live with Workday’s financial management suite, now its largest financial management customer, and Bank of America (BAC) for going live with Workday’s HCM suite, “our largest HCM customer in production.”Bhusri said customer satisfaction levels are at 98%.The company posted a per-share loss minus items of a penny in Q4, better than its six-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter, on revenue of $323.4 million, up 43%.Workday had guided Q4 to revenue of $317 million to $320 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had modeled $320.3 million when Q3 results were reported in November, but then revised it down to $319.6 million. Analysts had expected an adjusted loss per share of 5 cents.Though Q1 revenue guidance missed, Workday CFO Peek also had more positive news.“Looking ahead to our fiscal 2017, we are increasing our billings guidance for the first quarter from $350 million to $360 million to $365 million,” he said. “Billings for fiscal 2017 are expected to be between $1.855 billion and $1.875 billion. For the first quarter, we expect subscription revenue of $277 million to $278 million and total revenue of $337 million to $339 million.”Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect a Q1 per-share loss minus items of two cents, on $343.3 million in revenue. For the fiscal year, analysts have modeled adjusted earnings of four cents per share on revenue of $1.546 billion. Workday reported fiscal 2016 revenue of $1.16 billion, up 48%, so its guidance would represent a 33% increase.
"
418,CRM,"Well, it's no Salesforce.com (CRM) in size, but investors are turning their attention to hot little rival Workday (WDAY), which reports earnings after the close Monday.The maker of cloud-based HR and financial software likely will show continued fast growth -- while likely staying in the red as it spends to grow.For its fiscal Q4 2016 ended Jan. 31 , Workday guided to revenue of $317 million to $320 million, up 40% to 41% from the year-earlier quarter. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had modeled $320.3 million when Workday issued its Q3 results three months ago, but since then the consensus has slipped to $319.6 million. Workday didn't forecast earnings, but analysts expect an adjusted loss per share of 4 cents vs. a 6-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter.Like many stocks, Workday has been scraping bottom lately, hitting a 39-month low on Feb. 9 at 47.32. Workday stock fell 16% on Feb. 5, but it wasn't alone. That was the day Tableau Software (DATA) tanked 49.5% after releasing slower growth guidance for 2016, sending most software stocks down with it. Since then, Workday stock has enjoyed two good weeks, up 1% in early trading in the stock market today, near 60 but still down 25% for the year.Workday stock rose 3.2% Thursday, with enterprise software stocks helped by Salesforce.com's late-Wednesday earnings beat and better-than-expected guidance. Salesforce.com stock rose 11% Thursday but was down a fraction early Friday.Noting that Workday ""has beaten consensus revenue and EPS estimates in 12 of the 13 quarters it has been public,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Jack Andrews is bullish. ""We expect (Q4)  revenue to grow 41.9% ...  to $321.2 million, above consensus ...  and above the high end of the (Workday-provided) guidance range. By segment, we are projecting 44.6% growth in subscription services to $263 million (81.9% of total revenue) and 31.0% growth in professional services to $58.2 million,"" he said in a research report.He expects a 3-cent per-share loss minus items, a penny better than consensus.""One interesting note is that we believe Oracle (ORCL) has pulled back a bit on its promotional program on SaaS (Software as a Service) and aims to offer future promotions to customers tactically, rather than automatically,"" Andrews wrote. Davidson maintains a buy rating on Oracle stock.  It also has a buy rating on Workday stock, with a 99 price target.Oracle stock rose 1.8% Thursday, but was flat early Friday.Investment banker R.W. Baird on Thursday lowered its price target on Workday to 70 from 85, but it rates the stock outperform. ""Workday's share price has also been significantly reduced along with other high-valuation software stocks during the recent correction,"" wrote Baird analyst Steven Ashley.In Workday's Q3 earnings conference call with analysts, CFO Mark Peek said an adjusted operating profit likely wouldn't happen until Q2 this year.
"
419,CRM,"No. 1 tax-preparation software maker Intuit (INTU) -- as it heads into its busy season -- posted Q2 earnings and Q3 revenue guidance that beat Wall Street expectations, only to see its shares fall. One analyst says that the shares might be falling because the company didn't raise its guidance for the year.At least two analysts raised their price targets on Intuit stock after the earnings release, and another was bullish on the tax season. Yet, Intuit stock fell 4.3% on the stock market today, to 95.75.In an interview after the earnings release late Thursday, Intuit CFO Neil Williams said that the company's ""momentum is really continuing into Q3.""Intuit said that sales for its fiscal Q2, which ended Jan. 31, rose 23% from the year-earlier quarter to $923 million. The company swung to a 25-cent per-share profit minus items from a 6-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $893 million and 19 cents.The company doesn't give earnings guidance, but it expects Q3 sales of $2.2 billion to $2.26 billion -- at the midpoint up only 4.4% from the year-earlier quarter but above the $2.2 billion analyst consensus. Wall Street expects EPS ex items to rise 10%, to $3.15 per share.For the fiscal year, Intuit sees revenue of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion, up 8.5% at the midpoint.But the company didn't raise its guidance for the year, RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan told IBD, and there are questions about the company's underlying growth potential.Another factor could be the strong earnings and guidance this week from software makers  Salesforce.com (CRM) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW). Intuit, MacMillan says, is regarded as a ""defensive"" stock play, but if other stocks are doing well, Intuit is less attractive.In a research note, MacMillan said that Intuit's TurboTax sales stood out last quarter, rising 9%. He hiked his price target on Intuit stock -- but only to 93 from 91.UBS analyst Brent Thill called the results the ""best start to tax season in 13 years.""The fiscal Q3 tax season is always the company's biggest quarter.“We’re in the third year of a multiyear journey and are beginning to see a sea change in how Americans prepare their taxes, driven by the massive innovation across the TurboTax experience combined with a breakthrough marketing campaign that makes our product the hero,” Sasan Goodarzi, executive vice president and general manager of Intuit’s Consumer Tax Group, said in the earnings release.Part of Intuit's plan to drive consumer tax growth is to leverage its do-it-yourself tax packages, CFO Williams told IBD. ""Think about growing the DIY market as growing our total addressable market,"" he said.Thill also says that Intuit is a good defensive play. Williams agrees, saying that the small businesses that comprise much of Intuit's customer base often turn to its software packages when the economy heads south. Besides TurboTax, Intuit is known for its Quicken and QuickBooks small-business software.""Our products are needed most when small-business owners are maybe facing some headwinds economically."" Williams said. ""We do well with economic uncertainty.""Wedbush analyst Gil Luria raised his price target on Intuit stock to 100 from 90.Intuit rival H&R Block (HRB), which makes the other major tax-preparation software product, is slated to report fiscal Q3 earnings on Thursday.
"
420,CRM,"Spunky Big Data stock Splunk (SPLK) popped as much as 16% Friday, after the company late Thursday posted better-than-expected earnings and sales, comforting investors in software stocks that had been battered in recent weeks.Earnings minus items for Splunk's fiscal Q4 ended Jan. 31 rose 22% to 11 cents per share, where Wall Street analysts had expected 8 cents. Revenue rose 49% to $220 million, $17 million more than analysts expected. The company also forecast Q1 revenue higher than Wall Street estimates.Splunk stock eased off its session high but was still up nearly 10% in early afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 42, and still 45% off a 16-month high set July 23 at 76.29.The IBD Computer Software-Database group, which includes Splunk, rose as much as 3% Friday and was up more than 1% in early afternoon trading. Enterprise stocks got a boost not just from Splunk, but also from No. 1 customer relationship management software maker Salesforce.com (CRM), which offered upbeat guidance after the close Wednesday. Salesforce rose 11% Thursday and was down a fraction Friday afternoon.Splunk stock had fallen 23% on Feb. 5, the day after high-flyer Tableau Software (DATA) stunned Wall Street with decelerating sales growth and weak guidance for 2016. Following Tableau's lead, software issues fell by such a sizeable margin that analysts started calling it a software sector correction.""The Splunk (Q4) results were better than anticipated, given the recent disappointing quarters in fast-growth software, particularly SPLK’s Big Data cousin, Tableau,"" wrote Needham analyst Scott Zeller in a Friday research note. ""Splunk has faced growth deceleration over the past year, yet the company finished fiscal 2016 with a respectable 45% (year to year) billings growth and 48% revenue growth.""It is our belief (Q4) was driven by big deals (not disclosed), suggested by the ASPs  (average sale prices) of $80,000 in the quarter vs. typical $40,000-$50,000 range. The challenge will be to convince investors that SPLK can reaccelerate billings and revenue growth, rather than maintain consistent growth.""Zeller reiterated a hold rating on Splunk stock.More positive, with a buy rating and a 67 price target, Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne put Splunk's historical average sale price at $50,000 per software license and $70,000 in Q3, compared with $80,000 in Q4.""Big-deal metrics highlight growing momentum across Splunk's product suite,"" Materne said in a research note.
"
421,CRM,"For the year, he says Splunk customers signed 1,447  six-figure deals, up from 1,112 in fiscal 2015, and 102 seven-figure transactions, up from 68 such biggies in 2015. It also penned three eight-figure deals last year vs. two in the company’s entire previous history.""Splunk continued its strong customer-count trajectory as well, adding 621 net new customers in the quarter and bringing its total customer count to over 11,000,"" Materne noted. ""Combined, we believe the fact that Splunk continues to accelerate customer additions while also growing its average contract size is a clear indication of the high level of demand for the company’s solutions and its growing strategic value in the enterprise.""Splunk guided the current Q1 ending April 30 to a non-GAAP operating margin loss of 1% to 2%, on sales of $172 million to $174 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect a 1-cent loss minus items on revenue of $171 million, which would compare to a similar 1-cent loss on $125.7 million in the year-earlier quarter.For Q4, Splunk posted a fully reported loss of 61 cents per share, up from a 47-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter.

422,CRM,"U.S. stocks were mixed and mostly unchanged near midday Thursday, shrugging off a big drop in China stocks overnight.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 held a 0.2% gain each, while the Nasdaq edged 0.1% lower. NYSE and Nasdaq volume was tracking lower than Wednesday's levels.Nike (NKE) and United Technologies (UTX) were early leaders in the Dow, up 2% each.The Shanghai Composite slumped 6.4% amid worries about market liquidity. The Chinese government is hosting the world’s leading central bankers and finance ministers starting Friday.The nascent market uptrend has two things going for it at this point: First, there have been zero distribution days since the Nasdaq followed through on Feb. 17. Second, the market seems to be serving up more breakouts.In the stock market today, a couple of names moved up nicely on earnings. Domino's (DPZ) gapped up out of a long consolidation, rising 9%. Earnings and sales topped expectations while U.S. same-store sales rose a stealth 10.7%.Meanwhile, Salesforce.com (CRM) also gapped up, rising 9%, but it's still 18% off its 52-week high with resistance around 70. The enterprise software firm reported another quarter of solid growth, with earnings up 36% from a year ago. Sales rose 25% to just over $1.8 billion, the sixth straight quarter of 20%+ sales growth.But the news wasn't all good on the earnings front. After bumping up against its 50-day moving average Wednesday, China-based NetEase (NTES) slumped 16%. The company reported another quarter of strong earnings and sales growth, but Wall Street focused on margin pressure.Restoration Hardware (RH) caved in 25% after the company gave disappointing preliminary Q4 guidance late Wednesday.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI April crude oil lost 1% to $31.76 a barrel.Image provided by Shutterstock.
"
423,CRM,"Salesforce.com (CRM) matched analyst forecasts on earnings and beat them on revenue with a record fourth quarter, but shares soared in late trade after the enterprise cloud pioneer raised its forecast for sales growth.Announcing earnings after the market close Wednesday, Salesforce said adjusted fourth-quarter earnings rose 36% to 19 cents per share on revenue that rose 25% to $1.81 billion. Earnings were right on the money, according to estimates from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, but sales were better than the $1.79 billion revenue they had anticipated.The No. 1 developer of customer relationship management software, Salesforce raised full fiscal 2017 revenue guidance to a range of $8.08 billion to $8.12 billion, up from $8.0 billion to $8.1 guided after its third-quarter release.For its first fiscal quarter of 2017, which ends in April, Salesforce said it expects earnings per share of 23-24 cents, up 47% at the midpoint and ahead of analysts’ 21-cent consensus view. That's on revenue up 25% to $1.89 billion, where analysts expected $1.86 billion, up 23%.Its results seemed to strengthen hope that Salesforce might trigger an upturn in software stocks, reversing Tableau Software's (DATA) profitable but softer fourth quarter and weak guidance that triggered a 49.5% collapse in Tableau stock Feb. 5.Tableau's misfortune also precipitated a 15% plunge in the entire IBD Computer Software-Database industry group, where legacy software developer Oracle (ORCL) also resides. Salesforce stock also fell 13% at the time, and the IBD Computer Software-Enterprise industry group where it lives fell 8%.Neither group has recovered, the most notable exception being steady Oracle, up slightly Wednesday to 36.63, 19% off a six-month high set June 17.Days after the Tableau debacle, Salesforce set a 16-month low at 52.60 on Feb. 8, before rising 19.5% through Tuesday’s close at 63.98.  Salesforce ended the regular session down 0.6% to 62.50  in the stock market today. That was 24% off the stock’s all-time high of 82.90, hit Nov. 19, when Salesforce reported fiscal-third-quarter earnings up 50%.After Wednesday's earnings release, Salesforce jumped more than 8% to 67.95 in after-hours trading.""By any measure, this was a spectacular finish to the year with 27% revenue growth in constant currency for the fourth quarter and for the full year,"" Chief Executive Marc Benioff said in the earnings release. ""We are raising our fiscal year 2017 revenue guidance to $8.12 billion at the high end of our range -- unprecedented growth for a company of our size and scale.""Chief Financial Officer Mark Hawkins said its adjusted operating margin rose by 177 basis points, driving full-year operating cash flow up 37% to $1.6 billion during the fourth quarter.Said President and Chief Operating Officer Keith Block: ""We hit an all-time high in large transactions in fiscal 2016,"" adding that Salesforce's cloud platform is growing sales ""across every region, every cloud and every industry.""For full fiscal 2016, revenue rose 24% to $6.67 billion where analysts expected $6.65 billion. Salesforce said subscription and support revenue grew 24% to $6.21 billion and professional services and other revenue rose 28% to $462 million. The full-year adjusted earnings matched Wall Street at 75 cents.Salesforce managed to take a fourth-quarter unadjusted loss of 4 cents, better than the 6-cent loss expected by Wall Street.Beyond predicting Salesforce’s first $8 billion year in fiscal 2017, Benioff repeatedly assures that the company is ""well on the path to reach $10 billion faster than any other enterprise software company.""RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan said in a recent note to clients that the firm’s Salesforce1 platform for mobile-application development is driving fresh growth, although ""there are many avenues to sustain growth, including service and marketing, the platform, and international and future initiatives.""MacMillan went on to say: ""We think Salesforce can continue to drive premium growth for its size, and it remains an important strategic asset.""RBC maintains an outperform rating on Salesforce.com stock, with a price target of 80, as ""one of the best positioned companies in large-cap software.""Image provided by Shutterstock.

424,CRM,"The morning bell became music to the ears of software stock investors Thursday as Wall Street used Salesforce.com's Q4 strength and outlook to harmonize.Salesforce.com (CRM), an enterprise cloud pioneer and the No. 1 maker of customer relationship management software, sang soprano, its stock gapping up 11% as soon as the conductor raised the baton on the morning after its upbeat earnings report late Wednesday.Rival SAP (SAP) was up 1.6% in early trade in the stock market today. Fellow enterprise software stocks Ultimate Software (ULTI) rose 2%, ServiceNow (NOW) 2.8% and Manhattan Associates (MANH) nearly 1%.The harmony extended to database choir: Legacy leader Oracle (ORCL) rose a fraction, Qlik (QLIK) 2.7%, Splunk (SPLK) 3.9% and Hortonworks (HDP) 1.8%. Workday (WDAY) leapt 5% despite a lowered price target from Wedbush.Even Tableau Software (DATA) was up as much as 3.5% early Thursday. Tableau stock collapsed 49.5% on Feb. 5 after the company issued soft Q4 results and an outlook of slower growth, sending the entire enterprise software sector into a tailspin.""Slowdown? What Slowdown?"" asked FBN analyst Shebly Seyrafi in a Thursday research note, citing ""600 seven-figure deals"" signed by Salesforce.com during Q4.Salesforce set off a sectorwide rebound, but will it last? By midday, Salesforce had eased to an 8% gain, near 67.50. Most of the other stock also had eased, but remained up. Hortonworks, though, was down more than 1% and Manhattan and Splunk were down a fraction.Canaccord Genuity maintained its buy rating, but without explanation lowered its price target on Salesforce stock to 88 from 95 while praising the company. FBR, too, reportedly lowered its price target, to 82 from 88, but maintained its outperform rating.""By segment, Marketing Cloud was up by 31%,"" he wrote in a Thursday research note. ""App Cloud and other (formerly the Platform segment) was up by 43%, Services Cloud was up by 35% and the flagship Sales Cloud was up by +12%.""Commentary about activity in the most recent quarter included reference to the company’s signing of a new nine-figure transaction as well as a renewal of another large customer, also with a nine-figure sum.""Image provided by Shutterstock.

425,CRM,"Stocks quickly turned slender gains to losses Thursday, navigating mixed influences from overseas markets, early economic data and a raft of quarterly results.The Nasdaq slipped 0.3%. The S&P 500 and the Dow struggled with fractional losses. Volume was unusually soft on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE, suggesting large-scale investors were standing back from early trade.Today's stock market set out with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 recovering to narrow gains so far this week. The market's young uptrend is seeing some affirmative data points and has thus far managed to avoid distribution days -- days in which selling by institutional investors sends the market lower in rising volume. But a positive finish to the week would help bolster investor confidence.Europe's markets hung on to their early advances in afternoon trade, with the CAC-40 in Paris and London's FTSE 100 up more than 2% apiece.But a European rally and a positive surprise in January durable goods orders weren't enough to buck up investor confidence, as weekly jobless claims rose slightly more than expected, and the bulk of early earnings reports offered at least some disappointing news.The December Housing Price Index from the Federal Housing Finance Agency fit that same pattern, rising 0.4% -- good but below November's 0.5% increase and just missing consensus views for another 0.5% gain.Still, the Dow opened with two-thirds of its stocks positive. Nike (NKE) rose 1.5% to lead the index. Chevron (CVX) posted the widest loss, down 1.5%.Salesforce.com (CRM) topped the S&P 500 with a 10% advance. The cloud-based software leader posted Q4 results late Wednesday, with strong guidance drawing similarly strong support from investors. The advance stopped at the stock's 50-day moving average, which could present some resistance as shares attempt to climb the right side of a 37%-deep consolidation.Quanta Services (PWR) muscled 6% higher on above-forecast fourth-quarter results. HP Inc. (HPQ) dropped 7% following disappointing Q4 results.Among IBD 50 stocks, theater real estate investment trust EPR Properties (EPR) pared gains and was up more than 2% after an initial 5% surge. After Wednesday's close, the Kansas City, Mo.-based firm reported better-than-expected funds from operations, but a 7% revenue gain was just shy of estimates, and management lowered its guidance on full-year funds from operations. The move left shares in frustrated stasis, just below a 62.66 buy point.

426,CRM,"Capital keeps fledgling firms and ambitious projects alive. How firms extend financial lifelines:Stay alive. Most startups -- 80% by one estimate -- launch with founder funding. Loans from friends and family are the No. 2 capital source for entrepreneurs.“That only gets you open,” said Michael Sinensky, owner of FB Hospitality -- known in New York City for its popular bars and eateries.Look beyond. Sinensky founded Assure Funding last year to offer an alternative lending option. “We specialize in growth capital for new businesses,” he told IBD.Assure focuses on young but established firms seeking capital for things like expansion, inventory, staffing and unexpected expenses. “They just need some help in that moment,” he said.Show character. The numbers have to add up in any deal. Sinensky also weighs the borrower’s professional experience.“It’s the person and their history,” he said. “We look to see: Is this his first business? Have they taken out loans before?”Shop around. Sinensky’s top advice to entrepreneurs is to be discerning consumers when it comes to loans and lines of credit. “There’s a lot of different rates,” he said.Ride the wave. Small business lending was projected to hit $7.9 billion in 2015, according to Morgan Stanley (MS). That was up 68% from 2014.“I think you are going to see more private lenders,” said Billy Procida, CEO of Procida Funding & Advisors, a commercial real estate lending firm.Gain experience. Procida rose as a builder and developer on the East Coast -- and spent a storied year in 1990 apprenticing with real estate mogul (and now presidential hopeful) Donald Trump -- before getting into investing and lending.Working on big deals gave Procida insights from both sides of the table -- developer and lender.“I pretty much have your deal sized up within five to seven minutes of you getting here,” he said.Check yourself. Entrepreneurs seeking capital need to be brutally realistic. “People underestimate the budget, underestimate the schedule, and they overestimate the value,” Procida said.Bring expertise. A top team sways lenders, so don’t skimp on talent. “Surround yourself with people better than yourself,” Procida said. If you’ve tapped a big-name architect, bring that pro with you to meetings with financiers.Stay close. Procida takes a hands-on approach. His 100 Mile Fund specializes in deals within 100 miles -- or two hours' commute time -- of his office in Englewood Cliffs, N.J.Close proximity benefits both parties. “We’re on the property twice a month,” he said. “We provide development expertise and marketing expertise.”Venture out. Other funding approaches -- angel investing, venture capital and crowdfunding -- remain highly competitive.“It will be more challenging to raise capital in 2016 at every stage,” said Matt Holleran, general partner of Cloud Apps Capital.Specialize. Holleran is taking a market-focused approach with his venture capital fund. His team works exclusively with early-stage, cloud-based app startups.Sticking with one sector lets Holleran, a former Salesforce.com (CRM) exec, bring specific expertise and connections to prospective startups. The result is a matching of minds.“The right amount of capital from the right partners,” Holleran said.Pitch wisely. Entrepreneurs have to bring their A game to venture capitalists who have deep-dive knowledge of their business sector.“It does raise the bar for companies that should get funded at all,” Holleran said. “That’s a good and healthy thing.”

427,CRM,"Stocks slipped from narrows gains to mixed trade after Thursday's open, despite a strong increase in January durable goods orders and rebounding markets in Europe.The Dow pulled back to a 0.7% gain. The S&P 500 clung to a fractional advance, while the Nasdaq reversed to a 0.1% loss.The stock market today picked up generally positive signals from overseas, although China's Shanghai Composite ended its session 6.4% lower. That reverses a three-week advance and sent the index nearly back to its Jan. 27 low.What tripped the sell-off was unclear, but the sentiment did not travel far. The Hong Kong Hang Seng index fell 1.6%, but in Japan, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 picked up a 1.4% gain as the yen shifted lower vs. the dollar.In Europe, markets rebounded robustly after two days of declines.

It sent the online data storage and file-sharing service provider’s stock up 14% in after-hours trading, just after the market close.The company forecast current-quarter revenue above expectations and a narrower-than-expected full-year fiscal 2017 loss.Aaron Levie, co-founder and CEO of Box, said the company closed 13 deals valued at more than $500,000 each in fiscal Q4.“Enterprise IT is experiencing a once-in-a-lifetime shift to the cloud,"" he said on the company’s earnings call.Box’s new customers include AIG (AIG), Genentech and Home Depot (HD).Redwood City, Calif-based Box said revenue for the three months ended Jan. 30 rose 36% to $85 million as corporate customer additions rose, beating views. Box said it lost 26 cents per share minus items. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had modeled a loss of 29 cents per share and revenue of $81.77 million. Box said its non-GAAP operating loss in Q4 was $31.1 million (37% of revenue) vs $32.2 million (51% of revenue) a year earlier.For the current quarter, Box forecasts revenue of $88.5 million at the midpoint of its range, vs. analysts' consensus estimate of $86.9 million. For the fiscal year ending in January 2017, the company expects revenue of about $392 million and a loss of 84 cents at the midpoints of its ranges. Analysts had estimated that Box will report a full-year fiscal 2017 loss of 88 cents with revenue of $392 million.Box stock had closed up 3.7% in regular-session trading in the stock market today, prior to fiscal Q4 results.Known mainly as an Internet cloud storage provider, Box has evolved from a provider of basic online data storage into selling file sharing and collaborative tools for team projects. It also sells content management software for large companies.The company added 3,000 business customers in the January quarter. It had 57,000 paying business customers as of Jan. 30, up from 54,000 in the October quarter. Box says that its paying customers include 59% of the Fortune 500.Box said fiscal Q4 billings, a sales growth metric, rose 59% to $130 million.Box competes with Microsoft (MSFT), though it’s now a partner for Office 365 products as well. It also counts as rivals Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google, privately-held Dropbox, Amazon.com (AMZN) and others.Data storage costs have been falling, owing to the availability of remote data centers packed with computer servers, putting pressure on pricing. One of Box’s challenges, analysts say, is driving average selling prices higher with add-on software modules, such as file-sharing tools, as prices for online data storage continue to fall.Box has been aggressive on pricing to grab market share in the enterprise market, analysts say. It has a strong retention rate among customers. The company's capital spending jumped in fiscal 2016 as it invested in server capacity and built a new headquarters, but capex is expected to drop sharply in the current fiscal year.“With data center investments nearing the end, 2016 is likely to see significant improvement in free cash flow,” said Rob Owens, a Pacific Crest Securities analyst, in a research report.The bearish view is that Box will need to keep buying more servers as it adds customers, making it harder to turn profitable.Box has forecast that it will be free-cash-flow positive starting in fiscal Q4 2017 and FCF positive for the full year in fiscal 2018.Under a ""freemium"" business model, Box also provides consumers with free personal data storage accounts. Box had 41 million free users as of Oct. 31.Aside from Microsoft, Box has alliances with IBM (IBM) and Salesforce.com (CRM) in the enterprise market. Box partnered with IBM in June 2015 to develop new applications and jointly market products and services The IBM relationship has enabled Box to target larger business deals, analysts say.At a Morgan Stanley conference last week, Box said it’s developing a new workflow technology with IBM that will use tools from IBM’s “Watson” artificial intelligence program.While competition has been growing in online data storage, Google and Amazon focus mainly on small and medium-size businesses. Box aims to set itself apart by targeting government agencies as well as industries such as health care, retail, and media and entertainment. It acquired MedXT, a provider of cloud-based medical image viewing, in October 2014.Box currently gets a low IBD Composite Rating of 26 out of a possible 99. The company went public in January 2015, with shares priced at 14. The IPO raised $175 million. Box’s stock spiked on its first day of trading and traded above 20 in June but swooned into the end of 2015, and slid more sharply in January. Its stock touched an all-time low of 8.82 on Jan. 20. Shares began an ascent in early February, though short interest also rose significantly.

429,CRM,"More than most, Salesforce.com's fourth-quarter earnings -- scheduled for release after the market close Wednesday -- could help bring an end to what one analyst calls ""the beatdown that growth software stocks endured for about 45 days.""""We believe that last week probably marked a bottom, or close to a bottom"" for software companies that ""are down about 25% for the average stock,"" wrote Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis in a research note Sunday. ""Deals are getting a bit more scrutiny than before, but we believe we are nowhere near anything that looks like an IT spending clampdown. We are broadly optimistic on the outlook for next-generation software companies.""Salesforce (CRM) stock hit a 16-month low at 52.60 on Feb. 8, then rose 22% through Monday's close at 63.98. Salesforce stock was down a fraction, near 63.50, in afternoon trading in the stock market today. That's 23% off the stock's all-time high of 82.90, hit Nov. 19, after Salesforce reported fiscal-third-quarter earnings up 50%.Salesforce is a cloud software pioneer and the No. 1 maker of customer relationship management software. Salesforce is coming off many years of double-digit revenue growth and seven consecutive quarters of double- or triple-digit earnings-per-share gains, year over year. Its market cap at $42 billion makes it half the size of SAP (SAP), the largest in IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise industry group, and much smaller than business software giant Oracle (ORCL), with its $154.7 billion market cap. But Salesforce is much larger than next-generation cloud software companies Workday (WDAY), ServiceNow (NOW), Ultimate Software (ULTI) and others.Salesforce's fiscal Q4 2016, which ended in January, should make it eight consecutive quarters of double-digit-or-better earnings growth. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Salesforce to report earnings up 36% to 19 cents per share minus items, on revenue up 24% to $1.79 billion. Salesforce had guided Q4 to adjusted EPS of 18 to 19 cents on sales up 24% at the midpoint. Earnings especially were a tough comparison to follow, as EPS had doubled to 14 cents in fiscal Q4 of 2015.For the current Q1 2017 ending in April, Wall Street models EPS up 31% to 21 cents ex items, on revenue up 23% to $1.861 billion.Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said at the Q3 analyst conference: ""We expect to deliver our first $8 billion year during our fiscal year 2017, which puts us well on the path to reach $10 billion faster than any other enterprise software company.""The company's Salesforce1 platform for mobile-application development should spark growth, RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan said in a research note Sunday, although ""there are many avenues to sustain growth, including service and marketing, the platform, and international and future initiatives.""While deceleration is inevitable, we think Salesforce can continue to drive premium growth for its size, and it remains an important strategic asset.""RBC maintains an outperform rating on Salesforce.com stock, with an 80 price target, as ""one of the best positioned companies in large-cap software.""

430,CRM,"Closing high-quality deals and maintaining big accounts are tough, and too often companies rely solely on the sales geniuses of individuals and departments.So notes Tim Sanders, author of “Dealstorming: The Secret Weapon That Can Solve Your Toughest Sales Challenges.” He’s also the former Yahoo (YHOO) chief solutions officer.He says research on top-performing companies proves that sales know-how “is a team sport, involving players from across the enterprise.” Also, his Dealstorming concepts “have led to a stunning 70% close ratio for multimillion-dollar deals” in over 100 cases in which he’s been personally involved.Tips on going wide and long to maximize sales:Live for collaboration. When faced with a sales challenge, “you’ll triple your chances of success by asking your operations, marketing and finance teams for help,” Sanders told IBD. By harnessing that collective brainpower, top companies outsell their competitors by 20% or more. Spread the wealth too at review and bonus time, for the contributions of these nonsales personnel. Turn them loose. It’s been Sanders’ experience that involving the CEO or another top company officer slows the sales initiative planning process and inhibits individual creativity.Junior attendees in meetings are reluctant to speak up or they gravitate to the ideas of the seniors executives, “even if the assumptions behind them are flawed,” he said. “In 75% of cases, the breakthrough idea came from a nonexecutive who was closer to the problem or was free from the constraints of executive or sales process. Make C-suite escalation a last resort, not the first response.”Embrace strategic planning. Sales meetings shouldn’t be 50% information dumps, then discussion. Sanders recommends leaders distribute a “deal brief” to the team at least two days prior to any meeting. It contains a statement of the problem, the opportunity at hand, an influence map, activities to date and premeeting assignments.This process harnesses “the power of incubation, where ideas bump into each other during downtime, sleep or passive activities,” he said. “When meeting attendees show up, often they come with ideas in hand. This leads to a much more efficient use of meeting time. The most innovative companies in the world from IDEO to Procter & Gamble (PG) live by this.”Illuminate. When dealing with prospects, ask them to identify major issues, says James Nielsen, CEO of Sales Bootcamp, which teaches the professional sales process to college graduates and new hires.“If your prospect doesn’t have an urgent problem to solve, you’re going to have a tough time convincing them to evaluate, purchase and implement your solution,” he points out.Provide real answers. Prospects need numbers and proof points to support your argument that you can solve their problem and that you can solve it better than anyone else, Nielsen says.Generate leads. Companies should build a sales development team that focuses exclusively on prospecting into new accounts, Nielsen advises. Create a target account list based on a specific niche your company is focused on.“Try to understand their business the best you can before picking up the phone,” he said. Further, personalize your prospecting emails and voicemail. “Something in that email should be very specific to them or their business.”He adds that Salesforce.com (CRM), which offers customer relation management products, has generated an additional $100 million in revenue by adding an outbound sales development department.Be persistent. One email isn't going to cut it, Nielsen says. Utilize Twitter (TWTR) and LinkedIn (LNKD) when applicable.Broaden hiring criteria. Many top producers fail to replicate their success in their next job because they are dependent on previous systems and products for it.“To build a collaborative sales culture, ask candidates about how they solved big sales challenges or landed big accounts,” Sanders said. “A key question is to ask, 'What nonsales projects have you volunteered for, and what was your role?’ This reveals the intrarelationship builder who creates the future.”Image provided by Shutterstock.

431,CRM,"The distance between creative concept and viable business is shortened by savvy guides. How would-be entrepreneurs find their way:Speak up. Expert advice helps bootstrappers become successful businesspeople, but many don’t know whom to ask or how to get acquainted.“I realized there wasn’t a good place -- if you had an idea -- to get help,” said Carter Wigell, founder and CEO of Ideator.com.The website provides a platform for entrepreneurs to connect with mentors and investors.Virtualize it. Wigell envisioned Ideator in 2008 as an alternative to incubators and accelerators that buy into outfits and mentor their growth.“I’m a huge fan of those programs,” Wigell told IBD.Ideator’s approach lets entrepreneurs and advisors meet virtually and consult online, rather than strictly in person or within a specific program.“I truly believe in the value of aligning yourself with the right advisor and mentors,” Wigell said.Tap talent. Advisors on the Ideator site include executives from Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL), LinkedIn (LNKD), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Salesforce.com (CRM).Participants are not hindered by geography or status.“Democratizing the process -- that’s really my vision,” Wigell said.Click in. Would-be entrepreneurs create Ideator profiles describing their business concepts. The profiles can be private -- so only invited advisors have access -- or public.On the Ideator website, aspiring bootstrappers can reach out to advisors and investors to seek feedback and build teams. Conversely, participating investors and business pros can peruse public profiles for appealing ideas and newbies to help.“I wanted serial entrepreneurs to be able to collaborate on our platform,” Wigell said.Compete. Last December, Ideator offered a $10,000 award for the top submitted business idea. Judges from the Nasdaq Entrepreneurial Center, Salesforce.com, Pepperdine University and startup database CrunchBase weighed more than 100 entries.First place went to TrustMesh, an app that lets companies update the status of their software’s programming instructions and standards -- called APIs.Reach out. The idea was boosted by TrustMesh co-founder Pankaj Arora’s background as a software developer. “We see this problem of mistrust between systems,” he said.Workers who depend on software APIs struggle to keep up with their status updates. TrustMesh centralizes this info.Arora looked to Ideator to turn the techy concept into a business.“It’s an ecosystem where we can get different kinds of resources,” Arora said. “Just because of Ideator, we have multiple advisors who have helped us.”What he gained was traction.“We believe ideas are easy to get. Execution is very tough,” Arora said.Test it. Preparing his pitch for Ideator’s December contest solidified TrustMesh’s business strategy.“That was a good experience. It gave us some confidence that we had a good go-to-market strategy,” Arora said.Expand reach. Wisher, a wishing and giving app where users post things and experiences they want -- reminiscent of a Christmas gift list -- was launched in the U.K. by South African entrepreneur Maz Cohen.On Ideator, she tapped expertise from business pros in the U.S.“All of a sudden, everyone was sharing their business plans with me,” she said. “They were willing to discuss things with me. It really gives you the strength to go on.”Seek feedback. A first step if you have a big idea? Put it on paper and show it to friends, family and colleagues. “Talk around the concept with them,” Cohen said.Image provided by Shutterstock.

439,CRM,"Tableau Software (DATA) stock lost nearly half its value Friday, as investors reacted to weak first-quarter guidance late Thursday and the rise of Microsoft -- and possibly Amazon.com -- as a top rival in analytics, while enterprise software spending overall seems to be easing.Microsoft's (MSFT) new PowerBI data-analytics software product, irresistibly priced for free against Tableau's premium-priced product, won't necessarily affect only Tableau's campaign. Rival Workday (WDAY) stock was down 14% and Salesforce.com (CRM) was down 12% in midday trade in the stock market today. Security software stalwart Palo Alto Networks (PANW) stock was down 11%.Tableau stock, though, was down 49% as its outlook for this quarter and the full year lagged far below Wall Street expectations.Wall Street analysts, who were mostly upbeat about Tableau a day earlier, raced to downgrade ratings or reduce price targets.""Tableau reported revenue that beat consensus by only 1% (lowest ever), or about $2 million, when the average beat over last 11 quarters is around $11 million,"" Summit Research analyst Srini Nandury said in a research note.Summit slashed its price target on Tableau stock to 45 from 80, and maintained a hold rating.""Given that the company pulled down guidance for 2016, we believe Tableau is in the penalty box for the foreseeable future,"" Nadury said. ""We remain on the sidelines given our belief that 1) comps will get tougher from these levels; 2) competition continues to materialize"" with Qlik Technologies (QLIK), MicroStrategy (MSTR), Salesforce.com, Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft ""all gunning for a piece of the action; 3) the market may not be as big as some on the Street believe as most Excel users (as Tableau targets) would never need a visualization function; and, 4) low-hanging fruit already has been picked.""Tableau said it added more than 1,000 employees, many of them in sales, in 2015 and now has a total workforce of 3,000-plus.

Microsoft stock was up 1%, above 52, in afternoon trading on the stock market today.“The key near-term question is gross margins, given (Microsoft’s) changing (business) mix, but we still think gross profit dollars can start to accelerate,” MacMillan said.Microsoft’s business model transition could create some near-term headwinds for gross margin, he said. However, “a faster transition in the commercial Office business and strong growth in Azure will be rewarded by the market,” MacMillan said. Azure is Microsoft's cloud services business.For fiscal Q2, he expects Microsoft will report a gross profit margin of 61.4%, vs. 61.7% in the year-earlier quarter.Expectations remain low for Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system, which he says hasn't sparked a PC upgrade cycle.A big risk for Microsoft in its move to the Internet cloud is stiff competition from providers of cloud applications, such as Salesforce.com (CRM) and Slack, and cloud infrastructure, mainly Amazon.com (AMZN), MacMillan said.

445,CRM,"Well, which canary is it?After Big Data analytics software maker Tableau Software (DATA) disappointed investors with Q1 and 2016 guidance well below Wall Street expectations -- sending its stock crashing 49.5% Friday to an all-time low -- Summit Research analyst Srini Nandury questioned whether Tableau ""will prove to be the proverbial canary in the coal mine.”Nandury was referring to Tableau and prospects for its growth. But later Friday, in a research report, Robert W. Baird analyst Steven Ashley posed the identical question: “We wonder if Tableau will prove to be the proverbial canary in the coal mine.” Ashley's canary was much bigger.“With among the smallest deal sizes and shortest sales cycles in enterprise software, Tableau theoretically would be the first to see any downturn in new pipeline business due to a macro weakness,” Ashley wrote, questioning whether other enterprise software vendors might follow.Investors got the point. Tableau rivals Splunk (SPLK) and Qlik Technologies (QLIK) fell 23% and 15%, respectively, and little Hortonworks (HDP) -- which may have been Big Data’s first canary with a 37% gap down Jan. 19 after a poor earnings report -- fell 17%, also hitting an all-time low.Closing Friday at 8.48, Hortonworks is not only below its December 2014 initial public offering price of 16, but is also below the 9.50-a-share price Goldman Sachs set Tuesday for an 8.425 million-share secondary offering. Hortonworks' Jan. 19 dive came after it filed with the SEC to raise $100 million in the secondary offering, coming after the worst opening two weeks of any year in the market's history. On Tuesday, Hortonworks said in its new SEC filing that it had raised only $77.19 million, before expenses.Evercore ISI analyst Bill Whyman told IBD on Friday, however, that he stands by his research issued Jan. 26, in which he acknowledged tech companies face continuing “weak” demand, but not so weak that stocks should be “falling off a cliff” like they have so far this year.“The harder question is: Are stocks anticipating that demand will fall off a cliff six months from now?"" Whyman said. ""The evidence to date does not make this our base case.”He expects 6% global tech revenue growth for 2016 vs. 2% in 2015, and offered a mixed bag when looking at sectors. He advises overweighting portfolios with software and Internet stocks, underweighting communications equipment and computing, and market-weighting (neither buying nor selling) semiconductor stocks.“We forecast ‘not-pretty-but-we’ll-take-it' overall,"" he said.Late Friday, however, his Evercore ISI colleague Kirk Materne, sang a tougher mine-canary tune, “as software officially enters the pain cave.""“If you wanted a cathartic event to wipe out any remaining optimism in the software space, (Tableau’s) earnings report was it,” Materne wrote in a research note. “Ironically, the idea that a license-based, visualization tool vendor (Tableau) that is facing growing pains would cause a 10% pullback in Adobe (ADBE) or 14% pullback in CRM (Salesforce.com (CRM)) would seem like a stretch, but welcome to the new reality.“While most of the major ‘blow-ups’ year-to-date in software have been more company specific (at least in my view) vs. a dramatic change in the fundamental backdrop, the reality is no one cares, and the broader de-risking in the sector is unlikely to end until we see a strong quarter from one of the higher-quality growth names like CRM or Palo Alto Networks (PANW) (and the stock actually goes up) and/or until some of the smaller names throw in the towel and M&A picks up.”Palo Alto Networks stock fell 12% Friday, part of the general downturn.Database leader Oracle (ORCL), which is still trying to accelerate its cloud business, fell 1.9% Friday, in line with Friday’s broader market decline. IBD's entire Computer Software-Database industry group fell 15%.Other big names in the enterprise software market tumbling Friday included SAP (SAP) (down 3.6%), Salesforce.com (13%), Workday (WDAY) (16%) and Manhattan Associates (MANH) (9%).

449,CRM,"Just as the stock market goes through a correction, earnings for the tech companies in the S&P 500 are expected to record their first year-over-year decline in the past 10 quarters.A slowing China, weak global economy, strong dollar, poor PC sales and the shift to cloud computing continue to weigh on the tech sector, and the top tech companies' Q4 EPS are seen falling for the first time since Q2 2013.""Tech remains stuck in a low-growth environment, and the interaction of rising interest rates, a strong dollar, weak oil and commodities are increasing risk,"" said Bill Whyman, head of technology strategy research at Evercore ISI.Tech spending growth generally is slow, says Whyman, but he adds that underneath the surface, there is an aggressive shift in spending that favors companies connected to cloud computing, including providers of software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms and young, disruptive Internet companies.Apple, Facebook, Amazon Earnings On TapThus far, 13 of the 68 tech companies in the S&P 500 have reported earnings, including Intel (INTC) and IBM (IBM), which both provided tepid guidance that sent their shares falling.The tech earnings season gets into full swing starting Tuesday, with the biggest company of them all — Apple (AAPL) — set to report that day after the market close amid fast falling expectations for sales of its top product, the iPhone. On Wednesday comes Facebook (FB) and Qualcomm (QCOM), both after the close. On Thursday it's Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), also after the close. Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) reports on Monday, Feb. 1, after the close.The consensus estimate for the 68 tech companies in the S&P 500 is for earnings per share minus items to fall 3.4% from the year-earlier quarter, the fourth quarter in a row of deceleration. Subtracting Apple, which has the largest impact of any company in S&P 500, tech earnings would fall 6.7%, according to estimates collected by Thomson Reuters.For the S&P 500 as a whole, analysts call for EPS ex items, such as stock options and one-time expenses, to fall 4.5%. That drop is largely due to the ailing energy sector, which is expected to see its EPS tumble 73%. Excluding the energy sector, EPS is expected to rise 1.6% overall.Tech companies have long been the innovation trendsetters, turning in strong earnings that usually put the industry at or near the top of the best-performing groups in the S&P 500. Not now. In terms of earnings performance, tech is in the middle of the pack among the 10 industry groups in the S&P 500.""The tech sector is now more of a mirror of the S&P index as whole,"" said Gregory Harrison, earnings analyst at Thomson Reuters.The tech industry has been stuck in slow-growth mode at the same time it's going through a once-in-a-decade secular shift — the move to cloud computing — which has shattered old ways of using technology, says Evercore ISI's Whyman. Rather than buy large computer servers and storage systems for business operations, companies and other enterprises are lowering costs by turning to Internet-based cloud computing services provided by companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet.Cloud Computing Drives TechnologyCloud computing is the dominant force in technology and will continue to accelerate, says Whyman. Among other things, cloud computing has spurred the emergence of SaaS, provided on demand as needed. SaaS leaders include Salesforce.com (CRM).Moreover, many providers of cloud services are buying lower-cost hardware from Taiwan and mainland China, opting for stripped-down hardware of their own design instead of brand-name products. That is rattling some of the largest information technology companies, such as IBM, Cisco Systems (CSCO), Oracle (ORCL) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), all of which are undergoing major transitions.This disruption is happening amid slower sales of PCs and now-slowing growth for smartphones and tablets.Global PC shipments fell 8.3% in the fourth quarter vs. Q4 2014, to just under 76 million units, according to preliminary results by market tracker Gartner. It was the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment declines. For the year, PC shipments fell 8% to 288.7 million units. Gartner expects PC shipments to fall this year as well, but only by 1%, and it anticipates a soft recovery later in 2016.Global semiconductor sales fell 2% in 2015 to $334 billion, Gartner says, attributed not just to PCs, but also in part to weakened demand for electronic equipment amid the cloud shift and the continuing impact of the strong dollar.Strong Dollar Hurts Tech ResultsThe strong dollar, which makes U.S. exports more expensive, is more difficult for tech companies than other sectors.""A big variable remains the U.S. dollar, as it has a huge impact on tech,"" said Whyman. ""Tech derives more revenue from outside the U.S. than any other S&P sector.""Apple, despite the popularity of its products and huge size, is not immune to the fallout. When Apple reports earnings on Tuesday, its performance in China will be closely watched. China accounted for an estimated 25% of all iPhone sales in 2015. Slower economic growth in China and slower sales of smartphones globally are expected to pressure its earnings growth. The consensus on Apple is EPS growth of 6% year over year, which would be its slowest growth in eight quarters.As always, analysts will focus on corporate guidance, and the outlook might be especially important in this earnings cycle amid a rough start to 2016 for global stock markets.""The range of uncertainty is widening, so there is a greater interest in clues as to what 2016 might hold,"" Whyman said.Among the 12 subsectors in the S&P 500 tech group, application software leads with an expected average EPS increase of 44%. The group includes Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Salesforce.com.The Internet software and services group is expected to have the second-best performance among the tech subsectors. This includes Facebook and Alphabet, which continue to ride the rising tide of mobile and online ad growth. Facebook is expected to show EPS growth of 26%, while Alphabet is expected to post growth of 18%.Friday, some of the biggest tech companies reporting earnings in the coming week rose ahead of the major stock market indexes.Apple stock lifted 5.3% to 101.42, Facebook gained 4% to 97.94, Amazon rose 3.7% to 596.38 and Microsoft logged a 3.6% boost to 52.29.
"
450,CRM,"SAP (SAP) more than doubled its cloud customers in the fourth quarter, compared with Q3, to 2,700 businesses using S/4HANA, its next-generation business software ""nucleus"" around which operators can integrate old enterprise and new hybrid ""external ecosystems,"" the company said in releasing Q4 earnings before the open Friday.The Germany-based business software maker reiterated its 2016 guidance, pumped up its outlook for 2017 and predicted its new cloud revenue would exceed legacy software license sales by 2018.Year over year in Q4, SAP's 81% growth in cloud systems and support sales revenue to 632 million euros ($682 million at Friday's exchange rate) compared favorably with the 13% growth rate of its traditional software and support sales, but the latter reached 4.749 billion euros, still the bulk of SAP's activity. The combination of cloud and legacy software sales grew 18%, SAP said. Including other sources, total revenue rose 16% to 6.346 billion euros in Q4.At today's exchange rate of $1.08 for 1 euro, SAP's Q4 rose 16% to $6.853 billion.Shareholders have heard most of it before: SAP pre-announced 2015 performance on Jan. 11. SAP stock lifted 0.4% to close at 78.27 in the stock market today. Shares are 4% off a nearly two-year high of 81.21 set Dec. 29, as SAP stock ended a 37-day, stage-1 flat base. Shares rose 2% after the company pre-announced the 2015 results.""It's encouraging to see SAP is able to increase its market share in what appears to be an area of growth for the company,"" PureFunds CEO Andrew Chanin told IBD in an email after the Q4 announcement. PureFunds manages BDAT, which claims the title as the world's first Big Data ETF. SAP is now BDAT's No. 2 holding.""Due to the rapid increase of data growth, it's important to secure loyal customers now, as it gives SAP an opportunity to ... grow along with (customers') data management requirements,"" Chanin said. ""Locking in customers now could potentially be seen as locking in future growth.""Q4's IFRS operating profit fell 3% in to 1.7 billion euros, but non-IFRS operating profit rose 7% to $2.28 billion, yielding IFRS per-share earnings down 2% to 1.07 euros and non-IFRS up 7% to 1.40 euros. In U.S. dollars, that's $1.15 per share in earnings and $1.51 in per-share earnings minus items.IFRS stands for International Financial Reporting Standards, which like Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S., are stated in strict and non-strict terms in order to better compare performance from period to period. Non-IFRS and non-GAAP terms exclude extraordinary items.SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Face ChallengeThe Q4 difference in cloud vs. legacy growth rates illustrates the challenge that SAP and other legacy software developers such as Oracle (ORCL) and Microsoft (MSFT) face: Traditional business software and legacy enterprise products are still producing the big-revenue dinners, while upstart cloud software developers such as Salesforce.com (CRM), Splunk (SPLK) and Tableau Software (DATA) are eating the legacy players' lunch with faster growth from a smaller plate.All of SAP's cited rivals lifted Friday: Oracle by 2%, Microsoft by 3.6%, Salesforce by 2.9%, Splunk by 3.6% and Tableau by 0.7%.SAP reiterated its full-year 2016 guidance for non-IFRS cloud subscriptions and support revenue to a range of 2.95 billion to 3.05 billion euros at constant currencies vs. 2015's 2.30 billion euros, with ""the upper end of this range (representing) a growth rate of 33% at constant currencies.""But it also raised 2017 guidance and predicted a 2018 milestone. Total 2017 revenue is now expected to rise to a range of 23 billion to 23.5 billion euros, SAP said, and it now sees a 2017 non-IFRS operating profit of 6.7 billion to 7 billion euros.""Our strength in 2015 shows that the S/4HANA innovation cycle is well underway,"" SAP CEO Bill McDermott said in the company's earnings release. ""Our completeness of vision in the cloud has distinguished SAP from both legacy players and point solution providers. We beat on cloud and software, we beat on operating income, and we are ever-confident that SAP will remain a profitable growth business well into the future.""

455,CRM,"Zendesk (ZEN) has a strong niche in its core market and with plenty of room to grow, said a report from FBN Securities, which initiated coverage on the software company with an outperform rating and price target of 30.Zendesk stock was up about 1.3%, near 24, in afternoon trading in the stock market today.Zendesk provides a cloud-based customer service software platform. The company had its initial public offering in May 2014, raising $100 million. Shares priced at 9 each and popped 49% from that on the first day of trading. Zendesk is growing fast but has yet to show a profit, as it continues to invest heavily in research and development. Revenue rose 64% year over year to $55.7 million in the third quarter.Since its IPO, wrote FBN analyst Shebly Seyrafi, Zendesk has beaten the high end of its revenue guidance. The company primarily targets small- to medium-size businesses, of which there are 28 million in the U.S. Zendesk has about 30,000 customers in the U.S. and 64,100 customers globally.""We believe that Zendesk can grow well for many years to come,"" Seyrafi wrote.Its competitors include cloud software pioneer Salesforce.com (CRM), the leading maker of customer relationship management software. Key concerns include strong competition, he wrote. In addition to Salesforce.com, competitors include ServiceNow (NOW).In November, Zendesk announced a partnership with Microsoft (MSFT) for its software to integrate with Microsoft Office 365. It was the first customer-service add-in for Microsoft Outlook.In December, Zendesk received a price target increase from Pacific Crest Securities, raising the price target to 35 from 30. Analyst Brendan Barnicle said that Zendesk has multiple opportunities for additional growth. He said Zendesk is working with Facebook (FB) to add Facebook Messenger to its suite of applications. It would enable call centers to use Facebook Messenger to communicate with customers and prospects. Facebook Messenger could add $100 million in revenue, Barnicle estimates.Follow Brian Deagon on Twitter @IBD_BDeagon.

"
458,CRM,"""The planned expansion, which has not been confirmed by management, would follow the company's decision in mid-2014 to add a strategic sales channel targeting the lower end of the market (300-499 employees).

459,CRM,"The company develops software that manages payroll and human resources, from recruitment to retirement. Some 83% of about $583 million in annual sales are recurring revenue, which has been growing by double-digit percentages for years.

468,CRM,"TCW Select Equities Fund is off to a slow start this year along with the rest of the stock market, but it's coming off of standout performances in 2015 and longer-term.Managed by Craig Blum since 2004, the fund returned 12% in 2015 vs. 3.6% for its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and 1.4% for the S&P 500. TCW Select Equities carries a 36-month Performance Rating of A from IBD.The $1.8 billion fund seeks companies that have found large addressable markets and superior business models. ""When you do those things really well, the business is going to grow, whether you want it to or not,"" Blum said.Blum says that the stock market today is efficient at pricing in consensus expectations and extrapolating near-term results. ""Where markets make mistakes are in sizing up total addressable markets and business model advantages,"" he said. ""We've built an entire practice around exploiting those errors.""With a turnover ratio of 27% and only 30 holdings, TCW Select Equities values conviction. ""We're long-term in our orientation, which to us is four to five years,"" Blum said. ""That translates into turnover that is quite low.""As of Nov. 30, the mutual fund was most overweight on tech stocks, at 39% of assets.Migration To MobileBlum sees the fund's top holding, Alphabet (GOOGL), being in an ideal position to cash in on future ad spending. ""It sits right in the middle of this massive, multiyear audience migration to mobile and next-gen media,"" Blum said. ""We have been investors in advertising businesses for many, many years. The ad dollars always follow the audience.""The TCW team is particularly bullish on Alphabet's mobile business. ""It's on fire right now, with new ad formats and better pricing,"" Blum said. ""A big problem for Google for a couple of years was the gap between the pricing they get on desktop search vs. mobile search. That gap is closing, and we think it's going to continue to close.""Shares of Alphabet are up 42% from a year ago.Blum says the portfolio's No. 2 holding, Salesforce.com (CRM), stands to benefit from a shift to the cloud. ""If you add up all of the market cap for the old client-server companies, you get $1.4 trillion,"" he said. ""If you add up all of the market cap for the cloud companies, currently you get $200 billion. We think that's going to flip-flop.""Salesforce.com shares have climbed 30% in the past year.Cash-To-Card ConversionTCW Select Equities has owned Visa (V) since shortly after its IPO in 2008. ""We think there is still a big runway for cash-to-card conversion,"" Blum said of a global trend toward electronic payment. ""Visa has a capex-lite model, which is going to play a huge role in margins going forward.""Visa has handed investors a 15% gain in the past 52 weeks.In the pharmaceutical space, Blum likes Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), which focuses on treating ultrarare or ultra-orphan diseases. In Q3, the company saw sales from its flagship drug, Soliris, spike 19.9% year over year. ""Alexion also has an extremely compelling pipeline of other drugs that treat ultra-orphan diseases,"" Blum said. ""The upside, we think, is going to come from diagnosis. The number of patients diagnosed worldwide is going to be higher than what is currently priced in the stock.""Alexion shares are down 1% from a year ago.

470,CRM,"San Francisco's office market is famous for the number of tech companies gobbling up space. Leading the charge have been hometown favorites Salesforce.com (CRM) and Twitter (TWTR), as well as expanding Silicon Valley-based neighbors LinkedIn (LNKD) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL).Some 36% of all office stock in the Bay Area is occupied by tech firms, and they accounted for 60% of all office leasing activity in the first three quarters of 2015, said commercial real estate services giant CBRE Group (CBG) in a report published on Thursday.That strong demand for space has pushed office rents to ""near dot-com peaks"" and kept vacancies tight, CBRE said. San Francisco's office market benefited the most, with average asking rents growing 129% since early 2009, to $70 per square foot as of the third quarter.But with concerns swirling over further potential corrections in tech valuations, could San Francisco's booming tech-fueled office market be on the brink of a dot-com-like crash?Maybe not, but a high concentration of young tech outfits in late stages of venture-capital financing pose risks, CBRE said in its report, noting that those founded in the last 10 years take up nearly as much space as tech firms older than that.Riding Unicorns' FortunesConcerns are especially focused on their high valuations —$1 billion or more — and whether in the current slowing environment additional funding may dry up.As Colin Yasukochi, director of Bay-area research and analysis at CBRE, told IBD: ""If they receive less money, they will probably need fewer employees and less real estate. It could potentially have an impact on the office market in San Francisco Bay.""The tech industry has historically been volatile and cyclical. Any downturn would have an impact on the Bay Area,"" he added.And San Francisco would be the hardest hit. Citing research from venture-capital tracker CB Insights, CBRE says 40 of the 60 fast-growing Bay Area tech firms in late stages of private funding and valued at $1 billion or more — referred to as ""unicorns"" by venture capitalists — are in San Francisco.The Bay Area is host to nearly half of the 144 unicorn firms tracked nationally by CB Insights, the largest concentration in the U.S.""It's a big valuation for a private company,"" Yasukochi said of the $1 billion threshold. ""If the values are viewed as too high, it may be hard to raise additional funds. And it may be difficult to go public if valuations are higher than the public markets justify. And so the concern we have, from a real estate perspective, is how that impacts their growth and needs for additional real estate.""'There Is Concern'San Francisco's office real estate could feel the pinch in the next several months or quarters, he says.Of the 40 unicorns in San Francisco, ride-sharing company Uber Technologies holds the highest valuation, at $51 billion, followed by vacation rental's Airbnb at $25.5 billion, says CB Insights.Others highly valued are Pinterest at $11 billion and Dropbox at $10 billion.""It's not a comment on any specific company. Many of these companies are financially strong and doing well,"" Yasukochi said. ""It's just that the (venture capital and stock) markets are telling us that there is concern about these companies as a group.""San Francisco's 40 unicorns account for 16% of the city's tech-occupied space and 4.9% of overall office occupancy, CBRE says.Among other well-known tech outfits taking up space in San Francisco are Zynga (ZNGA), Yelp (YELP), Square (SQ) and Splunk (SPLK).

And, if corporate earnings and the economy are beginning to sag, the public will continue to buy their products and services, while they might reduce their buying of expensive durable goods, such as cars or TV sets.Defensive stocks also pay dividends that can cushion a downturn.But investors should keep in mind that a bear market will take everything down with it. There's no such thing as a safe stock.Among the top names in today's list is Constellation Brands (STZ), a purveyor of beer and booze. Its products could classify it as a defensive stock, but it has definite growth characteristics. It has a five-year annualized growth rate of 25%. Analysts expect 20% growth in fiscal 2016 and 14% growth in 2017.After riding along the north side of its 50-day moving average for months, it gapped to a new high Thursday after reporting better-than-expected earnings that were 15% higher than a year earlier.A REIT making this week's cut is Public Storage (PSA).Public Storage owns 2,200 self-storage facilities with more than 142 million square feet of net rentable space in the U.S. and Europe plus a minority stake in PS Business Parks (PSB), which has another 28 million rentable square feet of commercial and industrial space.It pays a dividend that is equal to an annualized yield of 2.8%.Among utilities, WEC Energy Group (WEC), NextEra (NEE) and Dominion (D) made the list. WEC provides electricity and natural gas to 4.4 million customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota. It operates 70,000 miles of electric lines, 44,000 miles of natural gas pipelines and 8,800 megawatts of power plant capacity.NextEra transmits electric energy generated by gas, oil, solar, coal, petroleum coke, nuclear and wind, serving 4.7 million customers in the east and lower coasts of Florida. It also leases fiber-optic networks and dark fiber to phone companies, wireless, Internet and other telecoms.Dominion is one of the nation's largest producers and transporters of energy. Its portfolio includes 24,400 megawatts of generation, 12,200 miles of natural gas transmission and 6,490 miles of electric transmission lines.

491,CRM,"For Dennis Lynch, investing is a family affair. The 45-year-old lead manager of $3.5 billion Morgan Stanley Growth is following in the footsteps of his father, who was a money manager and co-founder of Lynch & Mayer, starting in the 1970s.The elder Lynch (also named Dennis) can be proud. Morgan Stanley Growth was the 25th-best-performing U.S. diversified stock fund in 2015. It outperformed 95% of its peer mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the past five years.And with a 9.4% gain in the fourth quarter that topped 97% of his direct rivals, Lynch was again among the top-performing mutual fund managers.With Lynch at the helm since mid-2004, the fund has focused on its managers' best ideas rather than on overdiversifying. It has aimed for securities in the stock market that benefit from competitive advantages such as a network effect among site visitors and from a steady flow of subscription-based revenues.And in an industry that employs battalions of analysts who are experts at diving into the details of earnings reports, a key member of Lynch's team is a futurist whose job is to spot emerging investment trends years before they generate revenues and profits.Lynch talked with IBD about his investment approach from his office in Manhattan.IBD: Dennis, your fund has outperformed in 2015 and long-term. But in 2012 and 2014 it was middle of the pack. What went against the fund's approach in those years?Lynch: We try to add value through stock picking and identifying what we think are mispriced or undervalued companies, companies that are undervalued because investors don't understand the quality of their business or how they can grow over time.Along the way, there can be periods when specific ideas are not working or the market is not in agreement with our ideas. We had a challenging period in 2012. In the back part of the year we did poorly, given a large allocation to Facebook (FB). It came public with a lot of public enthusiasm, then went through a vicious and challenging period when the stock price more than halved.We actually added to our position during that challenging period, then later on we benefited as the stock price rebounded.Generally, when we have ups and downs relative to the market or peer groups, sometimes it's because we're going through a period when the market thinks we're wrong. And we also make mistakes from time to time.IBD: Your concentrated portfolio is the flip side of your long-term approach, right?Lynch: Yes. Why we do well in any given year reflects decisions made in previous years rather than anything we do in the current year.Amazon.com (AMZN) is a company we've owned continuously for roughly 13 years. The reasons we got involved were a combination of the online advantages that made them tough to beat. They offer inventory that they don't necessarily possess themselves, but which they have access to.At the same time, they've slowly built a very large logistical infrastructure in the physical world.And they target increasingly technology through their Amazon Web Services.IBD: Is there anything that could disrupt a juggernaut like Facebook?Lynch: You don't have to worry that another social network will get bigger. That's highly unlikely.But is there something out there that can take people's attention away, like virtual reality or some other technology that still in its early stages now?In the absence of something like that, it's unlikely that Facebook's network effect will be challenged anytime soon.IBD: LinkedIn's (LNKD) third-quarter profit jumped 50%, a nice rebound from Q2. This is another network-effect play, isn't it?Lynch: Both holdings have strong network effects of users connected to each other.Both have users who cross-connect. It's hard to displace them. Even though both have that at their core, they make money in different ways. So we're not exposed to the same end markets or even the same spending patterns.Earlier in the year, LinkedIn made changes to its workforce that surprised people. But each quarter, results have seen the fruits of LinkedIn's longer-term thinking.IBD: The key to Monster Beverage (MNST) is how their deal with Coke (KO) gives them a shot at foreign expansion, right?Lynch: With Coca Cola becoming a substantial owner, it opens opportunities for distribution to become more efficient in the U.S. and increases chances of capturing more global share. They've had less success outside the U.S.IBD: Is Salesforce.com (CRM) one of those subscription-revenue companies you like?Lynch: They provide customer relationship management services that in the past were sold on a high license-fee basis. They had a novel approach of offering those services in a subscription format rather than requiring large upfront fees, which can be costly.It gives customers the ability to benefit from upgrades to the whole system rather than having to buy a new version of the software for each upgrade cycle.As a result, they built a high recurring-revenue business. On an annual basis, revenue renewal is over 90%. So that gives their revenue a lot of visibility.They are figuring out how to meet other important needs for large organizations. They're expanding into marketing.IBD: Why has Athenahealth's (ATHN) share price been choppy recently?Lynch: Athenahealth is the dominant provider for doctors to get reimbursed by insurers.And the way their system works, every doctor can learn (about methods for improving insurance reimbursements) from the experience of other doctors on the platform.Once Athena figures out how to apply new rules for one doctor, all doctors benefit.So it's hard for a doctor not to join the network. This is an inherent network effect. But their penetration is still less than 10% of the overall doctor market, so they've got a lot of room for growth.And they've diversified into electronic health records. Once you get a lot of doctors to join, you can provide other services, which draws in more doctors.IBD: After a rough patch,Intuitive Surgical's (ISRG) earnings-per-share growth is accelerating again. Is this improvement for real?Lynch: That rough period was when they were transitioning from a first-generation platform to the next generation.And it's a razor-and-razor-blades model. There are a lot of consumables that need to be reordered each time.So it's a high recurring revenue model. It continues to take share.When a company has an upgrade cycle, customers wonder if they should order the old system or the new one. Sales can slow. It happened a couple of years ago. Now things are heading back in the right direction.IBD: Dennis, how does your team differ from its rivals?Lynch: One thing I try to emphasize when I talk with people who are thinking about whether to put money in the fund is what skin in the game do people running a product have?Here, we're not going to do well every quarter or every 12 months. There can be periods when things go badly, but through Morgan Stanley's deferred compensation program, the vast majority of team pay is deferred, and most goes into our products.We have significant personal exposure through co-ownership with our clients in the products we make for them.IBD: Tell me about the person on your team whose job is to scout ahead for emerging trends or disruptive new technologies.Lynch: Yes, in addition to our expert work, meetings with companies, looking at financial statements — those conventional activities — we've dedicated one person to research topics that have the potential to be disruptive in industries or sectors.IBD: What is your change researcher looking at these days?Lynch: More recently, he's been focused on Bitcoin and virtual reality. These are potentially powerful emerging themes and disruptive trends.IBD: Who is your disruptor expert?Lynch: Stan Delaney.IBD: How do you and the five other managers on this fund — David Cohen, Sam Chainani, Alexander Norton, Jason Yeung and Armistead Nash — divide your workload? Is each manager responsible for different industrial sectors, for example?Lynch: I act as a generalist. Outside of me, everyone has a sector and industry expertise. Sam follows the Internet and financials. David follows consumer, which sounds like one industry but is really multidimensional. Jason follow health care and some consumer staples. Armistead follows business services and software. Alex does technology — we think of technology differently than the Internet. Companies use the Internet to create. They are not selling semiconductors or software. Alex focuses on those kinds of business models and things like industrials.My dad managed large- and midcap growth stocks, starting in the 1970s in a time when managers tended to be generalists. Today people tend to be experts in a category but lacking the perspective of knowing multiple categories and being able to compare. We believe we benefit from taking the generalist approach, and we can leverage the experts.

"
539,CRM,"In the Q4 survey, almost twice as many CIOs reported increases in SaaS pricing as decreases, consistent with earlier pricing trends and surveys, Pacific Crest says.
"
540,CRM,"""SaaS vendors have pricing power because they are taking on the hardware and services responsibilities, as well as the software, for their client,"" Barnicle said in his research note.Software as a service hasn't ranked high in chief information officers' purchasing plans before, but it's suddenly become a top priority for spending in 2016 among CIOs with tech budgets over $1 billion, a study shows.That's good news for at least eight companies that provide Internet cloud-based software, with Microsoft (MSFT) and much smaller and more specialized Zendesk (ZEN) and Mindbody (MB) among them, says Pacific Crest Securities.About $150 billion will be spent this year on enterprise software overall, estimates market research firm Gartner.Pacific Crest's survey out Dec. 2 queried 81 CIOs about their technology budget plans for next year. Results show that the biggest spenders, with $1 billion-plus to allocate, now put SaaS on par with network security as the top spending priority.A SaaS spending trend was also seen among CIOs with budgets from $50 million to $1 billion. However, it was lacking among much smaller companies, where CIOs have $50 million or less to spend and where spending emphasis is heading toward databases.Why such interest in SaaS among CIOs at bigger companies?""In past Pacific Crest CIO surveys, SaaS hasn't shown well because CIOs were not heavily involved with SaaS,"" wrote Pacific Crest analyst Brendan Barnicle in a research note. ""SaaS was sold to individual business managers. However, as SaaS becomes more strategic, CIOs are becoming more involved in SaaS decisions.""Traditional Now Often SaaSBarnicle wrote that CIOs did not seem to be aware of the SaaS spending in their enterprises, so Pacific Crest started surveying chief financial officers and chief marketing officers in past years to get a read on SaaS spending.""Another reason for SaaS strength is that traditional software applications are now being delivered as SaaS,"" he added. ""So, applications like (Microsoft's) Office 365 and many security applications are now SaaS applications running across the entire enterprise. As a result, we consider Microsoft a SaaS vendor.""Microsoft gets an IBD Composite Rating of 90, meaning it performs better than 90% of other publicly traded companies by a variety of metrics such as revenue growth and stock price gains.In addition to Microsoft, Zendesk and Mindbody, the analyst figures that the survey yields ""positive implications"" for Hubspot (HUBS), Paycom Software (PAYC), Salesforce.com (CRM), Veeva Systems (VEEV) and Workday (WDAY).Pacific Crest says the SaaS momentum likely will continue to benefit legacy SaaS vendors Salesforce and Workday as they take market share from on-premises-software vendors such as Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP).Zendesk and Mindbody are ""particularly compelling,"" Barnicle said, because they ""trade at a discount to peers despite strong growth.

Earlier in the session, Microsoft stock reached 54.96, just below its all-time high of 54.98 on Nov. 6.Microsoft now looks like a ""long-term winner"" in cloud computing, Turits said. ""While only recently Microsoft looked like the legacy PC software vendor that had 'missed mobile,' we now see it as one of the only 'hyperscale' hybrid cloud vendors able to integrate Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) with a vast installed base of on-premise server and client software.""Cloud computing services are expected to account for 17% of Microsoft's revenue in fiscal 2016, which ends June 30.

"
635,CRM,"Amazon.com (AMZN) aims to parlay its cloud computing dominance into a big stake in the Internet of Things. The e-commerce giant in October launched ""AWS IoT,"" a new cloud computing service in its Amazon Web Services division. The new Amazon IoT service enables customers build cloud-based apps for Web-connected devices.While Amazon's cloud computing service excels at raw number-crunching, the new IoT service does more than process data. It provides real-time analysis of data streams sent from sensor-equipped devices. That's a jump in capability. And Amazon has ""Big Data"" competition.""Throughout the IoT space, there's work on the analytics that will be used to turn the terabytes of data streaming off devices into valuable, valid intelligence that can then be acted upon within a meaningful time-frame,"" said Paul Miller, a cloud computing analyst at Forrester Research. ""Amazon is part of that, along with (Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, Salesforce (CRM), Microsoft (MSFT), IBM (IBM) and others.""Microsoft recently rolled out its own ""Azure"" IoT tools, albeit with less fanfare than Amazon.By 2025, tens of billions of industrial, medical, automotive and consumer devices are forecast to be connected to the Web. Wireless phone companies, semiconductor makers, industrial companies and many others are racing to cash in from Web-connected cars, sensor-equipped factory machinery and outpatient health monitoring.Amazon's strengths in going after the IoT market include its massive cloud computing business, as well as in-house software analytics expertise. The e-commerce giant's fulfillment warehouses operate smoothly, largely thanks to robotics technology and merchandise-tracking tools.Amazon rolled out the new IoT service at its annual re:Invent conference in early October.With Amazon IoT, customers can build their own cloud apps to remotely control machinery, track inventory and supply chains, and handle thousands of other tasks. At re:Invent, Amazon strutted out BMW and John Deere as partners to show what the IoT can do in automotive and agricultural applications. For Deere (DE), Amazon tracks crop planting in multi-thousand-acre fields down to the individual seed level.Internet-connected devices range from home security systems to medical scanners, wind turbines and nuclear reactors.Werner Vogels, Amazon's chief technology officer, says cloud analytics will enable ""everything to become smart.""""Everything has the ability to become smart — a smartwatch, smart clothes, a smart TV, a smart home, a smart car. However, in almost all cases this 'smartness' runs in software in the cloud, not the object or the device itself,"" Vogels said in a blog.Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, in a 300-page report on robotics and artificial intelligence released in November, said companies will garner efficiency gains at all phases of production by gathering real-time data for analysis. The report says the ""smart factory"" concept will sweep across the manufacturing sector from advances in robotics and machine learning.Amazon, meanwhile, will charge U.S. customers $5 for every million messages sent from devices to the IoT service. That may not sound like much, but it adds up.""AWS IoT can support billions of devices and trillions of messages,"" said Brian Pitz, a Jefferies analyst, in a report.Not all of Amazon's IoT capabilities are home-grown.Amazon in March acquired a Denver-based startup, 2lemetry, for an undisclosed amount. 2lemetry's software enables companies to track, collect, process and analyze data from Internet-connected devices.Amazon expanded into cloud computing by leveraging the massive Internet infrastructure it had built to support its e-commerce business. Millions of computer servers provide the horsepower behind Amazon's e-commerce business and public cloud.Amazon Web Services is the biggest provider of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), where customers rent computer servers and data storage systems via the Internet.Amazon in 2012 paid $775 million to acquire Kiva Systems, whose warehouse robots move goods from shelves to package and shipping areas. Amazon says it has 30,000 robots in 13 warehouses.Even with its cloud and automation prowess, Amazon may need to strike partnerships to gain traction in emerging IoT markets, some analysts say. But it may prove hard to make allies out of IBM, Cisco Systems (CSCO) and other companies counting on growth from the IoT.General Electric (GE) in 2013 said it would offer Amazon's cloud computing services to its ""Industrial Internet"" customers. GE, though, in August rolled out its own IaaS services to support its Predix IoT products.Still, GE continues to shift much of its own computing workloads to Amazon Web Services as it shutters internal data centers, analysts say.Forrester's Miller says GE is making a big bet on building up its own Predix software platform into an IoT powerhouse.Amazon and GE, he says ""are clearly feeling one another out and learning where the opportunities might lie.""""The cloud is absolutely crucial to the Internet of Things, as well as connectivity, which is where the telcos are coming from,"" Miller added. ""It's not just about getting data from the connected device. You don't need the cloud for that. But you do need the cloud for intelligent processing of data and for providing (analytical) insights so that companies can be proactive in areas like maintenance.""

746,CRM,"Sector rotation is pretty much a done deal, if the Big Cap 20 is any guide. Last spring and summer, the medical sector was providing a third to a half of the names in the Big Cap 20.The summer leaders' charts now look sad. Biogen (BIIB) is 40% off its high. Illumina (ILMN) is 33% off its high. (It plunged after hours on preannounced Q3 revenue and full-year guidance that missed views.) Regeneron (REGN) is 23% off its high.In Tuesday's Big Cap 20, only one medical stock made the list.Heart-valve maker Edwards Lifesciences (EW) is on the list, despite a couple of breakouts that offered meager gains. A breakout on March 16 yielded a 9% gain in five sessions, then the stock consolidated. A breakout in July yielded an 8% gain in about three weeks before the stock consolidated.Small gains do not give individual investors much of a chance to make money.Edwards is now forming a new consolidation, but is it good news? In Monday's IBD, the medical sector was No. 19 of 33 sectors after being in the top four most of the year through September.If the medical sector is finished as a leader, what has replaced the medical stocks? An investor might just as well ask what hasn't replaced the medical stocks.The Big Cap 20's leadership is now more diverse than it has been all year.Its stocks are from many sectors, including retail, software, tobacco and leisure.Many are in early-stage patterns, thanks to resets or breakouts that didn't advance 20% or more.A reset occurs when a stock's low undercuts the low of its previous base, which resets the count at one. A first- or second-stage base has a better shot at success than a later-stage base.The following Big Cap 20 stocks feature first-stage bases:Software sector play Salesforce.com (CRM) is working on a first-stage consolidation. The stock has regained its 200-day and 50-day lines, and is only 4% off a new high.Breakouts this year led to gains of 9% and 10%. The stock hasn't posted a gain of 20% from a breakout since August-November 2013.Retail sector stock Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is working on a first-stage pattern. The stock is 4% off its high and is battling to retake its 50-day line.Breakouts this year led to gains of 15%, 4% and most recently 4%.Tobacco sector stock Reynolds American (RAI) cleared a 44.24 buy point Monday, but strong volume was missing. A valid breakout usually delivers a volume spike of at least 40% above average. Strong volume is the mark of institutional activity.Food and meat stock Hormel (HRL) rushed past a 64.23 buy point Monday. Volume was 130% above average. The stock is defensive and seldom delivers big gains out of breakouts. Hormel's last big gain was a 44% pop out of a November 2012 breakout.

"
755,CRM,"Tech companies have long been the innovation trendsetters, turning in strong earnings reports that most often put the industry at or near the top of the best-performing groups in the S&P 500. At least, that's how it had been. But the 2.4% average EPS growth outlook for Q3 would mark the sector's worst performance since Q2 2013, according to data collected by Thomson Reuters.
"
756,CRM,"And if Apple is taken out of the equation, then average tech EPS would be expected to fall by 3.4%.
"
757,CRM,"For the S&P 500 as a whole, analyst consensus estimates call for earnings per share, typically minus items such as stock options, to fall 4.5%. That drop is largely due to the ailing energy sector, which is expected to see EPS tumble 26%. Excluding the energy section, EPS is expected to rise 2% overall for the S&P 500.

766,CRM,"""We're still stuck in a low-growth world,"" Whyman said on the call.
"
767,CRM,"Part of what's ailing many big tech companies is what Whyman says is a once-in-a-decade secular shift — the move to cloud computing, which has shattered old ways of using technology. Rather than buy large computer servers and storage systems for business operations, companies and other enterprises are lowering costs by instead turning to cloud-computing services from such companies as Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL), the new parent company of Google.
"
768,CRM,"Moreover, many providers of cloud services are buying lower-cost hardware from China and Taiwan in order to cut their costs. That trends has hurt hardware vendors such as IBM (IBM), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and EMC (EMC).

"
770,CRM,"Cloud computing has spurred the growth of software-as-a-service business models, pioneered by companies like Salesforce.com (CRM). The SaaS model has enabled customers to pay only for what they use, instead of handing over hefty fees for some services they don't need. The SaaS model has been disruptive to old-line software makers like Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP). This disruption is happening amid slower sales of PCs, smartphones and tablets.

Rather than buy large computer servers and storage systems for business operations, companies and other enterprises are lowering costs by instead turning to cloud-computing services from such companies as Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL), the new parent company of Google.Moreover, many providers of cloud services are buying lower-cost hardware from China and Taiwan in order to cut their costs. That trends has hurt hardware vendors such as IBM (IBM), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and EMC (EMC).IBM is slated to report Q3 earnings after the market close Oct. 19. Big Blue, which has sold several businesses as it restructures, has posted 13 straight quarters of year-over-year declines in revenue. The 14th straight quarter is likely ahead, as IBM is expected to report a 12% drop in sales, to $19.65 billion. EPS is expected to fall 9% to $3.34.Cloud computing has spurred the growth of software-as-a-service business models, pioneered by companies like Salesforce.com (CRM). The SaaS model has enabled customers to pay only for what they use, instead of handing over hefty fees for some services they don't need. The SaaS model has been disruptive to old-line software makers like Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP). This disruption is happening amid slower sales of PCs, smartphones and tablets.PC Problem ContinuesResearch firm Gartner on Thursday said PC shipments fell 7.7% year over year in Q3, to 73.7 million units. That's an improvement from a 9.5% decline in Q2, but the Windows 10 operating system that Microsoft launched in Q3 had ""minimal impact"" on Q3 shipments, Gartner said.That's a challenge for No. 1 PC-processor maker Intel. After the close Tuesday, Intel is expected to post an EPS drop of 11%. Revenue is expected to rise a slim 2% to $14.2 billion, after a 5% decline in Q2.Among the sub-sectors in the S&P 500 tech group, the application software group leads the field, with an expected average EPS increase of 40%. Adobe Systems (ADBE) last week showed a 93% EPS increase when it reported earnings for its fiscal Q3 ended Aug. 28. But the software company forecast fiscal 2016 sales and profit below Wall Street estimates, and the stock sank more than 5%.The Internet software and services group, a strong performer all year, is expected to post a relatively modest EPS growth of 6%. This group includes Facebook (FB), Google, Yahoo (YHOO) and eBay (EBAY). Yahoo, which reports earnings on Oct. 20 after the close, hurt the sector. Yahoo's Q3 EPS is expected to fall 67% to 17 cents, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Without Yahoo, EPS growth for the group is 13%.Following Yahoo, Microsoft and Google both report after the close Oct. 22.Microsoft, which is restructuring, is expected to report EPS ex items of 58 cents, down 11%. Google is expected to show EPS of $7.20, up 13%.Apple reports after the close Oct. 27. Overall smartphone growth is slowing, but not at Apple. Earnings are expected to jump 32% to $1.88, its seventh quarter in a row of double-digit gains Revenue is expected to top $51 billion, up 21%.Follow Brian Deagon on Twitter @IBD_BDeagon.

The five-floor, 22,269 square-foot location will be Microsoft's first flagship store. It plans to open a second flagship store in Sydney, Australia, on Nov. 12.The flagship stores will feature the latest personal technology from Microsoft and its partners, as well as the Answer Desk, a one-stop shop for technical questions, troubleshooting and repairs; and the Community Theater, a place where customers can learn how to use Microsoft's latest and most popular products.Microsoft opened its first retail store in October 2006 in Scottsdale, Ariz.

825,CRM,"\Salesforce.com (CRM) announced its second major push into the vertical software arena within a week on Wednesday, as it unveiled a venture into the health care industry — a market that some contend has near-limitless growth potential and countless avenues for tech companies to pursue.Salesforce, though, isn't straying outside its comfort zone as it makes this push. The company has geared its health care effort around a strategy that involves sticking to its knitting in customer relationship management software, or CRM. While other tech companies have waded into the health industry in various incarnations — offering everything from electronic medical records to robotic surgeons — the cloud-computing developer says it plans to shy away from that, focusing only on the relationship between health provider and patient.'Treating Patients Like Consumers'Dr. Joshua Newman, a one-time practicing physician who is now the chief medical officer at Salesforce, is gearing the company's efforts toward an area that he says is sorely lacking in modern medicine.""What (health care providers are) bad at is relationships, phone calls, support, education, (the) patient experience — the waits are terrible,"" Newman said in an interview. ""People don't know what's going to happen to them. They don't have anyone to call. You can't get your lab results. The kinds of things we appreciate in every other industry, health care has been notoriously bad at.""Among its planned offerings, Salesforce is working on software that will let doctors, nurses and technicians all communicate in a sort of chat room to get up-to-date on a patient's condition, rather than on making countless phone calls. It would also allow health providers and patients to stay in frequent communication so that patients won't have to wait hours or days for answers on, say, prescriptions or therapy. In the past, providers have tried to keep patient communication to a minimum, he said.""The reason why is they've never gotten reimbursed for those things. In fact, it costs you money to call a patient. It costs you money to send emails, to have someone come in for something you don't get reimbursed for,"" he said. ""Health care just now is realizing the importance of treating patients like consumers.""Wealth Management MoveSalesforce plans to unveil specific products in October and start marketing them by February. Its announcement comes a week after the San Francisco-based company said it was venturing into the financial industry, another vertical business that it hopes will help the company meet a goal of reaching $10 billion in annual revenue. Salesforce is about two-thirds of the way there. Under its Dreamforce initiative, Salesforce has a number of other vertical initiatives — developing programs that are tailor-made for a certain industry — planned in other realms such as autos, media and retail.Both Salesforce executives and industry analysts agree pursuing a vertical strategy provides the next big growth opportunity for the software industry.What's in question, however, is just how lucrative health care will be. Research firm Gartner suggests vertical-specific software revenue designed for medical use is less than half that of government or banking programs. Health care also lags behind media, manufacturing and insurance in generating software revenue.Part of that is because the industry itself would rather devote its dollars to medical research, said Gartner analyst Jennifer Mazzucca.""(Information technology) has been relegated to not necessarily being the priority that it should be,"" she said.Big Software Will See You NowShe adds, however, that the reach of health care likely extends well beyond what current figures show, and is luring such companies as IBM (IBM) and Apple (AAPL) into vertical health care strategies, along with other industries where they can go vertical. Both IBM and Apple have formed an alliance to develop vertical-specific software.Plus, revenue attributed to other industries or entities, such as government or insurance, often have health care dollars attached to them, Mazzucca said.What's also unclear is how much growth potential there is in the industry, though it seems vast to many. The World Bank estimated overall U.S. health care spending at around $2.9 trillion in 2013, one-sixth of the nation's productivity. It also has an inflation rate that often is double or triple that of the rest of the economy, meaning its share of GDP will continue to grow.Translation: The life sciences industry can devote at least $50 billion a year to technology improvement, said Nitsa Zuppas, chief marketing officer at Veeva Systems (VEEV), which specializes in programs for pharmaceutical or biotech firms. She says Veeva itself can tap into a $5 billion market in the areas where it specializes, which includes tools to help pharmas get a proposed drug from lab to market.What also is promising about health care is that much of it remains in the dark ages when it comes digitizing. Zuppas points out that much of the regulatory approval process continues to be done the old-fashioned way — on paper — while it offers a program designed to rapidly expedite that process.""You have to have these documents forever, plus 10 years,"" she said. ""We see a huge opportunity.""Follow Russ Britt on Twitter @IBD_RBritt.

826,CRM,"Accounting benefits for phone companies have made some telecom investors scratch their heads, and upcoming revenue-recognition changes for software companies could be the next conundrum.The good news for technology stock investors is that the accounting changes for software companies have been ""effectively delayed until 2018,"" says a Citigroup report. The bad news is that there's a long list of companies that would be impacted.They include: Adobe Systems (ADBE), security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Splunk (SPLK).Industry ""deliberations"" over the new software revenue accounting standards will heat up in Fall, 2015, says Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard in a report. ""Proposed changes are significant and make revenue treatment less conservative,"" he said.Accounting standards bodies FASB and IASB proposed the changes in international revenue accounting in 2014.Pritchard notes that the accounting changes come just as the industry is shifting toward cloud computing's software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model and subscription-based revenue, rather than one-time licensing fees.""We see the non-SaaS subscription contracts such as those employed by Adobe, Autodesk (ADSK), CA, Guidewire Software (GWRE), Jive Software (JIVE), Microsoft and Splunk to be most at risk to change, with revenue timing accelerated.""The new accounting rules ""could provide more of an incentive for companies to change contract terms in order to accelerate revenue and achieve quarterly targets, something that current rules make more difficult. Beyond subscription revenue treatment, we also see other proposed changes that could drive more inconsistent allocation of revenue between product (license-appliances) and ratable sources (maintenance support) as well as separation of hosting arrangements from software in certain SaaS arrangements,"" Pritchard said.The accounting changes, Pritchard speculates, could ""make it difficult to compare reported revenue between native SaaS companies (like Salesforce) and flexible SaaS companies (like Oracle and SAP).""In a separate report, Morgan Stanley on Thursday said more than 50 ""pension heavy"" companies have recently changed their GAAP accounting, thereby redefining pension costs, and sometimes eliminating pension costs from adjusted earnings. They include Boeing (BA), FedEx (FDX), Honeywell (HON) and AT&T (T).Telecom companies have roiled earnings by introducing wireless financing plans for mobile phones. The EIP (equipment installment plans) pull forward earnings by booking equipment revenue on the date of sale. T-Mobile's (TMUS) aggressive Uncarrier promotions started the EIP trend, and AT&T followed.

900,CRM,"What Salesforce hopes to do is digitize the ties between advisor and client so there can be constant communication between the two, even in informal settings. Advisors would be able to look at a client's portfolio from the back of a cab or in a coffee line and offer advice instantly online.

901,CRM,"Mulcahy says Salesforce picked financial services first because the company's existing financial services customers — who advise everyone from high net-worth clients down to the average retail investor — sought ways to deepen relationships with clients.

903,CRM,"To design its new product, Salesforce worked with wealth management firms, including AIG (AIG) Advisor Group, Northern Trust (NTRS) and United Capital.
"
904,CRM,"Mulcahy adds there are few competitors who have tapped this market, though there are some who are offering customized programs for advisors of high-net-worth clients. The company's main competitor in this realm would be banks and brokerages themselves who use their own tech teams to develop their own software.

978,CRM,"Some investors are happy performing simply in line with the S&P 500 every year.But there's another group of investors, many of them IBD readers, who are true students of the market.They like the thrill of the hunt — finding that next big market-winner in the early stages of a new bull market. They're good at taking profits on the way up and raising cash near market tops. They're always looking for an edge to help them outperform.The edge is developed by hard work, discipline and a desire to beat the market using fundamental and technical analysis to find the very best growth stocks.Even the best investors have lazy streaks in them. But in the end, it doesn't get in the way of hard work, which is what is needed to go from good to great.It's human nature to procrastinate. Writers do it. Athletes do it. Executives do it. Even investors do it.The past two Investor's Corner topics outlined two bad habits that are best avoided in the journey to becoming a better investor. Bad Habit No. 1: Don't buy blindly based on a stock tip. No. 2: Don't freeze up, unable to pull the trigger, in the early stages of a new market rally.Bad Habit No. 3 is failing to be prepared with an actionable watch list when major averages flash a buy signal after a correction. Buy signals, or follow-through days, have been at every single market bottom in the past, and investors with clean, actionable watch lists benefit the most.When stock indexes are selling off in heavy volume, it's human nature to stop paying attention. It's easy to procrastinate in building a watch list of candidates that could be the next bull market leaders when the selling finally runs its course.At the start of new bull markets, new names in new sectors tend to provide the strongest leadership.Use screens like the IBD 50 (every day in IBD Leaderboard), Your Weekly Review (Tuesday and Thursday) to keep your watch lists fresh. Target newer companies with top fundamentals. Prune the list periodically, cutting names loose that aren't performing like they were before.IBD's stock tables quickly uncover the market's emerging stars. The tables are arranged by sector strength. At the beginning of each sector listing, look for Sector Leaders and IPOs within the last 15 years with EPS and RS Ratings of 80 or higher.It's easy to latch onto a former leader thinking that it has the potential to be a leader again. Microsoft (MSFT) was a huge winner in the 1990s bull market before a long period of sideways movement ahead of the 2008 bear market crash (see accompanying chart). Some are confident that new CEO Satya Nadella has the company on the right path, but it's tough for a company of Microsoft's size to reinvent itself. Meaningful sales growth is often hard to come by.At the time when Microsoft couldn't get out of its own way, enterprise software firm Salesforce.com (CRM) was making noise with a successful IPO in June 2004 (1). The company grew vast and grabbed a leadership position in the enterprise software space. No surprise, since companies take advantage of new software technologies, like the cloud, to operate more efficiently.

1007,CRM,"For a tech company, 16 years is practically middle-aged. And with revenue expected to top $6 billion this fiscal year, some might question how much growth is left for cloud and customer relationship management pioneer Salesforce.com (CRM).Top executives steering the San Francisco-based company known for automating all manner of sales functions insist there is still plenty.CEO Marc Benioff and President Keith Block believe that Salesforce will reach the $10 billion revenue mark in record time for an enterprise software company, though no time frame was given.""We also believe we will go from the sixth largest software company to the third largest, surpassing SAP (SAP),"" Block said in an interview with IBD.That would put it third behind Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL).And it's not just its core business in sales-force automation and customer relationship management, he says.""I think we will be the most relevant technology company in the world in the next few years,"" Block said. ""We will be influencing and advising companies and gaining their trust on how they can change their business model and disrupt the market.""Six Key ServicesSalesforce introduced its first customer relationship management, or CRM, solution in 2000, a year after Benioff co-founded the firm.In addition to its sales-cloud franchise, it now sells five other core services, including recently introduced analytics, community and marketing clouds.The Salesforce1 Platform provides the technology to power its products and lets customers and partners build their own apps.CRM apps allow sales and marketing staffs to record, organize, automate and strategize on customer interactions, using data as a key tool.The company's Marketing Cloud was born out of its $2.25 billion acquisition in 2013 of ExactTarget. It's the fastest growing top-five marketing vendor, Block says, citing research from Gartner.Analytics IntroducedSalesforce is also taking market share while other top-five vendors are losing share, he says.Analytics Cloud was launched in November at the company's annual ""Dreamforce"" conference, which drew 125,000 attendees — ""the largest technology conference in the world,"" Block says.Within two weeks of the Analytics Cloud launch, Salesforce was closing on $1 million-plus deals with several Fortune 500 companies, he says. However, the company has not yet reported sales results.Analytics Cloud lets customers run analytical reports on all digital platforms, including mobile phones and tablets.""In the old world, you go to the IT department to run reports and get the information in three to six weeks,"" Block said. ""They don't provide insights. Ours is all about ... analysis. We put it in the hands of everybody"" to quickly turn ""insights into action.""Though the firm's cloud services are sold to customers of all sizes, Salesforce is transitioning to an ""enterprise-class company,"" Block says.He says it has closed nearly 550 transactions for fiscal 2015 in the ""seven-and-eight-figures,"" about 100 more than last year.""No other cloud computing (company) is closing transactions at this size, scale and volume,"" he said.Driving UberCar service Uber uses Salesforce's integrated platform, which includes analytics, service and marketing clouds to ""power their business,"" Block says.New or expanded client wins in the first quarter, as called out by Benioff in a conference call, included Bouygues Telecom in France, Tyco International (TYC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Expedia (EXPE), Medtronic (MDT) and Western Union (WU), among many others.Salesforce signed a ""major new deal"" with a transportation company — ""one of the world's greatest brands in their category,"" Block said in the call.The unnamed company was using ""on-premise legacy technology from Oracle,"" he said, adding that it plans to put Salesforce1 on mobile devices and ""into the hands of more than 10,000 field employees around the world.""Salesforce's chief rivals in CRM are Oracle, SAP and Microsoft. Management pegs its market share in CRM at 41%, making it the No. 1 player.""We created a bow wave, a movement and a market. Others are tying to surf in our wake,"" Block said, adding that the transition for players with legacy technology is like ""turning a battleship in stormy seas.""Salesforce's addressable market for all its cloud offerings stands at around $62 billion, and it's expected to grow at a compounded annual rate of 11%, according to Rob Breza, an analyst with Wunderlich Securities.Helping to fuel that growth will be new wins in international markets — especially Europe and Asia, analysts say.Only 26% of Salesforce's revenue in Q1 was generated outside the U.S., a lower percentage than at Oracle and Microsoft. The largest share was in Europe, where revenue grew 28% from a year earlier, in constant currency.Total revenue in the quarter ended in April rose 23% to $1.51 billion. That put it on track to surpass a $6 billion annual revenue run rate ""faster than any other enterprise software company,"" Benioff said in the Q1 report.Operating cash flow jumped 54% to $731 million. Earnings per share rose 45% to 16 cents.Based on robust Q1 results, Salesforce raised its full-year revenue forecast to $6.55 billion, at the high end of its previous range.Management also upped EPS guidance for 2015 by two cents, to 71 cents per share, for a 37% year-over-year gain.In recently initiating coverage on Salesforce with a ""buy"" rating, analyst Breza of Wunderlich Securities noted that billed and unbilled backlog of over $9.1 billion ""should reassure investors"" that the company can sustain long-term growth.Investors drove up Salesforce stock 12% on April 29 after Bloomberg reported that it was fielding buyout offers. Executives at the company have declined to comment on ""market rumors and speculation.""Government Business Ahead?Analysts expect new wins in U.S. government contracts to provide solid growth opportunities in the future.JPMorgan analyst Mark Murphy noted that the U.S. General Services Administration is in the early stages of assembling a sizable purchase agreement with Salesforce for CRM products.Salesforce's ""dream"" of achieving $10 billion in revenue is a ""tangible target,"" Murphy wrote in a research note on June 25.The ""customer company,"" he said, has ""blossomed into a true multi-product success story as it now rides atop multiple product pillars of substantial scale and trajectory.""

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected 86 cents. EPS ex items would have fallen 5% in constant currency, Oracle said.The Redwood Shores, Calif.-based company's revenue fell 5% for the quarter ended May 31, to $10.7 billion. Analysts had forecast $10.9 billion. Revenue would have risen 3% in constant currency, Oracle said.For the current period, Oracle expects EPS ex items of 56 cents to 59 cents in constant currency, down 8% to 3.3%, and expects sales to rise 5% to 8% in constant currency. Analyst views aren't in constant currency. They expect 61 cents and $8.61 billion.Oracle stock was down 6% after hours, after the company released its results. Oracle stock rose a fraction in the regular session.Oracle is moving to a cloud model, where a company collects monthly subscription fees instead of large upfront license payments. Oracle also is working to increase adoption of its 12c database software, released in 2013, and to resuscitate its hardware business.Oracle co-CEO Safra Catz pointed to strong cloud software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service revenue, in the company's earnings press release.""We sold an astonishing $426 million of new SaaS and PaaS annually recurring cloud subscription revenue in Q4,"" Catz said.

"
1207,CRM,"Why might Salesforce.com be sold? Decelerating revenue growth and market saturation, analysts say — and also a belief by some that the cloud software pioneer just might be at its apex.
"
1208,CRM,"The No. 1 provider of customer relationship management software became the subject of takeover rumors after a Bloomberg report on April 29 said it has hired bankers to field offers, after receiving an unsolicited buyout offer from an unnamed company.
"
1209,CRM,"Analysts have since namedOracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT), SAP (SAP), Google (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) as potential buyers.
"
1210,CRM,"There are few possible suitors because of the size of Salesforce.com (CRM), which has a market cap near $47.5 billion.
"
1211,CRM,"The company's annual sales have soared from barely $1 billion in fiscal 2009 to $5.4 billion for fiscal 2015 ended Jan. 31.
"
1212,CRM,"Yet, year-over-year quarterly revenue growth has slipped from the high 30% range to the low 20% range in the past two years, and that lower growth is expected to continue, says Steve Koenig, an analyst for Wedbush Securities. Salesforce is set to release fiscal Q1 earnings after the close Wednesday. The consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters calls for revenue from the April quarter to rise 22% from the year-earlier quarter to $1.5 billion.
"
1213,CRM,"""I think they are decelerating in terms of new business activities probably faster than people realize,"" Koenig told IBD. ""It's not going to accelerate.""
"
1214,CRM,"This fiscal year, analysts expect sales growth of 21%, down from 32% in fiscal 2015, 33% in fiscal '14, 35% in fiscal '13 and 37% in fiscal '12.
"
1215,CRM,"Salesforce.com is sliding out of the high-growth group of tech companies, said a financial analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"
1216,CRM,"""There is no double that we are past the peak growth, so does (Salesforce.com CEO Marc) Benioff want to tap out at the top? That's a possibility,"" the analyst said.
"
1217,CRM,"But as a company gets bigger, smaller percentage growth inevitably follows. And growth will remain solid as it gains traction in new areas such as marketing services and data analytics, says Kirk Materne, an analyst for Evercore ISI.
"
1218,CRM,"""They have a much broader product portfolio,"" Materne told IBD. ""They are just now starting to penetrate the enterprise in a more meaningful way. And you look at their revenue base in international markets and they still have plenty of growth potential there.
"
1219,CRM,"""I just don't see a huge deceleration in the near term for these guys.""
"
1220,CRM,"But Koenig says Salesforce's sales team is having some troubles despite the hiring of former Oracle executive Keith Block as company president and head of sales in June 2013.
"
1221,CRM,"But sales team execution issues may not be the only issue crimping its sales growth, Koenig says.
"
1222,CRM,"""A bigger factor is simply that while the market is not yet mature, I think it's saturated,"" he said.
"
1223,CRM,"That is, many companies still have to move toward the cloud, he says, but Salesforce already might have converted most of the companies that had used older CRM systems from Siebel Systems, an enterprise software giant that Oracle bought in 2006 for $5.8 billion. That had been a key Salesforce target.
"
1224,CRM,"""That market has been picked through pretty well by now,"" Koenig said.
"
1225,CRM,"In the past few years, Salesforce has looked to boost revenue by moving into new markets. One of those markets is email marketing services, which it entered via its $2.5 billion acquisition of ExactTarget in 2013.
"
1226,CRM,"In October, Salesforce launched a data analytics service that competes with fast-growing Tableau Software (DATA) and others.
"
1227,CRM,"The company is also moving into human resource management software, where it will run into Workday (WDAY) and ServiceNow (NOW), says J. Derrick Wood, an analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group.
"

"
1239,CRM,"""It's a very high bar and that is exactly why it may not happen,"" he said, ""but I think anything could happen here.""Why might Salesforce.com be sold? Decelerating revenue growth and market saturation, analysts say — and also a belief by some that the cloud software pioneer just might be at its apex.The No. 1 provider of customer relationship management software became the subject of takeover rumors after a Bloomberg report on April 29 said it has hired bankers to field offers, after receiving an unsolicited buyout offer from an unnamed company.Analysts have since namedOracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT), SAP (SAP), Google (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) as potential buyers.There are few possible suitors because of the size of Salesforce.com (CRM), which has a market cap near $47.5 billion.The company's annual sales have soared from barely $1 billion in fiscal 2009 to $5.4 billion for fiscal 2015 ended Jan. 31.Yet, year-over-year quarterly revenue growth has slipped from the high 30% range to the low 20% range in the past two years, and that lower growth is expected to continue, says Steve Koenig, an analyst for Wedbush Securities. Salesforce is set to release fiscal Q1 earnings after the close Wednesday. The consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters calls for revenue from the April quarter to rise 22% from the year-earlier quarter to $1.5 billion.""I think they are decelerating in terms of new business activities probably faster than people realize,"" Koenig told IBD. ""It's not going to accelerate.""This fiscal year, analysts expect sales growth of 21%, down from 32% in fiscal 2015, 33% in fiscal '14, 35% in fiscal '13 and 37% in fiscal '12.Salesforce.com is sliding out of the high-growth group of tech companies, said a financial analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity.""There is no double that we are past the peak growth, so does (Salesforce.com CEO Marc) Benioff want to tap out at the top? That's a possibility,"" the analyst said.But as a company gets bigger, smaller percentage growth inevitably follows. And growth will remain solid as it gains traction in new areas such as marketing services and data analytics, says Kirk Materne, an analyst for Evercore ISI.""They have a much broader product portfolio,"" Materne told IBD. ""They are just now starting to penetrate the enterprise in a more meaningful way. And you look at their revenue base in international markets and they still have plenty of growth potential there.""I just don't see a huge deceleration in the near term for these guys.""But Koenig says Salesforce's sales team is having some troubles despite the hiring of former Oracle executive Keith Block as company president and head of sales in June 2013.But sales team execution issues may not be the only issue crimping its sales growth, Koenig says.""A bigger factor is simply that while the market is not yet mature, I think it's saturated,"" he said.That is, many companies still have to move toward the cloud, he says, but Salesforce already might have converted most of the companies that had used older CRM systems from Siebel Systems, an enterprise software giant that Oracle bought in 2006 for $5.8 billion. That had been a key Salesforce target.""That market has been picked through pretty well by now,"" Koenig said.In the past few years, Salesforce has looked to boost revenue by moving into new markets. One of those markets is email marketing services, which it entered via its $2.5 billion acquisition of ExactTarget in 2013.In October, Salesforce launched a data analytics service that competes with fast-growing Tableau Software (DATA) and others.The company is also moving into human resource management software, where it will run into Workday (WDAY) and ServiceNow (NOW), says J. Derrick Wood, an analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group.""They probably don't have a significant amount of market share they can capture in CRM, so they are moving into analytics and HR,"" he said.Koenig, for one, says Salesforce executives might be figuring that this is a good time to sell ""as far as maximizing the price, if you have motivated buyers chasing you,"" he said.Microsoft ended its March quarter with $95.4 billion in cash.

"
1281,CRM,"IBD: How does the original Internet boom compare with today's market?
"
1282,CRM,"Goldmacher: In the original boom, the Internet was new and poorly understood. Replicating any business model on the Internet seemed like a great idea. Now, entirely new business models have created the same enthusiasm. Nobody would have ever imagined a Snapchat or an Uber doing brand-new things. Some of these businesses are delivering phenomenal results in dramatic market adoption or actual profitability.
"
1283,CRM,"IBD: Who is leading the Big Data and cloud markets?
"
1284,CRM,"Goldmacher: In the data world, you don't have a public company leading the charge this time. You have extremely well-funded private companies like MongoDB, Cloudera, DataStax and Hortonworks (HDP), which was well-funded before going public.

"
1291,CRM,"IBD: Is the NoSQL database market a threat to Oracle's relational database market?
"
1292,CRM,"Goldmacher: It's a material threat. You have more contemporary technology in the NoSQL market at more compelling prices because so much functionality is delivered through open source that it is often free, so you are seeing most new projects being developed in some sort of NoSQL software.
"
1293,CRM,"IBD: What is the difference between NoSQL and Oracle's relational database?

"
1296,CRM,"Goldmacher: Within NoSQL you have subdivisions. The subdivision we participate in gives you the ability to write and read data to a database very quickly.

If a consistent track record of strong earnings-per-share growth is in place, it's also good to ask the question: What are you going to do for me going forward?In this case, it's good to know what kind of EPS growth is expected in the current quarter and full year.Fundamentals drive a stock's price performance. Big quarterly EPS and sales growth, high return on equity and peak profit margins are all important, but positive growth prospects also matter.The minimum annual EPS estimate to look for is +15%, although many aggressive growth names will show year-over-year gains stronger than that.It's good to see strong growth for the current year as well as the following the year.If it's 20%+ for both years, you're fishing in the right pond.Be careful not to look at quarterly and annual estimates in a vacuum. Just because a stock is expected to boost quarterly earnings by 50% and annual earnings by 30% doesn't mean it's a buy.

It set a goal of reaching annualized revenue of $20 billion in its corporate cloud business in the fiscal year that ends in June 2018. In the March quarter, Microsoft's cloud business had an annualized run rate of $6.3 billion.Microsoft's Internet cloud offerings include Azure data-center services, Office 365 productivity software and Dynamics customer management programs.Microsoft also set a goal of getting its upcoming Windows 10 operating system on 1 billion devices (PCs, tablets and smartphones) within three years.Both of Microsoft's big goals are achievable, said Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brendan Barnicle.In a research report Wednesday, Barnicle reiterated his overweight rating on Microsoft stock and raised his price target to 55 from 50. Microsoft fell nearly 1% to 48.64 on the stock market today.45% CAGR The Cloud TargetUBS analyst Brent Thill concurred. In a note Wednesday, Thill maintained his buy rating and price target of 50 on Microsoft stock.To hit its $20 billion goal in 2018, Microsoft's commercial cloud business will need to grow at a compound annual rate of 45%. This ""seems reasonable"" given that it has had seven consecutive quarters of more than 100% growth in the business, Thill said.""We believe their targets show the business getting to more critical levels of scale, where margins can slowly improve from current levels,"" Thill said.Other analysts weren't swayed by Microsoft's projections.Summit Research Partners analyst Richard Williams praised Microsoft's presentations on HoloLens holographic computing, Windows 10 and cloud computing, saying the company ""exceeded expectations.""

1423,CRM,"Aaron Levie is always full of energy, always on the go.
"
1424,CRM,"Levie left college early to create Box (BOX), an enterprise-class data management and collaboration platform that Levie says is transformative.
"
1425,CRM,"As Box chairman and chief executive, Levie led the company's initial public offering on Jan. 23, which raised $175 million.
"
1426,CRM,"Levie recently spoke with IBD about his company and industry.
"
1427,CRM,"IBD: In your Q4 earnings conference call with analysts, you said Box is creating a new category. How so?
"
1428,CRM,"Levie: As technology moves from on-premise systems to the cloud, there's a whole bunch of change that happens.
"
1429,CRM,"Salesforce.com (CRM) was able to create a new sales force automation and CRM platform from the cloud. Workday (WDAY) was able to disrupt the human resources, human capital management segment with the cloud.
"
1430,CRM,"What we're going after is all of the investment in content management software, storage technology and search appliances — all the things that enterprises need to be able to store and manage their data. We basically moved that to our cloud platform.
"
1431,CRM,"We are creating a new category where we're not just managing content, we're not just helping you search it or secure your content, we're helping you collaborate as well. So that's enterprise content collaboration — and that's the market we are going after.
"
1432,CRM,"IBD: What is the market size opportunity? I've heard widely different estimates.
"
1433,CRM,"Levie: The reason there are different calculations is that a lot depends on how much of that technology can be replaced and subsumed over time by our platform. Certainly we are disruptive to the content management industry. We're disruptive to the on-premise storage technology industry. We combine those solutions into one. That is a tens-of-billions-of-dollars opportunity that we're going after.
"
1434,CRM,"IBD: Some say there are three dozen companies in this field. How will Box remain a leader?
"
1435,CRM,"Levie: We've been competing in this landscape for 10 years. When a chief information officer sets out to standardize on a platform for their critical corporate information, there are far fewer choices that you have as an enterprise. You can't really go to Amazon's (AMZN) file sharing tool, you can't really go to Dropbox, you can't really go to Google (GOOGL) Drive.
"
1436,CRM,"So it largely comes down to us and Microsoft (MSFT).
"
1437,CRM,"I think (research firms) Forrester, Gartner and others will confirm that we're really the leader in the market because of our focus on enterprise security, scalability and content management.
"
1438,CRM,"When we do go up against Microsoft, we actually win two-thirds of the time. Even in those situations the customer is still likely buying something from Microsoft — Office 365, or the Office productivity suite. But they are using Box for the content management and security around that information.
"
1439,CRM,"So even when we do go head-to-head we often still see customers buying our solution alongside Microsoft. We think our differentiation is very clear. It allows us to command a premium price point at a premium position in this market.
"
1440,CRM,"IBD: Don't you also have a partnership with Microsoft?
"
1441,CRM,"Levie: We recently announced a partnership with Microsoft as an inaugural member of their cloud storage partner program. When you are a user of Office 365, Box will allow you to seamlessly take your data from Box and interact it with Office products. So, as I mentioned, even when we win an account against Microsoft, customers are still likely buying a Microsoft solution. It's not a zero-sum game where you have to use only one product or another. The synergies and the integration between our products will increase over time.
"
1442,CRM,"IBD: So you are just as much a partner with Microsoft as a competitor?
"
1443,CRM,"Levie: I think so. I think that is where the trend is going, and you'll see more partnership integration over time with Microsoft.
"
1444,CRM,"IBD: Most of your users are using the free version of Box. Is the freemium business model still the best way to go?
"
1445,CRM,"Levie: We definitely use free user traction as a way to get into the enterprise. Once Box gets brought into the enterprise, then we can work with those companies and sell a more secure or advanced version of our product.
"
1446,CRM,"So when you look at General Electric (GE) or Eli Lilly (LLY), these organizations first started out with users of our free product. Then we were able to sell an enterprise-wide solution to them. More and more, over time, our mix shift is going to go to larger enterprises, where our investment in our sales force and key partnerships with Microsoft and others will be very important.
"
1447,CRM,"IBD: Is there a stickiness to your product that once you start you tend to stay?
"
1448,CRM,"Levie: We have a very high retention rate. As customers expand their investment in Box, over time, there is a high degree of stickiness. Once you adopt our solution and have more and more of your critical files on our platform, it means that we can drive more productivity and can deliver new, more transformative-use cases within your business. That leads to a very high retention rate and a longer-term demand for our service with customers.
"
1449,CRM,"IBD: What do you find satisfying about what you've achieved?
"
1450,CRM,"Levie: We definitely love the fact that we're at a stage where we have meaningful conversations with some of the world's largest enterprises. We help them transform how they are using their data and how they are delivering IT in their organization. We have worked for 10 years to build out a differentiated platform and now we have some of the world's largest health care companies, media companies, energy companies and others that are using our product to really transform how they're working.

Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brendan Barnicle kept his overweight rating but boosted his price target to 50 from 48. Both analysts cited strength in the company's Internet cloud computing business as a basis for their bullish research reports.
"
1456,CRM,"Microsoft's Q3 shows that it is ""not 100% tied to the PC market, contrary to popular belief,"" Thill said. ""In our view, Microsoft is well ahead of its large cap value peer group in the transition to the cloud.""
"

The business now has an annual revenue run rate of $6.3 billion. Cloud offerings include Office 365, Azure and Dynamics CRM Online.
"
1458,CRM,"Microsoft's Azure business alone has an estimated $1.5 billion annual revenue run rate, Barnicle said.

1503,CRM,"Oracle (ORCL) is gaining some ground on Workday in cloud HR software, as the legacy software giant continues to transition more toward the cloud.So says Rick Sherlund, an analyst for Nomura Securities, in a research report Friday after attending Oracle's HCM World conference in Washington, D.C., on Thursday. HCM stands for human capital management, the more encompassing name for human resources.Oracle, the No. 1 database software provider, has been transitioning to a cloud software-as-a-service subscription model, where companies pay a monthly fee for the software they use vs. paying larger one-time license fees up front.The cloud model continues to gain in the market, and Oracle has been forced to play catch-up with such cloud vendors as Salesforce.com (CRM) and Workday (WDAY). Both companies are growing fast.HCM software helps companies manage employees, benefits and recruitment.Based on his discussions with customers and systems integrators (SIs), Oracle's efforts to better compete with Workday could be paying off, Sherlund says. He rates Oracle stock a buy.""We came away incrementally more positive after Oracle HCM World, given our conversations with customers and SIs,"" he wrote. ""Interest in (Oracle's) Fusion HCM (cloud product) has picked up over the last six months, with a key Oracle SI partner indicating that Oracle added approximately 580 Fusion HCM customers following the Release 8 product, with maybe one-third, or 150-200, live over the past two quarters.""Oracle's Q3 earnings earlier this month provided more evidence of the company's aggressive push into the cloud.Oracle's cloud revenue is still relatively small, but the company is making progress, Sherlund says.""Our view is that given enough time, Oracle will get it right in the cloud,"" he wrote. ""Workday was written natively for the cloud and is the high watermark for ease of configuration, ease of use and high customer satisfaction.""Our customer and SI checks indicate Oracle is getting better all the time and has the advantage of a broader product line, and it is easier for existing Oracle e-Business Suite customers to move to Fusion in the cloud since this was the design objective.""Oracle stock was down a fraction in morning trading in the stock market today and is down 5% this year after rising 17% in 2014.

1575,CRM,"In the commercial real estate recovery, the U.S. office market has lagged other sectors such as apartments and industrial.But it has been rebounding as the economy improves and adds jobs. A lot of the strength has been driven by high tech. Where tech companies are on the move, office fundamentals are strengthening.Take San Francisco. Twitter (TWTR) was one of the first in. And with new space being taken by tech companies such as Salesforce.com (CRM), Dropbox and Splunk (SPLK), among others, the city has become one of the strongest U.S. office markets.Commercial real estate brokerage Marcus & Millichap (MMI) ranks it No. 1 on its National Office Property Index for 2015, a forward-looking survey released this week.The index sorts markets by improvements expected in 2015 based on factors such as new office supply, employment growth, and vacancies and absorption.Close behind San Francisco are tech hot spots San Jose, Calif., and Seattle, which bumped New York for third place due largely to Amazon's (AMZN) expansion in its hometown. San Jose kept its No. 2 spot as tech firms such as Google (GOOGL) and LinkedIn (LNKD) continue to take up huge blocks of space in the area.""The tech markets are absolutely holding their strength, no doubt about it,"" said Alan Pontius, national director of commercial property groups at Marcus & Millichap. ""Tech is not limited to Silicon Valley/San Jose at this point.""U.S. office leasing activity is increasingly focused in the high-tech sector, concurs commercial real estate services giant CBRE Group (CBG).Tech Takes 1 Of 5 Big LeasesIn CBRE's latest office-market study, also out this week, it noted that high tech accounted for 19% of the largest U.S. lease transactions in 2014, up from 13.6% in 2013.""What jumps out to me is how much market share high tech has taken for leasing activity,"" said Sara Rutledge, CBRE's research and analysis director.She says high tech has become an important driver in rising office-market fundamentals in ""all regions"" of the country.""In the Midwest, high tech accounted for 14% of the leasing activity in 2014,"" she said, making tech the No. 2 leasing sector there after health care and life sciences.While Marcus & Millichap sees San Francisco's office market improving most this year, Pontius views it also as ""absolutely the best"" office market in America today.""Supply and demand fundamentals are simply the strongest,"" he said. ""You're talking about the U.S. capital for technology.""Marcus & Millichap notes that tech firms now occupy significant space in San Francisco's financial district along with South of Market, the Mission District and South Beach area. Salesforce recently committed to 710,000 square feet in the renamed Salesforce Tower in the South of Market district, it noted.Office-using sectors added 407,100 jobs in the U.S. in 2014, a 2.4% gain over 2013, to 17.2 million, says CBRE. It's 2 million more office jobs than at 2009's cyclical low.They're not all high tech, of course. ""Both employment and leasing activity is broadening to other office-using services such as financial services and other business services,"" Rutledge said.CBRE says Los Angeles and Dallas/Fort Worth each saw more than 40,000 new office jobs last year, in varied fields.According to Marcus & Millichap's office report, six Florida markets show improving strength this year. Miami moved up the index four places to No. 7, and Tampa-St. Petersburg six notches to No. 24. Other rising office markets include West Palm Beach, Orlando, Fort Lauderdale and Jacksonville.The reason: little new office construction has occurred in the Sunshine State in more than five years, while population growth and homebuilding has outpaced the national average, Pontius says.""You're seeing a pickup in office demand with no pickup in supply,"" he said. Retirees and other newcomers ""need services,"" he said, such as health care, legal, insurance, mortgages and banking.Nationwide, net absorption of office space in 2014 — some 52.7 million square feet — was the highest since 2007, CBRE noted. But CBRE expects that rate to moderate over the next few years to around 42 million square feet annually, closer to the historic average.Space Race: Use Less Of It Besides coming off a high mark in 2014, another reason may be the secular trend in the way office space is designed and used.""Demand is positive but users of office space tend to use less space per worker than they used to,"" said Jeanette Rice, CBRE's head of Americas investment research.Even with that dynamic, CBRE says, demand for office space nationwide is outpacing supply, which means vacancy rates will continue to fall, pushing rents up.Office vacancies in 2014 reached their lowest level since 2008, CBRE said, ending the year at 13.9%. The lowest vacancy rate in the U.S. was in Manhattan's Midtown South area, at 5.5%, followed by downtown San Francisco at 6.6%.Manhattan, home of Wall Street and a center for financial services, has also attracted lots of tech companies in expansion mode, such as Google and Amazon. Samsung plans to lease as much as 1 million square feet of additional space, Marcus & Millichap notes.Amid lackluster government employment, Washington, D.C. dropped two rungs in Marcus & Millichap's 2015 office index. More than 20% of the D.C. metro area's office stock will sit empty this year, Marcus & Millichap said.Energy capital Houston also is coming under pressure, but for another reason: the steep fall in oil prices and its impact on local employment at a time when a lot of new office supply is entering the market.There's no doubt oil's drop creates ""a degree of pause,"" said Pontius. So far this year in Houston, 1.3 million square feet of existing office space has been put on the market for subleasing, Rutledge of CBRE says. That brings available office sublease space to 2.7% of the total office market. At that point, it ""starts to impact the overall rental rate (downwards),"" she said.Despite new office supply in some markets, such as Houston, San Francisco, San Jose and New York, very little new office supply is expected nationwide. New office construction nationwide will amount to no more than 1% of existing office supply, Pontius says.""That is statistically almost nothing,"" he said. ""So you have time for the demand side to impact absorption and leasing. We expect a rising trendline on the demand side as the job market continues to expand.""

1668,CRM,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) continued to turn heads on Wall Street Friday after the cosmetics retailer reported stunning fourth-quarter sales and earnings that sailed past views, late the day before.Ulta stock was up 3.1% in afternoon trading in the stock market today. The pop came after an 8.5% surge in after-hours trading Thursday following the fourth-quarter report.An IBD 50 stock, Ulta is a one-stop shop for beauty and salon products at a variety of prices.In a report out Friday morning, Sterne Agee analyst Ike Boruchow called the fourth-quarter ""one of the company's strongest all-around quarters in recent years.""Why is Ulta poised to keep shining? 1. A strong growth record is seen continuing.Part of IBD's Retail-Specialty industry group, Ulta ranks No. 1 in the group with an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of a possible 99, based on a variety of metrics such as earnings growth and stock-price gains.Ulta has logged 17 straight quarters of double-digits earnings growth. And analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see it turning out double-digit earnings growth for all of fiscal 2015. 2. The company's strategy is striking a chord with consumers.Ulta has stayed on top of its game by regularly rolling out new products and brands while enhancing its service and shopping experience. It also boasts an attractive customer loyalty program that keeps drawing new members.""The company's various strategic initiatives are all clicking (marketing, in-store experience/services, brand additions, e-commerce), resulting in elevated brand awareness and an acceleration in traffic,"" wrote Boruchow, who rates Ulta a buy.Ulta remains one of the best growth stories in retail, he says. 3. Ulta's customer loyalty program keeps growing.The company continues to benefit from management's strategies to drive brand awareness, noted Boruchow.He says those initiatives include the company's customer loyalty program, which continues to grow, boasting 15 million members. Boruchow notes Ulta's ""strong CRM (customer relationship management) platform results in a more targeted marketing program (less reliance on broad discounts)."" 4. Ulta is focused on improving customer service.""While new customer acquisition is a key initiative, management recognizes the need to drive repeat visitation via an improved store experience,"" he noted.Ulta is investing in more ""customer-facing"" labor hours, he adds, as well as in in-store technology to aid associates in their customer service function. 5. Supply chain initiatives are expected to prove beneficial.Cowen analyst Oliver Chen also came out with a bullish report on Ulta Friday following the company's fourth-quarter results. He has an outperform rating on Ulta.He noted that supply chain enhancements should ""benefit"" several areas of Ulta's business.""We are comforted by ULTA's goals to build a supply chain that will be able to support their growth plans (1,200+ stores) and believe sustained efficiencies will be able to be realized as they are able to continue gaining scale,"" he noted.The benefits from an enhanced supply chain include ""increased delivery frequencies to improve in-stock conditions; delivering cartons packaged in easier 'stock-to-shelf' manners; and leveraging inventory across store footprint to fulfill omnichannel orders,"" he said. 6. E-commerce is a bright spot for Ulta.In assessing Q4 results, Chen noted: ""Momentum at Ulta.com has been driven by higher instances of click-and-conversion rates on promotional e-mails, and consequently drove sales productivity higher. Our enthusiasm for the continued success in the e-commerce (division) is underscored by growth in incremental transactions (more than doubling) from customers who are actively buying online and in-store vs. solely in-store, leading us to believe there isn't much cannibalization going on between online/bricks and the customer.""Ulta is the second-largest company by market cap in the specialty retail industry group, after Luxottica Group (LUX), and before Petsmart (PETM), Michaels Cos. (MIK) and Sally Beauty Holdings (SBH).

But that's what software service provider Veeva Systems (VEEV) has done since making its market debut in October 2013, as it's taken share from larger rivals that were using older technology. Veeva, founded in 2007, specializes in providing cloud-based software…

1672,CRM,"Tableau Software's (DATA) Q4 beat was ""particularly impressive,"" said an analyst, as investment banks raised price targets and the stock neared a record high.At least three investment banks raised price targets Thursday after the data analytics software maker late Thursday posted Q4 earnings and revenue that crushed Wall Street expectations.The leader in data analytics visualization software — designed to make it easy for nontechie workers to see and easily grasp data trends — also guided Q1 revenue above analyst expectations. The midpoint of its bottom-line guidance, however, fell short of views.Still, FBR Capital Markets & Co. raised its price target on the company to 100 a share from 88 while maintaining its market perform rating. Robert W. Baird & Co. also boosted its price target to 105 from 85 a share while keeping its outperform rating.Tableau Software stock was up 16% in early trading in the stock market today, above 97.Susquehanna Financial Group boosted its price target on Tableau stock to 96 from 83 and maintained its neutral rating, while Pacific Crest raised its target to 110 from 104.With international sales rising fast and big deals over $100,000 rising fast, Tableau's growth story might be just getting started, says Daniel Ives, an analyst for FBR, in a research report Thursday.""Tableau continues to fire on all cylinders, given strong tailwinds in its core Tableau desktop/server software at its existing installed base and among new customers, a dynamic we believe speaks to the massive Big Data opportunity that remains in the early innings,"" he wrote. ""With rapid adoption of Big Data analytics and execution acumen adding fuel to Tableau's growth engine, we believe that company has further growth opportunities as it expands both domestically and internationally in coming quarters/years.""Susquehanna's Derrick Wood offered similar praise in his report, though with a bit of caution long term.""This was particularly impressive, given the tough comp and increasing size of its revenue run rate,"" he wrote. ""While Tableau carried substantial growth in the high-growth data visualization market, we remain concerned that its growth will begin to moderate as it hits the $500 million revenue level with a business that is still largely driven by a single product offering.""Tableau's Q4 revenue rose 75% to $142.9 million despite rising competition from Salesforce.com (CRM) and Qlik Technologies (QLIK), among others.

1675,CRM,"A few of the largest and oldest tech firms may finally get a shot at beating the upstarts in the fast-growing data analytics software market.
"
1676,CRM,"Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Oracle (ORCL) and others are armed with software to tackle what is becoming a growing concern and a big pain for companies: how to derive useful information from the reams of social media conversations, e-mail and other unstructured data on the Internet.
"
1677,CRM,"The old tech giants have been losing ground in the data analytics business to companies such as Tableau Software (DATA) and Qlik Technologies (QLIK) that have perfected ways of analyzing structured data. Structured data include spreadsheets and information from databases arranged in columns in a relational database system. Tableau's visualization software lets business professionals arrange structured data in easy-to-read charts and graphs without the need for IT departments.
"
1678,CRM,"But so far, neither Tableau nor Qlik can tackle unstructured data — considered the next big virtually untapped territory for data analytics, says Daniel Ives, an analyst for FBR Capital Markets & Co.
"
1679,CRM,"""Unstructured data is the Holy Grail,"" he told IBD. ""Cracking that nut is really the gold on the other side of the rainbow.""
"
1680,CRM,"Companies see a growing interest in mining social media sites like Facebook (FB) for customer feedback and other insights into their operations, says David Schubmehl, an analyst for market tracker IDC.
"
1681,CRM,"""This whole social media revolution has focused organizations' efforts on unstructured data (such as) Twitter (TWTR) and Facebook posts, and people are beginning to understand the potential value of unstructured data, so the future is very bright for this kind of analysis,"" he told IBD.
"
1682,CRM,"For now, the structured data analysis market will be much larger — and will grow much faster than — unstructured analysis. By 2018, global sales of relational database software for working with structural data will reach $50 billion, up from $30 billion, says IDC.
"
1683,CRM,"Global sales of non-relational database software for unstructured information are expected to reach $5.08 billion by 2018, up from $4.19 billion in 2013, IDC says. The market for unstructured data will likely accelerate as more companies become aware that it is an untapped resource, Schubmehl says.
"
1684,CRM,"""Right now, we have estimated that 90% of the data available in the world today is unstructured information,"" he said. ""You have got people writing memos, emails, research reports, patents, discussing why they didn't like the Patriots' (Super Bowl) win and all of this is adding to the ever-growing amount of content that is out there.""
"
1685,CRM,"But unstructured data are also a much tougher nut to crack for analytics firms, says Boris Evelson, an analyst for market tracker Forrester Research.

"
1687,CRM,"Many technology players, including HP and Oracle, have used acquisitions to help them serve the emerging unstructured market.
"
1688,CRM,"In one of the most controversial deals in recent history, HP paid $10.3 billion in 2011 to acquire Autonomy, a maker of software for sifting through unstructured data.
"
1689,CRM,"That same year Oracle paid $1 billion to acquire Endeca, which makes business intelligence software analyzing unstructured data.
"
1690,CRM,"More recently, Microsoft (MSFT) acquired Equivio, an Israel-based text analysis firm that can provide analysis of unstructured data.
"
1691,CRM,"Other technology giants SAP (SAP) and IBM (IBM) have used acquisitions to build a capability for unstructured data analysis, Evelson says.
"
1692,CRM,"""Among the big players, IBM has an edge, and SAP over the years has acquired a lot of unstructured data technologies,"" he said.
"
1693,CRM,"So far, Tableau and Qlik both rely on third-party partners when customers require analysis of unstructured data.
"
1694,CRM,"Tableau works with several partners including Splunk (SPLK) and Amazon.com (AMZN) units Amazon Relational Database Service, which helps customers set up a database in the cloud, and Amazon Elastic MapReduce, a Web-service that uses Hadoop open source database software to sift through large amounts of data.
"
1695,CRM,"A Qlik spokesman says using third-party companies is an effective strategy because it offers an unstructured expert to better serve the customer.
"
1696,CRM,"Others may be adopting a different strategy.
"
1697,CRM,"Late last year, Salesforce.com (CRM) launched a data analytics software service to serve help companies with both structured and unstructured data.

""The market for business intelligence against structured data is large and well established and Tableau (and secondarily Qlik) are disrupting this market.""
"
1703,CRM,"Tableau reported Q4 revenue growth of 75%, which soundly beat analyst estimates of 50% growth.

1776,CRM,"Size isn't the be-all and end-all of the business world, although it has its perks. The bigger you get, the more likely you are to score the kinds of deals that can help you get even bigger.Executives at NetSuite (N) can attest to that. The company provides cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and e-commerce services, mainly in the U.S. and Europe.Its products include NetSuite, a platform for financials/ERP, CRM, professional services automation (PSA) and e-commerce capabilities that automates processes across departments; and NetSuite OneWorld, used to manage organizations with different currencies, tax rules and reporting requirements.Clients come from a variety of industries, ranging from distribution and wholesale to computer software, manufacturing, telecom services, retail, financial services and health care.Roughly three-quarters of its business comes from the U.S. Its competitors include tech heavyweights Oracle (ORCL), SAP (SAP) and Microsoft (MSFT).Technology Growth StoryWhile NetSuite doesn't have nearly the size of those companies, it has grown a lot bigger in recent years. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company to post $553.8 million in revenue this year. That's up from about $415 million last year and $236 million as recently as 2011.NetSuite has strung together nine straight quarters of 30% or better year-over-year revenue growth — a tribute to its ability to land bigger deals with bigger clients, says NetSuite spokeswoman Jennifer Gianola.While the company used to focus exclusively on small and midsize businesses, it now is signing large enterprise customers.""During our most recent quarter, we had a record number of deals greater than $1 million, and our OneWorld product had a record ASP (average sales price),"" Gianola told IBD. ""These are indications that larger organizations are moving to the cloud on NetSuite.""Big-Company DealsD.A. Davidson analyst Jack Andrews said much the same thing in a recent report, noting that NetSuite ""continues to gain traction in larger companies domestically.""Andrews cites San Francisco-based home furnishings retailer Williams-Sonoma (WSM), which last year selected NetSuite's SuiteCommerce product as the multichannel retail and business management platform for its global expansion into Australia.Prior to signing on with NetSuite, Williams-Sonoma ""had three different legacy systems for point-of-sale, e-commerce and call-center transactions,"" he noted. ""By utilizing NetSuite as a next-generation platform, it was able to consolidate the activities of four separate brands into a single back-end solution.""Overseas markets hold particular promise for NetSuite, he said: ""Internationally, we believe companies of all sizes can benefit from OneWorld's multicompany, multicurrency functionality immediately, given the more heterogeneous business, tax and regulatory environment.""Condensing In The CloudNetSuite's main selling point is its ability to help clients condense their operations over the cloud, Gianola says. ""The value proposition is looking at companies that really want to run products and services in one system. A lot of product companies are becoming service companies, and we are a great solution for them.""More of those companies are choosing to go with NetSuite over other firms.""(NetSuite) will continue to gain ERP market share in the midmarket from Oracle, SAP, Microsoft and Sage,"" said Jeff Houston, analyst at Barrington Research. ""We also anticipate it will keep moving upstream (to enterprise customers) due to its OneWorld product.""One of NetSuite's advantages is that it already has a cloud-based ERP system, while other players in the field are still developing theirs.""The fact that it takes so long to write/build this type of system speaks to the complex issues legacy software vendors face when competing with effective cloud products,"" Andrews noted.He points out that it took NetSuite about 10 years to build its OneWorld product, and Oracle around eight years to completely rewrite its software for the cloud.Because of this long lead time, Andrews said, investors should be able to find out about potential competitors ""long before they might impact the growth trajectory of NetSuite.""That growth trajectory was on display during the third quarter, when NetSuite logged a 34% year-over-year sales increase to $143.7 million, edging past consensus analyst views. Earnings climbed 22% to 11 cents a share, topping views. It was the fifth straight quarter of double-digit EPS growth.NetSuite reported its Q3 results after the close on Oct. 23. The next day, its shares popped 11% to 103.61. The stock has since pushed higher and now trades near 107.The company signed 360 new customers during the third quarter, and its ASP rose more than 40% year over year. It also had two key product announcements.One of the products, Services Resource Planning, joins ERP and PSA in enabling project-based businesses to run their entire business life cycle — including project management, resource management and time-and-expense management — in a unified solution, according to a note from FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi.The other new product, SuiteGL, ""adds a general ledger component to NetSuite,"" Seyrafi said. ""And later this year, NetSuite will roll out its next-generation user interface.""Meanwhile, NetSuite's $50.5 million buyout in July of Venda, a London-based e-commerce company, gives it a chance to expand its footprint in Europe, Gianola says.""We acquired a a great team of people, a great product and great customers,"" she said.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect NetSuite to post full-year EPS growth of 27% in 2014 and 42% in 2015.

1892,CRM,"""No other top 10 software company is growing faster,"" he said.Salesforce.com's ride in the cloud has hit a speed bump.Company shares were down 4% in after-hours trading Wednesday after the enterprise software company's fiscal Q4 2015 EPS and revenue outlook missed Wall Street views, as did its fiscal 2016 sales guidance.Salesforce (CRM), however, beat views with its EPS and sales for its fiscal Q3 ended Oct. 31.The conservative guidance, particularly for 2016, could be the company being cautious or a warning sign — it's too early to tell, says Kirk Materne, an analyst for Evercore Partners.""Seeing them start with a somewhat conservative outlook for fiscal 2016 isn't a total surprise, but it will create some questions about whether there is a real deceleration here or is the company being somewhat conservative,"" Materne told IBD.Salesforce.com is the No. 1 vendor of customer relationship management software. In recent years, it's moved into new areas such as marketing services to fuel its growth. Last month, Salesforce launched a data analytics software product that will compete with fast-growing rivals Tableau Software (DATA) and Qlik Technologies (QLIK).The proven necessity of Salesforce's core sales management product, which competes with offerings from Oracle (ORCL), SAP (SAP) and others, positions Salesforce for further growth opportunities, says Steven Ashley, an analyst for Robert W. Baird & Co.""A (company's) sales force needs to have a computer tool to record their interactions with their clients, keep a record and also project the business, what deals are in the pipeline, what is going on,"" Ashley told IBD. ""Every company needs this.""Salesforce has also been able to stay ahead of Oracle and SAP, which have scrambled to offer CRM and other software services in the Internet cloud, says J. Derrick Wood, an analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group.""Salesforce has made themselves the defacto standard in CRM, so it's going to be tough for Oracle or SAP to make a big dent on Salesforce given the strong lead they have taken in the market,"" Wood told IBD.For Q3, Salesforce reported earnings per share minus items of 14 cents, up 56% from 9 cents in the year-earlier period. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected 13 cents.Revenue rose 29% to $1.38 billion, where analysts had expected $1.37 billion.For the current quarter ending on or near Jan. 31, Salesforce expects EPS ex items of 13 cents to 14 cents, up 86% to 100%, on sales of $1.436 billion to $1.441 billion, up 25% to 26%.Analysts had modeled 14 cents and $1.45 billion.For fiscal 2016, Salesforce expects revenue of $6.45 billion to $6.5 billion, vs. analyst views of $6.655 billion.The company is working through ""an extremely tough foreign exchange environment"" that impacted its outlook and Q3, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in a conference call with analysts.But Benioff also said Q3 results show demand is not a problem.""No other top 10 software company is growing faster,"" he said.

1948,CRM,"Oracle's road to the cloud is getting smoother, but more than a few potholes remain.Analysts have offered mixed assessments of the database leader since its annual OpenWorld conference Sept. 28-Oct. 2, where executives discussed new products in data analytics and mobile, along with moves to help the firm transition from a license model to a cloud subscription model in order to compete with Salesforce.com (CRM), Workday (WDAY), SAP (SAP) and others.Oracle (ORCL) has some momentum, thanks to new cloud products such as platform-as-a-service middleware, 54% year-over-year cloud-based bookings growth in its fiscal Q1 ended Aug. 31 and a sales team that has expanded over the last few years, said J. Derrick Wood, an analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group, in a report this month. He rates Oracle stock as positive.""We feel the bulk of the product and sales force investments around the cloud are complete,"" he wrote. ""We think Oracle is positioned to stabilize the one area that has caused most of the execution challenges in recent quarters, which should lead to improvements in overall growth execution.""Oracle's cloud revenue is growing fast, but it's still a small part of overall revenue.Oracle's missing Wall Street estimates the past two consecutive quarters has given investors pause, Rick Sherlund, an analyst for Nomura Securities, said in a research report this month. But he maintains a buy rating on the company.""Investors may be losing confidence in the pivot to the cloud,"" he wrote. ""We think it will be more a function of time to move the tanker after a late start to the cloud ... and Big Data.""Oracle is the No. 1 maker of database software, which comprises about half of its revenue. At OpenWorld, Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison said that the company fully expects to transition its database market share to the cloud.But some observers, including Karl Keirstead, an analyst for Deutsche Bank, aren't so sure. He has a hold rating on Oracle stock.""While Larry Ellison claimed that cloud database access could end up as Oracle's largest cloud offering, and while we concur that the data/business intelligence stack is now slowly moving to the cloud, we're not convinced that the database-as-a-service will be a material revenue source for some time,"" he wrote in a report.Oracle's cloud revenue accounted for only 5.5% of total revenue in Q1. But the company says that its software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service revenue rose 32% from the year-earlier period, while its infrastructure-as-a-service revenue rose 26%.Still, company executives have conceded that it could take three years to shift from the license model, where the company gets the bulk of its revenue upfront, to a subscription format, where it collects revenue monthly.The company aims to turn every annual $1 of support revenue related to its license agreements into $2.50 to $3 of annual subscription revenue in the cloud.Investors need patience, because Oracle is still far more entrenched in its license model than the cloud, Michael Turits, an analyst for Raymond James, said in a report this month while maintaining an outperform rating on Oracle stock.""The cloud is clearly a work in progress ... with organic cloud (software-as-a-service/platform-as-a-service) revenue growing an improved but still underwhelming 10% year-over-year by our calculation last quarter,"" he wrote.Oracle is creating a one-stop shop with new offerings in the cloud, including data analytics, mobile and database products.But it might not have enough offerings to be that one-stop shop, Daniel Ives, an analyst for FBR Capital Markets, said in a report, though he rates the stock outperform.""We believe the company will need to improve execution and become more aggressive on the M&A front, as it is clear from its recent soft fiscal Q1 2015/fiscal Q2 2015 guidance that it needs to bulk up its product portfolio, e.g., cloud, Big Data and cybersecurity,"" he wrote.

He has a neutral rating on Salesforce stock.""We don't expect Wave to be functionally competitive with Tableau's (DATA) sophisticated (but also intuitive) visualizations any time soon, but we think Salesforce's initial product can appeal to existing customers who want simple charts for mobile devices,"" he wrote. ""There's likely a market opportunity, but the company will have to lower its price point as it gains more experience with marketing, deploying, and scaling the service.""Koenig believes Wave could bring in $150 million in annual revenue (between 2% and 4% of total revenue) within a couple of years. ""Additional upside would depend on seeing mass adoption outside of (Salesforce's existing customer) base,"" he wrote.Salesforce stock was up 4.5% in midday trading in the stock market today.Company acquisitions could be a deciding factor in the its share price in the coming months, Koenig says.""We don't expect big moves in Salesforce shares, unless the company makes a large, questionable acquisition (which we don't expect, at least this year),"" he wrote.RELATED:Salesforce CEO Benioff, And Beach Boys, Highlight Dreamforce.

1950,CRM,"Before founding software company Veeva Systems in 2007, Peter Gassner was certain of two things.He wanted the technology to be cloud-based and to address critical issues for a specific industry.

I knew there was a massive need for good cloud solutions,"" he told IBD.Turned out to be a good idea —Veeva (VEEV) is one of the most successful cloud-based software companies around. Not only has revenue been growing in double digits, it's also profitable.""Cloud companies are usually growing but not usually profitable,"" said Gassner, who is Veeva's CEO. ""We know who we are making products for. It's not a guessing game. So we can have lower sales and marketing costs.""It helped that co-founder and president Matt Wallach built the life science business at Siebel Systems, since acquired by Oracle (ORCL).""He had relationships with all these pharmaceutical companies and said, 'Here's a better version,'"" said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities. ""A lot of (Veeva's) business is replacing old Siebel systems.""Building SteamVeeva has more than 200 pharmaceutical and biotech customers. They include more than 30 of the 50 largest drug companies worldwide, and range from drug giants such as Merck (MRK), Novartis (NVS) and Eli Lilly (LLY) to emerging biotech outfits.One of Veeva's customers is Gilead Sciences (GILD), the maker of Hepatitis-C wonder drugs. Gilead has been buying more products from Veeva as it grows and expands worldwide, Gassner says.With plenty of customers, Veeva keeps expanding coverage, or users, in those companies and selling them more add-on modules.""That is driving growth and it is why Veeva has high margins,"" Barnicle said. And ""unlike Salesforce.com (CRM), they don't have to grab new customers. They're going to the same customer and selling them more.""Gassner has key contacts from a past employer. He was senior VP of technology at Salesforce.com, charged with building its software-as-a service, or SaaS, platform.CRM Software Drives RevenueVeeva's core Customer Relationship Management, or CRM, software is built on the Salesforce.com platform.""Veeva is Salesforce.com's preferred partner for pharma and biotech,"" Gassner said. ""We are a sales channel for Salesforce.com and a partner.""CRM software accounts for about 90% of Veeva's revenue, which is expected to top $300 million this year.According to research firm Gartner, CRM software revenue worldwide grew in double digits in 2012 and 2013. Moreover, vertical or industry-specific software comprised the largest segment of the enterprise software market, at $107 billion, or 26% of the total.Most of that software is still focused on client servers rather than the cloud, or Internet, Gassner says. ""We're bringing it from client servers to the cloud. There's tremendous opportunity and we're just at the early stage of it.""Veeva's revenue in fiscal 2013 grew 111% to $129.5 million and 62% in to $210.2 million in fiscal 2014, which ended in January.Revenue in the second quarter, which ended July 31, rose 53% to $75.7 million.Net income in the quarter jumped 69% to $12.4 million, or 9 cents per share. Though the company went public in October 2013, it figured EPS in the earlier period amounted to the equivalent of 6 cents a share.Veeva's stock is up more than 40% from its IPO price of 20. After rising at first, shares dipped to 17 in May. But they rebounded sharply after Q2 results were announced on Aug. 28. That day, the company raised its forecast for the full year to $300-$303 million from $277-$282 million previously.Per-share earnings guidance for the year was upped to 30-31 cents from 26-28 cents. Analysts expect Veeva's earnings to come in at 31 cents, for a 35% gain over last year. They see growth of 23% and 32% the next two years, according to Thomson Reuters.Managing Clinical TrialsManagement said the firm made ""great progress"" in the quarter on a second product category called Veeva Vault.Veeva built its own infrastructure for Vault, which focuses on content management for processes such as clinical trials, quality management, manufacturing and sales and marketing.More than 10 new Vault customers were added in Q2, including the second top-10 drug company that signed on for Vault's clinical trial product.""It's the fastest part of the business,"" Barnicle said of Vault. Similar to how Veeva's CRM software replaces Siebel's, Vault is replacing the ""old content management systems"" used in life sciences, Barnicle says.Tracking More DataVeeva's third and newest product line is called Network, a cloud-based solution integrated into the firm's CRM platform to help customers track data on their health care customers.William Blair analysts estimate that Vault and Network offerings could expand Veeva's market opportunity from roughly $700 million to as much as $3.8 billion. The upper target was based on expansion potential of its Network database to other regions of the world beyond the U.S. and China.Veeva's largest market is in the U.S., followed by Western Europe and Asia — especially China and Japan.William Blair analysts expect Veeva's revenue to reach $1 billion by the end of 2020.Veeva is far from the only company offering health care-specific technology. But the William Blair analysts said in their recent initiation report on Veeva that the ""vast majority"" offer on-premises products or use an isolated or single-client hosting model.""We believe these legacy vendors will lose the innovation, speed to market and price battles,"" they wrote.One chief rival is Cegedim, a global tech and services firm focused on health care. Cegedim's CRM business is being acquired by IMS Health (IMS). William Blair estimates that around 40% of Cegedim's seats use on-premises technology.Gassner sees the pending acquisition as a positive for Veeva. ""There will be disruption and we will benefit from that,"" he said.

"
1977,CRM,"SAN FRANCISCO — Salesforce.com's future keeps getting cloudier, and in the fast-changing software field, that's a good thing.Having rolled out one software ""cloud"" after another at its annual Dreamforce conference the past few years, the software-as-a-service company's latest cloud software product seeks to cash in on the analytics wave that's engulfing the business world.This, in fact, is the name of its new analytics cloud: Wave. And to pound the point home, the thousands gathered in San Francisco's Moscone Center to hear Salesforce (CRM) CEO Marc Benioff's keynote speech Tuesday were first treated to a performance by — you guessed it — The Beach Boys. More than 145,000 people had registered for the growing conference.The idea behind Wave is to let companies deliver real-time data from any source to each employee's device of choice. Companies can use Wave to build applications that display data graphically and let users click on the visualizations to drill deeper quickly. They can also manipulate how the data are displayed, using the now-pervasive touch interface to quickly convert, say, a vertical bar chart into a horizontal bar chart or a pie chart.The goal is that employees gain much more access to and control over data. Salesforce's marketing refers to Wave as ""analytics for the rest of us.""""Analytics is no longer a domain for people with multiple degrees and mastery of statistics,"" Benioff said in his keynote. ""This is the platform that lets business use information in a way that matters.""It also is designed to let businesses use information much faster by removing the data gatekeepers that have normally controlled access. That potential for increased agility is critical, John Sabino, a General Electric (GE) executive, said in a video testimonial shown during Benioff's keynote.""We have to be able to react at the speed of thought,"" Sabino said.That's a challenge facing businesses today. As the workplace becomes more mobile-device-centric and data collection accelerates, the opportunity to put data to work in contexts where it has the most value is enormous.""The demand for self-service analytics is sweeping across every business function as end users demand relevant business insights delivered at the right time to the increase their competitiveness and make decisions that positively impact revenues,"" Dan Vesset, an analyst at research firm IDC, says in Salesforce's press release.IDC projects the worldwide business analytics market, which generated $37.7 billion in sales during 2013, to reach $59.2 billion by 2018. And Cisco Systems (CSCO) estimates annual global data center traffic to reach 7.7 zettabytes — or enough to stream 18 months of continuous music to every person on Earth — by 2017, nearly triple 2012.""We need a breakthrough when it comes to data,"" Benioff said. ""It's a huge opportunity for a wave of innovation.""And yes, as the Beach Boys' appearance indicated, the pun was intended.Salesforce also announced a reboot of its year-old Salesforce1 mobile application-development platform — which, Benioff said, 84,000 companies now use. Salesforce designed its new version, Lightning, to let companies build mobile applications faster than they can with the current Salesforce1.""Everyone's building mobile apps,"" said Benioff. ""We have to get everything running on these devices as soon as possible. And that's not enough — we have to build faster than ever before.""Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetranke, the German bottling and distribution subsidiary of the soft-drink giant, has used Salesforce1 to build mobile apps that make an array of data available to salespeople, customers and the distribution channel. Those apps have made the company more connected and collaborative, but even more rapid development would be welcome, the firm's CEO, Ulrik Nehammer, told Benioff's keynote audience.""Customer service is all about being fast,"" Nehammer said.Most components of Lighting are set to be available by February.Also, Salesforce deepened its partnership with Microsoft (MSFT). The two companies will release joint products in 2015 for using Salesforce1 to build Windows Mobile apps, exposing Microsoft Office documents within Salesforce apps and letting data flow freely between Salesforce and Microsoft's Excel.

LinkedIn stock was up 3%, near 213 on the stock market today .LinkedIn, the social networking site for professionals, introduced Sales Navigator for Enterprises in August, with new functionality compared with prior versions. The platform was initially introduced in early 2012. It's a tool for sales professionals to access connections and information in the LinkedIn platform. The updated version integrates with Salesforce.com (CRM) and the mobile app for the Apple (AAPL) operating system.""The product emphasizes the concept of 'social selling', the use of social media to find potential clients, understand their needs, and engage them with warm introductions,"" Blackledge wrote in the report. ""Based on our work, there is a high correlation between salespeople effectively using social selling techniques and outperforming quotas and peers.""LinkedIn reversed concerns about slowing growth when it reported Q2 earnings on July 31. Q2 revenue rose 47% from the year-earlier quarter to $534 million. Earnings per share minus items climbed 34% to 51 cents, both ahead of consensus estimates. LinkedIn also raised Q3 and full-year guidance above the consensus estimates.Sales Navigator accounted for $25 million in Q2 revenue. Blackledge estimates Sales Navigator will account for $121 million in revenue this year, and will grow 129% in 2015 to $278 million.For Q3, the consensus revenue estimate on LinkedIn is $556.9 million. That would be an increase of 42% from the same quarter a year ago.

2001,CRM,"Tableau Software might be facing its toughest test as new rivals Salesforce.com and IBM try to challenge the company in the fast-growing data analytics software market.Tableau Software (DATA) has emerged as a leading provider of data analytics software that helps companies better analyze sales and other data in easy-to-read charts.Until the widespread selloff that hit the tech sector this year, the stock zoomed early and often as the company reported beat-and-raise quarters with high double-digit year-over-year revenue growth like clockwork.In its second quarter, Tableau reported revenue growth of 82% and earnings per share minus items of 5 cents. Analysts had expected revenue growth of 60% and a loss of 3 cents per share. But new products from Salesforce.com (CRM) and IBM (IBM) could give Tableau more competition.IBM announced a new visual data analytics software product on Sept. 16. Salesforce is expected to debut a similar product this month during its annual Dreamforce conference, planned for Oct. 13-16.Meanwhile, Tableau is preparing new products and expanding offshore to better compete with another competitor, Qlik Technologies (QLIK), which is much stronger outside the U.S., says J. Derrick Wood, an analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group.""IBM (in October) is going to make a big announcement with the new data visualization product called Watson analytics and then you have the speculation that Salesforce is going to announce their own analytics cloud product — a brand new product in analytics,"" he told IBD. ""There is no doubt that it's a hot space and Tableau is the leader, but you have got a lot of new products entering the market and maybe they create a more challenging competitive backdrop.""Competitive IntelligenceBut Tableau isn't too concerned about noise from existing or new rivals, says Francois Ajenstat, the company's senior director of product management.""Over the last four to five years most of the large enterprise vendors — SAP (SAP), Microsoft (MSFT), IBM — have all been introducing products and capabilities that are trying to mimic what Tableau has done,"" he told IBD. ""They are playing catch-up in this market.""Tableau and its new rivals are scrambling to grab a piece of what is becoming a fast-growing market.By 2018, global sales of business analytics software will reach $59.2 billion, up about 57% from 2013, says market tracker IDC.Tableau sells software that can be deployed on a single desktop, on company servers and in the cloud.The company now appears to be putting more focus on enterprise-level deals that would allow it to better compete with Qlik, Wood says.""They have focused a lot on the desktop side and not much on the server side, and that is kind of where they are lacking and where Qlik Tech differentiates,"" he said.Wood says deploying the software on servers helps give more people in a company access to data so the information can be checked by multiple departments at once, in order to address issues such as regulatory compliance.""When people start getting a lot bigger with Tableau they don't have that compliance support on the back end that really addresses IT needs, and that is what Qlik has already been better at,"" he said.Ajenstat doesn't agree, noting that in Q2 Tableau reported 157 transactions over $100,000, up 96% from the year-earlier quarter.Transactions of that size are a good barometer of Tableau's success in the enterprise market, Ajenstat says.""Our growth in enterprise deployments has been going extremely well, but we definitely have to educate the marketplace more about the fact that we can, in fact, grow our sales model,"" he said.Tableau stock gained in early September and now trades around 69, down 1% for the year but off 33% from a peak of 102.37 on Feb. 26. Tableau got caught in the widespread tech sell-off that smacked several other high-growth but often marginally profitable software companies, including ServiceNow (NOW) and Splunk (SPLK).Agility In The EnterpriseInvestors are responding to Tableau's ability to target more large companies on a wider scale on the server level, says Daniel Ives, an analyst for FBR Capital Markets.""There is a sense on the Street that they are able to move further up the enterprise, they are able to expand their product portfolio and that really is going to help them continue to show this fast-paced top line growth for the next few years,"" he told IBD.Tableau is also stepping up its offshore expansion even as the company is already demonstrating consistent growth outside the U.S.With the company investing in the future of its business abroad this year, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters on average expect Tableau to show a loss of two cents per share for full-year 2014, after 31 cents EPS in 2013. Then, in 2015, EPS is seen ramping to 18 cents, and in 2016 to 54 cents.International business accounts for about 22% of revenue at Tableau vs. 65% at Qlik, which has its official headquarters in Pennsylvania and was founded in Sweden.However, Tableau's international revenue has more than doubled for the last five quarters, showing that the company is quickly becoming a formidable rival to Qlik, says Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst for FBN Securities, in an Aug. 1 report.""We see Tableau as a growing threat to Qlik's international business,"" he wrote.And with year-over-year revenue growth of 82% to 95% in its last four quarters, there's no reason to believe Tableau will give up its lead anytime soon, Ives says.""Tableau continues to be a clear leader in the market that has helped to define the space, and they still have a long runway where they are the only plane taking off into the Big Data opportunity,"" he said.

Older methods — including cold calls, spam email, popup ads and other forms of disruptive advertising — have been increasingly rendered ineffective by consumers with call blocking and Internet filters. Consumers are recording TV shows and speeding past commercials. Traditional methods of advertising are having less influence on consumer buying decisions, according to HubSpot.""People no longer live, work, shop and buy as they did a decade ago,"" HubSpot CEO Brian Halligan told IBD. ""People now live in a social media world, a world of Google search and the blogosphere. About 70-80% of the consumer decision process happens online, which is a radical shift in the way people used to shop and buy.""Customers are increasingly selecting their own communication channels, relying heavily on the Internet and social media.HubSpot provides a cloud-based sales and marketing software-as-a-service (Saas) platform designed to help businesses generate customer leads and turn them into sales. Applications provided by HubSpot let businesses monitor, publish and track social media across Facebook (FB), LinkedIn (LNKD), Twitter (TWTR) and Google (GOOGL).

""It's a large market, and there will be more than one winner. HubSpot does a good job of standing out in the crowd.""Rivals include Marketo (MKTO), which went public last year. Other companies offering products and services in this field include Adobe Systems (ADBE), Oracle (ORCL) and Salesforce.com (CRM).HubSpot says that it has more than 11,620 customers in 70 countries. It uses a subscription model, with customers paying an average of $8,823 per year, HubSpot said.It targets businesses with 10 to 2,000 employees. Halligan says HubSpot's platform has increased sales leads of its customers by five times their average per month.Despite the fast growth, the company is not yet profitable. For the six months ended June 30, HubSpot revenue rose 46% from the year-earlier period to $51.3 million. But it reported a net loss of $17.7 million. It spent $33 million on sales and marketing, and $9.6 million on research and development.It's common for young companies, especially those in the SaaS field, to spend heavily, looking for a big payoff down the road.""It's a land grab,"" Halligan said, ""and we want to get as many customers as we can.""Adams said HubSpot estimates it will turn a profit by the end of 2016.""Software subscriptions typically take several years to become profitable on any given deal,"" wrote research firm IPO Boutique in a report, adding that it's the same with Marketo.

2075,CRM,"Oracle's conversion from a longtime software licensor into a cloud software vendor won't happen overnight.
"
2076,CRM,"The database leader must transition a salesforce long used to a system in which big companies and other enterprises pay upfront for one-year or longer licenses to use the software, which customers maintain in their own data centers on their own servers.
"
2077,CRM,"In the cloud software-as-a-service (SaaS) model, users pay monthly for what they need, and the vendor often maintains the software on its data centers, relaying software to customers via the Internet cloud.
"
2078,CRM,"For a big, long-entrenched licensed-software seller such as Oracle (ORCL), the transition will be monumental, says Michael Turits, an analyst for Raymond James & Associates.
"
2079,CRM,"""It takes a lot to turn the battleship and transition a legacy (software) company into a cloud company,"" Turits told IBD. ""We believe they are hiring people to focus on cloud sales and that the incentive structure"" is being altered to speed the transition.

2083,CRM,"The shift could take Oracle another three years, wrote Susan Anthony, an analyst for Mirabaud Securities, in a June 20 research report.
"
2084,CRM,"""As the shift takes place, the software vendors' new license revenues will ... be replaced to some extent by the cloud-subscription model, which within three years will match the revenues that would have been generated by the equivalent perpetual license and, over five years, contribute significantly more,"" she wrote.

2087,CRM,"""Oracle, like other traditional, on-premise software vendors, will be financially disadvantaged over the short term as its upfront on-premise license revenues are cannibalized by the recurring cloud-based revenues,"" he wrote in a June 25 research note. ""Therefore, we model expected license revenues to be flat to down for the next two years (during) the transition.""
"
2088,CRM,"Sherlund and Anthony's analysis dovetails with comments made by Oracle CEO Larry Ellison during a June 19 conference call to discuss earnings for fiscal Q4, which ended May 31.
"
2089,CRM,"""During the transition selling those cloud subscriptions, what could have been a license is now recognized over time, so we are going to recognize the revenue more slowly,"" Ellison said.

2094,CRM,"Some investors hope that Oracle's 12c database, launched in July 2013, will spark its cloud business, says Daniel Ives, an analyst for FBR Capital Markets. The product aims to help users consolidate databases in the cloud.

2095,CRM,"""There are signs of optimism, but over the next six months Oracle will need to prove themselves in order for investors to further buy into the cloud story,"" Ives told IBD.

2096,CRM,"With its Q4 earnings, Oracle for the first time released some details about its cloud revenue. It said that its combined SaaS and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) revenues rose 25% from the year-earlier period to $322 million, far outpacing the company's overall revenue growth of 3%, which included flat software license revenue.
"
2097,CRM,"SaaS includes customer relationship management software, while PaaS is middleware.
"
2098,CRM,"The company said that its infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) revenue rose 13%, to $128 million. Saas, PaaS and IaaS are the three main cogs of cloud computing.

"
2102,CRM,"Oracle briefed analysts last month at its Redwood City, Calif., headquarters about its move to the cloud. Oracle valued total annual cloud industry revenue at $74 billion.
"
2103,CRM,"At the meeting, President Safra Catz downplayed the challenges of the transition, Sherlund says.

2104,CRM,"""Catz emphasized that the transition to the cloud may be less disruptive than we may have assumed in our model of license revenues (flat to down over the next two years), given that the existing business has a long tail with renewal of large enterprise license agreements, and (she) did not subscribe to the view that the existing business would decline,"" he wrote.
"
2105,CRM,"Oracle's beefed-up sales staff might help ease the transition. Sherlund says that the company appears to have fixed sales issues that had slowed its transition. The move to a cloud model from a license model marks a major change in the compensation system for sales staff.

2120,CRM,"More tech companies are donating more dollars and expertise to nonprofit causes.It's a clear trend, says Daryl Brewster, who heads CECP, an organization that promotes and measures corporate charity.CECP looked at 19 tech companies from 2010 to 2013. It found that 11 had increased their giving in that span by a combined 30%, Brewster says.New York City-based CECP, formerly known as the Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy, was founded by actor Paul Newman in 1999. The organization is made of more than 150 executives who run companies with aggregate annual revenue of $7 trillion.Tech companies comprise about 10% of the membership. They include Salesforce.com (CRM), Microsoft (MSFT) and Cisco Systems (CSCO).""Our purpose is really to help advance society through business,"" Brewster said. ""We think societal improvement is an outcome businesses should be judged on.""Contributions from tech businesses can include money, software and hardware, and employee time and technical know-how.When they open their wallets, tech companies often give to education, Brewster says. He says that giving targets include K-3 education, financial literacy, international literacy and STEM — science, technology, engineering and math.Last month, Facebook (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, announced a $120 million donation over five years to schools in the San Francisco Bay Area. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, with hands-on leadership by Microsoft's chairman and his wife, is the nation's largest.Other Bay-Area tech companies are donating millions to SF Gives, an initiative of Tipping Point Community. The philanthropic foundation locates, vets and funds organizations that fight poverty in the Bay Area, says founder and CEO Daniel Lurie.Salesforce.com founder Marc Benioff called Tipping Point in February to discuss how the region's tech community could be inspired to give back, Lurie says.That was the start of SF Gives, now a group of 20 tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), LinkedIn (LNKD) and Zynga (ZNGA).SF Gives donors have pledged a total of $10 million to go to Tipping Point, which will distribute the money to charities in its portfolio.Lurie is pleased. It's a critical time in the region, he says. Silicon Valley may be the center of tech-created wealth, but many in the area are on the outside looking in.""We have a tremendous amount of wealth being created, but there are far too many individuals and families not participating in this economic boom,"" Lurie said.Tech companies in general now understand the depth of the economic hardship that many in the Bay Area face, he says.""There's an understanding and a level of commitment from these tech companies over the last few months that I hadn't seen before,"" Lurie said. ""This really makes me hopeful and optimistic.""Google (GOOGL), which has been a focus of anti-tech sentiment in San Francisco, is a member of SF Gives.Critics say that well-to-do techies displace long-term residents. Google in particular has been vilified for what some call a tone-deaf move of having its sleek black buses with tinted windows pick up employees in poorer neighborhoods.Following criticism, Google stated in February that it intends to cover in-city public transportation costs for low- and moderate-income students at a cost of $6.8 million over two years.Google made a one-time gift of $1 million to SF Gives in April, says Jacquelline Fuller, director of Google.org, the company's philanthropic arm.The company and its employees have several philanthropic goals, she says. ""No. 1, especially here in the Bay Area where we have our headquarters, we want to be a good citizen where we live and work,"" Fuller said.Another goal is to support local nonprofits, she says. Yet another is to provide a good example to tech colleagues. ""We want to help inspire other companies to help and give,"" Fuller said.Google gives more than $100 million each year to nonprofits and schools worldwide, she says. It also donates by giving away some products and apps, and by providing employee expertise in areas such as coding and marketing.Tech philanthropy can be a natural outgrowth of what a company already does.In New York City, marketing analytics company SumAll has allocated 10% of its equity to a separate nonprofit, SumAll.org.Nonprofits generally don't have the access to methods of measuring their work's impact that businesses do. But the same client-seeking techniques used by many companies are used by SumAll.org to identify families in New York City that are likely to become homeless, says SumAll.org Executive Director Stefan Heeke.""This is a powerful method to identify families likely to become homeless or other at-risk populations,"" Heeke said. SumAll.org's data include eviction notices, locations, income and demographics.The nonprofit's analytics have also been put to work on human trafficking statistics and the increasing female death rate in Syria.When he talks about SumAll.org, Heeke echoes the view of tech philanthropists of all kinds. ""I have a business background, and I saw the power of data and technology,"" Heeke said. ""I wanted to see them applied in a different context.""

""But Boston Properties is pretty exceptional with its operational strategy in how it leases and manages its portfolio.""The company's decentralized operations encourage collaboration and localized decision-making. Some large real estate firms, by contrast, miss opportunities by imposing a rigid, hierarchical structure.""Boston Properties has regional heads who each own their market,"" Toti said. ""That facilitates excellent strategy execution. Its regional heads are more visible as part of the company's leadership, and they're more empowered to make decisions.""Some REITs revolve around a charismatic builder with a singular vision. But at Boston Properties, its deep bench of executives works together to pounce on opportunities.""It's a team culture,"" Toti said. ""And (CEO) Owen Thomas is a team-oriented leader who seems like a good fit for the company and its culture.""

"
2152,CRM,"Investors had an unpleasant surprise for ServiceNow after the fast-growing enterprise software company released Q1 earnings late on April 23 that easily beat Wall Street expectations. The company also provided a stronger-than-expected outlook for the current quarter.Yet ServiceNow stock fell more than 6% on April 24, and fell the following two days as well.The investor reaction perplexed ServiceNow (NOW) CEO Frank Slootman, whose company is taking share from larger rivals including CA Technologies (CA) and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) in IT service management software.""I don't think in all my years of doing this kind of thing that have I ever seen anything remotely close to it,"" Slootman told IBD . ""It all goes under the motto of 'no good deed goes unpunished.' Investor sentiment is in turmoil right now and it really has nothing to do with our business or our company.""ServiceNow's results, with sales up 62% from the year-earlier quarter, were exceptional, says Matthew Hedberg, an analyst for RBC Capital Markets.""They couldn't have done much more in the quarter,"" he said.But ServiceNow wasn't alone.Highflying software companies such as Tableau Software (DATA), Splunk (SPLK), Workday (WDAY) and Salesforce.com (CRM) have seen their stocks dive this year despite strong quarterly earnings and outlooks.Shares of ServiceNow were down 9% this year through Tuesday before rallying 16% the rest of the week. Salesforce's stock has declined 6%. Tableau, a fast grower in the data analytics market, is down 12% this year. Workday, a leader in the human capital management market, is down 3%. The Nasdaq composite index is up 3.5%.High ValuationsInvestors generally appear to be nervous about the high valuations in the sector — all of the above companies are in the red except Salesforce — rather than any specific fundamental issues, says Kirk Materne, an analyst for Evercore Partners. Also, the young software stocks tend to move up and down more greatly than older legacy software stocks, he points out.""It's more of a general nervousness around some of the higher beta stocks and tech in general,"" he said.Older tech stalwarts such as Oracle (ORCL), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT) and HP are up this year despite recent quarters with decelerating or declining sales and EPS.Investors are placing a higher premium on size and stability rather than fast growth — for now, says Karl Keirstead, an analyst for Deutsche Bank.""You are seeing a growth-to-value rotation,"" he said. ""What is hurting Workday is the flipside of what is helping Oracle.""Splunk might the biggest victim among the highflier group.Splunk stock is down 37% this year, after falling 16% the day after its recent Q1 earnings soundly beat views.The magnitude of Splunk's sell-off is out of the company's hands, says Brian White, an analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald.""It's the cycle of the stock, the stock is in a bad mood,"" White said. ""There was really nothing in the (Q1) report that wasn't good. It was a very solid report.""Splunk raised its revenue forecast for the year from $400 million to $402 million-$410 million. Analysts had modeled for $406.9 million, slightly above Splunk's midpoint.The company's forecast could be construed as light, but there likely are bigger forces at work, says J. Derrick Wood, an analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group.""The shorts are winning over the longs right now,"" he said. ""The issue there is a re-evaluation for these high-growth assets. Where that value should fall is what the market is trying to figure out.""Prior to the sell-off, on Feb. 26 Tableau's stock reached an all-time high of 101.86 a share, or 13 times above the $476.2 million that analysts polled by Thomson Reuters project for 2015.Workday's peak price of 116.47 on Feb. 27 was roughly 19 times its expected revenue of $1.09 billion for its fiscal year ending on or near Jan. 31, 2016.Splunk's all-time high of 106.15, set on Feb. 28, was 29 times the $547.5 million revenue that analysts had projected for its fiscal year ending on or near Jan. 31, 2016.Those valuations have come down to earth. After Friday's close, Splunk's stock was trading near nine times revenue for its next fiscal year, with Workday at 13.5 times revenue and Tableau at eight times revenue.Over the past 15 years, ""growth company"" stocks have seen a mean average of eight times projected revenue, with anything near 20 among the highest, says Daniel Ives, an analyst for FBR Capital Markets.Those high valuations can make investors nervous, Ives says.""Once they start to sell off, it starts to be like yelling 'fire' in a crowded theater,"" he said.Where Is The Sweet Spot?As Deutsche Bank's Keirstead puts it, investors in cloud software companies are still struggling to find prices they are comfortable with.""You are seeing a re-evaluation of the growth software sector and that is why these stocks are struggling,"" Keirstead said.Legacy vendors, meanwhile, are up despite their own struggles.Oracle, Cisco and Microsoft are each up 11% this year, while HP is up 21%.All four companies are in various stages of some sort of reorganization or reprioritization, looking to recharge growth.Investors are attracted to these companies for varying reasons, Keirstead says.""In the case of Oracle, their total revenue growth rate in the most recent reported quarter was actually the highest in three years,"" he said. ""With HP, some people are enthusiastic about the pace at which they are cutting costs.""

That growth rate is on par with Q4 but better than the earlier six quarters.For the current quarter, the company expects EPS ex items of 11 or 12 cents, up from 9 cents. Analysts had modeled 12 cents.The company expects revenue of $1.285 billion to $1.29 billion, up 34% to 35%, where analysts had been expecting $1.27 billion.Salesforce raised its revenue outlook for the year to $5.3 billion-$5.34 billion, up 30% to 31%, from its previous estimate of $5.25 billion-$5.3 billion. Analysts have estimated $5.29 billion.The company expects EPS ex items of 49 cents to 51 cents, up a penny from its previous forecast, and up from 35 cents last year. Analysts expect 50 cents.In Q1, revenue from professional services and related areas increased 58% to $79.4 million.Deferred revenue rose 34%, to $2.32 billion.Ashley says Salesforce will continue to see faster growth from its services software, which provides customer service data on multiple devices, and its Force.com platform, which lets companies develop software applications for business-related social networking purposes.Salesforce.com's research and development costs jumped 43% to $188.3 million.

"
2208,CRM,"""Those are the people that we replace,"" he said. ""Those are legacy vendors; they are typically not involved in new projects.""ServiceNow (NOW) may have found the ticket to becoming a multibillion-dollar revenue company, but it will put the company in competition with a new and bigger rival.The enterprise software company is expanding its core IT service-management (ITSM) software into new areas, including human resources, sales and marketing departments.Already known as one of the fastest growing companies in the technology space, ServiceNow gave its followers a taste of its new capabilities on April 23 when it reported that 34% of its revenue in Q1 came from outside of its core IT service-management business.Revenues in Q1 grew 62% vs. the year-ago period. The company also expects annual revenue to grow to as much as $657 million this year. That's up 55% from a year ago.But ServiceNow's product expansion could set the company on a much larger growth path in the next few years, says Kirk Materne, an analyst for Evercore Partners.""They can keep growing at those levels just in their core market for the foreseeable future, but it's more important when you look at three to five years down the road in terms of the company developing into a multibillion-dollar revenue company,"" he said.Though the company's core IT service-management market is still growing at a strong pace, it's probably not enough to satisfy the company's desire for additional revenue growth, says J. Derrick Wood, an analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group.""I'm sure they look and say, 'We want to be a $5 billion (a year) revenue company,' and you are probably not going to do that just by being in ITSM,"" he said. ""They have aspirations to be a lot bigger company, and they have built a much broader portfolio to go after new opportunities.""ServiceNow has been growing at the expense of rivals CA (CA), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and others through its core software service, which allows companies with multiple offices to manage information requests among several departments and devices. The company's Internet-based cloud software has become a preferred alternative and replacement for bigger vendors that sell older products through a license model.But ServiceNow appears positioned to grow beyond its core business of providing software to power service desks for IT departments, says Steven Ashley, an analyst for Robert W.

2209,CRM,"Stocks finished Tuesday down for the first time in three days as volume increased on both exchanges. Disappointing earnings reports from key retailers and a Fed governor's warning on interest rates help drag down the indexes.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq dropped 0.7% and the Dow Jones industrial average gave up 0.8%.In the after-hours session, Salesforce.com (CRM) edged higher after the company reported earnings and gave bullish revenue guidance. It reported a loss wider than a year ago, but it beat analysts' expectations. Intuit (INTU) fell 3% in after-hours. Earnings topped expectations but guidance was weak. QuickBooks Online subscribers rose 36% in the quarter to 624,000.In the stock market today, among retailers that disappointed were Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), which lost 18%, and TJX Companies (TJX), which fell 8%.On Wednesday, the minutes of the Fed's April 30 meeting will be released at 2 p.m. ET, perhaps providing clues as to how fast quantitative easing will be unwound and interest rates will rise.The market became nervous and dropped to session lows Tuesday when Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said the central bank's current taper pace may be too slow.The Mortgage Bankers Association will also release its monthly index of mortgage activity at 10 a.m. Crude oil inventories will be released at 1:30 p.m.More retail earnings will be out Wednesday. Reporting will be Lowe's (LOW), PetSmart (PETM), Target (TGT), L Brands (LB) and Williams-Sonoma (WSM).

2210,CRM,"Tech stocks outperformed Monday, but it was a mostly quiet session for the NYSE indexes.Software stocks did most of the heavy lifting, although many of the gains in the sector looked like dead-cat bounces after sharp sell-offs.At the close, the Nasdaq rose 0.9%, the S&P 500 0.4% and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.1%. Preliminary data showed NYSE and Nasdaq volume coming in lower than Friday.In the stock market today, Salesforce.com (CRM) bounced nearly 3% ahead of Tuesday's earnings report. But it's still underneath its 200-day moving average after correcting 28% off its high.In the Nasdaq 100, Apple (AAPL) added 1%. The stock has been making new highs on the heels of reports last week the company is interested in acquiring headphone and music streaming company Beats Electronics for $3.2 billion. Apple's 7-for-1 stock split takes place next month. The record date is June 2. Shares will start trading at the split-adjusted price on June 9.Other big percentage gainers in the Nasdaq 100 included Illumina (ILMN), TripAdvisor (TRIP) and F5 Networks (FFIV). Those stocks seem to be bottoming from their corrections.Meanwhile, after two straight heavy-volume declines on Thursday and Friday, Grifols (GRFS) rallied 3% in heavy volume. It closed just below a buy point of 42.38.In the trucking space, J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT) flirted with a breakout from a cup-with-handle pattern. Shares rose 1%. It came to within 6 cents of a 77.96 buy point.On Tuesday, watch for earnings reports from Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Home Depot (HD) and TJX Companies (TJX).

2211,CRM,"Oracle's deal to acquire Micros Systems hits one of three industries targeted by the software giant to reaccelerate its revenue growth.The enterprise software maker on Monday said it's reached an agreement to acquire Micros Systems (MCRS), a provider of hardware, software and service for hotels, restaurants and retailers, for $5.3 billion, or $68 a share. The pending deal had been reported last week.Oracle (ORCL), the No. 1 database provider, has been scrambling to reinvigorate its growth in the cloud computing era, when instead of paying costly upfront license fees, companies and other enterprises pay a monthly fee for software service as needed.That the transition to the cloud will be tough for Oracle became more apparent last week when its Q4 earnings fell short of Wall Street expectations in a typically strong period for the company.Micros, which would be Oracle's biggest acquisition since Sun Microsystems in January 2010, is in one of the three segments — financial and telecom are the others — the company identified as main targets at its analyst day event last fall, says Brian White, an analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald. He rates Oracle stock a buy.""They have been very clear that they have ambitions to go into these verticals,"" White told IBD. ""(Micros is) one of the lead players in hospitality, retail and restaurants. This is probably an area where (Oracle) can sell a lot of their cloud applications.""Single-Digit GrowthWith Oracle stuck in single-digit revenue growth, acquisitions might be the best way to reaccelerate growth, says Daniel Ives, an analyst for FBR Capital Markets & Co. He rates Oracle stock outperform.""This was a company that was late to the cloud, as was evidenced last week (with its disappointing earnings and guidance) and its inconsistent performance the last few years,"" Ives told IBD. ""They need to fire up the M&A engine.""Acquisitions might be the best way for Oracle to boost its growth, agrees Wedbush Securities analyst Steve Koenig, pointing to the $39 billion in cash and equivalents held by the company. He has a neutral rating on Oracle.""Oracle faces some secular challenges, and growth is becoming pretty minimal,"" Koenig told IBD. ""They have got to acquire companies; they have got to use their balance sheet.""Oracle targeted the telecom segment with last year's $2.1 billion acquisition of Acme Packet, a network gear maker for the telecom industry. Oracle last year also bought Tekelec, a maker of networking software, for an undisclosed price.Based in Columbia, Md., Micros says it has nearly a 10% share of the market for software, hardware and service for the hospitality industry. It pegs total sales of $14.1 billion for the industry last year.Micros had about $1.3 billion in revenue last year.The company says it has more than 567,000 customers and manages more than 330,000 active company systems in over 180 countries.For its fiscal Q3 ended March 31, Micros posted revenue of $348.9 million, up 11% from the year-earlier period, its biggest growth in four quarters. Earning per share minus items rose 16% to 72 cents, its best growth in six quarters.For the current quarter, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect revenue of $360.5 million, up 9.7%, and EPS of 71 cents, up 14.5%.The customer numbers likely attracted Oracle, says Koenig.""It's about acquiring customers,"" he said. ""It helps Oracle move the needle on their growth rate.""Oracle expects the acquisition to close this year.The CRM ArenaMicros also gives Oracle access to another brand of cloud-based customer relationship management software that helps companies improve their work with customers.Oracle has been trailing several rivals in the hospitality and retail cloud segments, Ives says.""Oracle was definitely missing a piece of that market and having difficulty competing with the likes of SAP (SAP), NetSuite (N)and niche players like Demandware (DWRE),"" he said. ""So this bulks up the CRM piece and is a much more vertical focus around retail, a big reason why they are doing this deal.""The combination of Oracle and Micros will provide integrated products to help companies grow, Oracle Co-President Mark Hurd said in a statement.""Oracle has successfully helped customers across multiple industries harness the power of the cloud, mobile, social, Big Data and the Internet of Things to transform their businesses,"" Hurd said. ""We anticipate delivering compelling advantages to companies within the hospitality and retail industries with the acquisition of Micros.""Oracle's cloud acquisitions in recent years include Taleo, RightNow Technologies and Responsys.It acquired Taleo, a maker of talent-based software, for $1.9 billion in 2012.The company bought RightNow, a provider of customer service software, for $1.5 billion in 2012.And it bought Responsys, a maker of cloud marketing software service, for $1.5 billion in December.

2212,CRM,"Information technology professionals these days talk more about clouds than do meteorologists. But in the IT world, clouds refer to cloud computing, where resources are accessed over the Internet and paid for as a service. The Internet cloud is turning enterprise computing on its head, letting new players rise up and forcing incumbent tech companies to adapt. That makes it…
"
2213,CRM,"Corporate America has been moving computing workloads to the cloud more slowly than expected. Equinix aims to change that with Cloud Exchange, a new offering for enterprise customers.Equinix (EQIX), a provider of computer data centers, is expected to lay out more of its Cloud Exchange strategy at its analysts day event in New York on Wednesday. Equinix stock touched a 13-month high Thursday.Data-center operators provide space, power and cooling. Customers pack the centers with their own computer servers and other gear. Equinix also specializes in providing connections to high-speed, fiber-optic networks operated by AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and other telecom services providers. Equinix's customers include some of the biggest cloud-services providers, such as Amazon (AMZN) Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure unit.The biggest users of cloud infrastructure as a service (IaaS) have been small and midsize businesses. Many large companies and other enterprises still process their most important workloads in their own private data centers for security and other reasons.With IaaS prices falling rapidly, though, corporate IT departments are being tempted to move more workloads to shared, public cloud-computing systems.Equinix anticipates that many large companies will adopt a hybrid cloud model that meshes private and public infrastructure. Companies will keep some business apps behind a private corporate firewall and access public IaaS providers for other services.That's where Equinix's Cloud Exchange comes in. It enables large companies to access cloud-computing services as well as cloud-based software products from companies such as Salesforce.com (CRM).To use Cloud Exchange, enterprises buy access to a communications port. It provides high-speed, private connections to cloud-based services. A self-service, automated system lets companies connect to cloud service providers.In 19 Markets By Year-EndEquinix offers Cloud Exchange in 13 markets and plans to expand to 19 markets by year end. Equinix Chief Operating Officer Charles Meyers said at a JPMorgan conference last month that the company has big expectations for Cloud Exchange.""We view the cloud opportunity as essentially the next transformational ecosystem for our business,"" Meyers said. ""We've seen record bookings in cloud, bringing cloud service providers onto the platform over the last several quarters.""He said that Cloud Exchange will give corporate IT departments and chief information officers flexibility in choosing cloud-computing services ""on a workload-by-workload basis.""""Our goal is to essentially enable the CIO to place the workloads into the right infrastructure option flexibly, cost-effectively and efficiently,"" Meyers said. ""By putting a small implementation inside of Equinix sites, you can, in real time, provision workloads to the appropriate infrastructure choice on demand.""Equinix saw Q1 revenue rise 12% to $580 million. Yet it garners only 9% of its revenue from enterprise customers, excluding financial services, analysts say.Demand for data-center space has been driven by the rise of social networking, mobile devices, cloud services, online gaming, computer-based stock trading and more.Equinix Chief Technology Officer Ihab Tarazi has focused on building hybrid cloud products since he came aboard in October, analysts say. Tarazi had been vice president of enterprise network services at Verizon Communications.""Equinix is expanding its product offerings to ease (corporate) deployments using a hybrid cloud model,"" said Adam Ilkowitz, a Nomura Securities analyst, in a research report. ""Cloud Exchange seems especially timely ... . It's early days, but so far Microsoft and AWS have signed on as cloud providers, while TW Telecom (TWTC) and Level 3 (LVLT) are providing connectivity. We expect to hear more about this at the investor day.""Level 3 on Monday announced an agreement to acquire TW Telecom for $5.7 billion, creating a bigger rival for Verizon and AT&T in business and Internet services.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Michael Bowen is upbeat on Cloud Exchange's prospects. ""Equinix estimates that approximately 82% to 84% of IT resources still reside in-house at enterprises, but the pace of cloud adoption is slowly beginning to accelerate,"" Bowen said in a research report this week. ""Cloud Exchange offers customers the ability to eliminate cloud access across the public Internet.""Cloud Exchange (should) have a positive impact on pricing at Equinix as a result of affording enterprises the ability to directly access cloud providers as well as interconnect with other enterprises.""

2224,CRM,"And since 2011, it's been running a project whose name is a demand: More Disruption Please.
"
2225,CRM,"More Disruption Please is a kind of incubator, in which health IT startups pitch Athenahealth (ATHN) on why they offer a value-added service for Athenahealth's clients.
"
2226,CRM,"Athenahealth picks its favorites and makes them available to clients through its network, in a system that's been compared with Apple's (AAPL) App Store.
"
2227,CRM,"Athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush plucked Kyle Armbrester fresh from Harvard Business School to develop the program. Armbrester, vice president of business development, spoke with IBD about how the project began.
"
2228,CRM,"IBD: How did the More Disruption Please concept get started?
"
2229,CRM,"Armbrester: When I came to Athena, we were one of the best technology-enabled services companies in the market. We're very good at building these technology-enabled services like Collector, Clinicals and Communicator.
"
2230,CRM,"But what we noticed was twofold. One, we have a large distribution network with all of these providers and patients that were interconnected. And two, we were never going to be everything to everyone. We were never going to build a product that satisfied every need.
"
2231,CRM,"And there was a fantastic business model from the consumer space of having an open-platform type concept. So we looked to Amazon (AMZN) and Salesforce (CRM) and Facebook (FB) and other titans of technology to take that particular model and align it with our cloud-based infrastructure.
"
2232,CRM,"Our unique spin is that, because we take a percentage of net collection, we don't actually partner with technology companies. We partner with outcomes companies like ourselves. So to be a part of the More Disruption Please program, we give our partner the scorecard, and that scorecard shows how they're either driving more revenue to the doctors for doing the right things, or decreasing operational inefficiencies inside the providers' workflow, or helping to improve patient and provider outcomes.
"
2233,CRM,"There are a few examples of that. We measure things like documentation time — how long the doctor is inside the EMR (electronic medical record). We want them out of the EMR as much as possible. We want them seeing patients, because we win and the doctor wins when that happens.
"
2234,CRM,"We also look at things like charge-entry lag. When each charge gets captured, there's a lag time to when it actually gets put in the system, and there's a delay in payment because of that. So we work with our partners to attack some of these metrics that we know help our doctors perform clinically and financially in the best way possible.
"
2235,CRM,"That's really the crux of the MDP program. We find best-in-breed cloud-based technologies, build free connectivity with them and then help them spread throughout our cloud-based network with our providers.
"
2236,CRM,"IBD: How has your process evolved since you started? Have you learned as you've gone along about selecting the right companies?
"
2237,CRM,"Armbrester: Yes, absolutely. When I showed up, we had no advance connectivity. The process for partnership was pretty ad hoc, and we built custom interfaces. It wasn't really scalable.
"
2238,CRM,"I think the biggest changes have been twofold. One, we've built good awareness around the program inside the industry and inside our client base. Which is important, because our clients look at the MDP label as a mark of distinction for these partners, because they know that Athena is doing our jobs as stewards of the network, making sure that they're driving performance.
"
2239,CRM,"Number two, and my real goal in wanting to come to Athena, is to drive more energy into the health IT space. Right before I decided to go into health IT I wanted to start something else — I always had a technology background — (then) got interested in health through a project I was working on, and quickly realized that the barriers to entry for scaling inside the health IT space were really on the connectivity side.
"
2240,CRM,"You had large client-server systems, by Cerner (CERN) and Allscripts (MDRX) and others, to dominate the landscape, and interfacing with those custom systems in those large silos is impossible. For an entrepreneur to scale something that actually has a meaningful impact on physicians and patients and their workflow is really, really hard. So on a conceptual level, what I bought into with Jon (Bush), was his vision to lower that barrier to entry for entrepreneurs and to, like Justin Timberlake, 'bring sexy back' to HIT (health care IT).
"
2241,CRM,"IBD: Can you give an example of a company you've selected through this process and how that's played out?
"
2242,CRM,"Armbrester: One of our best partners is a company called Entrada. They do cloud-based, real-time speech-to-text, and cloud-based transcription.
"
2243,CRM,"We give these small startup companies five clients right out the gate, and we run a beta (test) process. During the beta process we optimize them, we tweak them, we get the user experience right, we give them a scorecard (and) we measure results. This gives them an ROI (return on investment) that they can then go sell to our clients. They can say, ""Listen, we're moving documentation in time, we're moving same-day encounter close rates, and all these other metrics so you can get paid more quickly and see more patients efficiently.""
"
2244,CRM,"With Entrada, we took them through that process. And after they move out of that, they move into something we call ""generally available."" That means they're open to anybody inside Athena to use.
"
2245,CRM,"We launched them last year, and since then they've signed 45 accounts inside Athena. Some of those accounts have hundreds of doctors, some of them have two to three doctors. They're driving documentation time lower for all those practices.

Right before I decided to go into health IT I wanted to start something else — I always had a technology background — (then) got interested in health through a project I was working on, and quickly realized that the barriers to entry for scaling inside the health IT space were really on the connectivity side.You had large client-server systems, by Cerner (CERN) and Allscripts (MDRX) and others, to dominate the landscape, and interfacing with those custom systems in those large silos is impossible. For an entrepreneur to scale something that actually has a meaningful impact on physicians and patients and their workflow is really, really hard. So on a conceptual level, what I bought into with Jon (Bush), was his vision to lower that barrier to entry for entrepreneurs and to, like Justin Timberlake, 'bring sexy back' to HIT (health care IT).IBD: Can you give an example of a company you've selected through this process and how that's played out?Armbrester: One of our best partners is a company called Entrada. They do cloud-based, real-time speech-to-text, and cloud-based transcription.We give these small startup companies five clients right out the gate, and we run a beta (test) process. During the beta process we optimize them, we tweak them, we get the user experience right, we give them a scorecard (and) we measure results. This gives them an ROI (return on investment) that they can then go sell to our clients. They can say, ""Listen, we're moving documentation in time, we're moving same-day encounter close rates, and all these other metrics so you can get paid more quickly and see more patients efficiently.""With Entrada, we took them through that process. And after they move out of that, they move into something we call ""generally available."" That means they're open to anybody inside Athena to use.We launched them last year, and since then they've signed 45 accounts inside Athena. Some of those accounts have hundreds of doctors, some of them have two to three doctors. They're driving documentation time lower for all those practices. It's been fantastic to see them transform from a very small startup into a company that has dozens and dozens of clients in less than a year's time.

2249,CRM,"Stocks hit record highs during the holiday-shortened week. Black Friday kicked off holiday shopping, while several retailers reported earnings, including Lowe's (LOW) and Dollar Tree (DLTR), along with tech giants Salesforce.com (CRM), HP Inc. (HPQ) and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE). The Justice Department moved to block the AT&T (T)-Time Warner (TWX) merger, while the FCC signaled it'll pare back net neutrality rules. Marvell Technology (MRVL) agreed to buy Cavium (CAVM) for $6 billion.X The Nasdaq rose 1.6% while the S&P 500 and Dow climbed 0.9%, all setting all-time highs. Higher oil prices lifted energy stocks while Apple (AAPL) had solid gains and the Marvell-Cavium deal kept chips rallying. Earnings were mixed, with Salesforce, HP, HPE falling on results or guidance.RELATED:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch? Start HereThe Justice Department said the megamerger would harm consumers because the combined media-and-telecom giant might extract higher prices for Time Warner (TWX) content from other video distributors, or try to withhold content from emerging rivals. The DOJ has asked AT&T (T) to sell off Turner Broadcasting or its DirecTV satellite business to gain approval. AT&T rejected the DOJ's claims and proposed conditions, suggesting President Trump's animus toward Time Warner-owned CNN was a key factor. The DOJ's move could chill other big mergers, analysts say. AT&T and Time Warner rose about 1%.Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) fell 7% Wednesday on weak guidance and CEO Meg Whitman's decision to step down on Feb. 1 amid ongoing restructuring. Antonio Neri, who was named president in June, will replace Whitman. October quarter earnings and revenue topped lowered expectations. But for the January quarter, HPE forecast adjusted EPS of 22 cents at its midpoint of guidance vs. estimates of 28 cents. HPE has sold off its software and enterprise services businesses to focus on servers, networking and data storage hardware but faces stiff competition from Cisco (CSCO) and Dell Technologies (DVMT).The PC and printer maker's fiscal Q4 revenue rose 11% to $13.9 billion. But earnings only met views for a 22% gain and  HP Inc. (HPQ) gave in line guidance, raising concerns about the company's growth outlook. HP shares fell 5% Wednesday.Marvell Technology (MRVL) announced a deal to buy fellow chipmaker Cavium (CAVM) for more than $6 billion to create an ""infrastructure solutions powerhouse"" in communications and data centers. Marvell agreed to pay $40 and 2.1757 Marvell common shares for each Cavium share, or $91.78 as of Friday's close. Both stocks rose sharply after gaining earlier in the month on reports that a deal was close.Salesforce.com (CRM) reported Q3 earnings surged 62% to 39 cents a share, with revenue rising 25% to $2.68 billion, both topping. But for the January quarter, Salesforce.com forecast adjusted earnings of 32-33 cents a share vs. estimates of 34 cents a share. Salesforce.com named Bret Taylor, a former chief technology officer at Facebook (FB), as president and chief product officer. Salesforce.com acquired startup Quip, where Taylor was CEO, last year. Salesforce.com named Alex Dayon chief strategy officer. Salesforce shares fell 1.8% Wednesday but just edged lower for the week, right at record highs.The Republican-led Federal Communications Commission moved closer to dismantling the Obama administration's net neutrality rules. The FCC aims to increase broadband investment by cable TV companies and other internet service providers. The FCC will vote Dec. 14 on Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to scrap public-utility-type Title 2 regulations that were foisted on ISPs. ISPs may be able to charge content providers or business partners fees for ""prioritized"" services. Some regulatory authority on consumer protection could shift to the Federal Trade Commission. Pai says new ""transparency"" rules will protect consumers.RELATED:Why FCC Net-Neutrality Reversal Could Later Be Reversed AgainPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Q1 earnings rose 34% while revenue swelled 27% to $505.5 million, both topping the consensus. The cybersecurity firm guided December-quarter estimates slightly higher. Shares jumped 5.55%. Palo Alto's solid quarter followed soft sales and disappointing guidance from other computer software security providers.On Monday, Roche (RHHBY) unveiled upbeat data from trials in immuno-oncology and hemophilia A — sending its shares up 8.6%. But Dow stock Merck (MRK) fell to an 18-month low after Roche's combination of Tecentriq, cancer drug Avastin and chemotherapy helped reduce the risk of disease worsening or death in patients with advanced lung cancer. Merck's Keytruda-and-chemo combo was approved in May. Biogen (BIIB) spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) lost nearly 10% as Roche said its Hemlibra significantly reduced bleeds in a Phase 3 study of hemophilia A.Malls were crowded on the traditional holiday kickoff even as online and mobile shopping continues to grow rapidly and retailers of all kinds touted deals well before Black Friday. Amazon (AMZN) and Wal-Mart (WMT) are expected to do well, but it will be a critical holiday season for Macy's (M) and other department stores.Dollar Tree (DLTR) Q3 EPS jumped 25% to $1.01 with sales up 6.4% to $5.32 billion, both beating Street estimates. The deep discounter sees Q4 EPS of $1.80-$1.89 vs. consensus views for $1.80, on sales of $6.32 billion-$6.43 billion vs. consensus views for $6.36 billion. Shares leapt 4%, hitting new highs. Off-price apparel chain Burlington Stores (BURL) Q3 EPS soared 40% to 70 cents, beating views but sales only rose 6.6% to $1.438 billion, just short. Same-store sales climbed 3.1%. Shares fell 3% for the week after hitting record highs Monday.Urban Outfitters (URBN) earnings unexpectedly rose in the latest quarter. The young-adult clothier's reported earnings of 41 cents, up 3% vs. a year ago, on sales of $893 million, up 4%. Analysts were expecting EPS to slide 18% to 33 cents. Guess (GES) topped earnings views but revenue fell short. DSW (DSW) reported a 12% EPS drop that missed views, with the shoe retailer also giving weak guidance. Urban Outfitters hit an 11-month high while Guess and DSW tumbled below recent buy points.Shares of recent IPO Qudian (QD), Yirendai (YRD) and other China-based providers of online credit plunged on reports that China authorities had ordered a suspension of online small-loan approvals. The rapid expansion of consumer loans, especially on online microloan platforms, has raised concerns among financial regulators.Home-improvement retailer Lowe's (LOW) third-quarter earnings, revenue and same-store sales beat estimates, helped by higher home-repair demand in the wake of the summer's string of hurricanes. But shares fell, with some analysts saying Wall Street may have wanted more acceleration following a weak second quarter, and expressing concerns about thinner margins and its outlook for the year. Earlier this month, larger rival Home Depot (HD) beat views and raised its full-year forecast.The QuickBooks and TurboTax maker's earnings leapt 83% as revenue grew 14% to $886 million in the October fiscal first quarter, easily beating views. For the current quarter, Intuit (INTU) guided to adjusted earnings per share of 33 cents on sales of $1.17 billion, modestly above analyst models. Shares fell 3.8% on Tuesday following earnings after hitting a record Monday. Intuit lost 1.7% for the week.Durable goods orders, which tend to be volatile, fell in October after a big gain in September. Core capital goods orders dipped, but the business investment proxy jumped vs. a year earlier.

2250,CRM,"MainStay Large Cap Growth Fund (MLAAX) is racing at a gallop, thanks in part to thoroughbred holdings like Alibaba Group (BABA), Nvidia (NVDA), PayPal (PYPL) and Facebook (FB).XThe first two have gained more than 100% this year. PayPal is up nearly 100%, and Facebook has climbed nearly 60%.Fund lead manager Justin Kelly describes where the $12.4 billion fund's giddy-up has come from in broad terms: ""During what we called the QE (quantitative easing) bubble from 2012 to 2016, growth stocks were (largely) out of favor,"" he said. ""Value and safety stocks were (generally) in favor because interest rates were so close to zero."" Now investors' appetite for growth has returned. ""People feel better about the growth outlook and (generally) are willing to pay more for growth stocks,"" he said.That appetite has enabled the fund to jump 32.05% so far this year going into Friday. That's well ahead of the S&P 500's 18.11% gain and the fund's large-cap growth peers' average of 25.74%. It's also nearly triple the fund's own three-year average annual gain and more than double its five-year pace.The fund itself shows a preference for three flavors, or buckets, of growth. One bucket holds consistent growers. ""Those are companies that tend to grow through positive as well as more-challenged economic times,"" Kelly said.The second bucket holds what Kelly calls dynamic growth companies that he and his colleagues estimate will grow revenue and earnings an average of 10% or more for each of the next three or so years. ""They've been growing market share in markets that are expanding,"" Kelly said, and their industries tend to be newer.The third bucket holds cyclical growth stocks operating in more economically sensitive sectors. ""We believe those companies are in the right part of their cycle,"" Kelly said about bucket No. 3.In any bucket, a holding must be addressing a growth opportunity, gaining market share or have a leading share, and have high or rising return on invested capital. It also must have sustainable competitive advantages and strong, innovative management.Managed care provider UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is an example of a stock in that first bucket. Steven Hamill, who tracks health care stocks for the fund, says the fund team believes UnitedHealth benefits from membership growth, driven by rising employment and by increased use of managed care by the U.S. government to control costs. The firm also benefits from its use of data analytics.That's a payoff from UnitedHealth's acquisitions of information-technology companies over the past 15 years, Hamill says. With more insight into patient trends and cost trends, UnitedHealth has been able to offer services at prices below those of its rivals. ""That's allowed them to gain share and have profit-margin growth,"" Hamill said.Salesforce.com (CRM) — whose cloud software helps businesses organize and handle sales operations and customer relationships — is an example of a stock in bucket No. 2 for dynamic growers. On Tuesday the company reported adjusted third-quarter profit and revenue that topped expectations, but its profit outlook for the current quarter slightly disappointed most investors, IBD reported.""Our belief is that they can grow free cash flow at (an average of) 25% annually for the next three years, and that the market is underestimating the duration of their growth,"" Kelly said.Netherlands-based ASML Holding (ASML) is an example of a company in the fund's third bucket, holding cyclical growers. ASML makes lithography systems used to fabricate integrated circuits. The fund began its current stake in June.""We saw a big upward earnings cycle developing,"" Kelly said. ""We believe the company (looked poised to) make more money in the next two years than Wall Street's consensus view expected. So our analysis differed on both the size and duration of their expected free cash flow and earnings.""MainStay Large Cap Growth's big gainers this year include Alibaba, which is in the dynamic-growth bucket. ""They are the leading e-commerce platform in China, and they have an emerging (online) payments platform (Alipay) and cloud services business,"" Kelly noted. ""They've benefited from many growing technology trends. They are the Amazon (AMZN) of China.""Alibaba is a longtime member of Leaderboard — IBD's premium service that spotlights play-by-play moves of top stocks.Nvidia, another dynamic growth stock in the fund's portfolio, has expanded well beyond its roots in video games. ""We think their video game business is a modest grower,"" Kelly said. ""We believe their gem is their data-center products business. We think their business in (chips for) self-driving cars is only beginning.""Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) enable players to see increasingly lifelike action in video games. Now variations on those GPUs provide the speedier calculations needed by data centers, machine learning and self-driving cars. ""We believe those newer businesses have faster growth than their video games business,"" Kelly said.PayPal, also a dynamic growth stock, benefits from the shift to electronic payments. ""As transactions increasingly go online, we believe PayPal makes it easier for consumers to make purchases quickly,"" Kelly said. ""We think their growth will be stronger than the market (in general) believes.""Facebook is also a member of IBD's Leaderboard. The increasing use of social media is driving Facebook, Kelly says. ""As they've gotten bigger, they've applied more analytics to their technology, increasing returns for advertisers,"" Kelly said. ""We believe it's a self-reinforcing advantage over other social media services like Twitter (TWTR) and Snapchat (SNAP).""RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

2251,CRM,"Software companies transitioning to the cloud is not a new story, as notable tech names like Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Microsoft (MSFT) have made the move and lived to tell about it.XBut a lesser-known company's move to the cloud, that of Guidewire Software (GWRE), may be more impressive because of the clientele it serves — the property and casualty insurance market.""The thinking a year ago was that insurance companies are too conservative with data (storage) to adopt a cloud strategy, but given the changing demand environment, Guidewire has embraced (the cloud) pretty quickly,"" JMP Securities analyst Rishi Jaluria told Investor's Business Daily.The leading software provider for insurers, Guidewire is leveraging relationships with technology partners Amazon (AMZN) Web Services and Salesforce (CRM), which are its cloud providers. It expects cloud subscription sales to rise from 6% of its $514.3 million in fiscal 2017 revenue to a range of 20% to 30% in fiscal 2018.The Foster City, Calif.-based firm's shift to a cloud-based subscription model can be likened to that of Adobe, according to Deutsche Bank analyst Nandan Amladi.""Adobe gets written about as a company that's done (the transition to the cloud) well. I think Guidewire is just starting that process at this point,"" Amladi told Investor's Business Daily.Guidewire offers two property and casualty core platforms: InsuranceSuite and InsuranceNow. In a recent report, research firm Gartner called Guidewire's InsuranceSuite platform, which has captured a large share of Tier 1 insurers, the leader in property and casualty core platforms in North America. Tier 1 insurers have at least $5 billion in annual written premiums.Only nine of the 227 total deployments of InsuranceSuite as of March 31 were cloud-based, rather than on-premises, according to Gartner. InsuranceNow, on the other hand, is an all-in-one cloud-based offering for smaller-size insurers, and it results from an acquisition of ISCS in early 2017.""I like that they're both embracing the cloud but they're not forcing it or trying to do anything unnatural to get things in that direction,"" said JMP's Jaluria.IBD'S TAKE: Guidewire is a member of the IBD 50 list of leading growth stocks, which is compiled based on a variety of fundamental and technical factors, including earnings and sales growth, return on equity, price performance and more. See how the IBD 50 can provide hot stocks for your watch list.That approach has helped Guidewire capture a considerable market share. The Gartner report noted that Guidewire has secured nearly 33% of the new customer wins in the property and casualty market, which is three times as much as its nearest competitor.Another factor that sets Guidewire apart is its narrow focus on the property and casualty market — it doesn't sell into any other sectors of insurance, helping it establish ""pretty clear market leadership,"" according to Amladi.In a recent earnings conference call, Chief Executive Marcus Ryu said: ""The increased market dynamism in both demand and competition motivate greater investment to expand our addressable market and to build on our market leadership position.""Guidewire has more than doubled the number of its customers from 158 in fiscal 2013 to 328 in fiscal 2017, with 25 of those customers in the Tier 1 category of more than $5 billion in annual premiums each. And Guidewire isn't focused just on North America, either; it has a strong global presence, Amladi says.MetLife (MET) is a notable customer win for Guidewire. In a ""first-of-its-kind"" project, the company recently deployed InsuranceSuite Cloud, in which Guidewire not only built the solution but is operating it on behalf of MetLife. Jaluria notes that while the product has negative margins at the onset, at a scale seen at 12-15 customers, InsuranceSuite Cloud is expected to reach 65% gross margins.The momentum that Guidewire is seeing is extending to its stock action. Shares are up more than 60% this year, and could be entering a buy zone soon. The stock, a member of the IBD 50 list of leading growth names, is finding support at the key 50-day moving average as it works on the right side of a flat base with an 81.56 buy point.While shifting to the cloud is key for any software business given the current environment, the transition will make Guidewire's financials look ""messy"" in the near term as revenue recognition for subscription deals is delayed compared to its term licenses.The company also expects gross margin to decline to between 62% and 64% next year ""due primarily to the significant increase of lower margin services revenue,"" Chief Financial Officer Richard Hart said on the company's fourth-quarter conference call in September.""Fiscal 2018 will also be one of increased investment as we capitalize on opportunities to address a larger addressable market,"" Hart said. ""We plan a significant increase in hiring of development professionals to meet our product development road map.""Hart added that Guidewire also plans to expand its cloud production services staff and invest in the automation of operational processes.Guidewire will issue its next quarterly report in late November. Revenue is projected to climb 7% to $100.6 million, while the bottom line is expected to reverse to a loss of 14 cents a share from earnings of 2 cents a share last year.Guidewire announced the acquisition of Cyence, a machine learning technology startup that serves the property and casualty market, on Oct. 6 in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $275 million, including $140 million in cash and 1.4 million shares. The deal is expected to close early in the January quarter.Hart said at the company's investor day on Sept. 28 that he expects Guidewire to continue to be acquisitive, with one to two acquisitions per year, according to Jaluria.The analyst notes that the acquisitions could be consolidating deals, extending product features, or expanding the company's global footprint.Amladi notes that Guidewire is ""not dependent on acquisitions for growth,"" but could competitors give it a run for its money?""The competition isn't sitting still,"" he said. ""Guidewire is the leading vendor at this point, but if you're out front, you always need to look over your back to see how other people are catching up.""Shares ticked up 0.7% to close at 80.96 on Friday.RELATED:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

2261,CRM,"With Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google dominating the cloud-computing platform battle, those companies will seek to strengthen their respective positions through alliances with other major tech firms next year, market researcher IDC predicts.""I think we'll see those top three make some very interesting alliances and maybe even some acquisitions,"" IDC Chief Analyst Frank Gens told Investor's Business Daily, adding that ""2018 will be a really interesting year.""Gens says he looks forward to seeing how companies like IBM (IBM), Oracle (ORCL), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Facebook (FB) position themselves as the trio of major cloud players scale up, he said.Using the ""cloud,"" or employing third-party digital services via the internet, is the next major computing platform in the wake of the client-server age. And the major cloud infrastructure providers have amassed computing resources and Big Data capabilities that other companies can't match, Gens said.Competition among those big three will create opportunities for other major tech companies to extract favorable terms for cloud resources, Gens said. The deal-making likely will lead to partnerships where one cloud firm is named a preferred provider, such as the arrangement Adobe Systems (ADBE) has with Microsoft.Gens likened next year's expected cloud market activity to a game of musical chairs.""By the end of 2018, everyone will have found their seat in this new marketplace,"" he said. ""It feels like the entire industry is realigning around the fact that those three companies want to beat each other so badly.""IBD'S TAKE: The FANG group of closely watched internet stocks is made up of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet. For the latest news on the group, visit IBD's page on FANG stocks.One of the driving factors behind the realignment is that cloud-computing infrastructure providers are becoming platforms for artificial intelligence as a service, Gens said.On Tuesday, IDC released its annual predictions for the year ahead and beyond for information technology.IDC predicts that an ""AI war"" is looming as the major public cloud service providers offer an ever-expanding variety of AI-powered services.The research group forecast that 40% of enterprise digital transformation initiatives will use artificial-intelligence services by 2019.IDC also predicted that enterprise spending on cloud services and infrastructure will be more than $530 billion by 2021 and in excess of 90% of enterprises will use multiple cloud services and platforms.RELATED:Microsoft Talks Up Artificial Intelligence, Cloud, Quantum ComputingOracle's Cloud-Computing Guidance Raises Concerns About GrowthWhy Cisco Is Good Fit For Google's Push In Cloud Computing

2277,CRM,"With Salesforce.com (CRM) stock up 34% this year, analysts are debating what it'll take to move shares higher when it reports second-quarter earnings late Tuesday.The leader in software-as-a-service is expected to report unadjusted profit of 32 cents per share, up 33% from 24 cents a year earlier, with revenue rising 23% to $2.52 billion.""The onus for the stock heading into Q2 results is buttressing the case for sustained 20% top-line growth without a degradation in underlying unit economics,"" Keith Weiss, analyst at Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients. ""In this regard, raising the full year revenue and margin targets may prove a stronger catalyst for CRM than the quarterly results themselves.""The company's software helps businesses organize and handle sales operations and customer relationships.

""We expect 20%-plus billings growth (in Q2) would be positive catalyst for shares.""Bhavan Suri, an analyst at William Blair, wrote: ""We expect the company to provide Q3 billings guidance that is below consensus expectations (22% growth) because we believe the street mean is high and billings continues to skew seasonally toward fourth quarter. Further, we would remind investors that the company faces a tough billings comparison from last year (19% growth), and management has guided below the Street for both the first and second quarter of this year.

One small slip-up can prove costly.XBecause small mistakes often trigger large problems, advisors adopt processes and systems to prevent mishaps. They harness technology, provide staff training and create procedural safeguards to ensure accuracy and manage compliance tasks.Despite their best efforts, however, many advisors recall the sting of a simple error — and its lasting repercussions. To avoid a recurrence, they learn to identify operational red flags and deploy resources to run a tighter ship.""My experience is (that) little mistakes can balloon into big problems,"" said Steve Branton, a certified financial planner in San Francisco. ""Having a structure in place to make sure you check all the details"" can minimize the odds of errors, omissions or oversights.Branton has taken a series of steps to reduce the likelihood of small mistakes. Like many advisors, he uses customer relationship management (CRM) software to capture client data, track account activity and prompt action items such as submitting documentation on a timely basis.He also prepares for client meetings by drafting all the necessary paperwork and asking account holders to confirm accuracy. To facilitate communication among third parties, he has clients sign release authorization forms.""That way, we can speak to their CPA, attorneys and other professionals,"" he said. ""An accountant or attorney cannot share certain information with us without a signed authorization from a client, due to privacy rules. With that authorization in place, we can be much more proactive"" on the client's behalf.Early in his career, Branton saw firsthand how a tiny mistake could mushroom into a mess. Inheriting an aging client with a $1 million IRA, he realized upon the client's death that the primary beneficiary was a trust.""The surviving spouse faced a very tax-inefficient situation,"" he said. ""She should've been listed as the primary beneficiary.""To save the widow a hefty tax bill, Branton spent four months working with the custodian to orchestrate a spousal rollover. He had to enlist every potential beneficiary of the trust — including the couple's adult children — to notarize that they approved of transferring the IRA directly to the surviving spouse.Since then, Branton has conducted annual client reviews of all listed beneficiaries. He checks account titling and transfer capabilities, especially between tax-deferred retirement accounts and trusts. He also participates in monthly meetings with nine other advisors at his firm, Mosaic Financial Partners, to review best practices, assess processes and propose new ways to improve operations.Clear client communication keeps everyone on the same page. Advisors often find that completing documents (such as change requests on insurance polices or updates to beneficiary arrangements or property records) requires close coordination with clients.Pat Renn, an Atlanta-based certified financial planner, holds monthly client meetings by phone that usually run 20 to 40 minutes. The agenda largely flows from a customized checklist that his aide prepares for each call.""With this 'client roadmap' we can review everything to make sure we have current information,"" Renn said. ""When my assistant makes the appointment, she has the checklist in front of her and goes over what's on the list"" so that the client comes prepared.Experienced advisors know that the potential for mistakes increases when clients face tight deadlines or try to execute transactions that involve third parties. A seemingly innocent misunderstanding can lead to severe unintended consequences.""The biggest errors occur when money is in motion,"" said Scott Bishop, a Houston-based certified financial planner. ""So I'm always telling my team that we need to double-check and communicate, communicate, communicate when money is moving.""Like Renn, Bishop is a fan of using checklists as error-prevention tools. He has developed action items for many scenarios including a sequence of to-do steps after a client dies.""Every time we make a little mistake, we learn from it and I make another checklist for our operations manual,"" Bishop said.After nearly two decades as an advisor, Bishop has learned that asking the right questions — and getting accurate answers — goes a long way toward eliminating errors. When clients seek to sell a mutual fund, for example, Bishop will ask, ""What's your tax basis on that fund so that I can compute your capital gain?""Documenting client responses in a consistent manner adds another layer of protection to ward off snafus. Renn and his team take detailed notes of all client conversations and highlight any pending actions.""I'll dictate into an iPhone what we agreed to do,"" Renn said. ""It's all very specific with the time, date and next steps.""

2295,CRM,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow industrials were little changed early Thursday after the major averages closed  up Wednesday but well off intraday peaks. The Nasdaq added an eighth distribution day, this one for stalling.XIn a choppy market, with the uptrend under pressure, some stocks will continue to have successful breakouts. Vantiv (VNTV) has powered ahead while Apple (AAPL) is hitting all-time highs. Vantiv, a payment processor, is extended from a buy point while Apple is still in range. But for a savvy investor, you want, to paraphrase ""The Hunger Games,"" for the odds always to be in your favor.S&P 500 index futures fell nearly 0.1% vs. fair value while Nasdaq 100 futures slid 0.1%. Dow industrials futures were a fraction higher.Salesforce.com (CRM) rose 1.7% on Wednesday to 92.24, just clearing a 92.09 buy point in volume that was just above average. Ideally you'd like to see trading activity rise sharply, reflecting institutional buying. Still Salesforce looks positively flush with volume next to Adobe Systems (ADBE), Microsoft (MSFT), Electronic Arts (EA) and Wal-Mart (WMT).Adobe Systems rose 1% to 151.82, just clearing a three-weeks-tight entry at 150.50. A three-weeks tight offers a chance for existing buyers to add a few extra shares. But Adobe, which has been a big winner in 2017, rose Wednesday on volume 45% below normal.Microsoft rose slightly to 73.65 on Wednesday, after retaking a 72.99 buy point on Monday, following a decent rebound from the 50-day line last Friday. But trading volume continues to dry up, suggesting little enthusiasm by deep-pocketed mutual funds.Electronic Arts rose 1.55% to 119.25 on Wednesday, in volume that was 33% below average. Electronic Arts retook a 116.14 flat-base buy point on Monday, in volume that was slightly below normal.Wal-Mart has edged higher for three straight sessions, retaking an 80.57 cup base buy point on Monday. Monday and Tuesday volume was light. Wednesday's suddenly spiked, but the stock really didn't move — up 0.3% to 80.96.A 0.5% cushion over the buy point is fairly threadbare heading into Wal-Mart's second-quarter earnings report Thursday morning.Investors shouldn't rush into cash. The market rally is still valid. But you should be extra cautious about buying stocks in the current market, and extra quick to take profits and cut losses.RELATED:The Big Picture: Stocks Stall; Does That Threaten Market's Bounce?These 5 Techs Are Near Buy Points In This Classic Bullish PatternThese Two Global Retail Giants Will Deliver 1-2 Punch: Investing Action PlanStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

2296,CRM,"Ah, those sociable humans, they're always up to something online — texting, tweeting, messaging, Googling.HubSpot (HUBS) Chief Executive Brian Halligan says he's staying on top of all that, and making it work to his company's advantage.X""We are really watching the way the marketplace and humans are changing, and building products to match that,"" Halligan said on a recent company earnings call.HubSpot is an 11-year-old maker of sales and marketing software based in Cambridge, Mass., and it sells to small- and midsize businesses. Its own pitch is that potential customers — aka those sociable humans — find businesses through digital channels like blogs, internet search engines and social media. HubSpot's expertise lies in attracting people to websites and optimizing content so that visitors are converted into paying customers.Its mantra: Help customers create more personalized interactions with their prospective buyers to close the deal. The strategy has helped HubSpot see its revenue shoot up 38% to $171 million in the first six months of 2017. Shares are up 52% this year.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect 2018 revenue growth to slow to 25% from 34% this year. HubSpot could beat those earnings estimates if new initiatives gain traction, says Derrick Wood, an analyst at Cowen & Co.""Their rate of growth has come down. Marketing tech in general is a tough market to scale. It's fragmented with lots of small vendors. So to come out as a single winner and take a lot of market share has been challenging,"" said Wood, who has a neutral rating on the stock.Further, HubSpot's main challenge is maintaining a sales growth rate that will support its valuation.HubSpot has evolved into a multi-product company — adding sales automation and customer relationship management (CRM) software. Many of HubSpot's customers have 10 to 50 employees, with some in the low hundreds. Analysts say HubSpot targets firms with up to 2,000 employees.The company has focused on the midmarket as opposed to competing head-on for large corporate accounts vs. the likes of Oracle (ORCL), Salesforce.com (CRM), SAP and Adobe Systems (ADBE). That way HubSpot has avoided the cost of investing in its own sales staff to chase down and close deals, says Wood.""What's different about these guys is the focus on midmarket. They have to keep the new-customer growth engine going. They're looking at new ways to acquire customers,"" said Wood. ""Also going into new markets, like they're doing with sales force automation and CRM, is going to drive growth. But I don't think you'll see them go upmarket into (larger) enterprise (firms).""HubSpot's customers mostly engage in business-to-business marketing. They buy online subscriptions to software that ranges from $2,500 to $30,000 annually. The average marketing customer spends about $13,000 a year.HubSpot also has laid claim to what it calls ""Inbound Marketing."" Halligan and co-founder Dharmesh Shah wrote a book on using Google, social media and search-friendly blogs to attract customers via the internet. HubSpot sells tools that track the online activity of website visitors and personalize content as their interests are identified.Halligan says people are spending less time texting, emailing back-and-forth, or searching on Google. Instead, Halligan says, they're using messaging platforms more, including Slack, in the workplace.And, humans consume tons of video. So HubSpot helps its customers evaluate video platforms such as Facebook (FB) Live for marketing purposes.""If you look how people spend their day, they're spending an awful lot of time on social media,"" Halligan said on the earnings call. ""There are big shifts going on, and HubSpot's going to be there to help our customers through it.""HubSpot has used Twitter (TWTR), Facebook and Instagram to build its own follower base. In late September, HubSpot will host its annual ""Inbound"" user conference to rally the troops.Still, there's more to HubSpot's marketing than social media engagement. HubSpot has built up sales channels, such as website design and marketing agencies, that point people toward its products. About 40% of revenue comes from customer-referral channels, says Wood.HubSpot aims to borrow some techniques from Intuit (INTU) and Autodesk (ADSK), which have successfully targeted accountants and architects, as partners. HubSpot aims to partner with sales agencies. HubSpot also works with industry players. HubSpot has growing ties to Microsoft's (MSFT) LinkedIn and its sales tools.IBD'S TAKE: HubSpot has formed a cup-with-handle chart pattern with a buy point of 76.20. The stock is hovering near its 50-day moving average. Alarm.com, Realpage, and Appfolio have the highest Composite Rating, a CAN SLIM investing metric, of companies in IBD's Computer Software-Specialty Enterprise group.The company also provides help in integrating its software with Salesforce.com's bigger platform. And, HubSpot's tools work with e-commerce payment platforms such as Shopify (SHOP).HubSpot recently rolled out a $50 monthly marketing starter package. New visitors to its website are greeted with offers for free versions of HubSpot products. After using free versions for a while, or ""freemiums,"" the company figures users will upgrade to paid products.""If you roll the clock forward two, three, four years, that's just the way I think humans are going to buy products because they're going to want to try it and use it (first),"" said Halligan on the earnings call. ""This freemium thing is going to be here to stay.""Indeed, HubSpot has added two new board members — one from software firm Atlassian (TEAM) and one from data storage provider Drop — both of which use freemium business models.HubSpot has more than 34,300 customers, up 40% from a year ago, with roughly 27,000 of them buying marketing tools. Average revenue per customer has been falling, however, due to the lower-priced offers.Nate Cunningham, a Guggenheim Securities analyst, says HubSpot has a ""greenfield"" opportunity to target small companies that never bought marketing software. He says HubSpot needs to improve operating margins as it adds customers in new ways.""The No. 1 determinant of HubSpot's growth is probably not competitive displacement, to gain share vs. Salesforce or IBM,"" said Cunningham. ""It's more about how can they get people to try their product who never have had a marketing product before. I think greenfield is where the bulk of the opportunity is.""HubSpot had over 5,000 ""Growth Stack"" customers as of June 30, up from 3,000 at the start of the year. These high-spending customers buy more sales, CRM and marketing software tools. And, they're more likely to renew subscriptions annually as opposed to leaving.Bhavan Suri, analyst at William Blair, says HubSpot is on the right track.""We believe HubSpot's customer growth is a good indication of the health of the business,"" he said in a note to clients, ""and provides significant up-sell and cross-sell opportunities longer term, which we believe could ultimately lead to an acceleration of the business as soon as next year.""Shares of HubSpot have been in decline while forming a deep handle, but were up 2.2% at Friday's close to 67.35.RELATED:This Education Company Reaps Newfound Disposable Income In ChinaAd Tech Firm Does Bidding For Customers, One At A TimeBiotech Finds Its Stride With Kidney Cancer Treatment

2301,CRM,"If there was an exchange traded fund for FANG stocks, this one might be it.XFirst Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund (FDN) counts the four FANG stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) — among its six largest holdings. That's more than 30% of the fund's weighting in just those four stocks.FANG is the acronym for four companies that dominate the internet industry. Their shares have been a focal point of this year's strength in internet and other technology sectors, especially the big caps.Although the four stocks have had success this year, their charts at this point are uncertain. Alphabet is trading in the lower parts of a base it's forming. Netflix gapped up sharply July 18 on earnings, but has erased most gains. Amazon is drifting below its 50-day moving average. Facebook is holding up better, still near its highs.The fund started trading in June 2006, long before FANG became an investor buzzword. It's had good long-term performance, with shares rising 7% last year, 21.7% in 2015, 2.4% in 2014, 53.6% in 2013 and 20.7% in 2012, according to Morningstar.com.To be in the fund's underlying index, companies must earn at least 50% of annual sales from the internet. They must also have a three-month average market cap of at least $100 million, and certain liquidity requirements. Stocks are picked using a combination of market capitalization and average share volume, according to the First Trust website.First Trust Dow Jones Internet has more than 40 holdings. Other major components are electronic payments leader PayPal (PYPL), cloud-based business software firm Salesforce.com (CRM) and e-commerce pioneer eBay (EBAY).Of course, the well-known internet brands such as Twitter (TWTR), Expedia (EXPE) and Groupon (GRPN) are also in the ETF.Not all are in the technology sector. Online brokers E-Trade (ETFC) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD), as well as health care technology company Veeva Systems (VEEV) are in the portfolio.First Trust Internet's shares are testing support after pulling back to the 50-day moving average. A good bounce from the line would put the ETF in a buy area. Shares already are near the 98.18 buy point of a flat base from a breakout about a month ago. But market risk is higher than normal right now, and that applies even to a diversified investment such as an ETF.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

2309,CRM,"Cloud computing leaders Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Google, along with internet giants, have the inside track in monetizing artificial intelligence technology, a Mizuho Securities report says, but enterprise software providers also will grab a piece of the action.At a basic level, artificial intelligence is the use of computer algorithms to attempt to replicate the human ability to learn, reason and make decisions.Amazon, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are pushing into AI-as-a-service. They plan to rent AI tools to customers on a pay-as-you-go basis via their public cloud-computing services.Enterprise software providers such as Salesforce.com (CRM) and ServiceNow (NOW) are in the early stages of embedding AI tools in existing products to make them more predictive, analysts say.""In evaluating recent artificial intelligence/machine learning trends and innovation put forth by enterprise vendors, we see incremental benefit for Salesforce, ServiceNow and Splunk (SPLK),"" Mizuho analyst Abhey Lamba said. ""Across the stack, we think the revenue opportunity lies with application vendors that address specific business problems or analytical tool providers that help enable a solution. The core AI engine layer of the stack will likely be dominated by large vendors such as Amazon, Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Google and Microsoft; smaller players are likely to either get acquired or run into significant headwinds.""AI, around since the 1960s, now comes in new forms.

2310,CRM,"""Buy now"" with one click.Online shoppers know the payment tool well. It's a good example of how innovating in digital payments can take a company and its stock a long way. XJust ask founder Jeff Bezos at Amazon.com (AMZN), whose shares have approached the 1,100 mark.Other digital-payment players — think PayPal Holdings (PYPL), Square (SQ), and hot startup Stripe — also make it easier for merchants to nail down purchases, whether shoppers are on a PC, using a smartphone or in a store. PayPal and Square have shined in 2017, with their stocks climbing 50% and 92%, respectively, for the year vs. a gain of 10% for the S&P 500.Innovation in digital payments is making cash and checks go away and someday may even eliminate plastic credit cards. As technology evolves, a battle is raging to draw in merchants to payment ecosystems, along with billions of dollars in transaction fees.Payment processors are wooing merchants with new software-based sales tools and website services and, in some cases, cash loans to grow their businesses.""Anything a merchant can do to reduce the amount of friction in the transaction has an immediate effect on the top line, in terms of incremental sales, and the bottom line, in terms of lower transaction costs,"" said Thad Peterson, analyst at Aite Group.IBD'S TAKE: Keep an eye on credit card and payment-processing stocks, which have risen in weeks to rank 31st in price performance among 197 industry groups tracked by Investor's Business Daily. A leader in the group, PayPal's stock climbed to a record high after earnings. Use the IBD Stock Checkup to see how PayPal and other stocks stack up on crucial fundamental and technical measures.But competition is fierce in the crowded digital-payment industry, with well-funded startups challenging corporate giants from the credit card, e-commerce and consumer electronic fields. It's a tight-margin business, but huge.Online payment processors generally garner around 2.9% of a transaction value plus a 30-cent fee from merchants. They may pay partners, such as banks, to use their systems. ""It has to be a scale (volume) business to make it work,"" said Peterson.The good news is that e-commerce is booming. Global e-commerce sales will jump to $4 trillion by 2020, up from $2.35 trillion in 2017, accounting for nearly 15% of all retail spending worldwide, says research firm eMarketer.Competition is about to get even rougher.Amazon's U.S. patent for 1-Click technology, which stores payment and shipping information, expires in mid-September. When that happens, analysts say Visa (V), Mastercard (MA) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are expected to jump in with their own versions of the technology, intensifying the battle for merchants. While the credit card networks offer their own speedy online payment systems, such as Visa Checkout, they still require a user name and password to complete a transaction, while 1-Click does not.Amazon grew into an e-commerce giant by leveraging its 1-Click technology, rolled out in 1997. Apple (AAPL) licensed 1-Click for its app store, paying Amazon for the friction-free payment option.Keep Up With Stocks Near A Buy Zone At IBDMore recently, Amazon has been using 1-Click to attract merchants to its payments platform. If online shoppers log in to their Amazon accounts at third-party websites, 1-Click speeds up the checkout process. Partners include luxury retailer Moda Operandi, Nine West and L'Occitane.Amazon in February announced that 33 million consumers are using its payments service at both its site and third-party sites, up from 23 million a year earlier. That still trails PayPal's 210 million active customer accounts worldwide. Amazon reported earnings late Thursday and fell far short on earnings views due to high expenses.As digital-payment rivals target merchants, they're tapping a new tool — loans. Banks have stepped back from lending to small businesses since the 2008 recession. But Amazon, Square and PayPal have expanded their lending. Shopify (SHOP), a provider of e-commerce platforms that uses Stripe technology, has jumped into the lending game, too.Amazon in early June said its lending to small businesses has topped $3 billion, including $1 billion in loans over the last 12 months. Some 20,000 small businesses have received loans ranging from $1,000 to $750,000. Amazon uses internal data to identify creditworthy clients.PayPal in May announced that it has issued more than $3 billion in loans to 115,000 businesses globally since 2013. Square's lending has topped $1.5 billion over three years.One weapon that Square has been able to wield is making credit-card readers that plug into mobile phones and tablets, such as Apple's iPad. That enables Square to drill down deeply into the small-business realm by targeting ""micro-merchants"" — very small entities that may not have accepted credit cards previously. A handyman, lunch-truck operator or masseuse might be among them.Square in March unveiled a new platform enabling its retail customers to process payments on custom websites, getting into competition with Stripe and PayPal. Jordan McKee, analyst at 451 Research, says payment processors aim to add higher-margin products.""Everyone wants to be a solutions provider,"" said McKee. ""The payments space is difficult. Margins are very slim. It's a game of scale. These companies are using payment processing as a linchpin to offer software-based services with higher margins that are sticky.""""Payments is a hard business to make money in. But if you can offer software with monthly fees and get recurring revenue then you build a bigger business,"" he added.What companies will find long-term success? It's hard to say, but here's a snapshot of new developments involving three big digital-payment players that illustrate the industry stakes, strategies and ambitions.The iPhone maker says Apple Pay, the mobile payments service rolled out in 2014, is on track to be accepted at 50% of U.S. retailers by year-end. ""It's a commendable milestone but pales in comparison to the ubiquity of Visa and MasterCard in physical stores and PayPal (online) acceptance,"" said Josh Beck, a Pacific Crest Securities analyst in a report. Loup Ventures says only 13% of Apple's 680 million iPhone users have activated Apple Pay.Apple launched its first large-scale marketing campaign targeting mainland China in late July, notes research firm Analysys Mason. Apple has lagged in gaining traction vs. local mobile payment incumbents, Alipay and WeChat.Looking to gain traction with millennials, Apple in June introduced a rival to PayPal's Venmo and Square Cash, both person-to-person payment systems. Consumers link a bank account to a smartphone app and send money to friends or family using an email address.While the money-transfer services are mostly free for consumers, PayPal and Apple see the apps as acquisition and engagement tools. PayPal also aims to get fees from merchants that accept the money transfers as payment.The San Francisco-based startup maintains it has no plans to go public, despite speculation that it could pull the trigger next year. Stripe's latest funding round in December gave it a whopping $9.2 billion valuation. In all, Stripe has raised $440 million.Investors include American Express (AXP) as well as Visa, which has placed multiple online- and mobile-shopping bets, also investing in Sweden's Klarna and Square.Stripe's software enables companies to accept and track online payments made via credit or debit cards as well as smartphone apps and cyber-currencies such as Bitcoin. Stripe's customers build its tools into their own apps and websites. The tools help businesses bypass complex relationships with banks and older payment providers.Stripe's technology lets companies focus on their products rather than back-end payment processing. Customers include Salesforce.com (CRM), Uber-rival Lyft and Target (TGT). Stripe's closest rivals are PayPal's Braintree unit and Dutch startup Adyen.""Braintree and Stripe are similar animals,"" said Aite's Peterson. ""They take the payment processing load off of a merchant along with the risk. Both of them need to find ways to add value, to broaden their platform.""Stripe on July 10 unveiled a partnership with Alipay, part of Alibaba Group (BABA), and WeChat, part of Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), two of China's biggest digital-payment services. The deal gives Stripe access to hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers.Amid worries over competition from Apple, Amazon, and Stripe, PayPal has nonetheless raised 2017 revenue guidance and its three-year revenue outlook. Since spun off from eBay in 2015, PayPal has evolved from a payment button to a broad payments service provider, while expanding from online checkout to mobile payments.PayPal in February said one-third of all its transactions are now mobile while three-fourths of the top 100 online retailers accept PayPal. PayPal has forged new alliances with Visa, Mastercard, Google and Facebook (FB).Apple has also warmed up to PayPal. PayPal announced in early July that consumers in North America, Australia, Israel and seven European nations will be able to use their PayPal accounts for purchases across Apple platforms, including the App Store, Apple Music and iTunes.A deal with Amazon remains elusive.""Convincing Amazon to accept PayPal seems unlikely given it already has its own payments-tender type, its own private-label card, and it recently added a staged-wallet feature for Prime members, which we see as a direct threat to PayPal,"" said Thomas McCrohan, a Mizuho Securities analyst in a June 27 report. Pacific Crest Securities says PayPal could be a takeover target of several companies, though nothing seems imminent.More In-Depth AnalysisSmart Ideas In Artificial Intelligence And Early Investing Hot SpotsHere's One More Thing Amazon Is KillingFast Food Makes Its Biggest Change Since The Drive-Thru

"
2315,CRM,"Investors in Dow component Microsoft (MSFT) and countless other companies are due for a wake-up call in coming months, and this is one instance where hitting the snooze button isn't a good idea.A set of new accounting rules that govern revenue recognition — said to be the biggest change in standards since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 — will take effect next year, affecting either fiscal 2018 or 2019 for all U.S. companies.The accounting changes are under the radar of many investors, who may scramble to make sense of what's happening with the stocks, many of them blue chips like Microsoft, into which they've poured their money.Under the designation of FASB 606 — FASB is an acronym for the Financial Accounting Standards Board — the new rules will make revenue recognition consistent across U.S. industries. It's geared to help investors, but there could be near-term pain. Many companies will likely speed up revenue recognition and possibly make earnings more volatile from quarter to quarter.""We expect that (the new rules) will cause significant investor confusion over the next 12 months to the financial analysis of companies ranging from small companies up to the largest, including Microsoft,"" said a recent report from Citigroup.But the rules aim to address a big problem.While top-line growth is a critical metric for investors, revenue recognition has been a weak link in accounting standards. With the new rules, Wall Street analysts and investors should get a better feel for how a company is doing and whether business is deteriorating or booming.One goal is providing more transparency in sales backlogs, or revenue not yet recognized from contracts already signed. Some companies state backlogs, some don't. Now they'll have to put a number on it in many industries. Guidelines specific to the software and defense industries, for example, are going away.In regulatory filings, companies also will be required to disclose more information on contracts. That should give investors and analysts more data on what risks or uncertainties companies face. Companies talk about things like pension costs in filings but don't provide the same transparency on revenue issues.Industries with the most ""deferred revenue"" — sales booked over time — will be most affected by FASB 606, says a Morgan Stanley report. Those include software, communications equipment, airlines, aerospace and defense.In industries that will be impacted most by the new rules, some analysts are talking about using more steady free cash flow as an alternative metric to earnings per share. The reason is free cash flow will be less impacted by the 606 rules.""I would expect to see more disclosures, certainly by the third quarter, on whether the standard is going to affect revenue recognition,"" said Dusty Stallings, a partner at accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers.Microsoft is expected to be one of the prominent early adopters of the new standard. It reports its 2017 fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on July 20, and a few weeks later the company plans to restate earnings for the prior two years.Also on the list with Microsoft are a number of other Dow components, including General Electric (GE), Boeing (BA) and Verizon Communications (VZ).A wide swath of other firms in many industries are expected to be impacted. They include Amazon.com (AMZN), American Airlines (AAL), AT&T (T), Electronic Arts (EA) and General Dynamics (GD). Others are First Solar (FLSR), Monsanto (MON) and T-Mobile US (TMUS)Companies that recognize more revenue upfront could have more earnings volatility. Surprises to the upside may be followed by sudden, equally surprising shortfalls. Companies prefer that a total contract value be recognized over time, which provides more flexibility in smoothing out earnings to meet consensus estimates.""New principle-based revenue rules will likely accelerate revenue recognition, while also introducing more volatility,"" said Snehaja Mogre, a Morgan Stanley analyst in a report. ""As the new standard will not impact actual cash flows, we expect investors to increase their reliance on cash flow metrics.""Many companies are still studying the new FASB 606 rules, but crunch time is coming. Expectations run high that many companies will finally declare whether the 606 standard is ""material"" or not to financial results on June- or September-quarter earnings calls.In Microsoft's case, the new standard is expected to impact Windows 10 revenue in particular. Microsoft is expected to book Windows 10 revenue when it bills hardware makers rather than over the life of a PC or device using the software. Microsoft in May briefed financial analysts, telling them that in fiscal 2016 revenue would have been about 7% higher —$6 billion or so — had it used the new revenue standard back then.While Microsoft will forecast earnings in July for its first fiscal quarter of 2018, it plans to update guidance in August using the new revenue recognition standard. When briefing analysts in May, Microsoft made the point that the FASB 606 rules will not impact free cash flow.""Net-net, investors could start paying more attention to cash flows given increasing revenue variability,"" Brent Bracelin, analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, said in a recent note to clients.While some companies will opt to restate earnings for prior years, most are expected to take a ""modified"" compliance route, applying the new rules on a quarter-by-quarter basis going forward, adjusting results for new contracts, says Betsy Meter, an audit partner at KPMG.""It's industry-driven mainly,"" she said. Companies that delay, though, will be less likely to take Microsoft's approach and restate prior-year earnings, which gives investors more information.""For industries where there is a significant impact, a full retrospective approach will give them some history and visibility,"" Meter added.Some of the biggest names in tech, though, see little impact. Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are among tech companies that expect little impact from the new standard. Chipmaker Intel (INTC) has not been heard from.In general, the rules are expected to affect companies with multiyear contracts, licensing revenue and contracts that peg revenue to performance benchmarks. And they will also affect companies that use third-party sales distribution channels.Revenue from Amazon-branded electronic devices sold through retailers will be booked earlier, rather than when consumers actually buy the devices, says a Connor Group report. The new rules also will impact Amazon gift cards, says the report.Key to the new accounting rules is that revenue must often be booked right away and not stretched out over the term of contracts. AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon will likely book more revenue from smartphone sales upfront, rather than over the course of an installment payment plan.Salesforce.com (CRM) and Adobe (ADBE) are among software companies still studying the impact of 606 rules. Workday (WDAY) has decided to  remove guidance for billings, a sales growth metric,  as it adopts the new accounting rules. It's unclear how many other companies may follow suit on billings.Companies with cloud-based, software-as-a-servicer (SaaS) business models that involve renewable subscriptions are expected to be less impacted than those that sell software installed on a customer's own in-house computers.Only about 7% of SaaS provider ServiceNow's (NOW) revenue comes from on-premise licenses, analysts say. Splunk (SPLK) and Ansys (ANSS), on the other hand, garner a large chunk of revenue from on-premise deals, says a William Blair report.While Microsoft will likely book Windows 10 revenue sooner, its online Office 365 sales will be less affected. Cloud-based software is rented via the internet.""SaaS models should see the least impact from the new standard, given that software is hosted and delivered over broadband connections vs. software installed on-premise,"" said Bracelin.Cisco Systems (CSCO), a big computer networking gear maker, could see its deferred revenue impacted, he says.Many software companies may be in the process of renegotiating contracts to ease the impact of rule 606, says KPMG's Meter.Some software makers, such as Autodesk (ADSK), have already transitioned business models to subscription licenses for cloud software. Under the 606 rules, only software that is continuously updated is eligible for revenue recognition over time, or ""ratably.""A lot of U.S. companies had hoped for further delays in carrying out the 606 rules, which have been in the works for more than a decade.""Companies know the time is upon them to get going,"" said Stallings at PricewaterhouseCoopers. ""There's acceptance that this is going live on Jan. 1, 2018, for calendar-year companies.""RELATED:Workday Ends Billings Guidance In Accounting Shift, Stock Falls

2318,CRM,"Futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average turn higher Friday after the Nasdaq composite closed Thursday below its 50-day moving average. Microsoft (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) fell back below their 50-day lines, joining Apple, Netflix and many others. Some stocks, such as Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN), are holding support. But they are fighting against the tide.Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.4% vs. fair value after falling for much of the overnight session. Futures for the S&P 500 advanced 0.4% and Dow futures climbed 0.35%. Crude futures rose nearly 1% after gaining for several days in a row.XThis year's broad tech rally was fueled by several big trends: FANG+ (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet, plus Apple), China internets, chipmakers, optical gear plays and, more recently, enterprise software firms.But more and more stocks are breaking 50-day lines or round-tripping on breakouts.Apple tumbled below its 50-day moving average on June 10 and hasn't found a way back. Even with recent struggles, including Thursday's 1.5% loss, Apple is still up 24% in 2017, the third-best performer in the Dow Jones industrial average.Microsoft and Alphabet on Tuesday closed just below their 50-day lines and bounced back on Wednesday. On Thursday, both Microsoft and Google's parent fell more decisively below that key support line. Microsoft and Alphabet are among the biggest cloud-computing rivals to much-larger Amazon Web Services.IBD'S TAKE: The market direction is still uptrend under pressure, which means investors should be cautious about taking new positions and ready to take profits and cut losses quickly. Pay attention to the leading stocks and major averages and read The Big Picture daily.Facebook traded below its 50-day line intraday for the fifth time in June, but once again closed above that line. Facebook announced this week that it has topped two billion monthly users. What makes that even more amazing is that the social giant is blocked in China, the world's largest internet market.Amazon has pulled back toward its 50-day line but has found support so far. Amazon continues to roil the retail, apparel and broader consumer fields, with Nike (NKE) confirming in its Thursday night earnings call that it will sell some shoes directly via the e-commerce giant.Weibo (WB) and Momo (MOMO) have fallen below their 50-day lines. NetEase (NTES) is once again round-tripping its late-stage breakout.

Lumentum (LITE), which is seen as a possible Apple iPhone 3D sensor play, is close to round-tripping.Salesforce (CRM), Shopify (SHOP) and SAP (SAP) are all below their 50-day moving averages.Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE), which both had strong earnings last week, are holding up well so far.While many techs are weak, financials are making gains, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) a notable breakout this week. Big banks announced huge dividend hikes and stock buybacks late Wednesday after passing the second round of the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests. Meanwhile, higher Treasury yields, while a negative for the broader stock market (and housing stocks in particular), also are giving a lift to financials.Meanwhile, biotechs have been big winners in June. Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron (REGN) are two big-name breakouts, but there have been others.Defense and aerospace firms like Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) have held up well, either within buy range or just extended.In Asian markets, Japan's Nikkei fell 0.9% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 1.7% but China's Shanghai composite rose 0.1% 0.2%.

During the regular session Celgene (CELG) roared into a buy zone, with Amgen (AMGN), Regeneron (REGN) and Biogen (BIIB) among peers showing bullish action.Investors should pay attention to sector rotations, because a stock's performance is closely tied to that of its broader industry. Stronger industry-sector performance may reflect improving business conditions for those companies. And there is a momentum shift as markets become more enamored or disenchanted with a group.Nasdaq 100 futures rose more than 0.1% above fair value, though off overnight highs. Futures for the Dow industrials climbed nearly 0.1% while S&P 500 index futures turn slightly higher. Crude oil futures, which have plunged this week, edged up.Over the last five sessions, the Medical-Biomed/Biotech group has been the top performer out of IBD's 197 industry groups, soaring 6.9%.

Bioverativ is on Leaderboard, IBD's premium service highlighting a select cull of stocks, mostly growth plays in or near buy zones.Clovis Oncology (CLVS) has skyrocketed 57% this week after reporting strong trial data, suggesting its ovarian cancer drug may get a much-wider use.Gilead Sciences (GILD) rose 2.9% to above its 50-day line as the Hepatitis-C and HIV biotech tries to break a downtrend going back more than a year.One good way to play the biotech boom is via ETFs, such as the SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) and iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB). Both XBI and IBB broke out of consolidations this week.Oracle reported much-stronger-than-expected earnings late Wednesday, with 3% revenue growth also edging past views. Shares of the business software giant shot up 11% to 51.35 in premarket trading on the stock market today. That would be a record high and well above a 47.09 buy point, though overnight trading doesn't always carry over into the regular session. Still, Oracle already topped an aggressive entry of 46.17 on Wednesday, rising 1.1% to 46.33 in heavy volume.In addition to desktop software names Microsoft, Adobe and Red Hat, which are all near long-time or all-time highs, several other business software stocks have been breaking out and hitting highs in recent months. They include cloud-based payroll software players such as Workday (WDAY), Paylocity (PCTY) and Paycom (PAYC), as well as ServiceNow (NOW), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Veeva Systems (VEEV).In Asian trading Thursday, Japan's Nikkei dipped 0.1% while China's Shanghai composite slid 0.3%.

2326,CRM,"It's been a rough week for Snap (SNAP) as user growth is slowing, JPMorgan cut its price target on the social network and a report says short sellers have placed a $1.2 billion bet that the stock will continue to fall, which it has.Snap stock ended the regular trading session down 3.6% to 18.85 on the stock market today. Earlier in the day the stock was down 7%. It's down 10% for the week and far off its record high of 29.44.""Competitive pressures may be intensifying for Snap, challenging the platform's ability to attract and retain new users,"" Nomura analyst Anthony DiClemente wrote in a research report published late Wednesday. DiClemente has a sell rating on Snap and price target of 14.Snap held its widely watched initial public offering on March 1, pricing shares at 17. They popped 44% on the first day of trading, then hit a record high on 29.44 the following day. The IPO raised $3.4 billion and placed a $24 billion market valuation on the company. It was the largest technology IPO since Facebook (FB), its main rival.Snap is the owner of Snapchat, a mobile messaging platform where users can add creative elements to photos and videos. It competes mostly with the Instagram platform of Facebook, which has steadily copied the most popular features of Snapchat.Looking at data from SensorTower, Nomura's DiClemente concluded that downloads of the Snapchat app have dropped 22% in the first two months of the second quarter vs. the year-ago period. That compares with an increase of 6% in the first quarter.In a report issued Monday, JPMorgan cuts its price target on Snap to 18 from 20, citing competition from Facebook.IBD'S TAKE: Snap has a low IBD Composite Rating of 25, out of a best possible 99, a rating that combines several proprietary IBD ratings into one measure. Big winners often have a Composite Rating of 95 or higher near the start of major share-price gains. IBD focuses on the best-performing IPOs of the past three years in its IPO Leaders column.Restrictions will be lifted on about 1.2 billion shares of Snap from July 31 to Aug. 31, setting them free for trading and possibly adding concerns about when stock restrictions expire, which could bring volatility to the stock.This bad news is good news for short sellers who have bet $1.2 billion against the company. According to S3 Partners, Snap is the third-largest short in the application software sector, behind Workday (WDAY) and Salesforce.com (CRM).Investors take a short position when they borrow stock from a broker, sell it and hope the stock falls. If they repurchase the stock at a lower price and return it to the broker, the short seller pockets the difference. Year to date, S3 estimates short sellers have a pocketed a $52 million profit on Snap.""With short interest increasing even at these expensive borrow rates, it looks like short sellers are positioning themselves for a dramatic sell-off in Snap's stock price after the lockups expire,"" wrote Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3's head of research. He says 50 million shares of Snap stock are shorted.Facebook's Instagram program recently reached 700 million monthly users and has doubled in size the past two years. Facebook also said its Instagram Stories application, which competes directly with Snapchat Stories, broke the 200-million-user mark among daily active users in mid-April.Snap ended the first quarter with 166 million users, up 36% from the year-ago quarter, and up 5% from the previous quarter.JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth has a neutral rating on Snap and price target of 18, down from 20.""We are lowering our Snap estimates to account for our more cautious view on the pace at which Snap can scale its ad business, a softer outlook for Spectacles, and slower daily average user growth in outer years,"" Anmuth wrote. ""Snap's been monetizing for just over two years, and there is significant work required to scale the ad platform.""RELATED:Snap Laughs Off Facebook Competition As Stock Plunges On Earnings MissSnap Plunges As More Analysts Say 'Lottery' Stock A Bad BetSnap Stock Plunges On Big First-Quarter Revenue, Net Income Miss

2340,CRM,"Columbia Select Large Cap Growth Fund (UMLGX) keeps on shining. Lead manager Thomas Galvin has been at the helm almost 15 years. And over the past 15 years this growth fund has outpaced 86% of its large-cap growth fund rivals tracked by Morningstar.com, with an average annual return of 11.44% vs. 9.65% for its peers, going into Thursday.That outperformance has been fueled by focusing on stocks with superior earnings growth opportunities and attractive valuations. The ""select"" part of the $4 billion fund's name refers to the managers' concentrated approach, focusing on just their highest conviction ideas such as Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Salesforce (CRM) and Nvidia (NVDA).And the managers apply quantitative tools to manage risk. In a nutshell, a key step is to limit holdings' correlations, so their stocks are not vulnerable to the same risks. Ideally, any one torpedo in the form of a market problem won't sink more than one holding.This growth fund has beaten the S&P 500 Index for the one-year, three-year, five-year, 10-year and 15-year periods on an annualized basis through June 20. Year to date, the fund is up 14.95% vs. the S&P's 4.46% and 10.67% for large-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar.com.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

They look for companies driven by secular opportunities rather than cyclical ups and downs.""We try to find companies that will grow their sales and earnings two times over the broader market,"" Carter said.On average, companies in the S&P 500 Index grew earnings about 6% annually from 1960 through 2017, Carter says. He and his teammates look for companies that are growing earnings more than 12% a year. On average, they end up picking companies posting earnings growth closer to 18% to 20%.""If we can find companies that are growing faster than the broader market, while improving and maintaining margins and returns on invested capital, we think that's a high-growth opportunity,"" Carter said.It's a best-ideas growth fund that holds 25 to 35 stocks. Carter says they're not trying to benefit from easy earnings comparisons year-over-year or quick spikes in energy prices or interest rates that are more cyclical in nature.Instead, this growth fund seeks firms benefiting from secular themes involving demographics, innovation, productivity and low costs. They want companies gaining market share, generating returns on equity above the market and balance sheets with little or no debt.Carter says 50% of the portfolio consists of established growth companies. The other 50% consists of emerging growth companies.Established growth companies are familiar names with stable profits, growing earnings by about 10% to 15%. This includes names such as Visa (V) and Nike (NKE).Emerging growth companies are raising earnings much faster, typically between about 20% and 30%, such as Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA).With only a $15 billion market cap, Ulta is a one-stop shop for beauty enthusiasts, which is stealing market share from both department stores and drugstores. Its sales growth is four times the entire retail sector, Carter says.One of this growth fund's long-term plays is Booking Holdings (BKNG), which includes online travel agencies Booking.com and Priceline. The fund originally bought the stock in 2009 at 100 per share. Now it's trading around 2,122.""In 2009, it was growing earnings north of 30%,"" Carter said. ""Today it's closer to 15% to 20%.

2341,CRM,"Let's say you buy a stock when it breaks out of its base and clears its correct buy point, but then it starts to pull back. What to do? One option: Sell all or most of the position and protect gains. Another strategy? Hang on to see if the stock can rebound quickly or form a base on base.A base-on-base pattern, like the name suggests, is a base that forms on top of a base. It usually occurs during a period of market turmoil, when even strong stocks come under pressure and consolidate rather than march higher.For a base-on-base pattern to be viable, the new base must form before the stock has risen 20% above its buy point from the initial base. It's OK for the upper structure to fall back to or below the lower pattern's buy point.But if the upper part falls 7% to 8% below the first base's buy point, sell shares to cut losses if you bought at the first breakout. That's simply following the golden rule of investing.Base-on-base patterns can be deceptive. It's easy to view the stock as a failure because it consolidates so quickly after its breakout. But the structure often produces powerful breakouts once a new market uptrend begins.""It's like a spring that is being held down by the pressure of a heavy object,"" IBD founder and former Chairman William J. O'Neil wrote in ""How to Make Money in Stocks."" ""When the bearish phase in the overall market ends, as it always does, this stock is more apt to be one of the first to emerge at a new high en route to a huge gain.""A base-on-base pattern is considered a single structure, not two separate bases, and it's the second part of the pattern that's most important. It should be a properly formed base with a well-defined buy point.Ancestry.com, a provider of family history information, cleared a 21.45 buy point from a base-on-base on Sept. 20, 2010, in triple its average daily trade (1).  At the time, its Accumulation-Distribution Rating was a best-possible A+. Sales growth had accelerated for four straight quarters.The second half of the base began forming in mid-August, when the market was in a correction. Notice how volume was light in the down weeks.The stock began picking up in early September as a new market uptrend began. Ancestry.com more than doubled over the next seven months, hitting a peak of 45.79 on April 29, 2011.Let's fast-forward to the 2017-2018 time frame. Have many top-rated stocks built the base on base and busted out to new highs, enriching alert IBD-style investors? You bet.Salesforce.com (CRM), a member of the IBD Big Cap 20, slowly rose out of a long saucer with handle and a 84.50 buy point during the week ended April 7, 2017. The stock rallied hesitantly. By early June, the cloud-based business software giant got only as high as 91.99, up less than 9%. Then it crawled sideways for seven weeks.That action formed a tight, shallow, flat base. A new buy point in late July arrived at 92.09. Since then, Salesforce has risen a very respectable 42% in less than a year.Micron Technology (MU) formed a base on base from March to September 2017. In the second base, the stock dove deep into the belly of the first base. That's unusual but not surprising, given that in this case Micron's first base was nearly wafer-thin in its decline (from 29.87 to 26.37, a mere 12% correction).Micron formed a short handle on its second base, an 11-week double-bottom base, and ran past a 33.12 entry during the week ended Sept. 15, 2017. The data-storage play has since sprinted nearly 92% higher, reaching as high as 63.42.(Editor's Note: Ancestry.com was acquired by European private equity firm Permira in December 2012.

The company's family of Impella heart pumps are regularly winning regulatory approval for new uses.CEO Michael Minogue said at the company's earnings call in late April that with Impella, ""we are still in the early innings with a penetration rate of approximately 9% of 231,000 patients in the U.S. alone.""The early innings angle is exactly what bulls like to hear.• A new factor for Salesforce.com is new customers. According to International Data Corporation, a market intelligence provider, Salesforce.com increased its market share in 2017 by more percentage points than 19 top competitors combined.Salesforce also chalked up a new item when it acquired MuleSoft.CEO Marc Benioff said at the May 29 earnings call that, ""So many of the CEOs I spoke with told me that data remains locked in their legacy systems, and is holding them back. With MuleSoft, we're now enabling our customers to connect all of their data across any public or private cloud.""MuleSoft was a March 2017 initial public offering with $296 million in sales.• Edwards Lifesciences makes heart valves and other products for cardiovascular disorders.CEO Michael Mussallem said at the April earnings call that therapy penetration for transcatheter aortic valve replacement is still low. That means Edwards is still on the young side of the growth curve.• Software security provider Palo Alto Networks has a new CEO, ex-Google executive Nikesh Arora.

Each of them has a relative strength line that is holding up strongly and near new highs in the stock market today.XFANG stock Facebook (FB) quietly pulled back into the 5% buy range from a cup with handle's 188.42 buy point over the past week. Shares moved back out of buy range Thursday with a 3% advance. Analyst firm BTIG raised its price target on the social media giant from 175 to 275 — a 36% increase. Shares added 2% Friday.Recent weakness in the stock was caused by continuing probes into Facebook and CEO Mark Zuckerberg over the Cambridge Analytica scandal.Salesforce.com (CRM) also briefly dipped back into buy range last week before rebounding nicely. The software stock is about 10% above a 128.97 flat-base entry. Salesforce is the No. 1-ranked stock in the Computer Software-Enterprise group with a highest-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating.

It is currently in week four of a potential formation; the minimum length of a flat base is five weeks.

2346,CRM,"The breadth of industries that feature stocks hitting new highs continues to be wide. On Tuesday, Salesforce.com (CRM), Five Below (FIVE) and Dillard's (DDS) are giving investors opportunities to add new positions to their portfolios.Salesforce, a June 2004 IPO, is up more than 2% for the week as shares continue to drive past a 128.97 buy point in a seven-week cup pattern.The 5% buy zone extends up to 135.42. Thus, the stock remains in the permissible buy range.Notice on a daily chart how the RS line, painted in blue, continues to pump into new high ground. Good. It confirms that the enterprise software play is beating the S&P 500. Since its February 2017 breakout from a first-stage base at 80.47, Salesforce has rallied more than 65%.The San Francisco-based firm has emerged as a real force of change within its field. CEO Marc Benioff, who left Oracle (ORCL) to start Salesforce, pushed for a new business model in which customers could download customer relationship management (CRM) software straight from the internet onto their computers — with no stacks of CDs to upload into their desktops. Salesforce sought to make its products affordable and easy to use.Today, the company has excelled in going beyond the CRM space and into service, marketing, data analytics, collaboration and AI. It continues to win multiple large contracts.In its April-ended first quarter, Salesforce achieved another milestone. Revenue grew 25% to $3.01 billion, marking the first time it logged $3 billion in quarterly sales. Salesforce had a total $3.05 billion in revenue for the entire fiscal year ended in January 2013.On a quarterly basis, revenue has grown 25%, 27%, 25%, 25%, 27%, 25%, 27%, 26%, 25% and 25% vs. year-ago levels in the past 10 periods.Five Below has cleared a 78.38 entry in a six-week flat base. The Philadelphia-based retail innovator, popular among kids who can spend their allowances on items priced at $5 or less, reports fiscal Q1 results after the close on Wednesday.The Street sees earnings up 120% to 33 cents a share on a 25% rise in sales to $291.4 million. That would mark the biggest year-over-year profit increase since a 175% leap in the quarter ended July 2013.Five Below joined IBD Leaderboard as an earnings-related call option play on Wednesday.Dillard's rose more than 5% and reached as high as 93.58 intraday. At that price, shares stood more than 5% past the 88.61 buy point in a 12-week cup. Disciplined buying means grabbing shares when they are no more than 5% past the proper entry.While on a daily chart Dillard's may have showed handle-type action from May 21 to June 1, such a handle is invisible on the weekly chart. Treat that shakeout period as more attempts by the stock to build the right side of the cup.Dillard's has posted big earnings growth in the past two quarters (up 52% to $2.82 a share and up 36% to $2.89 on an adjusted basis) as the Little Rock, Ark., company ended a nine-quarter drought in sales growth with top-line gains of 6% in fiscal Q4 and 3% in Q1. The Street sees sales inching up 1% to $1.47 billion in the July-ending second quarter.Dillard's joins Kohl's (KSS) and Macy's (M) as new emerging leaders within the retail sector.

2348,CRM,"The outlook for growth stocks is good, based on projections for corporate earnings growth, say mutual fund managers that IBD spoke with. What managers aren't sure of is whether the pace of corporate earnings growth — and thus the outlook for growth stocks — will continue to speed up.""We continue to see a constructive environment for earnings,"" said Charles Shriver, lead manager of $2.5 billion T. Rowe Price Personal Strategy Balanced (TRPBX) and $437.4 million Global Allocation (RPGAX) funds. ""But earnings may have hit a peak in the first quarter. We do still see opportunities. But they will be driven more by individual names.""But John Wilson, lead manager of $3.8 billion Columbia Large Cap Growth Fund (LEGAX), sees an ongoing clear runway for growth stocks in the technology space, where he finds the bulk of his opportunities. ""We continue to have a strong earnings backdrop,"" he said. ""In technology in May, we saw a continuation of many of the same trends we saw in 2017: strength as companies moved to digitize their business operations, and an ongoing move to more digitization moving forward.""And digitization is getting a boost from federal government policy. ""A lot of companies have additional cash flow from tax reform last year, so we see companies deploying that within technology and other capital projects to improve their competitiveness,"" Wilson said. ""That helped outperformance in May by technology stocks and growth stocks more broadly.""The S&P 500 gained 2.41% in May.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBest Mutual Funds Monthly Performance ReportSmall caps thrived amid headlines that drove investors to seek safe havens in U.S. stocks. The on-and-off prospect of a trade war was one factor that pushed investors into small caps, which tend to derive the bulk of their revenue and earnings from the U.S., said Shriver.In addition, May headlines focused attention on Italy, which was about to elect a populist coalition that is seen as skeptical of the European Union. ""When there is concern about overseas events, U.S. small caps tend to outperform,"" Wilson said.Reflecting that tilt toward U.S. stocks, world equity funds lagged U.S. diversified stock funds, losing 1.09% on average last month.China region funds were the only foreign stock fund category to gain in May, climbing 2.82%. In sharp contrast, Latin American funds plunged 12.48%.Among sectors, science/technology funds outpaced all other categories, gaining 6.29% in May. Global sci-tech funds were close behind, rising 6.12%. Health/biotechnology funds tacked on 4.82%. The energy sector was also strong.Wilson said the digitization trend benefits growth stocks that enable customers to shift to cloud computing from on-premise software. It also benefits companies that are involved in digital advertising and marketing, he said. ""Whether it is Microsoft (MSFT) or Adobe (ADBE) or Salesforce.com (CRM) or ServiceNow (NOW), we're seeing strong end demand drivers based on the need for a lot of corporate America to take important steps to make themselves part of the growth in the digital economy,"" Wilson said.Microsoft continues to benefit from growth in its Azure cloud computing service. ""Microsoft is doing a strong job of using their legacy enterprise relationships to help companies migrate their business processes and operations to the cloud,"" Wilson said.Wilson added that corporate America sees the shift to the cloud as a key strategy for survival. Two to four years ago, companies' purchasing managers talked with Microsoft about their computing needs. ""Today these discussions involve CEOs and CFOs,"" he said.His fund also holds Micron Technology (MU). ""They're a leading provider of memory, which is now going incrementally into new applications in data centers as well as into artificial intelligence and machine learning,"" he said.In health care, Abiomed (ABMD) was a top holding of $11.2 billion Primecap Odyssey Aggressive Growth (POAGX) as of March 31.

Salesforce.com (CRM) and other software stocks have been winners. Payment stocks are a pocket of strength. Many retail names, from Lululemon (LULU) to TJX (TJX) have been strong. Energy stocks from Chevron (CVX) to Marathon Oil (MRO) are doing well, but are subject to the ups and downs of crude oil prices. Biotechs are trying to make a recovery, with Biogen (BIIB) skyrocketing Friday on positive Alzheimer's drug news.Meanwhile, chips are still well off their highs, a bad sign for any stock market rally.

Trump also threatened tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports. But for now, Wall Street has decided the Trump trade impact has been priced into stocks.If you look at the Nasdaq composite over the last several months, the tech-heavy index looks like it broke out on June 1, rallied for a few weeks, then erased those gains before rebounding again last week from its 50-day moving average.The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones have been consolidating since late January, with the S&P 500 in somewhat better shape.Stocks, even top stocks, tend to track the broader stock market. But sector rotations into and out of China internets, software stocks and energy names have left many individual stock charts looking more volatile.Amazon stock and especially Netflix stock have been two of the biggest stock market winners in 2018.

A solid gain in heavy volume could offer a buying opportunity. Alternatively, Okta could continue to consolidate for a few weeks, forming a new base and buy point.Collaboration software maker Atlassian (TEAM) broke out last October. Anyone holding Atlassian stock since then would be sitting pretty. Since then the stock has staged a few failed breakouts but still moved up, generally following its 50-day.

The Hang Seng has let an 11.9% year-to-date gain shrivel to less than 0.5%.Despite the decline in Chinese mainland equities, Autohome, a member of IBD Leaderboard since Jan. 2 this year, scored a new breakout from a rare pattern called the ascending base. In such a pattern, the stock has already broken out but then posts three quick corrections of around 10% to 20% over a nine- to 16-week period. The stock must make a new high before each correction; hence, it's an ""ascending base.""Autohome focuses on advertising and marketing of automobiles through its website. The company's earnings have grown 28%, 15%, 39%, 58%, 82% and 53% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters. Analysts see Q2 earnings rising 23% to 87 cents a share.On Jan. 2, Autohome had initially cleared a 17-week base that shows elements of a double bottom. This base gave a 67.79 standard buy point.A narrow five-day handle formed on the tail end of the base. That provided a slightly lower buy point of 65.67, a dime above the handle's high. That handle began forming on Dec. 22 last year and the resulting lower entry is very close to the 66.55 ""alternative entry point"" created by the middle interim peak wedged in between the two sell-offs within the base.Check out this recent Investor's Corner column on how a chart pattern can lead to more than one correct interpretation of the stock's current balance of supply (AKA sellers) vs. demand (buyers) and the proper time to buy.On the Leaderboard daily and weekly charts, users can see chart annotations placed in real time on specific buy points, including bases and follow-on entry points.Elsewhere, software sector leader Salesforce.com (CRM) rallied as much as 4.4% and struck a new high of 132.55 before pulling back and giving up nearly half of that impressive gain.

HDFC's 50-day average turnover is a healthy 826,000 shares per day.

There was no dollar figure despite Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow suggesting previously that China had agreed to buy $200 billion more in U.S. goods.Last week the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite all rose Monday but closed the week modestly lower.

2372,CRM,"Top stocks have a lot of common traits, including strong fundamentals, excellent mutual fund sponsorship and a top-notch management team, among other things.Another common trait of top stocks? Strong price performance, otherwise known as relative price strength.Investors have a decision to make every day in the stock market. Some choose to focus on stocks that are far off highs — the ones on sale that look like they can't get any cheaper. But IBD readers know this is a risky strategy. Why? Because weak stocks often get weaker due to deteriorating fundamentals, shrinking market share, and a host of other factors.Another common trait of weak price performers is that institutional sellers have sometimes been busy unloading shares. That begs the question: Does it really make sense to own a stock that institutional investors are selling with abandon? The answer is a resounding no. These stocks might seem inexpensive, but they're cheap for a reason.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIBD's Relative Price Strength (RS) Rating helps you identify the market's strongest performers. Stocks are rated on a 1-99 scale with 99 being the best. Stocks rated 99 have outperformed 99% of the stocks in IBD's database over the past 12 months.But the path to outperformance isn't only about targeting stocks with the highest RS ratings. Many can be extended in price, or too late to buy, after recent base breakouts. Others might be extended after recently finding support at the 50-day moving average for the first time after a breakout.The trick is to find the strongest performers with high RS ratings as they build new bases. The accompanying table is a select group of stocks from IBD growth screens like IPO Leaders, Sector Leaders and the IBD Big Cap 20. All have healthy charts and are potentially actionable as they consolidate gains.Keep in mind that a large-cap growth screen like the Big Cap 20 will house some stocks with lukewarm RS ratings below 80. In many cases, though, stocks like this boast healthy charts.The reason for an RS Rating in the 60s or 70s, for example, is because large-cap stocks tend to be slower-moving than a high-octane growth stock. Recent IPOs with a limited trading history might start off with seemingly low RS ratings as well.In a recent Big Cap 20 screen, ServiceNow (NOW) offered a good example when it was setting up in a flat base with a 176.66 buy point. At the time, its RS Rating was 96. Group peer Salesforce.com (CRM) also boasted a healthy RS Rating of 86 when it was recently forming a base with a 129.97 entry.RELATED:Best Stocks To Watch Showing Rising Relative StrengthA Stock Breakout Specialty Tool: The Relative Strength LineBest Stocks To Buy And Watch (With High RS Ratings)

However, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones briefly crossed above their 50-day moving averages but once again found resistance at that key level.

2378,CRM,"Look out, index huggers! The stock market is shifting in a direction that favors active managers and stock pickers, says T. Rowe Price fund manager Ann Holcomb. That should boost prospects for the stock mutual funds she helps run, whose portfolio holdings include leading stocks like Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Red Hat (RHT) and Mastercard (MA). Two of her funds have already done well in a variety of past markets, having outperformed the S&P 500 in calendar 2017 as well as over the three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31.Only 10% of U.S. diversified stock funds with at least $100 million in assets pulled off that four-for-four feat, which makes them winners of the 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner.The market is rotating to the benefit of active managers and stock pickers because of heightened volatility, says Holcomb, one of three managers of $635 million T. Rowe Price Capital Opportunity (PRCOX) and its institutional clone, $654 million Institutional U.S. Structured Research (TRISX).Holcomb's funds bear an additional distinction. While Holcomb and her co-managers Jason Polun and Tom Watson oversee the portfolios and keep their eyes on the big picture, T. Rowe Price lets a team of some 30 analysts make buy and sell decisions for the fund. Each analyst runs his or her own sleeve, or segment, of the portfolio. It's like a professional sports team. Coaches oversee the team, but it's the players who score and play defense. Delegating that much responsibility to analysts is rare in the stock mutual fund world.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHolcomb, who is 46 years old, discussed the funds' investment approach with IBD from her office in Baltimore, Md.IBD: How does the market environment impact Capital Opportunity?Holcomb: We've had years of low volatility, high correlations (among stock performances) and compressed dispersion. That's challenging for stock pickers. There's no extra reward for good stock picking if all stocks move together.But now, volatility is increasing and correlations are going down. That should continue as interest rates rise. That helps active managers in addition to stock pickers. They're the ones who can take advantage of mispricing vs. underlying stock values that our analysts discover.IBD: Why do rising rates cause that dispersion?Holcomb: They're not necessarily the cause, but they help. Companies that have been supported by free or low-cost money now get (somewhat) taken out of the market. High quality companies take market share.IBD: Your two funds are the only T. Rowe Price portfolios that let analysts make buy-sell decisions. Why use that approach? Is it because 30 minds are better than three?Holcomb: It was the idea of our current CEO, Bill Stromberg, when he became director of research in the late 1990s. Our analysts are experts. Bill wanted to showcase their stock picking by having them manage a portfolio within a risk-controlled framework. We limit how much their industry and sector weights deviate from the S&P 500.IBD: What's left for you portfolio managers to do?Holcomb: We have what we call an oversight committee. It consists of the named PMs and portfolio specialist Jennifer Martin. We decide which analysts join the team. We also look at how much of the S&P each analyst covers.We monitor the overall profile of the portfolio daily. This comes in the form of risk monitoring, looking at components of active risk, any tilts that develop in terms of looking more growthy or valuey. We're also analyzing the analysts' performance.We're also ensuring that there is consistency between their positioning in this portfolio and what they advocate (for other funds). We engage with our large, institutional clients as well.Also, we manage a monthly rebalancing process in which any positions that are outside our risk limits are brought back in line.IBD: Intuitive Surgical has been volatile since November. But it's in a long uptrend. What's driving that?Holcomb: Its fundamentals continue to improve. Analysts have raised their estimates. When companies deliver like that, sometimes it takes time for the market to catch up.We've had a big position for some time. Our analyst Jon Wood has a very favorable view. It's a bet on computer assisted robotic surgery, a bet that it becomes more mainstream. It's been adopted in urology and gynecology. Our analyst sees it being used more in general surgery.IBD'S TAKE: Learn why Intuitive Surgical hit a record high after reporting first-quarter results.IBD: The fund has trimmed its exposure to Red Hat. Do you still like it?Holcomb: Red Hat is the prime beneficiary of the increased use of open source software, driven by cloud computing. They have leadership in Linux. So Red Hat has a strong core, which is successfully expanding into cloud software.Analysts change their positioning for many reasons.... (In trimming the position in) Red Hat, which remains overweight in the fund relative to its weight in the S&P 500, analyst Ken Allen used it as a source of funds to reduce his underweight in Oracle (ORCL) (due to) the analyst's view that its prospects are improving.IBD: You hold Mastercard as well as Visa (V). Do you like one more than the other?Holcomb: They are largely doing the same thing. Looking at Mastercard, our analyst Jon Friar sees it as a sustainable mid- to high-teens earnings per share grower. Both companies benefit from the movement of payments from cash and checks to electronic. They have high incremental margins, pricing power and strong free cash flow conversion.With regard to Mastercard, they have a willingness to invest in next generation products, such as their acquisition (last year) of (U.K.-based payments technology company) Vocalink.Mastercard has a very attractive business model, with high barriers to entry.IBD: Why has the fund trimmed its stake in PayPal (PYPL)?Holcomb: Our analysts prioritize within their own sleeves. Our PayPal thesis has been that it can materially outperform due to monetizing their Venmo asset, or using their balance sheet to buy back shares or for some accretive M&A or if they have some core business surprises.Our trim in PayPal was because its valuation was not as attractive as some other names. We used it as a source of funds for those more attractive names. But, long-term, we see some PayPal characteristics that can still be in play, so it's still in the portfolio.IBD: Earnings per share growth in SVB Financial (SIVB) has accelerated for five quarters in a row. What's your thesis for this stock?Holcomb: Generally, SVB does well heading into a Federal Reserve (money) tightening cycle like the one we're in, and the market has not fully valued its deposits strength. We're looking at the potential for it paying a dividend. Usually, paying a dividend opens your investor base. So we started a position in March.IBD: Which do you prefer with S&P Global — its index business or its ratings business?Holcomb: It does have a lot of businesses. It is a compounder. It should grow earnings per share at a double-digit pace. It should improve its margins through cost cutting and price increases.Its ratings business has a market-leading share. And it is returning capital to shareholders.Also, its tax rate fell with implementation of tax reform.After the financial crisis, regulation of its space increased, but that just made it more difficult for competitors to get into their business, deepening the moat around their business.Like PayPal, Red Hat and Mastercard, S&P Global is a leader that is pulling further ahead of rivals.They're also shifting to a recurring revenue model, which makes their financials less lumpy and can lift their valuation. About 75% of their revenue is recurring vs. less than 60% five years ago.IBD: What's your thesis for Salesforce.com (CRM)?Holcomb: It pioneered SaaS (software as a service) applications. It remains by far the biggest company in that market. It benefits from a large ecosystem of software, hardware and IT services partners to make its products more valuable and make its market position even larger. And they're another company with a recurring revenues model.IBD: How does Diamondback Energy (FANG) fit into a growth portfolio?Holcomb: Well, we're a core portfolio with exposure to all S&P 500 sectors, including energy. Diamondback is one of the leading operations in the Permian Basin, where they've got a lot of low-cost acreage and can grow production faster with better results than a lot of competitors.They have low financial leverage, and their execution over the last several quarters has been excellent.IBD: Give me an example please of a play that is not part of the S&P 500.Holcomb: Worldpay (WP) is one. They're a combination of merchant acquirer and payments processor. This was Vantiv (until its takeover of Worldpay early this year). It has the best collection of assets among public merchant acquirers, and should grow earnings per share at a mid-double-digit pace for an extended time.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE THESE:Want To Be A Millionaire?

2382,CRM,"Salesforce.com (CRM) jumped Thursday as several analysts hiked their price targets following fiscal 2018 fourth-quarter results that topped views, but with this software maker the Street is watching other key metrics in addition to profit and sales.X One is billings — mainly deferred revenue, received in advance for subscription services — and in the fourth quarter Salesforce came through with flying colors, analysts say. Billings grew by 28% to $5.6 billion, well ahead of the high end of guidance and consensus expectations of 17% growth.Many analysts also were impressed by the company's fourth-quarter bookings growth. Adam Holt, analyst at MoffettNathanson, views them as key.""The bar was set high with bookings growth of 39% year-over-year in Q3 but 55% bookings in Q4 was ridiculous at north of a $20 billion run rate,"" he said in a note to clients. ""If there was hair on the print, it was decelerating constant currency revenue growth, but bookings are the most important indication of business strength.""Bookings include changes in off balance-sheet revenue, or the ""unbilled"" sales. Ross MacMillan, an RBC Capital analyst, called fourth-quarter results a ""bookings bonanza"" in a report. MacMillan hiked his price target to 130 from 120.Another key metric, some say, is ""backlog,"" a financial metric related to bookings. Jennifer Lowe, UBS analyst, considers this critical, noting that Salesforce again came through on that front.""The standout (Q4) performer was unbilled deferred revenue (up 48% to $13.3 billion),"" she said in a report.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!The glowing reviews came amid a raft of price target hikes for Salesforce.

This ETF picks stocks of companies that are deemed to have competitive advantages or ""moats"" which make their fundamental performance more predictable and are undervalued according to a traditional discounted cash flow analysis.

Utilities have been sold off on concerns around rising interest rates, but we don't expect long-term rates to rise much.Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO). This is a market-cap-weighted emerging markets ETF with a low 0.14% expense ratio that gives exposure to the largest, growing emerging market companies as well as those in China. Emerging markets have started to perform over the last year after essentially a lost decade. Returns going forward are expected to be higher than for every other asset class on a long-term basis. We expect emerging markets to be the best beneficiaries of higher commodity prices and firming global growth late in the business cycle.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Which Sectors Does Market Pro Expect To Outperform This Year?AI, Robotics, Blockchain Among Hot New ETF Industry TrendsBig-Cap Techs, Brazil Lead Past Month's Top-Performing Stock Plays

2390,CRM,"Oracle (ORCL) Chief Executive Safra Catz said Monday she discussed the U.S. Defense Department's cloud-computing contract with President Trump, and told him the Pentagon's plan to find only one provider isn't a sound strategy.""It just made no sense,"" she told journalists at Oracle's offices in Petach Tikva, Israel. ""I never heard of something like a single cloud and I would challenge anyone to point at a significant commercial customer who has one cloud.""The Pentagon intends to award a single contract for multiyear cloud services. The contract could go to one team made up of multiple companies. A final request for proposals, which outlines a contract as long as 10 years, is scheduled to be released in May and awarded by the end of September.Catz, who shares the title of CEO with Mark Hurd, usually keeps a lower profile than her colleague, except when it comes to Oracle's affairs in Washington, D.C. Bloomberg reported earlier that she criticized the bidding process at a private dinner with Trump earlier this month.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCatz added that the procurement process seemed designed to benefit Amazon.com's (AMZN) AWS, which rivals some of Oracle's computing and storage products.""I have no idea why they were given unfair advantage,"" she said Monday. ""I have no idea why anyone would think that is a good idea.""Trump told her that ""he was very confident that the Pentagon would have a fair review,"" she said.Oracle has led a campaign in Washington to prevent Amazon from winning the Defense Department contract, Bloomberg has reported. Catz's company has cooperated with Microsoft (MSFT) and IBM (IBM), among others, on the effort, which has included lobbying lawmakers, defense officials and the White House.Israel-born Catz served on the executive committee of Trump's transition team before he was sworn into office. She later joined his administration's American Technology Council, which focused on government modernization.Under Catz, Oracle has orchestrated a transition to cloud-based products after decades as a mainstay of traditional corporate computing software. The shift hit a snag when the company's cloud sales growth slowed down, sending its stock tumbling the most in more than six years last month.The Redwood City, Calif.-based company was a late entrant to the cloud, and has continued to face stiff competition. That includes rivals Amazon, Microsoft and Salesforce.com (CRM), all of which have continued to boost their internet-based software offerings.Catz said the company's numbers last year were impacted by a change in the licensing model that gave the impression of slower growth. ""As this evens out, I think we will start to see cloud acceleration that is very significant. But I don't want to time that right now.""Oracle shares gained 0.4% to close at 46.05 on the stock market today. They have fallen 11% since the company's disappointing earnings release last month.

2401,CRM,"Older advisors often share bits of wisdom with newly minted planners. But seasoned pros might also learn something from upstarts.Shaped by their tech-savvy upbringing, financial planners in their 20s and 30s are eager to dish out advice to their more experienced colleagues. You just have to ask them.These newcomers realize that they don't know it all. As much as they welcome supportive guidance from veteran advisors, they may chafe if treated with bossy condescension.""Mentoring young planners using encouragement and trust will breed confidence,"" said Jeff Realejo, a 25-year-old certified financial planner in Pompano Beach, Fla. That's better than telling them what to do and how to do it.For example, asking, ""Why don't you try this?"" is more effective than declaring, ""You should do it this way."" Granting them the autonomy to make their own decisions — and learn their own lessons — contributes to a richer, more rewarding work environment.If you've developed a well-oiled machine after decades of building a successful practice, you may figure there's no reason to alter a winning formula. But fledgling planners may offer useful suggestions to stay one step ahead as you navigate your business into an uncertain future.""The pace of change is rising rapidly, especially if you want to attract younger clients,"" said Ashley Foster, a certified financial planner in Houston. ""If you've been doing something for 30 years and it has been working for you, you may not want to change. But change will pass you by whether you like it or not.""An increasing number of millennial clients — born in the 1980s and early 1990s — prefer to interact online. Advisors with easy-to-access digital platforms can appeal to this demographic.Foster, 34, would advise his elders to embrace new technology now, not later. Waiting to apply the latest tech tools ""until something begins to disrupt your livelihood"" is misguided, he warns.He recommends that older advisors ask two questions when weighing an investment in technology: ""How will it help me operate more efficiently?"" and ""How will it help provide more value to my clients?""""Using new financial planning software instead of relying on outdated and less comprehensive software can save you time you'd spend creating spreadsheets,"" Foster said. ""I'd say be open-minded about changes to our industry, not just technological but also regulatory and business-model changes. Don't look at these changes as a roadblock; look at them as an opportunity.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFoster's prior business partner, an advisor for 50 years, initially resisted some of these changes. But Foster gradually persuaded him to come around — and he's now enjoying helping clients with a fresh emphasis on holistic financial planning.To improve their daily business operation, Foster recommends that longtime advisors rethink workflow procedures and client service delivery. He cites advances in customer relationship management (CRM) platforms.""A lot of advisors either use Microsoft Office/Outlook as a CRM or nothing at all,"" he said. ""It may have worked for them in the past, but today there are many customizable CRM solutions built specifically for financial planners to help them increase productivity.""Misconceptions abound about integrating cutting-edge technology. Some advisors assume the transition from aging systems to agile ones will prove long and frustrating.""Don't think that technology is too hard or will take too much time to learn,"" said Lucas Casarez, a 31-year-old certified financial planner in Fort Collins, Colo. ""This may have been the situation in the past with old legacy systems. But in the last four or five years, advances have made the technology easier"" to adopt.Embracing low-cost automation can win over both junior associates at your firm and your clients. Aside from efficiency gains, going paperless can signal to your team that the firm wants to evolve with the times.For example, Casarez favors e-signature apps. He says that DocuSign ""is so easy that clients in their 60s and 70s can use it and they like it.""He also urges older advisors to cultivate wet-behind-the-ears planners by creating an appealing organizational culture. Providing ongoing constructive feedback on their performance and affording them ample pathways to learn and grow on the job will solidify your relationship with them.""The younger generation is more focused on values than dollar signs,"" Casarez said. ""It's the same with culture. If they feel your firm is doing the right things — reinvesting in the community through volunteerism, reinvesting in employees by sending them to conferences and helping them earn professional designations — they're more likely to buy into the culture and stay over the long term.""YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Creative Prospecting Helps Advisors Grow Their BusinessAttentive Advisors Create A Comfortable Space For Clients To ShareWhen Clients Acquire Vast Wealth, Advisors Are A Priceless Resource

2416,CRM,"Wall Street showed continued confidence in the economy on Thursday as FAANG companies and other market leaders flexed strength in stocks today. The buying surge offset weak moves by some names in the apparel retail, department-store and bank industries.The Nasdaq composite roared more than 1.3% higher by day's end and notched a new all-time high of 7823, up 13.3% for the year. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average trailed with gains of nearly 0.8% to 0.9%. Volume ran nearly 10% higher vs. Wednesday on the Nasdaq and fell nearly 5% on the NYSE, according to preliminary data.Among the FAANG plays, Netflix (NFLX) cooled off with a 1.2% decline to 413.50 in trading that boosted 43% above usual levels. Yet the stock holds a comfortable cushion above its rising 50-day moving average. The Leaderboard member is up 115% year to date. The four other FAANG techs advanced 1.5% to 2.4%.Apple (AAPL), up 1.7% to 191.11, has now risen 6.7% past a 179.04 proper buy point in a seven-week double bottom.Meanwhile, enterprise software companies firmed up their leadership role with more gains. Two top names in HR, finance and payroll management, Workday (WDAY) and Paycom Software (PAYC), advanced more than 4% and 3%, respectively. Paycom's turnover came in 9% below its 50-day average. But it was also the highest in more than two weeks.Workday joined the IBD Leaderboard as the 10th current stock in the hand-selected list of top growth companies. It triggered an aggressive entry point in a Shakeout+3 pattern. Workday also has been forming a double-bottom base, one of the eight bullish patterns that every growth investor needs to know to time their buys in the strongest market leaders.More than 2.6 million Workday shares exchanged hands on Thursday, 38% above its 50-day average.In general, seek out those highly rated stocks that form solid bases, then break out past a proper entry in volume at least 40% above average. Huge volume on the breakout day boosts the chance that a growth investor will make money in a relatively short period of time. Sometimes, however, big volume can arrive in the days after a breakout.The Nasdaq 100, tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that all-electronic exchange, rose 1.5%. Within the FAANG names, Alphabet (GOOGL) rallied 2.6% to 1201 and notched a new all-time closing high.The stock is close to surpassing a new handle on its nearly six-month chart pattern, a bullish double bottom. The double bottom features two sell-offs, and the second low must undercut the first low. If no handle forms, the typical buy point is 10 cents above the middle peak in between the two lows.While the Google search engine, AI and self-driving-car company has not been seeing the triple-digit growth that it once enjoyed soon after its 2004 IPO, it's still showing solid growth as a megacap company.In 2017, Alphabet grew profit by 29% to $35.90 a share as revenue rose 23% to $110.86 billion, eclipsing the $100 billion level for the first time.The Street sees earnings climbing 23% to $44.28 a share in 2019.Revenue has jumped 21%, 20%, 22%, 22%, 21%, 24%, 24% and 26% vs. year-ago levels in the past eight quarters.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Alphabet earns a top-notch A for SMR Rating, which stands for Sales + Profit margins + Return on equity.Alphabet is highlighted in today's IBD Stock Of The Day feature.Workday joined the Leaders list of Leaderboard as it moved further past an aggressive entry of 160.9The daily and weekly charts of Leaderboard names are annotated by senior markets writers to flag critical buy points, timely sell signals, and instances of chart action that indicate unusual strength.Fellow enterprise software names ServiceNow (NOW), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Ultimate Software (ULTI) gained 4%, 2%, and 1.3%, respectively.Software continues to rank as the No. 1 sector among 33 tracked by IBD for mid- to long-term performance. See the full rankings in IBD's NYSE and Nasdaq stock tables.Ultimate Software corrected sharply for two weeks but has rebounded fiercely. Still, its latest action is too narrow to qualify as a proper cup base.The company's earnings jumped 73% to $1.30 a share in Q2, the biggest year-over-year increase in at least 18 quarters. Revenue grew 21% to $276.8 million, a quarterly best.On the downside, Broadcom (AVGO) dragged down the fabless semiconductor industry group. The large-cap designer and maker of many types of electronic chips at one point gapped down more than 18% in huge volume following news that it's buying business software firm CA (CA). Analysts reportedly criticized the decision.Broadcom ranked on the top of the ""Down in Price"" section of IBD's Stocks On The Move table. Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK), Zumiez (ZUMZ) and L Brands (LB) also dropped significantly in huge turnover. That's usually a sign of heavy institutional profit-taking or pure selling.Small caps lagged a touch on Thursday, yet remain leaders in year-to-date performance.The Russell 2000 rose just 0.4%, but at 1690 the popular small-cap index boasts a 10% gain since Jan. 1.

As a result, the portfolio recently has been investing in growth stocks such as Veeva Systems (VEEV), Grubhub (GRUB), Canada Goose Holdings (GOOS), RealPage (RP) and Tyler Technologies (TYL). All are market leaders with IBD EPS Ratings of 90 or higher and Relative Strength Ratings ranging from 99 to 83.This year through June 30, investing in growth stocks like these have brought gains ranging from 24% by enterprise software maker RealPage to 86% by upscale winter wear maker Canada Goose.Federated Kaufmann Small Cap Fund has another trait that stands out. The portfolio has held many of its heavy-hitting stocks since they first came to market.With its team of experts working together to find new companies that the fund can hold long-term, this top mutual fund as of Dec. 31 has beaten the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years. That feat makes it a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAnd it's won the award in three categories: U.S. diversified equity funds, growth funds and small-cap funds. And that's no easy feat: Only 10.4% of eligible U.S. diversified stock funds made the Best Mutual Funds Award list.Fund lead manager Stephen DeNichilo, 42 years old, has been with federated since 2012 and has 20 years investment experience. He discussed his fund's hot streak and other aspects of the team's investment approach with IBD from his team's offices in Manhattan.Best Mutual Funds Monthly Performance ReportBeyond Q2: Stock Fund Managers' Outlook NowMoney Market Funds Back In Bond MixSee Which Stocks The Best Mutual Funds Have Been BuyingBest Mutual Funds: Six Month LeadersBest Mutual Funds: Quarterly LeadersMutual Fund Category PerformanceIBD: Nine portfolio managers guide this fund. Why so many?DeNichilo: There are two lead managers, me and John Ettinger. Each portfolio manager has buy and sell discretion. ... Each manager focuses on different sector verticals — technology, biotech, consumer, financials, software and so on. Industrials, materials and energy are my areas. Our arrangement brings buy and sell decisions closer to the research process.IBD: You've outpaced the broad market in four varying time periods. What enables the fund to outperform so consistently?DeNichilo: The consistent focus of our process. Our sole focus is to find innovative, growing companies regardless of the macro environment's noise.We at Federated have used the same philosophy on our flagship Kaufmann Fund (KAUAX) (now a $6.6 billion midcap growth portfolio) for 30 years. And members of the small-cap fund's team have been working together on average over 15 years.IBD: Why use so many portfolio managers rather than analysts?DeNichilo: When you have companies that are small and growing 15%, 20%, 30% sequentially, things are moving very fast. You need to be on top of those. Our process brings the portfolio manager closer to the research process. The closer, the better. And on top of it, we have senior managers — I am one of them — monitor the portfolio, monitor risk management. They provide a sort of check and balance.IBD: Why does your fund participate in so many initial public offerings?DeNichilo: The team analyzes virtually every IPO that comes to market. I would say, broad brush, we buy anywhere from 25% to 50% of IPOs we see, varying widely throughout the years based on the quality of deals.Each IPO is vetted by the sector PM, who often has a solid working understanding of the company and market segment before the deal comes to market.Over 50% of the fund's holdings were initially bought on IPO. That's one of the most inefficient parts of the market. And buying at IPO gives us a first-mover advantage with a stock.IBD: Why has Veeva Systems trended higher the past couple of months?DeNichilo: This is a stock we've owned since the IPO. It has a fantastic combination of experienced leadership who know what to build and how.This is a SaaS (software as a service) solutions company for the life sciences market. Sort of a Salesforce.com (CRM) for life sciences.They have a proprietary content management platform that's used for medical promotions and regulatory-clinical trials. And it enables their customers to move critical functions in regulatory submissions and manufacturing quality to the cloud. They have a knack for hiring people with deep industry knowledge, who work closely with customers to build what their most advanced customers want, and apps that can be tailored and integrated for high levels of customer success.IBD: Grubhub's earnings per share growth has sped up for three quarters. Why?DeNichilo: This is another name we bought on IPO. They're in an enormous and rapidly growing total adjustable market. They stand to benefit. They're expanding into additional cities. They're signing major restaurant chains like Yum Brands.There's some concern about competition from Uber Eats and DoorDash. But we think the market is large and growing, with room for more than one player. And Grubhub has first-mover advantage and a strong brand name.IBD: Enterprise software maker RealPage has eight straight quarters of increasing ownership by mutual funds. What's this feeding frenzy about?DeNichilo: This is another stock we bought on IPO in 2010. They are a real estate software company that helps solve huge inefficiencies in the property management vertical.They enable property managers to better manage renter life cycles and property management workflow. They are a leader in helping apartment owners manage their property, their tenants, their buildings, schedule repairs and take rental payments.They have a huge amount of recurring revenue, a nice history of hitting their numbers and they are a nice consolidator in the industry.IBD: After two quarters of declining EPS, Canada Goose posted gains of 39%, 48% and 166%. What do you like about them?DeNichilo: We think there's big growth in the consumer functional luxury space. Canada Goose is successful in their wholesale business, and is in the early stages of developing its retail business with just a handful of stores in the U.S. and Canada and Europe. And it's moving its brand beyond winter garments into an all-seasons assortment.The company limits distribution and inventory growth to maintain premium pricing and avoid discounting, which is the death knell for any retailer. Sales have grown in excess of 30% (annually). We think estimates for only 25% growth will prove conservative.IBD: Tyler Technologies is in the same IBD enterprise software group as RealPage. It provides IT management services and software for various levels of government. Why is that attractive to you?DeNichilo: They are a SaaS company for municipalities. They make government more efficient. Their software automates processes. It's used in everything from public safety to small-claims arbitration. It lets everything be done online.IBD: Government is often rapped for being slow and resisting change.DeNichilo: After the financial crisis, when municipalities found themselves in fiscal trouble, they saw the payback and return on investment for using Tyler was so large that they couldn't ignore it.IBD: What's your thesis for Novanta (NOVT), which makes photonics and motion control systems?DeNichilo: We think they are still an undercovered company on Wall Street. Management has done a fantastic job turning the company around, pivoting from cyclical to secular areas. Now they're focused on such secular growth areas as 3D printing, DNA sequencing, robotic surgery and warehouse automation.Novanta allows customers' (devices) to have precise movements down to the micron level. They've reduced their semiconductor exposure from 50% of revenue to less than 10% today. And they're focusing more on industrial automation and next-generation medical processes.IBD: What's the appeal of At Home Group (HOME)?DeNichilo: They're a value player that is taking share in retailing. They showcase a broad, inexpensive assortment of home decor in large-format stores. They were created out of the bankruptcy of the former Garden Ridge.Their productivity remains relatively low with significant opportunity for growth in same-store sales. They have plenty of real estate opportunities as other large-format stories like Sears and Kmart close.They have ability to grow 20% annually. They're not online currently, but that's a longer-term opportunity.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Millennials: Tips For Reaching Goal Of Becoming A MillionaireYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

2431,CRM,"Think of Red Hat (RHT) as a technology company that has reinvented itself not just once, but twice in 15 years.There aren't too many of those around — Netflix (NFLX) comes to mind. And the payoff can be huge for companies that manage to pull it off.While Netflix morphed from DVD renter to movie streamer to new-age Hollywood powerhouse, Red Hat's reinvention is tied to the rise of cloud computing. Like many traditional suppliers of information technology, it has been pressured to adapt.""Red Hat has gambled on a couple of significant cloud technologies or trends,"" said Dennis Smith, an analyst at Gartner Group. ""One of them has come up aces. That's container technology and container adoption. The other bet is on a multicloud strategy. The jury is still out on that.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe software maker's original claim to fame: It led the commercialization of Linux open-source software. Its Linux operating system runs servers in data centers operated by most large U.S. companies.Two years ago, bearish analysts said Red Hat faced a day of reckoning as Corporate America shifted more business workloads to cloud-computing specialists like Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN).""Public"" cloud service providers rent customers shared computing infrastructure, including servers and data storage systems. Aside from AWS, the biggest cloud players are Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and IBM (IBM).Bearish analysts warned that companies would buy less of Red Hat's software for their private data centers and that it could be shut out from the cloud. One worry was that Amazon Web Services offered customers its own version of open-source Linux for free.But Red Hat already pivoted from its core Linux business. The company aimed to build a cloud-friendly app development platform.It also charged into a new cloud technology called containers. By using Red Hat's software containers, corporate developers build custom apps in private data centers and move workloads to public clouds.Red Hat's OpenShift platform combines Linux, container technology, cloud automation tools and software-defined networking for data storage. The OpenShift cloud product is priced 10 times higher than Red Hat's enterprise Linux software.""Our software runs everywhere, (in) on-premise and multiple public clouds. That's part of the story,"" Chief Executive James Whitehurst told Investor's Business Daily in an interview.""The other piece of the story is that, oh, Red Hat isn't dead. It has a much larger addressable market opportunity because Linux is only so big but this next thing is potentially 10 times larger,"" Whitehurst added. ""That combination — Red Hat is not dead and its addressable market — is why you're seeing so much interest in Red Hat and the stock.""Cloud computing marks the latest evolution in Red Hat's business model. In the early 1990s, Red Hat developed its own version of Linux, open-source software. The company gave the software away for free, then sold shrink-wrapped boxed versions in hopes of making money from technical support.A decade later, the Raleigh, N.C.-based company released Red Hat Enterprise Linux for corporate customers. With additional features, RHEL targeted computer servers in on-premise data centers.RHEL enabled the software maker to shift to a subscription-based business model. The company provided customers with software updates via the web.Red Hat next moved into virtualization, or software that enables servers to share business workloads. In that market, it took on powerhouses VMware (VMW) and Microsoft.As the tech industry slowly bounced back from the 2008-09 global recession, Red Hat stock did OK. But it never caught on fire like that of Salesforce.com (CRM), the leader in software-as-a-service. One investor concern was that Red Hat's Linux-related growth might be limited as new rivals leveraged open-source software.In 2017, Red Hat showed signs of gaining traction in cloud computing. Analysts focused on its early lead in container technology. Shares shot up 71% in 2017 and have gained 40% this year.Revenue rose 21% to $2.98 billion in the year ended Feb. 28. Adjusted profit increased 31% to $2.98 a share.At its analyst day in May, the company said its emerging technology segment now has an annual $200 million run rate. Most of that comes from cloud revenue, such as OpenShift.""While RHEL still stands at Red Hat's core, it is clear that OpenShift is its future,"" Oppenheimer analyst Ittai Kidron said in a report to clients.Gartner's Smith says that large RHEL customers have given OpenShift a boost. He says it's unclear if OpenShift will keep its momentum with smaller RHEL users.Red Hat isn't alone in aiming to make it easier for companies to develop apps that can run on multiple public clouds. It competes with Pivotal Software (PVTL), spun off by VMware, Docker and Rancher Labs.Red Hat has an edge, Smith says, as companies steer away from proprietary technologies that could lock them into one vendor for years. The Linux leader's tools enable companies to develop applications that run on cloud infrastructure, a market called platform-as-a-service, or PaaS.""Red Hat provides the most flexible PaaS environment from an infrastructure standpoint, allowing users to runs its solution on private data centers or in any public cloud,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Adam Holt said in his note to clients. ""Pivotal has a similar offering to Red Hat, but not as broad or deep.""Red Hat partnered with AWS, by far the biggest cloud service provider, in 2017. They aimed to make it easier for OpenShift customers to move workloads to the AWS cloud platform.At its investor day in May, Red Hat and Microsoft announced they will jointly offer OpenShift as a managed service on the Azure cloud platform.""While not a needle-mover short term, the Microsoft partnership represents a sizable call option for future growth,"" Matthew Hedberg, a RBC Capital analyst said in a report.Reports surfaced in March that Google's cloud-computing unit was eyeing an acquisition of the Linux leader to boost its presence in the corporate market.""I could see why any cloud provider might say owning Red Hat has value because it would give them more ability to move workloads to their cloud,"" Redhat's Whitehurst said. ""But any cloud provider would also have to recognize that we are neutral and weigh the benefits of having an edge moving workloads with the dis-synergy associated with us losing our Switzerland status.""The company also has been a steady acquirer of startups.In 2006, it bought JBoss for $350 million. With the purchase, Red Hat gained popular enterprise application development tools. In 2015, the company bought cloud automation specialist Ansible for a reported $150 million.In January, Red Hat acquired container platform developer CoreOS for $250 million, marking its largest deal since buying JBoss.""OpenShift will be more formidable once it integrates the recently acquired CoreOS,"" said a Cowen & Co. report on container technology. ""Although we estimate that OpenShift was only 3% of total Red Hat billings (a sales growth metric) in fiscal 2018, we forecast that it will eclipse $300 million in 2020 billings, equating to 7% of total.""The report went on to say: ""Given its financial resources, container focus, and strong recent track record with (mergers), we believe that Red Hat will perhaps uniquely, continue to act as a consolidator of some of the very best innovation in the container market.""Shares of Red Hat gained 1.1% on Friday to 171.06.RELATED LINKS:Sell And Take Profits Or Hold?

2433,CRM,"McDonald's, Chevron and Home Depot each gained 2 points in the stock market today and helped push the Dow Jones industrial average nearly 0.5% higher in afternoon trading Thursday. Tesla rallied again as crude oil rose sharply.Among the Dow Jones' 30 components, eight stocks rallied at least 1 point as U.S. Treasury bonds fell, pushing up yields. Oil rallied sharply.Meanwhile, software stocks dropped en masse, pressuring the Nasdaq. Chip equipment firms, including Lam Research (LRCX) and Applied Materials (AMAT), also took it hard on the chin. Both of these former big winners in 2017 are now in basing mode.At 2:15 p.m. ET, the tech-centered composite fell 0.9%, slightly cutting early losses. The Nasdaq 100 slumped 1.2%, poised to halt a four-day winning streak. The S&P 500 traded virtually flat, down 0.1%. The small-cap S&P 600 fell 0.4% after rising four sessions in a row.Enterprise software shares took a break. In the IBD Sector Leaders screen, Adobe (ADBE), Salesforce.com (CRM), ServiceNow (NOW), RealPage (RP) and Ultimate Software (ULTI) all slid 2% to 3% or more in brisk volume.Tesla (TSLA) has been rising on comments earlier this week by CEO Elon Musk that he's confident the electric vehicle pioneer will ramp up weekly production of the pivotal Model 3 sedan to 3,000 units per week by month's end.The stock has rebounded as much as 35% from its near-term low of 244.59 on April 2. Over the same time frame, the Nasdaq composite has gained 13%.However, please check out the MarketSmith daily chart on Tesla, and you'll see that Tesla is having some trouble climbing back above the 200-day moving average.The 200-day line traces the average closing price of a stock over the past 200 trading sessions, or roughly 10 months' worth of action. As a growth investor, you want to see a stock rise not only above its 50-day moving average but the 200-day line as well.Most of the top dogs in the IBD 50 show such a trend. They're hitting new highs, leading their 50- and 200-day moving averages higher.On the positive side, Tesla now stands just 17% below its 52-week and all-time peak of 389.61. That price represents a fantastic gain since the transportation innovator initially broke out of a stage-one base near 40 back in April 2013.The current base is first stage. Watch to see if the stock can keep muscling higher, slashing through a very visible overhead supply of willing sellers at the 350 to 360 price range.Tesla's sales jumped 68% last year to $11.76 billion, breaking the $10 billion barrier. But the Palo Alto, Calif., company also lost $8.66 a share. The Street sees Tesla bleeding more red ink this year (an estimated net loss of $6.82 a share in 2018), but then earn $2.37 a share in 2019.The company has a $54 billion market cap and 170 million shares outstanding.In contrast, Toyota Motor (TM) has a $201 billion market cap (share price times total shares outstanding) and 1.47 billion shares outstanding. The global car and truck titan had $265 billion in sales in 2017, up 4%.Toyota shares are forming a saucer with a droopy-looking handle. In a bull market, the handle should show a maximum decline of 8% to 12% from high to low. In Toyota's case, the correction within its three-week handle is an acceptable 9%. The provisional buy point is 138.68.McDonald's (MCD) surged more than 3% to 168.48 in active turnover. The world's largest restaurant chain hit a nearly four-month high and is carving a new saucer-style base. The current buy point for now is 178.80.Elsewhere in stocks today, Five Below (FIVE) destroyed short sellers with a 22% gain, extending its run to five sessions. Shares notched an all-time high of 99.91, up 487% from its July 2012 IPO at 17 a share.The operator of stores that sell items at $5 or less reported late Wednesday that earnings in the April-ended first quarter catapulted 133% to 35 cents a share, the biggest for any first quarter. Sales jumped 27% to $296.3 million.Five Below, based in Philadelphia, has aggressively expanded its chain into new markets in the Midwest, Southwest, and California. The stock entered IBD Leaderboard as a call options play ahead of Wednesday's quarterly results.The stock has also risen 27% past a recent breakout point of 78.38 in a well-formed base on base. A seven-week flat base makes up the upper portion of this bullish chart pattern.WTI crude oil futures rallied 1.7% and got as high as $66.07 a barrel. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond eased to 2.95%.Chevron (CVX) posted a bullish gap up, rising 3.75, or nearly 3%, to 127.13. Volume is running mildly above average.Despite the nice gain, the integrated oil major is not yet at a proper buy point.Right now, watch to see if Chevron can rally past the handle portion of its five-month cup with handle. The handle' s high is 131.08, thus generating a 131.18 buy point.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on growth stocks, leading industry sectors in the stock market, breakouts, sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:Should You Buy Stocks Or Sell Now?

2434,CRM,"The IBD Stock of the Day is Akamai Technologies (AKAM), which is hovering just below a buy point. Akamai is nearing the potential entry just after cloud services rival Amazon (AMZN) moved into its own buy zone last week.The cloud-based internet content delivery provider is trading just below a cup-with-handle buy point of 77.69. The stock first tried to clear that level on May 22, but hit resistance and reversed lower.The buy point for Akamai Technologies, which is in IBD's Internet-Network Solutions group, remains valid because the stock only fell as much as 3.5% from that level. A sell signal for the stock would be triggered at a 7%-8% loss.Shares rose 1.4% to 77.07 in Monday's stock market trading.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAmazon, with its fast-growing Amazon Web Services unit, competes with Akamai in internet content delivery services. Amazon stock cleared a buy point of 1,617.54 on Wednesday. It eclipsed the old peak of 1,638.10 on Thursday, offering another entry point. Both moves came in light volume. Amazon climbed 1.45% Monday to 1,665.27, a new high.Akamai's key customers include software stocks Salesforce (CRM), Adobe (ADBE) and Autodesk (ADSK), as well as online brokerages Charles Schwab (SCHW) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC).If and when Akamai attempts a breakout, look for heavy volume on the upside as that indicates support from institutional investors. Also keep an eye out for an upward-sloping relative strength line, which measures a stock's price performance vs. that of the S&P 500. Right now the RS line is trading somewhat sideways. An RS line at a new high during a breakout is a bullish indicator.This base has a handle. When a stock forms a handle on a cup base, that's a positive development. It provides a chance to shake out weak holders before the stock moves higher.Akamai earns an IBD Composite Rating of 91 out of 99. The Composite Rating includes a variety of fundamental and technical factors, including earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity, and relative price performance.Last quarter, the company broke a streak of quarterly earnings declines, with growth of 22%. Akamai also saw its second straight quarter of accelerating sales growth. The tech firm is expected to issue its next quarterly report near the end of June.The Internet-Network Solutions industry group ranks No. 35 out of the 197 industries IBD tracks.

2435,CRM,"While software, semiconductor and internet stocks have enjoyed a productive 2018, cloud computing has had its share of success, too, making First Trust Cloud Computing (SKYY) a leading ETF.Cloud computing is a field that crosses into various industry groups. Companies in IBD's data storage, networking, online retail, enterprise software and other groups are part of the First Trust Cloud Computing portfolio. The ETF breaks down its holdings by software (nearly 39%), internet software and services (14.8%), communications equipment (14.2%) and a few other industries.Only some of the fund's holdings are pure-play cloud companies. First Trust says the holdings are divided among three classes. One is pure plays, another is companies that support cloud providers, and a third type is large companies with broad operations that indirectly use or support cloud computing. That last segment's weight in the portfolio is capped at 10%.With many of the technology giants among its 30 holdings, First Trust Cloud Computing is predominantly a large-cap ETF. The median market capitalization is $40.38 billion. It excludes stocks with less than $100 million in market cap.The largest component is Netflix (NFLX), with more than 7% of the portfolio. Netflix, which started as a DVD rent-by-mail service, is now predominantly a streaming video service. The stock is up more than 70% from a breakout to new highs at the start of the year.Amazon.com (AMZN), the No. 2 holding, may be best known for online retail, but it has a bustling cloud business. In its Q1 earnings report, Amazon said its cloud-computing unit, Amazon Web Services, had revenue of $5.44 billion. That was up 49% and above estimates of about $5.3 billion.Other holdings are Akamai Technologies (AKAM), whose technology improves streaming content; network optimization expert F5 Networks (FFIV); Salesforce.com (CRM), a leader in customer management software on demand; and Zynga (ZNGA), whose games are played on social networks and mobile devices.The ETF on May 7 cleared the 51.26 buy point of a cup-with-handle base and remains in buy range. The relative strength line is trending higher and near new highs, which can be read as a positive sign.Long term, the ETF has been a solid investment. Shares have climbed about 65% since they broke out to new highs nearly two years ago. That July 2016 breakout was important because the ETF beat resistance around 31 that had dogged shares for more than a year.Most of First Trust Cloud Computing's ascent in that time has been smooth, partly because the broad market saw little volatility in 2017. This year, the ETF has been more volatile, reflecting the general market. Shares have slid 12% and 11% in two corrections this year.RELATED:Active Asset Allocation Made Easy With IBD ETF Leaders IndexAmazon Stock Jumps As Earnings Slaughter Views, Prime Fee RaisedSalesforce.com Price Target Hiked; MuleSoft To Spur Cloud Computing

Salesforce paid $2.8 billion in 2016 for Demandware, then its largest deal.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSalesforce.com slowed its pace of acquisitions last year after a flurry of deals in 2016 raised concerns over its core business strength. Now, however, it has put itself back in the acquisition game in a big way, analysts say.""MuleSoft will be the largest deal in (Salesforce's) history and we believe is the highest multiple ever for a significant public SaaS asset,"" Ross MacMillan, analyst at RBC Capital, said in his note.Brent Bracelin, analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, said in his report: ""This is the most expensive public software deal we have seen in recent memory, and we believe exposes a broader willingness toward more expensive (mergers) than in years past.""Still, Wall Street says there are aspects of the deal that make sense. MuleSoft sells software that automates the integration of new tools with legacy enterprise platforms and speeds application development.""We are positive on the deal, if less enthused about the price tag — MuleSoft has built a unique and sticky mission-critical next-generation middleware solution, connecting legacy systems, cloud apps and devices,"" added MacMillan.In the December quarter, MuleSoft revenue rose 60% to $88.7 million. The company reported an adjusted loss of 12 cents a share vs. a loss of 10 cents a year earlier. MuleSoft set a revenue target of $1 billion in 2021 when reporting fourth-quarter earnings.Alex Zukin, analyst at Piper Jaffray, said in a report: ""In its most recent earnings call MuleSoft reported 45 seven-figure customers which is similar to the amount that ServiceNow (NOW) had at the same scale and demonstrates the strategic nature of the company's value proposition.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Why 2018 Software M&A Is Likely To Pick Up, With SaaS Firms EyedAI In Business: This Is What The Future HoldsChart-Reading Basics: How To Find The Correct Buy Point For Leading Stocks

2447,CRM,"The best sector mutual funds last year thrived in several areas, and the number of funds winning IBD Mutual Funds 2018 Awards jumped to 32 from the previous year's 13.This year the best sector mutual funds represented technology, defense and aerospace, media and telecom, health care and retail. Each of the top-performing sector funds not only surpassed the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years, but was also the top fund in its sector ranked by 10-year performance.According to Morningstar, a sector mutual fund invests solely in a general industry — such as technology — or in a more specific industry, like an internet company. But there can be a great deal of overlap among the sectors. For example, Amazon.com featured heavily in three of the five featured sector funds — technology, retail and media — while other FANG stocks held prominent roles as well.The components and weighting within the fund dictate its performance compared with the S&P 500.Technology stocks were among the year's best performers, as institutions flocked to the leading names — like the FANG stocks — in the sector.T. Rowe Global Technology (PRGTX) was the top fund within the U.S. technology sector, coming in with a 47.04% return in 2017, more than doubling the S&P 500's 21.83% return and also trouncing the tech-heavy Nasdaq's 28.2% return. The fund targets potential winners within specific technological themes, like cloud computing.Holdings that drove 2017's outperformance include Big Cap 20 member Salesforce.com (CRM) and FANG stocks Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon.com (AMZN) — a position which has since been sold. The fund also saw big gains from Chinese stock leaders Tencent (TCEHY) and Alibaba (BABA).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs of Dec. 31, the fund had nearly 35% of its assets in its top five holdings, which are exhibiting strong fundamental and technical action.New top holdings include dynamic electric automaker Tesla (TSLA) and Broadcom (AVGO). Shares of Tesla moved up 46% in 2017, but have been mostly stagnant since September 2017. Since then, the stock has been trading sideways in a range from 290 to about 360.Meanwhile, Apple-supplier Broadcom fell victim to slowing iPhone sales, as the stock fell 21% from its highs in early February. The stock is consolidating at its 50- and 200-day moving average lines.The defense industry saw strong gains in 2017, as President Trump boosted military spending.  Blue chip stock and defense leader Boeing (BA) paced the advancers with a gain of nearly 90%.Fidelity Select Defense & Aerospace (FSDAX) jumped 34.21% in 2017. Its top holdings include Dow Jones Industrials name Boeing, Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD).While Boeing and Northrop — up 32% in 2017 — are extended from recent buy points, General Dynamics hasn't had the same torrid advanced and is near a 229.64 flat-base entry.Social media has become a major segment of the media & telecom sector and no company has a larger social media impact than Facebook (FB).T. Rowe Media & Telecommunications (PRMTX) rose 32.99% in 2017. According to Morningstar, the fund is a bit different from the other sector funds in the communications category. While the fund has several communication tower names like American Tower (AMT) and Crown Castle (CCI), it also looks for high-growth companies that are disrupting the industry, like Amazon.The two tower companies had gains of 35% and 28%, respectively, in 2017. As such, the fund's performance was driven by its top three holdings: Amazon.com, Alibaba and Facebook.In a sector not typically known for large advances, health care fund Delaware Healthcare (DLHIX) put in a strong performance in 2017 with a 32.32% rise.The $512 million fund's performance was driven by its position in Germany-based MorphoSys — which advanced nearly 60% — and is involved in the development and research of antibodies. The foreign biotech is also the fund's biggest position as of the end of January at over 7%.Its top U.S.-based position is ethical drugmaker Eli Lilly (LLY), but that didn't spark the fund's 2017 performance, as the stock only rose about 15% last year.Retailers continue to struggle with the Amazon Effect, creating winners and losers within the sector. The obvious retail winner in 2017 was e-commerce giant Amazon.In 2017, Fidelity Select Retail (FSRPX) delivered a 25.82% return due to its long-term investment in the industry leader Amazon.A whopping 40% of the $2.3 billion fund's portfolio is tied to e-commerce giant Amazon (23%) and Home Depot (HD) (17%). Both stocks were paramount to the fund's return in 2017 and will again in 2018 if their positions remain that big.The Fidelity Select Retail fund has owned Amazon since August 2005 — according to Morningstar — while Home Depot was first purchased in August 2008. Last year, Amazon ran up 56%, accounting for a large portion of the fund's annual gains. The stock is trading near its highs and nearly 30% above its most recent buy point — a flat base's 1,213.51 entry.In the meantime, the home improvement retailer had a solid 41% advance in 2017.

2455,CRM,"Advisors sell their experience, expertise and commitment to client service. But most of all, they sell their time.Their success largely revolves around their ability to work efficiently. If they're putting out fires all day, they can wind up exhausted as they constantly race to catch up.Clients can tell the difference between an efficient advisor and a poor time manager. The productive planner runs tight meetings, sticks to a well-orchestrated schedule and rarely runs late. The less organized planner loses track of time, overlooks details and struggles to respond promptly to calls and emails.Sensible work habits drive productivity. Allocating sufficient time to complete critical tasks — and delegating other activities to reliable aides — creates a more effective system.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStaying on track doesn't happen by accident. Savvy advisors master their workflows by scrutinizing their to-do lists, prioritizing the most pressing issues and setting aside time to tackle whatever merits their immediate attention.""Any way we can reduce stress makes us better planners,"" said Kathy Parks, a certified financial planner in Knoxville, Tenn. ""Early on, I learned a good way to do that was to put time on my calendar for what I needed to do so that I no longer had to rush to get ready for a meeting at the last minute.""Parks relies on a carefully crafted calendar to maintain her focus and maximize her productivity. By plotting her workday in advance, she leaves less to chance.Face-to-face meetings — with clients, colleagues and others — can wreak havoc on an advisor's schedule. Conversing in person has its advantages, but it's easy to let time slip away when you're in the same room with someone as you both keep chatting.Parks lays the groundwork for efficient client meetings by planning diligently. Soon after booking an appointment, she blocks out three commitments in her calendar: a time to prepare for the meeting, the meeting itself and a follow-up.""The client meeting is an important part of the process, but so are the things that I need to do before and after that,"" Parks said. ""So if I set a financial planning meeting with a client for May 2, I might enter in my calendar that on April 30 at 1:30 p.m., I'll enter data, do analysis to prepare, and come up with my recommendations. And I'll schedule time to follow up after May 2 to enter my meeting notes into my CRM (customer relationship management system), change a beneficiary, etc.""After many years of using CRM platforms, Parks has learned to save time when typing her meeting notes. She describes client conversations succinctly while thinking ahead.""When you're in CRM, you're talking to three people: your future self, your colleagues and a regulator,"" she said. ""So give all three the gift of clarity in your notes.""As she enters her notes, she asks herself: ""If I'm unfamiliar with this, would I understand what happened and why?"" and ""Would a colleague or regulator who's unfamiliar with this understand what happened and why?""Many advisors treat time management as a daily challenge, examining every hour — even every 15 minutes — on a granular basis. But taking a big-picture perspective helps as well.Every January, Parks maps out her annual calendar. Highlighting her priorities for the coming year, she divvies up her time based on pursuing the most meaningful objectives.""Looking at things globally, I'll work with my colleagues in an intense account-overview process,"" she said. ""It starts with: What are the big rocks that go into my calendar first? Then the smaller rocks, and then the sand.""Her planning doesn't stop there. Every summer, she spends two to three weeks reviewing every client's file. Her goal is to stay one step ahead of what needs to happen for the rest of the year.""It's a deep analysis of each client account, with a list of action items,"" she explained. ""I'm intimately in their world. If a client sold a business earlier in the year, for example, I may plan for a meeting with their CPA in October to discuss tax repercussions.""To allocate the proper amount of time for meetings, Parks follows a few simple rules. For starters, she finds that phone conversations are more efficient than in-person meetings to cover routine issues.If the meeting will benefit from face-to-face discussion, she tries to hold it in her office. She's more apt to stay on track when she hosts visitors.""When you're in your own environment, you can control the meeting far better,"" she said.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Before Aging Clients Show Signs Of Dementia, Advisors Take ActionAdvisors Track Economic Reports To Stay One Step Ahead Of MarketsAdvisors Promote Health And Wellness To Help Clients Live Better

Facebook — under fire over protections of personal data — is shaping a similarly weak chart.But Amazon and Netflix are near record highs, extending their impressive advances. Both have climbed back above the 50-day moving average after shaking off the March sell-off in technology and other shares. Netflix rallied after its latest earnings report, which showed strong subscriber gains.Despite the mixed performance, First Trust Dow Jones Internet remains an ETF Leader, with a gain of 15% so far this year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTo be sure, the FANGs are just four stocks in a portfolio of about 40 companies. But the FANGs do have the greatest weightings. Amazon accounts for nearly 10% and is the single largest holding. Facebook is nearly 8%, Netflix about 6%, and Alphabet class C shares and class A shares nearly 5% each.Another internet stock, PayPal Holdings (PYPL), has slightly more than 5%; most other holdings represent less than 3% of the portfolio. So the fund is definitely tilted toward the largest internet companies. Salesforce.com (CRM), the cloud-based customer management software firm, has been one of the ETF's winners this year, up about 13% from a breakout in January.The ETF tracks the Dow Jones Internet Composite Index, which selects stocks with a three-month average market capitalization of at least $100 million and other liquidity measures. It is weighted by market cap, which explains why the big internet stocks are at the top.  The median capitalization is $8.29 billion, making the fund more of a mid- and large-cap vehicle.Internet stocks tend to trade at a premium valuation, and that's reflected in First Trust Dow Jones Internet's average price-to-earnings ratio of 52.4 (as of March 29).First Trust Dow Jones Internet certainly wasn't launched as a FANG exchange traded fund when it started trading in 2006. But it has tracked the fortunes of the internet sector, including the 2008 bear market.The ETF plunged 62% from a peak in October 2007 to the bottom in November 2008. It swooned 28% in another painful time in 2011, but since then has trended mainly upward.

2494,CRM,"Veeva Systems (VEEV) is a ""coiled spring"" ready to jump, thanks to several growth initiatives.XThat's the contention of Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis, who says Veeva stock has had a mighty run so far in 2018. He adds the cloud-computing firm that focuses on software applications for the pharmaceutical and life-sciences fields has room for further growth.In using the term ""coiled spring"" to describe Veeva's outlook, Davis says the future looks even more prosperous when 2019 comes into view.""Veeva has several growth initiatives in process that range from significant new feature upsells to adjacent customer breadth moves,"" Davis said in a recent note to clients.Pleasanton, Calif.-based Veeva has more than 600 customers in the life-sciences industry, ranging from Big Pharma firms to emerging biotechs.It counts companies like Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK), Novartis (NVS) and Pfizer (PFE) among its customers.Veeva went public in October 2013 at $20 a share, and hit an all-time high of 78.28 on March 8. It managed to avoid most of the carnage in this week's sell-off and shares were down 1% Friday to 74.30.Veeva stock broke out of a 38-week consolidation period with a buy point of 68.17 on Feb. 28, a day after the company posted better-than-expected results for the fiscal fourth quarter and gave guidance that crushed Wall Street's estimates for the current fiscal year.For its current fiscal year, which will end next Jan. 31, Veeva expects to earn an adjusted $1.32 a share, up 43% year over year, on sales of $818 million. That's up 19%, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Analysts were modeling adjusted profit of $1.01 a share on $807 million in sales.Veeva's growth initiatives are likely to reach sufficient scale this year to provide a path to upside to 2019 estimates, Davis said.""If this scenario is correct, investors will figure this out sometime this summer or fall at which point Veeva shares could sustainably move higher,"" he said. Davis rates Veeva stock as buy.Veeva began in 2007 with a software application to help pharmaceutical sales reps organize drug data to make stronger doctor pitches.

2510,CRM,"The 2018 stock market has not been for the faint of heart, having already notched all-time highs and the biggest correction in two years. But some stock mutual funds have found ways to both post gains and surpass major indexes, often with investment strategies that include such stock market leaders as Amazon (AMZN), Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX) and Salesforce.com (CRM).X For the year through March 8, Fidelity Investments' Will Danoff and John Roth have deftly ridden such stocks to a nice 6.48% gain in the fund they manage: $28.5 billion Fidelity Advisor New Insights Fund (FNIAX). That compares with the S&P 500's 2.84%. The legendary Danoff is best known for managing the $129.6 billion Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) since 1990, and with which he's outperformed every other stock fund with $100 billion or more in assets in the past 15 years.Many of their top holdings are riding a megatrend — people spending more time on the internet — that they see driving earnings growth and price appreciation for years to come.A key to the winning investment strategies they've used since New Insights' inception in 2003 is change. ""We always look for change,"" Danoff told IBD, ""and change is an opportunity: when there's a new management team, a new product, a spinout or a big acquisition.""While New Insights is solidly in the large-cap growth camp, Roth brings in expertise in midcap stocks and a slight value tilt, which adds a level of flexibility to the managers' investment process as they navigate 2018 stock market trends.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportIn a wide-ranging Q&A, Danoff and Roth share how their flexible investment strategies allow them to uncover opportunities even as the bull market ages and many growth stocks get pricey. They also discuss their major holdings, including why they're bullish on Amazon, Netflix and Adobe.IBD: What is the strategy of your fund?Will Danoff: Fidelity Advisor New Insights is a capital appreciation fund with a growth bias. Both John and I believe that stocks over time follow the underlying earnings per share of the companies. I've joked in the past: You get two fund managers for the price of one. We created a sleeve structure two years ago: Will is running 60% of the fund, John is running 40% of the fund. John has a more value orientation, I have a more growth orientation.IBD: What is the main trend in the market today and how are you integrating it in the fund?Danoff: I'm looking for the best stocks in the market and companies that have a sustainable competitive advantage but are growing in this environment, gaining market share, are able to leverage technology and find certain trends like Cloud or SaaS (Software as a Service) or just more and more people and more and more companies spending more time on the internet. That's probably the megatrend that we're all living in.John Roth: I've spent half my time at Fidelity as a value-ish analyst and half as a growth analyst. I prefer to buy growth stocks — I think they're more fun, more interesting. But I think you can also make money in turnarounds and other things that the market has left by the wayside.Nine years into a bull market, I think there's some valuation concerns on the growth side, so that's taken some of my growth money out, but I still have a growth bias. I think the key is to be versatile and really take advantage of the opportunities the market gives you.Danoff: We're flexible and we'll go anywhere, so I really think that helps the fund. There aren't many constraints on what we can do. And John has been really good at anticipating which out-of-favor groups might come back into favor. And by looking for out-of-favor groups, that forces you to look at your existing names and say ""Wow, maybe all the good news has been discounted here.""IBD'S TAKE: As an individual investor, you want to stay in sync with the market. Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.IBD: Speaking of which, could you give a few examples of trades in the past 12 months?Danoff: We were up 28% last year and tech helped a lot. Amazon was a nice overweight, Activision Blizzard (ATVI), PayPal (PYPL), Facebook (FB), Adobe — these were larger technology companies that grew very nicely.We always look for change and change is an opportunity: when there's a new management team, a new product, a spinout or a big acquisition. When something's happening, Fidelity can hopefully move quickly.Last year was about avoiding some of the defensive names, General Electric (GE) obviously struggled with their earnings. ... We were underweight in a big way.IBD: Your fund profile talks about companies that are undervalued by the public. But obviously the public is focusing on the big tech names, so how are they undervalued or what is the additional value that you're seeing in them?Danoff: John and I are looking for misperceptions by the public. If we think Facebook can sustain 30% growth for longer than people think, or we see Mark Zuckerberg's genius ultimately being applied to Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook messenger (and) video. ... We're not seeing anything that other people may not see, but we think the good news will last longer. I think I am more bullish on Facebook than the consensus and I own a lot of it.Roth: A lot of times these big names are right in front of you and it doesn't mean they're not going to be great stocks. Apple (AAPL) has been the poster child. Back in 2007, people got excited about the potential for the company to have $6 billion in revenue, and no one thought they'd go to $250 billion. And it unfolded slowly over the years right in front of you.IBD: What are your thoughts on the fact that we're late in the economic cycle and valuations are high?Danoff: Yes, we've had a long run since the bottom of the spring of 2009, earnings have more than doubled, stocks have more than tripled. The crisis of 2008-2009 I think was felt more deeply than people realize. … (The economic impact) was quite drastic.There was this massive footrace to put on the brakes — cutting costs, cutting capital spending. Sort of the whole world froze. I think Apple and Google were two of the only companies I'm aware of that grew earnings in the first two quarters of 2009.My point is, the starting point was quite drastic. And so even though we've had this long economic expansion, I don't feel like people are high-fiving themselves. Up until very recently, most companies were managing the costs conservatively and controlling their capital spending.The other observation I have is the world is much more global and U.S. companies are now able to sell their products all over the world. The big companies in the S&P 500 are now much less capital intensive; they're high margin, they're high growth and they're highly cash generative. Yes, I think the market is expensive, but the market is not what it used to be. The quality of the companies is higher and estimates are going up.IBD: Would you look more outside of the U.S. to find good stocks?Roth: Our philosophy is turn over as many rocks as you can. The more you turn over, the higher the probability to find something good. If we find that the U.S. has less opportunities, then maybe we'll look harder in Europe. Europe has been slow to recover and there are some interesting names there. And the same would be true in Asia. You might see more names in the fund because we're trying to find new ideas.Danoff: The global research effort helps us so much. The global economy is much more integrated. We can talk to Asian tech companies who are part of the supply chain, or Samsung, which is a supplier and a competitor to so many of the big tech companies, and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). It's hugely helpful to understand where we are in the cycle in that particular industry.The trends we're seeing overseas are often similar, sometimes ahead of the trends that we see in the U.S., sometimes behind. But in terms of the big global companies, often the Nestles (NSRGY) and Unilevers (UN) are more defensive, and right now defensive is out of favor. So we're trying to pay attention to out-of-favor, but right now these stocks are not leading the market. This is the tension and the balance we have to find.IBD: The market had a short correction recently. How do you react in this kind of environment?Roth: We went through a very long period of no volatility and to the extent we see more volatility in the future as the economy heats up and the Fed gets more aggressive, it just means that we have to tighten our game up and look for dislocations every day. We've had some really big swings in the market where you could open up and then all of a sudden be down a fair amount, and so on an individual stock basis we're looking for bargains on the names that we really like. We do have some cash in the fund and we can be opportunistic. So a little bit of volatility is not a bad thing at all.IBD: Do you sell anything in those times?Danoff: You have to stay flexible and when fundamentals change, we all have stories when a top 10 position discloses some bad news and the stock is down and you start saying, ""Oh my God, one of my big positions is under pressure."" If there's competition from Amazon, or there's regulatory changes, or there's unexpected margin pressure, you can't stand still in this business.When the whole market sells off, John and I are looking for higher-quality companies that we can upgrade to.IBD: Considering the current increasing inflationary pressures, do you see any sector rotation or areas that may pop up that would be more advantageous for investors in 2018?Roth: We are seeing wage inflation. Everyone from Walmart (WMT) to most big companies have started to pay their employees more. These bonuses that are coming as a result of the tax cut will have the same effect.Who benefits? It's probably the financials to some extent, probably the energy companies, materials, gold. We have exposure to all of that, and we can easily shift if it looks like it's going to become more prevalent.IBD: What is your outlook for some of the big names in your fund?Danoff: Good news is good news. In an expansionary environment, Netflix is crushing it overseas. They're adding 5 million subs overseas a quarter and a couple million subs in the U.S. They have some pricing power, the service is outstanding, it's a subscription model offering great value for roughly $10-$11 a month. The average subscriber is spending 10 hours a week watching their content. Margins are going up and I am quite positive.Adobe has made a shift from licensed to Software-as-a-Service to the recurring revenue model. More and more people are spending more and more time on the web, so companies and individuals purchase Adobe software more frequently. Revenues are growing more than 20%, margins are going up and the company is generating a huge amount of free cash flow, so the outlook is very bright for Adobe. Could it sell off because it's expensive? Yes, both Adobe and Netflix could see multiples compression near-term, but I think over time both companies are very well positioned to grow, looking out three to five years.Amazon — wouldn't you want to partner with the richest man in the world, Jeff Bezos? A week does not go by where somebody doesn't tell me, ""I love Amazon."" AWS, which is their cloud-computing business — they started before anybody else realized that could be a business — it's now I think an $18 billion business, growing roughly 40% a year; it's nicely profitable. In e-commerce, he's pushing hard into India, into food, in apparel — he's gaining market share. He's got a long way to go. Maybe I'd like him to show a little more profit because I think stocks follow earnings over time, but I'm confident that everything Amazon is investing in is ultimately going to generate a very strong return, and if that's the case, then profits will come over time.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:How To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For Beginners401(k) Experts Warn When NOT To Use A Target Date Fund2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Price Gains, With A Foreign TiltThe New Stock Gems: Which Top IPOs Are The Next Googles And Ciscos?

Meanwhile, bullishness among newsletter writers polled by Investors Intelligence has cooled off, a good sign for market psychology. Excessive optimism usually means that few willing buyers remain to prop up stock prices.The bulls ratio is currently at 48.1%, off from the January peak of 66.7%. IBD's Psychological Market Indicators feature updates the bulls and bears ratios every Wednesday after the market close.The Nasdaq gained 0.5%, good for a third straight gain. The Nasdaq 100 rose nearly 0.4%. However, Tuesday saw small caps really shine. The Russell 2000, a laggard in 2017 and year-to-date in 2018, and the S&P SmallCap 600 both jumped 1.1%.Also important, volume picked up on the Nasdaq all-electronic exchange vs. the prior session, according to early figures. Such action points to institutional accumulation, which is a necessary ingredient for any meaningful market rally to last.The S&P 500 edged 0.3% higher, while the Dow Jones industrial average finished slightly up as five of its 30 components rallied 1 point or more.Lately, the scene on Wall Street was littered with distribution, or significant declines by the major benchmarks in higher turnover vs. the prior session.

2514,CRM,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rallied Wednesday morning following President Trump's State of the Union address and heading into a slew of big earnings reports before and after the session.The major averages suffered their worst losses of 2018 on Tuesday. But Workday (WDAY), Electronic Arts (EA), Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) and Salesforce.com (CRM) rose modestly Tuesday or fell less than the S&P 500's 1.1% retreat. Red Hat (RHT) matched the S&P 500's decline.X Even better, Workday, Salesforce.com and Red Hat are all in buy range. Electronic Arts and fellow video game maker Take-Two Interactive closed Tuesday slightly below entry points, but rallied in extended trading on EA's earnings report and guidance.S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq 100 futures rose about 0.4% vs. fair value, even with tech titan Apple (AAPL) down modestly. Apple has lagged the major averages for months, with its earnings due Thursday night.In his primetime State of the Union address to Congress Tuesday night, Trump touted recently passed tax cuts and the big rally in the stock market over the past year. He also called for immigration reform and $1.5 trillion in infrastructure spending.Meanwhile, investors will digest earnings from many top companies today, including Boeing (BA) before the open as well as Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT) after the close.Workday rose 3.2% to 120.26 in Tuesday's stock market trading after Morgan Stanley upgraded the cloud-based business software firm and William Blair said it recently won two big financial-software deals. That move pushed Workday to the edge of a buying range from a 111.98 cup-with-handle entry point. But it was the first time Workday's breakout seemed impressive.The initial Jan. 23 breakout came on volume that was well below average, and it remained light for the next several sessions. Also, the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, was lagging. Even as the stock moved into all-time highs, the RS line remained stuck below even short-term peaks.But on Tuesday, trading volume was 51% above normal. And with Workday posting a big gain on a bad market day, its RS line rose to a two-month high.Salesforce fell 0.9% to 112.23, a modest loss on below-average volume. The maker of on-demand customer relationship software is comfortably above a 109.29 flat-base buy point. Salesforce initially cleared the entry point on Jan. 12, but volume was only 25% above normal. That's OK, but you'd really like to see a 40%-50% minimum gain as a sign that institutional buyers are stepping in. The next session, the stock fell back below the entry on similar volume. Salesforce then retook the entry, but on a series of low-volume moves.Also, Salesforce's RS line really hasn't made any progress from short-term levels since the breakout.Red Hat broke out past a 131.03 flat-base entry on Jan. 25, then rose to near the top of the 5% buy zone the next session. Shares have pulled back the last two sessions, including Tuesday's 1.1% on volume that was 34% below normal.The Linux software firm's breakout came on volume that was just above average. The RS line has not made much improvement since then.Electronic Arts closed up 0.9% to 118.70, working toward a 112.89 buy point. After the close, the video game maker met fiscal third-quarter earnings estimates and fell short on revenue. But EA guided higher for the current March quarter.EA shot up 7.8% to 127.95 in premarket trading Wednesday, suggesting a breakout into a buy zone.Keep in mind that extended trading does not always translate into how a stock will open and close the following session.Also, EA's RS line is well below where it was at the start of the five-month consolidation, though it did top a very short-term high this week. Hopefully, EA's after-hours action does carry over to Wednesday with a high-volume price spike.Take-Two fell 0.8% to 118.31 on Tuesday. The stock has topped a 120.28 buy point from a handle in the last two sessions, but failed to close above it. Take-Two rallied early Wednesday in sympathy with peer EA, climbing 1.5% to 120.05, just below the entry.Take-Two's RS line has some distance to the consolidation's highs, but a solid breakout would give it at least a short-term high.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Stocks Suffer 2nd Distribution Day; Leaders Hit AgainAlibaba Likely To Show Strongest Revenue Growth In 15 QuartersAbiomed, Arista, Align, YY: How To Read A Stock Rebound3 Fast-Growing Sector Leaders Telling Different Stories Ahead Of EarningsWhat Apple's Stock Chart Is Telling Us Going Into Earnings, iPhone X OutlookAs Market Sold Off, This Small-Cap Tech Stock Rocketed Up; Why?

2522,CRM,"Having a growth strategy has paid off well for American Century All Cap Growth Fund (TWGTX) since the start of the 2009 bull market. And the fund's early purchase of its largest holding Alphabet (GOOGL) in early 2009 might have something to do with it beating the S&P 500 since then.X The $1.2 billion fund is up 4.09% this year through Feb. 22, ahead of S&P 500's return of 1.41% and its large-growth Morningstar category's 4.12%. The fund also has returned a stellar 20.75% in the past year, plus average annual returns of 10.42% and 14.22% in the past three and five years, beating the S&P 500 for the one-year, but slightly lagging it for the other periods.The fund recently changed managers. Gregory Woodhams, senior vice president and co-chief investment officer of American  Century's global growth equity, and Joe Reiland, vice president and portfolio manager, took over the fund's management as of Feb. 16. Before that, Michael Orndorff and Marcus Scott comanaged the fund for the past nine and six years, respectively.American Century All Cap Growth strives to invest in companies that show continuous accelerating earnings growth and a strong price momentum. While it can invest in companies of all sizes, over 70% of its holdings fall into the large-cap category, 25% comprise midcap stocks, with the remaining allocation in small caps. It primarily invests in U.S. stocks, but had a less-than-5% allocation to foreign equities as of Dec. 31.Last year, the fund benefited from the risk-on rally that began shortly after Donald Trump won the election in November 2016. Growth stocks were lifted on expectations of President Trump's stimulus package for individuals and businesses, a solid earnings season and overall economic strength.Stock selection played a large role in the fund's performance in 2017, as much on the positive as the negative side. Its top-10 holdings represent 37% of the fund and include names such as Alphabet, IBD Leaderboard member Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), Mastercard (MA) and FedEx (FDX). These stocks soared between 33% and 53% last year.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersAmong the fund's largest sectors are technology at 30% of the portfolio, consumer cyclical 17%, health care 15% and financials 12%. With technology being the top performing sector, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple's positions have each grown to represent 7%, 5% and 4.4% of the fund.LogMeIn (LOGM) is a midcap internet service company that provides a cloud-based platform for online meetings, customer support, remote access and password security. Its earnings and revenue skyrocketed between 94% and 216% the past four quarters. Earnings per share jumped 110% last year and analysts estimate a 29% increase this year. The maker of GoToMeeting, OpenVoice and join.me also recently announced it will acquire cloud-based phone system provider Jive Communications and Unified Communications. Shares of LogMeIn advanced 20% last year. The stock is 13% off its Feb. 15 all-time high, having sliced through its 50-day moving average after the company reported 94% gain in earnings that beat expectations, but was light on revenue.Within the software space, creative design program maker Adobe Systems (ADBE) and customer relationship management firm Salesforce.com (CRM) also did well, each jumping 70.2% and 49.3% last year, and 15.3% and 12% year to date. Adobe, which successfully transitioned to cloud-based recurring subscription services recently announced that its longtime CFO Mark Garrett will be retiring. The maker of Photoshop and Acrobat plans to grow its e-commerce business. It's also on IBD's Leaderboard.Among banks, which are expected to benefit from rising interest rates, the fund holds Zions Bancorp (ZION) and SVB Financial (SIVB)). The holding company for Zion Bank, which operates via 436 branches in 11 Western and Southwestern states reported double-digit earnings growth in the past six quarters. Its stock is up 8% so far in 2018 after advancing 19% last year.The holding company for Silicon Valley Bank SVB Financial reported accelerating earnings and sales growth in the last five quarters. In the most recent quarter, earnings per share rose 53% on revenue growth of 32%. The stock rose 36% in 2017 and 5% this year.Among key detractors to American Century All Cap's performance in 2017 were biotech stocks such as Shire (SHPG), where despite reporting good results, ""investor concerns over competitive threats to the company's hemophilia franchise weighed on the shares,"" notes the latest fund annual report. Shire's stock fell 6.3% last year.Natural gas producer Range Resources (RRC) also was a drag on performance due to unfavorable weather conditions and gas prices. The stock declined over 50% last year and has continued its slide this year.RELATED:What's Will Danoff Into These Days?What's The Stock Market Doing Now?

2523,CRM,"A new generation of financial advisors grew up online. They embraced social media and streamed music and watched movies on their phones.X So where does that leave older generations striving to build a great financial advisor practice?Advisors of all ages seek to harness technology to their advantage. While that's relatively easy for techies, it poses a challenge for those who lack an affinity for such solutions.""People can get intimidated with technology,"" said Allan Katz, a certified financial planner in Staten Island, N.Y. ""But the tools out there now are tremendous. Learning how to use them is so important for an advisor.""Katz, 48, evaluates potentially cost-effective technologies in three steps. First, he asks, ""What am I trying to accomplish?"" Examples include enhancing some aspect of client service or streamlining an administrative task.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!Second, he asks, ""What's the best tool to help me accomplish that?"" He will review tech products that are designed to address his needs, assessing their cost, ease of use and other factors.After identifying the most promising tools, he will conduct test runs and gauge the results. Many vendors allow users to try their offerings for a limited time at little or no cost.For years, Katz has favored VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) for his phone lines. He has used several VoIP providers, and he recently sampled a vendor's latest release.""I like VoIP because it's much less money and lets you do so much,"" he said. ""But when something new comes along, I might test it out. In this case, (the new product) was OK but not all that robust, so I didn't go with it.""Because technology keeps advancing at warp speed, financial advisors cannot buy hardware or software and forget about it. They must prowl the landscape for upgrades and scrutinize potentially groundbreaking applications and gadgets.""You have to constantly review the newest offerings and see if you can make whatever you have better,"" Katz said. That's a chore for individuals who find technology boring, vexing, or a source of fear and frustration.Many advisors resist the hype to obtain the newest device that hits the market. Non-techies usually find that waiting at least a few months — or longer — enables them to learn from the first wave of users and perhaps nab the product at a lower price.""I'm not a first adopter,"" Katz said. ""I don't think, 'Oh, this shiny new thing just came out and I have to buy it.' ""Similarly, Patti Black doesn't consider herself an early adopter. After 20 years as a financial advisor, Black figured she knew enough about technology to get by. But when she joined a new firm last year, she faced a steep learning curve to master its financial planning software and CRM (customer relationship management) platform.Black got up to speed on the basics by watching online training videos produced by the software firms. But Black, a certified financial planner in Birmingham, Ala., says the videos only covered ""routine scenarios.""To round out her knowledge, she asked tech-savvy colleagues to help. She discovered that some younger employees were happy to coach her.""We have some millennials here who were able to work with me and answer my specific questions,"" she said. ""Beyond (benefiting from) their help, it's been great getting to know them better.""While Black works at a firm with younger, tech-oriented staffers, other planners operate solo or without an in-house tech whiz. That's when leaning on outside experts can help.Kevin O'Brien, a certified financial planner in Northborough, Mass., relies on a local computer support business to advise him on tech matters. He's worked closely with the shop's owner for 20 years.""Any time I buy a new computer, I make sure he installs it,"" O'Brien said. ""And I'm always running things by him. He takes care of my hardware, networking, and security and firewall.""A voracious reader, O'Brien scans industry publications and blogs by thought leaders such as Bob Veres and Michael Kitces to educate himself about tech trends. He also attends annual conferences hosted by his custodian, TD Ameritrade (AMTD), where attendees, guest speakers and vendors share ideas and resources to keep pace with technology.O'Brien has also participated in a peer network with other financial advisors. They discussed their experience using different tech tools and invited vendors to present their latest wares.Thanks to input from his peers, O'Brien discovered two valuable tools: a voicemail system called PhoneTag and a digital dictation service called Copytalk.""Those were two applications I bought because other advisors in my study group liked them,"" he said. ""I'm not a tech person. But by talking to your peers and keeping an open mind, you can learn about some great solutions.""RELATED:Coaches Help Advisors Sharpen Their Processes And Woo ProspectsMillennials, Other Investors: Avoid This Costly 401(k) MistakeWhat's The Stock Market Doing Now?

2525,CRM,"Investors preferred to continue investing in U.S. stocks and trimming their stakes in Bitcoin-related securities on Tuesday as the Nasdaq continued to stage one of its biggest month-to-date gains.X The Nasdaq composite rallied 0.7% while the Nasdaq 100, capturing the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that exchange, rose 0.8%.Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), meanwhile, flashed a warning sign that a prolonged correction may be in the works. The popular fund dropped 2% to 1,653.90, sinking for a third straight session and giving back all of last Thursday's strong rebound. The fund is also losing more ground below its critical 50-day moving average.Bitcoin Investment Trust gave astute chart readers a pair of sell signals in December when it showed some clear signs of a climax run, one of the most important sell signals featured in IBD market columns. Bitcoin also slashed through its 10-day moving average, a good sell trigger for short-term traders.The PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq 100, is now at 169.49. The heavily traded ETF extended its overall gain since a Day 3 follow-through on June 30, 2016, to more than 57%. A follow-through is a vital market-turning signal that was noted by The Big Picture back then. Typical follow-through rallies occur on the fourth day or later after an initial rally attempt that follows a significant market correction.Meanwhile, some blue chips took a break as the Dow Jones industrial average finished practically at breakeven. At least seven of the 30 member stocks in the Dow Jones industrials fell 1 point or more, including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) following its plan to take a $13.6 billion charge following the new tax code and repatriate billions in profits back into America immediately. The company also suffered a setback in court over a drug patent.The S&P 500 lifted 0.2%. Breadth was positive on both exchanges; on the Nasdaq, winners smashed losers by a nearly 4-3 margin. NYSE winners crushed losers by nearly 9-to-5.J&J slid 4% to 141.83 in heavy turnover, but the uptrend remains in place as the diversified medical products giant remains above its 50-day line. At its recent peak, the stock held a 14.9% profit since clearing a 129.10 buy point in a long base on base, a key pattern for those who want to buy the most bullish growth stocks.Apple (AAPL) edged slightly higher to 177.04 and trades just a few points off its all-time peak of 180.10. At that peak, the largest company in the U.S. exchanges by market cap ($900 billion) has run 52% since the pivotal breakout from a cup with handle at 118.12 on Jan. 6, 2017.Apple is also up nearly 10% from its latest true base, a second-stage cup with handle that provided a 160.97 entry. The base formed from Sept. 5 to Oct. 26. Volume on the Oct. 27 breakout came in strong, 64% above the 50-day average. It later tried to break out from a flat base at 176.34 but has not climbed much from that entry.While the iPhone and digital services titan has sort of set the standard over the past 12 months on how a giant company can turn things around and rally nicely from key breakouts points, the market's rally across techland means that IBD-style growth investors can possibly find other big cap names that could present even richer stock profit potential.Four names to consider include:Lam Research (LRCX), a play on semiconductor equipment, $34 billion market cap: The stock rallied nearly 3% to 215.05 and is crafting the right side of a new cup-style base since peaking at 219.70 on Nov. 21.Lam, which had been regularly featured in IBD Big Cap 20 throughout 2017, is expected to grow fiscal second-quarter earnings by a whopping 64% to $3.68 a share. In contrast, Apple's profit in the just-ended fiscal first quarter is expected to rise 13%.PayPal (PYPL), digital payments pioneer, $101 billion market cap: The stock floated 0.2% higher to 84.18, a fifth straight gain, and is now up 5.9% past the recent breakout from a good flat base at 79.48. Shares are thus a tad extended from the proper buy zone.Earnings are seen rising 24% to 52 cents in Q4, following year-over-year gains of 13%, 17%, 19%, 28% and 31%.Salesforce.com (CRM), a business software innovator, $81 billion market cap: The Marc Benioff-led cloud-based enterprise software giant is nominally in buy range at 113.24, 3.6% above a 109.29 entry in a six-week flat base.Earnings in the January-ending fiscal fourth quarter are seen rising 18% to 33 cents a share following EPS increases of 26%, 14%, 47%, 17%, 38% and 62% in the prior six quarters.

""Many companies are still in the early stages of understanding what is AI, what problems can be solved, what is possible.""IDC forecasts that worldwide spending on AI hardware, software and services will jump to $58 billion by 2021, up from just $12 billion in 2017.""AI is not a budget line-item at this stage,"" said CCS's McQuire.JPMorgan estimates that AI will account for 1.8% of global enterprise IT budgets by 2021. Though still small next to, say, the 8% spent on cybersecurity, that would be up from a scant 0.3% in 2016.An AI spending boom would boost growth at enterprise software firms, cloud computing providers and IT service providers such as Microsoft, IBM, Accenture (ACN), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Oracle.""The AI killer app has emerged: cost savings,"" Brent Bracelin, a KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst, said in a recent note to clients. Aside from customer service, he says many time-consuming, back-office tasks  such as human resources, finance and accounting will be automated with AI.One key to the future of AI will be to make it easier for companies to forge ahead with artificial intelligence projects, say analysts. Salesforce.com, AT&T (T) and Google are among those seeking a faster track for AI in business.AT&T, with an open-source software project, aims to make developing AI predictive tools as easy as building a website.  Working with IT consulting firm Tech Mahindra, AT&T has launched an open-source artificial intelligence software project with the Linux Foundation.""There is some confusion that doing AI is very expensive if you look at the R&D budgets of Google and Amazon,"" said Kaul. ""But you don't need billions of dollars to get AI projects started. There is open source software — it's a big trend within AI — that helps companies build their own solutions.""Salesforce.com has a mantra to help customers build AI tools ""with clicks not code."" That means companies don't need their own programmers to write algorithms that can find patterns or make inferences from sales data.Salesforce has a line of tools it calls Einstein that use a company's historical lead and account data to predict which deals are more likely to close.""What companies need is the ability to apply AI to their business. There's not a lot of off-the-shelf AI, like Salesforce's Einstein,"" said CCS Insight's McQuire. ""But technology is advancing quickly. We're going to see a lot more technology that helps companies automate the creation of custom AI models, which will speed up the market.""McQuire says nearly 60% of companies surveyed by CCS Insight are testing or studying AI. One problem is that high-tech companies are willing to pay much higher salaries for AI specialists, which increases their expenses.If they lack in-house expertise, McQuire says many companies are turning to cloud computing vendors — Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google — to get a head start.Cloud computing vendors aim to provide AI-as-a-service. Companies can run artificial intelligence apps on powerful computers rented by the hour to crunch massive quantities of data.""All the public clouds are fighting over who has the best AI platform,"" said Jason Ader, a William Blair analyst, in a report.Google is focused on providing cloud customers with tool kits for ""machine learning,"" one type of AI. Google's AI tools enable cloud customers such as a hospital radiology department to focus computer vision algorithms so they can spot lung cancer.Many midsize or large companies lack internal technology staffers who can build AI-powered apps. That gives information technology services firms such as Accenture and IBM an opening as companies look to develop custom AI apps, says Bhavan Suri, analyst at William Blair. IBM, which has focused its Watson AI platform on health care, is moving into new markets such as digital marketing.Wall Street analysts anticipate that AI tools will be integrated with existing big data, business intelligence and industry-specific enterprise software. Kaul says many industries are still in the early stages of digitizing records handled as paperwork. Once that data is available, AI tools can go to work to help deploy AI in business.""Although Google, Facebook (FB), Baidu (BIDU), Apple, Microsoft and Amazon may have taken early advantage of their large data sets and established platforms, enterprise  software vendors like SAP, Oracle, and Salesforce are gradually embedding AI into their offerings,"" said the JPMorgan report.Software companies pushing into AI include Adobe Systems (ADBE), Tableau Software (DATA), Zendesk (ZEN), Coupa Software (COUP), Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD), HubSpot (HUBS), Splunk (SPLK) and Workday (WDAY).The fact that most non-tech companies need a helping hand getting into artificial intelligence also provides an opportunity for startups pushing into the enterprise market. Among them: Sentient Technologies, DataRobot, Clarifai, Algorithmia, Affectiva and SpaceKnow.At this early stage of AI in business, corporate America is using what's called ""machine learning"" for the most part as opposed to more complex ""deep learning."" With ML, algorithms are trained to create predictive models or identify patterns. ML helps predict what a particular customer is likely to buy or detects insurance claims fraud.Tech companies use machine learning to personalize web content and other tasks. But they also are plowing ahead in applying deep learning, which mimics neural networks in the human brain, for classifying images and other purposes. Self-driving cars will require deep learning to map their surroundings and detect hazards.Technology giants are in an AI arms race. They're funding or acquiring startups and paying super-salaries to hire AI computer scientists.Amazon isn't stopping at Alexa-powered digital assistants. Its Amazon Go retail stores use computer vision and AI to do away with cashiers.Apple uses artificial intelligence software for facial recognition in the new iPhone X. And Apple is developing AI health care mobile apps.For Facebook users, AI lurks behind the scenes, playing a central role in what advertisements or news they see. And at Netflix (NFLX), programming recommendations are getting better as software algorithms are trained to identify movie matches.What sets the tech giants apart is commitment. For them, the future of AI is now.Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai makes a point to show this. On earnings calls and tech conferences, he now calls Google an ""AI first"" company.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Is It Time To Get Into — Or Out Of — The Stock Market?No. 1-Ranked Stock With 118% Growth Breaks Out With Earnings DueBirth Of An Industry: Early Investing  Hot Spots In Artificial IntelligenceIt's An AI Arms Race: What China Has To Offer Vis-A-Vis U.S.

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CRM in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 34 cents per share for CRM, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 33 cents per share.

2535,CRM,"Stratasys Ltd. (SSYS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 28. In the trailing four quarters, the company topped earnings estimates, delivering an average beat of approximately 117%.Before we discuss the factors likely to influence the forthcoming results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.The company reported mixed results for third-quarter 2017, wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missed the same. Although revenues declined marginally, earnings improved significantly on a year-over-year basis. The year-over-year improvement in the bottom line was mainly driven by the company’s consistent focus on reducing operating expenses, partially offset by lower revenues.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderStratasys, a manufacturer of 3D printers and in-office rapid prototyping (RP) and manufacturing systems, looks well poised on the back of product launches and strategic partnerships. These initiatives are paving the way for the company to excel in the 3D printing industry, which is anticipated to witness CAGR of 25.76% from 2017 to 2023 and reach $32.78 billion.Notably, during the quarter, the company announced that Skorpion Engineering has accelerated the development of prototypes of luxury cars by around 50% with the help of Stratasys’ additive technology solutions. The company also announced the launch of BioMimics for 3D printing of medical models. This will address the needs of hospitals, manufacturers of medical devices as well as researchers.The company also entered into a collaboration with e-Xstream Engineering, per which the latter will be delivering “process modeling and structural analysis numerical tools” to Stratasys, which will in turn be beneficial for the betterment of the company’s solutions and hence the top line.The company’s strategic partnerships with Schneider Electric, The Boeing Co., Ford Motor Co., Siemens, Boom Supersonic and United Launch Alliance have expanded its geographic reach and market penetration. Its clientele, which includes the likes of Airbus and Koninklijke Philips N.V, is an additional positive. We believe an increase in its client base to aid fourth-quarter 2017 revenue growth.Furthermore, Stratasys has also taken measures to improve margins. It recorded operating margin of 5.2% in the third quarter compared with 2.1% reported in the year-ago quarter.We believe that the company’s consistent focus on reducing operating expenses will also drive results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Stratasys, Ltd.

QuoteWhat’s Behind the Dismal Projection?The company, during its third-quarter earnings conference call, had noted that a considerable decline in GoPro (GPRO  -  Free Report) revenues as well as the moderate fall in the drone market will adversely affect the fourth quarter’s top-line performance.Notably, GoPro is its largest customer which had accounted for approximately 19% of fiscal 2017 revenues. It used to buy video-processing chips from Ambarella for its action cameras. However, since the beginning of fiscal 2018, GoPro has been purchasing these chips from one of Ambarella’s competitors. This is hurting Ambarella’s shipment volumes, thereby depressing overall revenue growth.Notably, sales to GoPro significantly declined year over year in the fiscal third quarter from $34.6 million to $18.4 million. Also, GoPro’s contribution to total revenues was down to 20.7% in the fiscal third quarter from 30% in the year-ago quarter. Management predicts GoPro revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter to plummet to $13 million from $30.2 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Furthermore, lingering weakness in the drone market has been denting this chip maker’s revenues. The company has witnessed three back-to-back quarters of decline in this market. Moreover, Ambarella projects softness in the drone market to persist throughout fiscal 2018.Some Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Square, Inc.

2537,CRM,"Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 28. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this customer relationship management solution provider will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.Notably, Salesforce has delivered positive earnings surprises for seven straight quarters. Over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 6.5%. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model conclusively shows that Salesforce is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. Per our model, a stock with a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold), has higher chance of beating estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our  Earnings ESP Filter.Salesforce currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.51%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 33 cents, which is 17.9% higher than the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 28 cents. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $2.81 billion, up 22.6% from the prior-year quarter tally.Let’s see what’s driving this overwhelming expectation.Acquisitions Boosting Top-Line GrowthAcquisitions have always been one of Salesforce’s key growth strategies. Over the last two years, the company has closed as many as 14 acquisitions worth billions of dollars, including its biggest ever buyout — Demandware. These acquisitions have strengthened its position in the customer relationship-management solution-providing space. We expect the acquisition synergies to drive Salesforce’s fiscal fourth-quarter top-line performance.Salesforce.com Inc Price and EPS Surprise Salesforce.com Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Salesforce.com Inc QuotePartnerships Stoking International GrowthSalesforce still generates only about 30% of total revenues from international operations, which is much lower than its rivals like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) or Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) composition of around 50%. Nonetheless, the company noted that its partnership agreements with the likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Alphabet for the firms’ cloud services have been helping it expand its international operations.Earlier, the company used to run its software at its own data centers which had been curbing its growth potentials. However, in 2016, the company decided to utilize the geographical reach of other data-center service providers to expand its international business.The company’s first partnership in this space was with Amazon Web Services in 2016, followed by the next alliance with Alphabet last November. During third-quarter fiscal 2018, the company won several deals due to its international-expansion initiatives. Companies like National Australia Bank, BP, Group PSA and Hitachi picked Salesforce’s solutions to fuel digital transformation. It is most likely that the company will continue winning international deals which will drive its fiscal fourth-quarter top- and bottom-line results.Partner Program Adding CustomersTremendous growth in Salesforce partner certifications has been fueling the company’s top-line results. Notably, Salesforce’s partner certification has witnessed growth of five times over the last four years and more companies are willing to invest in Salesforce activities. Accenture (ACN) has emerged as one of the biggest examples for this. Notably, Accenture is currently a global leader in the Salesforce implementation service space, with more than 11,000 skilled consultants.Notably, a number of big organizations, including Hilton, DuPont and ASTACar have become Salesforce’s partners during the fiscal third quarter. Analysts covering the stock believe the fiscal fourth quarter will witness the same trend, thereby bolstering the company’s top-line performance.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

Five9 beat earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 200%.EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 4 cents per share.

2540,CRM,"Shares of Twilio Inc. (TWLO  -  Free Report) jumped more than 6% during yesterday’s after-hours trade after the company reported splendid fourth-quarter results, wherein its revenues topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as management’s guidance range. Also, the top line marked solid year-over-year growth.Talking about the company’s bottom-line results, though it posted a loss per share, the figure was much lower than the consensus estimate and management’s guidance range as well. However, it has an unfavorable comparison when compared with the year-ago quarter results.Let’s discuss the fourth-quarter results in detail.RevenuesThe company’s fourth-quarter revenues surged 40.6% year over year to $115.2 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $104 million. Also, it came ahead of management’s previously guided range of $102.5-$104.5 million. Furthermore, the company’s base revenues jumped 40% year over year to $105.3 million.The robust top-line performance was mainly driven by remarkable year-over-year growth in active customer account which was a result of the company’s continued focus on introducing products as well as its go-to-market sales strategy.The company registered a whopping 33.8% surge in active customer accounts, adding more than 12,373 accounts over the last 12 months, bringing the total count to 48,979 as of Dec 31, 2017. During the fourth quarter alone, Twilio added more than 2,490 active customer accounts.Operating ResultsNon-GAAP gross profit climbed approximately 27.5% year over year to $61.6 million. However, gross margin contracted 550 basis points (bps) to 53.5%, as elevated cost of goods sold more than offset the benefit of higher revenues.Non-GAAP operating expenses flared up 35.8% year over year to $65.5 million. The year-over-year surge was mainly due to increased investment in research and development, and sales to capitalize on the market opportunity. However, as a percentage of revenues, the figure decreased to 56.9% from 58.9% in the year-ago quarter.Furthermore, the company reported non-GAAP operating loss of $3.9 million. In the year-ago quarter, Twilio had posted an operating income of $80,000. Non-GAAP net loss came in at $2.6 million or 3 cents per share. In the year-ago quarter, the company had reported net income of $0.3 million or almost breakeven earnings per share. The year-over-year widened loss was mainly due to elevated costs and operating expenses which more than offset the benefit of sturdy top-line growth.Nevertheless, non-GAAP loss per share came way below management’s guided range of a loss of 5-6 cents. Also, the quarterly loss was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6.Twilio Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Twilio Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Twilio Inc. QuoteBalance SheetThe company exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $290.9 million, slightly up from $283.9 million at the end of the previous quarter. In addition to this, during the year, the company used $3.3 million worth of cash for operational activities.OutlookBuoyed by a solid quarterly performance, Twilio provided encouraging outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2018.For the first quarter, Twilio estimates revenues to be between $115 million and $117 million (mid-point $116 million). This is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $107.6 million. Base revenues are anticipated in the range of $108-$109 million. Non-GAAP net loss is projected to lie in the 6-7 cents per share band. The consensus estimate is currently pegged at a loss of 5 cents.For the full year, Twilio expects revenues to lie between $5016 million and $514 million (mid-point $510 million). This is significantly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $476.4 million.Similarly, base revenues are estimated in the range of $356.5-$357.5 million, higher than the previous forecast of $483-$487 million. Non-GAAP net loss is projected to come in the range of 10-14 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 11 cents.Recovers from Uber HangoverThe recently-reported strong quarterly results clearly indicate that the company has been able to mitigate the loss of revenues from Uber.It should be noted that Uber uses Twilio services for a variety of used cases such as driver and rider communication, driver marketing and several others. Till 2016, Uber used Twilio’s platforms in most of its geographical operations. However, since first-quarter 2017, Uber is “optimizing by used case and by geography” and is planning to ""move communications for some use cases in-app."" This means that Uber is now trying to operate its messaging services internally.Uber’s contribution to Twilio’s revenues declined to approximately 5% in the fourth quarter from roughly 17% in the year-ago quarter.Despite this, the company managed to report robust revenue growth in back-to-back three quarters, returning itself once again on growth trajectory mainly due to its sustained focus on rolling out products, global expansion, go-to-market sales and acquisition strategies.Our TakeWe believe back-to-back impressive quarterly results and optimistic guidance will give a fresh boost to the company’s share price which is currently trading below 24% to its 52-week high level of $34.74.Notably, Twilio’s shares have underperformed the industry to which it belongs to over the past year. The stock has depreciated 21.4% during the said period, while the industry recorded growth of 25.5%.Nonetheless, the company’s key initiatives, including product innovation, global expansion and acquisitions, are helping it gain customers, which bode well for long-term growth. We believe proliferation in cloud and mobile penetration across the globe will continue to fuel Twilio’s customer growth over the long run.Twilio boasts a strong clientele that includes the likes of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), salesforce.com (CRM  -  Free Report) and Twitter among others. Furthermore, the long-standing relationship with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) is particularly noticeable. Twilio uses Amazon Web Service (AWS) to host its platform.Nevertheless, intensifying competition in the communications market and growing prevalence of in-app push notifications are major concerns. Moreover, customer concentration is a headwind.Currently, Twilio carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2542,CRM,"Millennials grab headlines on a daily basis, with a focus on their hesitance to invest, massive debt loads, and changing shopping patterns. But as the often-maligned generation—known for “killing” everything from napkins to beer to home buying—gets older, many more will invest their money in the stock market.In many cases, Millennials themselves have actually disproportionately created positive, long-lasting economic changes, making investors from older generations a lot richer. And as the generation gets older and invests more, it will likely focus on the companies that is has grown with and the brands it already loves.With that said, let’s take a look at seven stocks that aging Millennials have strong connections to that are also set to expand their bottom-lines just as many young people begin to invest.1.      Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) Millennials helped propel Netflix into an international streaming TV giant. The company added 8.3 million users in Q4, marking yet another quarter of historic growth. As the cord-cutting revolution rages on, with linear TV becoming less relevant every day, Millennials will continue to account for a large amount of Netflix subscribers. Netflix is Currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but the company is expected to expand its EPS figures at an annualized rate of 26.67% over the next three to five years. This growth will be driven in large part by its commitment to new original content—much of which is geared towards Millennials.2.       Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report)This German sports apparel powerhouse has experienced a rapid rise over the last year, especially in the U.S. As Adidas’ footwear grows in popularity in both the athletic wear and streetwear space, the company’s cultural clout among Millennials solidifies. Propelled by the likes of Kanye West, other celebrity endorsers, and a grassroots business model, Adidas looks poised to compete with Nike (NKE) for years to come. And Millennials, who helped lift the brand’s popularity in the U.S. should be happy to note that Adidas is projected to grow its earnings per share figures at an annualized rate of 19.12% over the next three to five years. The company is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system.3.       Facebook (FB  -  Free Report)  Built from the ground up by Millennials—who represent both the founders and the first wave of users—Facebook is expected to see its bottom line surge at an annualized rate of 26.82% over the next three to five years. Facebook is one of the most valuable companies in the world and is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). In the coming years, Millennials are unlikely to abandon Facebook, and there is a good chance they stay loyal to the company’s fast-growing photo-sharing app, Instagram. Looking ahead, Facebook could entice a new generation, as well as its core users, as it continues to invest in new technologies such as AI and augmented reality.4.       Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) For all of the businesses and industries that Millennials have supposedly hurt, they have without a doubt helped lift Amazon’s e-commerce business to outrageous heights. Millennials currently use the site to buy everything from clothes to electronics to groceries—which could become even more popular as Amazon further intertwines Whole Foods into its e-commerce business. On top of that, Jeff Bezos’ company, which is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has bolstered its own original streaming television and movie offerings, as well as invested in live streaming sports. Amazon is expected to see its EPS figures grow at an annualized rate of 20.87% over the next three to five years.5.       Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report)Few Millennials can image their lives without Google. From school related searches to navigating new cities, Alphabet’s ubiquitous search engine plays a huge role in young people’s lives. This isn’t likely to change anytime soon, especially when taking into consideration the company’s widely popular Gmail and all of Alphabet’s other mostly-free online tools—not to mention YouTube. Alphabet is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and rocks an “A” grade for Growth. The company is also expected to expand its EPS figure at an annualized rate of 18.41% over the next three to five years.6.       Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) Today, nearly every company in the industrial world, many celebrities, and almost 100% of news outlets use Twitter to reach a largely Millennial audience. Twitter’s importance in breaking news events is only likely to expand in the years to come, especially as mobile device use grows around the world. Twitter is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and boasts “A” grades for Growth. The company is projected to expand its bottom line at an annualized rate of 21.50% over the next three to five years.7.       Salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report) Fortune ranked Salesforce as the #4 best place for Millennials to work in 2017. The customer relationship management company employs 6,668 Millennials, who now account for 46% of the company’s total workforce. These employees will soon enter roles of greater importance at the firm that has seen its stock price soar in recent years. Salesforce is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), rocks an “A” grade for Growth, and is expected to see its EPS figures expand at an annualized rate of 25% over the next three to five years.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2543,CRM,"While all tech companies have their eyes on the biggest tech show of the year, Customer Electronics Show (CES) 2018, Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) is silently enhancing its capabilities through acquisitions. Though the company has not made any announcement regarding this, it was the to-be-acquired company — Attic Labs — which revealed this news on its website. However, financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.Attic Labs was founded in 2015 by Aaron Boodman and Rafael Weinstein. According to Crunchbase, the start-up has raised $8.1 million Series A in 2016 from Greylock Partners and Harrison Metal. Attic Labs is known for its Noms tool, an open-source decentralized database, which helps users replicate information as well as edit them across multiple machines and consequently, easily sync the information.Rationale Behind the AcquisitionUpon completion of the acquisition, Attic Labs’ team will be integrated with Salesforce’s Quip division. Quip is Salesforce’s document-collaboration platform which was acquired in 2016, for a total consideration of $750 million. The division offers a similar platform like Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google Docs, which enables users to share and edit documents.Noms has much more advanced features than similar kind of tools, including Git. Like Git, Noms also retain all previous versions and facilitate synchronization of all edited versions as per requirements. However, the main features which make it a superior tool are that it stores only structured data, not files or directories, and secondly, it supports very large data sets.Therefore, we believe the additional features embedded with Noms make it a feasible acquisition for Salesforce. This buyout will enhance Salesforce’s Quip division capabilities and the additional features may attract organizations to opt for this service, instead of Git.Bottom LineAcquisitions have always been one of Salesforce’s key growth strategies. Although, the company remained almost silent throughout last year on the acquisition front (just one — Sequence), it may repeat the likes of 2016, when it bought 12 companies, this year to boost its capabilities, and grab newer and larger markets.We believe Salesforce’s continued focus on expanding its business through strategic acquisitions and investments will drive growth over the long run.Notably, Salesforce has returned 47.5% over the past year, significantly outperforming its industry’s gain of 38%. Currently, Salesforce carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) and Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. (MLNX  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Broadcom and Mellanox have expected long-term EPS growth rates of 13.8% and 16%, respectively.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

Per Marc Benioff, the Chairman and CEO of Salesforce, UK is the company’s largest market in Europe and the company is putting its best foot forward to tap the growth opportunities in the market.The company already has some noteworthy UK-based companies on its clients list. These include the likes of Aston Martin and British Airways among others. Notably, in May 2018, Salesforce opened its Salesforce Innovation Centre in Salesforce Tower London aimed at developing innovative solutions in accordance with its customers. The new-age solutions will cover areas such as cloud, artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) among others.The company is also planning to unveil a second data center in UK in 2019. The first one was inaugurated in 2014. Notably, the new one is expected to follow the footsteps of the first data center in using renewable energy sources.The initiatives of the company are helping to expand its presence in the UK, which will eventually boost its customer base in the country, thereby being a tailwind for its overall revenue growth.Impressive FinancialsNotably, Salesforce has been benefiting from robust adoption of its cloud-based solutions across all geographic regions, which aids revenue growth.

2547,CRM,"Shares of Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) have been gaining solid momentum, of late, and even crafted a 52-week high of $135.71 yesterday. One of the major reasons behind this could be the company’s outstanding first-quarter fiscal 2019 results. Also, encouraging second-quarter and full-fiscal outlook drove its shares higher.Notably, the company has gained approximately 7% since it reported fiscal first-quarter results on May 29. The stock has outperformed its industry in the year-to-date period. Salesforce has returned 32.6% in the said period, while the industry has gained 17.7%.Salesforce’s fiscal first-quarter revenues were up 25% year over year to $3 billion and came ahead of management’s guided range of 2.925-$2.935 billion. The reported figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.94 billion as well. Rapid adoption of the company’s cloud-based solutions and acquisition synergies led to the splendid top-line results.The company reported non-GAAP earnings of 74 cents per share, trumping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. The figure increased more than twofold from the year-ago quarter.In fact, Salesforce beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 19.7%. Backed by the impressive results, the company has issued an upbeat outlook for the second quarter as well as full fiscal.Let’s take a look at what factors are driving Salesforce’s back-to-back robust quarterly performances.Buyouts Buoying Top LineAcquisitions have always been one of Salesforce’s key growth strategies. Over the past two years, the company has closed or was in the midst of as many as 16 acquisitions, worth billions of dollars, including its latest biggest-ever buyout agreement — MuleSoft. These acquisitions have strengthened its position in the customer relationship-management solution-providing space. We expect the acquisition synergies to continue driving Salesforce’s top-line performance in the quarters ahead.Expanding International Business With PartnershipsSalesforce still generates only about 30% of total revenues from international operations, which is lower than its rivals like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) or Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) composition of around 50%. Nonetheless, the company noted that its partnership agreements with the likes of Amazon and Alphabet for the firms’ cloud services have been helping it expand Salesforces’ international operations.Earlier, the company used to run its software at its own data centers which had been curbing its growth potentials. However, in 2016, Salesforce decided to utilize the geographical reach of other data-center service providers in order to expand its international business.The company’s first partnership in this space was with Amazon Web Services in 2016, followed by the next alliance with Alphabet last November. During fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, the company won several deals due to its international-expansion initiatives.Partner Program Adding CustomersStellar growth in Salesforce partner certifications has been fueling the company’s top-line results. Notably, the company’s partner certification has witnessed five-time growth over the past four years and more companies are willing to invest in Salesforces’ activities. Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report) has emerged as one of the biggest examples for this. Notably, Accenture is currently a global leader in the Salesforce implementation service space, with more than 11,800 skilled consultants.The company added and strengthened its relationships with some notable customers during the fiscal first quarter such as Citi, Philips and Santander UK, SoftBank and LUXA among others. We expect the trend to continue and drive the overall financial performance of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

GitHub will continue to run relatively independently, and Microsoft will burn none of its more than $130 billion in cash to fund the deal.Tax reform incentives seemed to suggest that tech firms would finally be spending some of their overseas cash on big deals this year, but that has not necessarily been the case so far. Still, a number of major tech M&As have gone down, and several interesting trends have emerged.Ryan takes a look at Adobe’s (ADBE  -  Free Report) plan to buy e-commerce solutions provider Magento, as well as PayPal’s (PYPL  -  Free Report) acquisition of fintech firm iZettle, and examines how industry leaders are using new technologies to modernize small business transactions.He also digs into Salesforce’s (CRM  -  Free Report) deal to take over MuleSoft  and compares it to the Microsoft-GitHub acquisition. Salesforce and Microsoft, leaders in their own right, have looked at the evolving nature of the tech sector and expanded outside their traditional core businesses. Why?

I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and story teller for the fascinating arena of behavioral economics.On the inaugural episode of the Mind Over Money podcast, I outlined what two different sciences were teaching us about how our brains make decisions, especially those involving uncertainty and risk like stock market investing.I liked to describe these scientific twins and their goals and methods this way: neuroscience examines our behavior from the ""inside-out"" and behavioral economics studies our decisions from the ""outside-in"" to gain clues about where it all goes wrong.In a Medium blog post that accompanied the episode, I listed eight of the most common (or intriguing) cognitive biases that get in the way of better decisions. You can find that piece here...Mental Models of Financial SabotageThat article also has a classic money-behavior research question from the founders of the ""outside-in"" psychology of economics, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. I have talked about that dynamic duo in several podcasts and perhaps most poignantly in this episode: What's the Undoing Project All About?Charles and Tracey: The Wealth of Investing Wisdom... From ExperienceToday, I was excited to discover that the summer edition of the Charles Schwab magazine OnInvesting was devoted to one of my favorite topics. The cover title reads ""Mind Over Matter"" and the description says ""Overcoming the mental mix-ups that may be costing you money.""To take their 8-question investor decision-making quiz, I invited my colleague Tracey Ryniec on the show to find out how rational we are as professional investors.Tracey runs two model portfolios at Zacks, the Value Investor and the Insider Trader, and she has lots of experience with her own decision-making traps as well as those of her followers.We go through the eight questions and their corresponding cognitive biases for over 20 minutes, while also weaving in stories from our experiences as long-term investors and short-term traders giving stock recommendations to thousands of loyal followers.Getting “Straight” on Your Goals, Time Frames, & ProcessesOne stock I was honored to mention was one that I just sold today for a sizable gain in my Healthcare Innovators long-term portfolio: Align Technology (ALGN  -  Free Report), maker of the Invisalign clear dental ""straighteners.""I explained how I also owned it for a smaller gain in my short-term TAZR Trader portfolio. Wearing two hats like this simultaneously can be done if your goals, time horizons, and research/decision processes are clear and deliberate.It's not about having perfect discipline as much as having the systematic consistency to write out a solid plan and then check your behavior against it as frequently as possible.Tracey and I also talk about being open to new information but then still vetting that info against your plans and processes.And I share some ideas about investing mistakes I've made, based on an article I wrote in March. At the time, I wanted to use at least 3 blunders -- selling Salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report) and Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report) and not buying Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) -- as windows to my own biased decision-making.These were mistakes in the context of how bull markets actually work based on the goals, methods, and behavior of large fund managers. I explain the concepts in more detail in the article here...A Wonder to Behold: Last Innings of the Bull MarketThat article also includes a link to a special 1-minute video I made in October that sums up how and why you ""follow the big money"" right to the end of the bull market.Because unless you know more than they do, you've probably called the end of the economic cycle and the top of the market about 5 times before in this decade.Finally to learn more about the fascinating connections between Salesforce, IBM, and NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) in making artificial intelligence a requisite technology of the Fortune 500, see my March 2017 video which I'm certain Einstein and Watson would say still stands the test of time...Get Your ""MPA"" In Deep LearningDisclosure: I own shares of NVDA in the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the TAZR Trader and Healthcare Innovators services.

2553,CRM,"A successful portfolio manager is aware of the importance of having well-performing stocks in one’s portfolio. Indicators of a stock’s consistent performance include a rally in share price and robust fundamentals.One such stock that investors need to hold on to right now is Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report). Though there are a few concerns, these are short lived. The stock has the potential to perform well over the long run.Accenture’s share-price movement has been quite encouraging. In the last one year, its shares have appreciated 34.5%, while the industry to which it belongs to recorded a decline of 30.5%.What’s Driving Accenture?Accenture is one of the leading providers of management consultancy, technology and outsourcing services in the world. The company is on a growth trajectory, gathering momentum from its positive earnings surprise history and robust fundamentals. It delivered a positive earnings surprise in three out of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 3%.Last quarter, Accenture reported sturdy year-over-year improvement in revenues and earnings. The year-over-year upswing was primarily driven by its continued focus on innovative product roll outs, continued investments in enhancing digital and marketing capabilities, along with major acquisitions.Furthermore, Accenture pursues strategic acquisitions to diversify its offerings and expand operating markets. The company closed 37 acquisition deals worth approximately $1.7 billion in fiscal 2017. Also, over the last three fiscals, Accenture has invested approximately $3.4 billion in acquiring nearly 70 companies, including start-ups.These acquisitions have helped the company enhance its product offerings and penetrate into newer markets, thereby contributing to the company’s top line. We believe its acquisition strategy will have a positive impact on Accenture’s top-line performances in the upcoming quarters.Apart from acquisitions, Accenture’s strategic partnerships with companies like Google, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and Salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report) have also been key catalysts.  Partnerships have always helped the company fortify its presence across segments like IT security, customer-relationship management and consulting, in turn bolstering its revenues. We expect the company to retain this bullish momentum, backed by its continued focus on operational efficiency.Bottom LineGiven that the company’s long-term earnings per share growth rate is 10% and has a VGM Style Score of A, we believe the stock still has much upside potential. We can essentially filter the negatives and focus on the positives which drive price.Accenture carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2554,CRM,"About a month has gone by since the last earnings report for Salesforce.com Inc (CRM  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 4.7% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsContinuing its earnings streak for the seventh quarter in a row, Salesforce posted splendid third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein the top and bottom lines not only fared better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but also came ahead of management’s guided ranges. Quarterly revenues and earnings also marked year-over-year improvement.The company reported non-GAAP earnings of 39 cents per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents and came ahead of its own guidance range of 31-32 cents as well. Moreover, the figure compared favorably with the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 24 cents, mainly driven by strong top-line growth and efficient cost management, partially offset by increased number of outstanding shares.Before discussing the fiscal third-quarter results in detail, here are some important business highlights of the quarter.Amazon Partnership Stoking International GrowthThe company still generates only about 30% of total revenues from international operations, which is much lower than its rivals like Microsoft or Oracle composition of around 50%. Nonetheless, Salesforce noted that its partnership agreements with Amazon’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) last year have been helping it expand its international operations.Earlier, the company used to run its software at its own data centers, which was curbing its growth potentials. However, the company decided to utilize the AWS data center’s geographical reach to expand its international business in the previous year. In addition, Salesforce has planned to invest about $400 million on AWS’ cloud platform, over the next four years.Of late, Salesforce also entered into an agreement with AWS to run its software in the latter’s Canadian and Australian data centers. This, in turn, has opened up fresh prospects in the Canadian and Asia-Pacific markets.During the fiscal third quarter, the company won several deals backed by its international expansion initiatives. Companies like Hilton, DuPont, National Australia Bank and Hitachi picked Salesforce’s solutions to fuel digital transformation.Having discussed the third quarter business highlights, let’s now turn to the financial results.RevenuesSalesforce continued to witness solid growth in revenues. The company’s revenues of $2.68 billion jumped 24.9% year over year and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.648 billion. Furthermore, reported revenues came above the guided range of $2.64-$2.65 billion (mid-point: $2.645 billion).The improvement can be primarily attributable to rapid adoption of the company’s cloud-based solutions. Also, higher demand for the Salesforce ExactTarget Marketing Cloud platform, part of the Salesforce1 Customer Platform, drove the year-over-year upside in revenues.Now, coming to its business segments, revenues at Subscription and Support climbed about 25.3% from the year-ago quarter to $2.486 billion. Professional Services and Other revenues surged almost 20.5% to $193.7 million.Geographically, the company witnessed constant currency revenue growth of 21%, 33% and 27% in the Americas, EMEA and APAC, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.MarginsSalesforce’s non-GAAP gross profit came in at $2.038 billion, up 25.6%. Additionally, gross margin expanded 40 basis points (bps) to 76.1% primarily owing to solid revenue growth that was partially offset by increased investment in infrastructure development including the expansion of the international data centers.Non-GAAP operating expenses increased up 18.6% from the prior-year quarter to $1.601 billion. However, as a percentage of revenues, operating expenses decreased to 59.8% from 63% in the year-ago quarter. This was primarily because of efficient cost management.Salesforce posted non-GAAP operating income of $436.9 million compared with the year-ago figure of $272.6 million while operating margin advanced 360 bps to 16.3%. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP operating margin was mainly driven by improved gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.Non-GAAP net income grew 66.4% year over year to $284.4 million while net income margin expanded 260 bps to 10.6%. The benefit from improved gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues on net income margin was partially offset by elevated interest and other expenses.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowSalesforce exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $3.63 billion compared with $3.50 billion in the previous quarter. Accounts receivable were $1.520 billion compared with $1.569 million at the end of the fiscal first quarter. As of Oct 31, 2017, total deferred revenues were $4.39 billion, up 26% on a year-over-year basis.During the first three quarters of fiscal 2018, the company generated operating cash flow of $1.687 billion. Also, it generated free cash flow of $1.290 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2018.GuidanceBuoyed by better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter results, the company provided an encouraging guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter and raised its outlook for the full year as well. For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company anticipates revenues in the range of $2.801-$2.811 billion (mid-point: $2.806 billion), representing a year-over-year increase of 22-23%.Further, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the band of 32-33 cents. On a GAAP basis, the same is anticipated between 3 cents and 4 cents.Additionally, Salesforce raised its revenues and earnings outlook for fiscal 2018. Revenues are now anticipated to come in the range of $10.43-$10.44 billion (mid-point $10.435 billion), up from the previous projection of $10.35-$10.40 billion (mid-point $10.375 billion), representing a 24% year-over-year increase.By completing this target, the company is expected to achieve the $10 billion mark in revenues faster than any other enterprise software company.Similarly, Salesforce now projects non-GAAP earnings to lie between $1.32 and $1.33 while GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of 12-13 cents. This compares with the previous guidance range of $1.29-$1.31 on non-GAAP basis and 7-9 cents on GAAP basis.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Analysts were quiet during the past month as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions.Salesforce.com Inc Price and Consensus  Salesforce.com Inc Price and Consensus | Salesforce.com Inc QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, the stock has a strong Growth Score of A, a grade with the same score on the momentum front.

2555,CRM,"Leading business service provider Cintas Corporation (CTAS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on Dec 21. The company is likely to report higher revenues from Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment, which accounts for the lion’s share of total revenues, due to improved demand for its products.This, in turn, is likely to result in higher earnings for the quarter.Top-Line ImprovementCintas recorded industry leading revenue growth over the past few quarters with continued focus on core businesses. New business wins, deeper penetration of existing customers with more products and services, and customer retention remain key strengths of the company. In addition, Cintas also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is likely to benefit the company in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Moreover, the successful integration of G&K Services Inc. is likely to expand Cintas’ customer profile and augment its revenues. With annual revenues of approximately $1 billion, G&K Services has more than 170,000 customers in the United States and Canada. The combined company is expected to cater more than one billion business customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment revenues is currently pegged at $1,296 million, up from $1,006 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues from First Aid Safety and Protection segment are expected to be $137 million compared with reported revenues of $125 million in the year-earlier quarter.Other Key FactorsHowever, a persistently challenging macroeconomic environment has mostly driven customers to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas. This is expected to result in some loss of businesses. In addition, significant international operations expose it to risks of fluctuation in foreign exchange rates, which in turn, is likely to impact its financial results.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cintas is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -4.19% as the former is pegged at $1.20 and the latter at $1.25.

2556,CRM,"BlackBerry Limited (BB  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Dec 20, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 5 cents per share compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of a penny. Results were aided by robust software sales. Total revenues in the quarter were $249 million, down 25.4% year over year. However, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $231 million.Lets see whats in store this earnings season.Factors Likely at PlayWe expect BlackBerry’s fiscal third-quarter results to be benefited by strong software sales on the back of its decision to end all internal hardware development and focus exclusively on software business.Of late, the company has also inked many deals to bolster its software business. For example, during the quarter BlackBerry signed a sales and distribution agreement with Tokyo Electron Device Limited. Per the agreement, Japanese device manufacturers will have access to Blackberry's QNX Software Development Platform 7.0, the most advanced and secure embedded platform in the market.In fact, BlackBerry’s efforts to expand its product portfolio augur well and should boost results in the to-be-reported quarter. The company expects its Software and Service revenues to rise between 10% and 15% for fiscal 2018.During the quarter, BlackBerry was ordered to pay Nokia (NOK  -  Free Report) approximately $137 million following the loss of a payment dispute with the latter. We expect management to provide an update on the issue on the fiscal third-quarter conference call.However, BlackBerry is exposed to risks related to foreign currency fluctuations as it operates globally. Adverse foreign currency effects might also hurt results in the to-be-reported quarter. High costs might hurt the bottom line as well.BlackBerry Limited Price and EPS Surprise  BlackBerry Limited Price and EPS Surprise | BlackBerry Limited QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that BlackBerry is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.

This is because the Most Accurate estimate is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of a penny. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: BlackBerry has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Computer and technology sector may consider the following stocks with the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat in their upcoming releases:Salesforce.com (CRM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.02% and a Zacks Rank #3.

2559,CRM,"ServiceNow (NOW  -  Free Report) has been a favorite with investors, courtesy of its strong partnerships, global presence, rising share price and strong fundamentals. Shares of ServiceNow have gained 62.8% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 35.9% rally.Let’s now delve deeper and take a look at some of the aspects aiding the company’s performance.Key DriversThe share price momentum can primarily be attributed to growing adoption of the company’s platform and tools by 2000 (G2K) companies, as defined by Forbes. The company is also gaining from rapid penetration into the non-ITSM markets such as customer service, human resource and security.ServiceNow has been a dominant name in the IT service market (“ITSM”). The company is steadily winning market share amid the ongoing trend of replacing legacy on-premise systems with cloud-based processes, especially among G2K companies. The growing penetration at G2K customer base has been driving ServiceNow’s top-line, which has been exemplary, increasing at a CAGR of more than 70% over 2009-2016 time frame.Notably, with none of the customers exceeding 10% of revenues in the last couple of years, the customer base remains unaffected by the problem of customer concentration. Diversified clientele is another positive.Moreover, the company’s expanding product portfolio (including emerging products) and strong renewal rate (almost 98%), are the other key catalysts. Additionally, the popularity of its Customer Service Management product, launch of a new HR product and the availability of the Jakarta platform to all is anticipated to boost performance further.Acquisitions have also played an important part in ServiceNow’s growth trajectory over the years. The acquisitions of Neebula Systems (2014), BrightPoint Security and ITapp (both in 2016) has aided the company to expand product portfolio, particularly security and ITOM solutions. The recent buyout of DxContinuum will boost its predictive modelling capabilities, consequently expanding ServiceNow’s intelligent automation product portfolio going ahead. Also, the company's recently announced acquisition of Qlue, a developer of virtual messaging agents, is anticipated to enhance customer experience. Further, the announced acquisitions of Telepathy and SkyGiraffe are expected to enhance the company’s enterprise mobile experience.ServiceNow has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, recording a positive average earnings surprise of 18.6%.Further, it has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 39%.Risk RemainsHowever, in spite of an improving top-line, mounting losses and stiff competition in the non-ITSM markets from established players like Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and salesforce.com (CRM  -  Free Report) remain concerns for the company.Zacks Rank and Key PicksServiceNow currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2561,CRM,"On Dec 6, we issued an updated research report on Oracle Corp. (ORCL  -  Free Report), a Redwood City, CA-based enterprise-grade database, middleware and application software provider.Oracle, which enjoys a dominant position in the enterprise software and database management system (DBMS) software market, is gaining ground in the cloud sector as well.However, the business model transition will adversely affect the company in the near term as revenues from SaaS are recognized later against upfront revenues from legacy on-premise licensing business. Additionally, increased spending for the transition negatively impacts margins.Oracle stock has gained 25.9% year to date, underperforming the 31.8% rally of the industry it belongs to.Key FactorsOracle’s next-generation autonomous database, which is supported by machine learning, is a key catalyst. Among infrastructure, DBMS is expected to record strong growth driven by Big Data and digitalization initiatives. We believe that Oracle’s leading position in the DBMS software market will make it the primary beneficiary of this increased spending.Moreover, Oracle is gaining from a significant momentum of its software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings. It is winning market share against salesforce.com (CRM  -  Free Report) and Workday (WDAY  -  Free Report), which is a significant growth driver. We believe the company’s growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth in the foreseeable future.Oracle Corporation Revenue (TTM) Oracle Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Oracle Corporation QuoteBoth its software-as-a-service (SaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) products are anticipated to  witness robust growth over the next few years as enterprises increasingly transition to the cloud. According to an IDC market report, SaaS will remain the dominant cloud computing type, capturing nearly two thirds of all public cloud spending in 2017 and roughly 60% in 2020. To tap this massive opportunity, Oracle introduced a number of Cloud Platform services in the last few quarters that will not only help personalize SaaS applications, which are currently in demand but also support easy migration of on-premise applications to Oracle Cloud.However, the late revenue recognition from a SaaS based business model will be a drag on the top line. Moreover, additional spending on PaaS and IaaS will keep margins under pressure in the near term. Furthermore, intensifying competition in the cloud business from Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a concern for the company.Zacks RankOracle has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 37.94%.In the preceding quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 41.18%. Moreover, Coupa beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in three of the last four quarters.For third-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues are anticipated in the range of $44.8-45.3 million. Subscription revenues are forecast between $40.8 million and $41.3 million, while professional services revenues are projected at approximately $4 million.Management projects non-GAAP gross margins between 67% and 69%. Moreover, non-GAAP loss from operations is anticipated in the range of $5.5-$6.5 million. Net loss is anticipated in the range of 10-12 cents per share. COUPA SOFTWARE Price and EPS Surprise COUPA SOFTWARE Price and EPS Surprise | COUPA SOFTWARE QuoteNotably, Coupa’s shares have returned 41.7% year to date, slightly better than the 29.8% rally of the industry.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors    Coupa provides unified, cloud-based spend management platform that helps enterprises keep a tab of daily expenditures. Cumulative spending over the platform since its launch has surpassed $500 billion (at the end of second-quarter fiscal 2018). This reflects growing adoption of its solutions by the likes of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN  -  Free Report), salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report), Caterpillar, Unilever and others.Moreover, an expanding partner base is expected to drive top-line growth. The partnership with Software AG makes it easy for companies to integrate Coupa with most leading enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, including those from SAP and Oracle. The company has expanded CoupaLink certified solutions by adding Software AG’s webMethods Connector.In the last quarter, Coupa launched its next-generation cloud platform and added more than 70 new capabilities. We believe that the platform will help the company gain new customers rapidly, which will drive result in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Moreover, the availability of Coupa Open Buy with Amazon Business in the United States is a growth driver.Earnings WhisperNevertheless, Coupa is unlikely to deliver a positive earnings surprise in third-quarter fiscal 2018 due to an unfavorable combination of Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.This is because, as per our model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 for this to happen.

2563,CRM,"Guidewire Software, Inc. (GWRE  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP loss of 6 cents per share, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents per share. The reported figure was, however, much lower than the year ago bottom-line figure of 2 cents per share.The company posted revenues of $108.2 million, which increased 15% from the year-ago quarter. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $101 million and was above the guided range.Management noted that the recent consolidated release of the Guidewire platform has been instrumental in the enhancement of its product suite. The company is also banking on its strategic partnership with Salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report) for its growth.Notably, the company is transforming to a subscription based model from a term license based one, which might hurt the top line in the near term. This is because term license revenues include advance payments and subscription-based revenues are a bit delayed.Nevertheless, management is extremely optimistic about the several cloud-based products launched in the quarter, at a time when the P&C insurance industry is moving steadily toward adoption of cloud solutions.So far this year, Guidewire stock has gained 56.0%, substantially outperforming the 27.5% rally of the industry it belongs to.Revenue Details    The company has three main segments namely Maintenance, License and Other and Services.Maintenance revenues amounted to $18.9 million, up 15% year over year. However, the same from License and other decreased 22% from the year-ago quarter to $30.1 million. Service revenues surged 52% from the year-ago quarter to $59.1 million.Management stated that a substantial majority of the first quarter’s revenues were from subscription based products. Backed by the strong performance of subscription products, management expected increase from subscription sales were in the range of 30% to 40% from 20% to 30% for fiscal 2018.However, growth of the Maintenance revenues that are part of subscriptions will be negatively impacted while the change in the company’s business model is in progress, because of the delayed revenue recognition from the subscription based products. Per management, the license revenues will have a negative impact in fiscal 2018. The sales process might be a bit elongated due to the time taken by customers to choose between on-premise and cloud delivery options. Perpetual license revenues facing a decline will be a further drag to the license and other revenues.Meanwhile, services revenues were better than expected in the quarter. The segment is anticipated to improve its performance in the near term backed by proper implementations of InsuranceNow.

The integration of Cyence would imply that the company would be able to provide an entire life cycle to the insurance products starting from designing to transaction management.Guidewire Software, Inc.

Nonetheless, Salesforce noted that its partnership agreements with Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Amazon Web Services (AWS) last year have been helping it expand its international operations.Earlier, the company used to run its software at its own data centers, which was curbing its growth potentials. However, the company decided to utilize the AWS data center’s geographical reach to expand its international business in the previous year. In addition, Salesforce has planned to invest about $400 million on AWS’ cloud platform, over the next four years.Of late, Salesforce also entered into an agreement with AWS to run its software in the latter’s Canadian and Australian data centers. This, in turn, has opened up fresh prospects in the Canadian and Asia-Pacific markets.During the fiscal third quarter, the company won several deals backed by its international expansion initiatives.

Furthermore, reported revenues came above the guided range of $2.64-$2.65 billion (mid-point: $2.645 billion).The improvement can be primarily attributable to rapid adoption of the company’s cloud-based solutions.

Professional Services and Other revenues surged almost 20.5% to $193.7 million.Geographically, the company witnessed constant currency revenue growth of 21%, 33% and 27% in the Americas, EMEA and APAC, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.MarginsSalesforce’s non-GAAP gross profit came in at $2.038 billion, up 25.6%. Additionally, gross margin expanded 40 basis points (bps) to 76.1% primarily owing to solid revenue growth that was partially offset by increased investment in infrastructure development including the expansion of the international data centers.Non-GAAP operating expenses increased up 18.6% from the prior-year quarter to $1.601 billion. However, as a percentage of revenues, operating expenses decreased to 59.8% from 63% in the year-ago quarter. This was primarily because of efficient cost management.Salesforce posted non-GAAP operating income of $436.9 million compared with the year-ago figure of $272.6 million while operating margin advanced 360 bps to 16.3%. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP operating margin was mainly driven by improved gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.Non-GAAP net income grew 66.4% year over year to $284.4 million while net income margin expanded 260 bps to 10.6%. The benefit from improved gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues on net income margin was partially offset by elevated interest and other expenses.Salesforce.com Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Salesforce.com Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Salesforce.com Inc QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowSalesforce exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $3.63 billion compared with $3.50 billion in the previous quarter.

2568,CRM,"We have already moved past the traditionally busy stretch of earnings season, but there are still several key reports to look forward to next week.

This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.And today, we’ve made that task even easier for you. Using the Earnings Calendar, we looked ahead to next week and selected the biggest reports to watch. Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of November 20.Salesfore.com (CRM  -  Free Report)Cloud computing and customer relations giant Salesforce is scheduled to report its latest earnings results after the market closes on November 21. Salesforce has never missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings, and shares of the company are up over 56% so far this year. Nevertheless, increased competition in the cloud CRM space, as well as expensive international investments, could create new pressures this quarter.Based on our latest consensus estimates, we expect Salesforce to report earnings of 37 cents per share and revenues of $2.65 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 52% and 23%, respectively. Investors will want to focus on the company's international growth, as a series of strategic partnerships and investments have made this segment the company's key growth catalyst. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report)Hewlett Packard Enterprise is slated to release its latest earnings report after the bell on November 21. Things have been relatively up and down for HPE since its split from the former Hewlett-Packard Company in late-2015. Still, the company is coming off a strong earnings beat in the most recent quarter, and a recent spin-off could help improve margins.According to our latest consensus estimates, HPE is poised to post earnings of 28 cents per share and revenues of $7.71 billion. During the third-quarter of fiscal 2017, the company sold its Software business to British firm Micro Focus, so the most important year-over-year comparison for investors to keep an eye on will be in the net margin category. Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report)Agricultural equipment behemoth Deere & Company is scheduled to report its latest earnings results before the market opens on November 22.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 37 cents, representing a year-over-year increase of a whopping 52%. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $2.65 billion, up 23.5% from the year-ago quarter.Let’s see what’s driving this overwhelming expectation.Amazon Partnership Stoking International GrowthFor the last few years, Salesforce has been keen on building partnerships to expand its international operations. Its partnership with Amazon’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) is very crucial and the company, during its last earnings conference call, stated that the collaboration has helped it gain businesses overseas.It should be noted that earlier Salesforce used to run its software at the company’s data centers, which was curbing its growth potential. However, last year, the company decided to utilize the AWS data center’s geographical reach to expand its international business. In addition, Salesforce plans to invest about $400 million on AWS’ cloud platform, over the next four years.In the last few months, Salesforce has entered into an agreement with AWS to run its software in the latter’s Canadian and Australian data centers. This has opened up fresh prospects in the Canadian and Asia-Pacific markets.During the fiscal second quarter, the company won several deals due to its international expansion initiatives. Companies like Toshiba, Nomura, Queensland Urban Utilities and Australia Post picked Salesforce’s solutions to fuel digital transformation. It is most likely that the company will continue winning international deals which will drive its fiscal third-quarter top- and bottom-line results.Salesforce.com Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Salesforce.com Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Salesforce.com Inc QuoteAcquisitions Driving RevenuesAcquisitions have always been one of Salesforce’s key growth strategies. Over the last two years, the company closed a number of takeovers worth a combined deal value of more than $4 billion. Last year alone, the company made as many as 12 takeover deals, including its biggest ever buyout — Demandware — concluded in July 2016. These acquisitions have strengthened its position in the customer relationship management (CRM  -  Free Report) solution providing space. We expect the acquisition synergies to drive Salesforce’s fiscal third-quarter top-line performance.Salesforce Partner Program Adding CustomersTremendous growth in Salesforce partner certifications has been fueling the company’s top-line results. During its fiscal second-quarter conference call, Salesforce announced that its partner certification witnessed growth of five times over the last four years, and more companies are willing to invest in Salesforce activities. Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report) has emerged as one of the biggest examples for this. Notably, Accenture is currently a global leader in the Salesforce implementation service space, with over 11,000 skilled consultants.Notably, a number of big organizations, including Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), 21st Century Fox, Jefferies Investment Bank and Samsung, picked Salesforce solutions during the fiscal second quarter to drive their digital transformation. Analysts covering the stock believe that the fiscal third quarter will witness the same trend, thereby bolstering its top-line performance.Furthermore, during the fiscal second quarter, Salesforce broke through the $10-billion run rate and named itself the first company in the history of enterprise cloud software industry to have achieved this milestone so fast, including its closest rivals like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and SAP SE.Currently, Salesforce carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2570,CRM,"Shares of Twilio Inc. (TWLO  -  Free Report) jumped over 4% during yesterday’s after-hours trade after the company reported splendid third-quarter top-line results and raised its 2017 outlook. Twilio’s third-quarter revenues topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as management’s guidance range. Also, the top line marked solid year-over-year growth.Talking about the company’s bottom-line results, though it posted a loss per share, the figure came in line with the consensus estimate and matched the upper-end of management’s guidance range as well. However, the reported loss came in wider than the year-ago quarter’s loss.Let’s discuss the third-quarter results in detail.RevenuesThe company’s third-quarter revenues surged 40.6% year over year to $100.5 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $91.9 million. Also, it came ahead of management’s previously guided range of $91-$93 million. Furthermore, the company’s base revenue jumped 43% year over year to $92 million.The robust top-line performance was mainly driven by remarkable year-over-year growth in active customer account which was a result of the company’s continued focus on introducing products as well as its go-to-market sales strategy.Part of this tremendous top-line growth was also contributed by the strong adoption of the Twilio Studio product launched in the third quarter. Jeff Lawson’s statement on Twilio Studio suggests he is very optimistic about this product’s success. He noted, “With Twilio Studio, the visual builder for Twilio, we can accelerate our customers’ roadmaps and help an even larger set of users build on our platform. We are excited by the size, scale and diversity of what new and existing customers are creating with Twilio.”During the reported quarter, the company registered a whopping 34.9% surge in active customer accounts, adding over 12,032 accounts in the last 12 months, bringing the total count to 46,489 as of Sep 30, 2017. During the second quarter alone, Twilio added over 3,058 active customer accounts.Going forward, we believe the company will continue with its strategy of bringing in new and advanced products in the quarters ahead. It should be noted that during the second-quarter conference call, the company had stated, “We had a total of 42 product announcements around SIGNAL this year, including Twilio Functions, our serverless computing product, new analytics products, our voice recognition product we built in conjunction with Google and support for several new third-party communications channels like Alexa, Slack, Twitter and email for companies want to communicate with their customers in a growing list of new mediums.”Operating ResultsNon-GAAP gross profit jumped approximately 33% year over year to $53.7 million. However, gross margin contracted 310 basis points (bps) to 53.4%, as elevated cost of goods sold more than offset the benefit of higher revenues.Non-GAAP operating expenses flared up 40.4% year over year to $61.4 million. The year-over-year surge was mainly due to increased investment in research and development, and sales to capitalize on the market opportunity. However, as a percentage of revenues, the figure was flat at 61.1%.Further, the company’s non-GAAP operating loss increased to $24 million from $11.3 million reported in the year-ago-quarter. Non-GAAP net loss came in at $7.1 million or 8 cents per share, which is wider than the year-ago quarter figure of $3.3 million or 4 cents. The year-over-year widened loss was mainly due to elevated costs and operating expenses which more than offset the benefit of sturdy top-line growth.However, non-GAAP loss per share came in line with management’s upper-end guided range of a loss of 7-8 cents. Also, the quarterly loss matches the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Twilio Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Twilio Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Twilio Inc. QuoteBalance SheetThe company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $283.9 million, slightly down from $289.2 million at the end of the previous quarter. In addition to this, during the first three quarters of 2017, the company used $7.1 million worth of cash for operational activities.OutlookBuoyed by a strong quarterly performance, Twilio raised its full-year outlook and provided encouraging guidance for the fourth quarter. For 2017, Twilio now expects revenues to come between $386.5 million and $388.5 million (mid-point $387.5 million), up from $371-$375 million (mid-point $373 million) projected earlier. This is significantly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $373 million.Similarly, base revenue is estimated to be in the range of $356.5-$357.5 million, higher than the previous forecast of $348.5-$350.5 million. Non-GAAP net loss is now projected to come in the range of 22-23 cents, against its previous projection of 22-24 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 23 cents.For the fourth quarter, Twilio estimates revenues to be between $102.5 million and $104.5 million (mid-point $103.5 million). This is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $98.2 million. Base revenue is anticipated to be in the range of $96.5-$97.5 million. Non-GAAP net loss is projected to lie in the 5-6 cents per share band. The consensus estimate is currently pegged at a loss of 6 cents.Recovers from Uber HangoverThe recently reported strong quarterly results clearly indicate that the company has been able to mitigate the loss of revenues from Uber.It should be noted that Uber uses Twilio services for a variety of used cases such as driver and rider communication, driver marketing and several others. Till 2016, Uber used Twilio’s platforms in most of its geographical operations. However, since first-quarter 2017, Uber is “optimizing by used case and by geography” and is planning to ""move communications for some use cases in-app."" This means that Uber is now trying to operate its messaging services internally.Looking at these developments in its biggest customer’s strategy on communication services, Jeff Lawson (Twilio’s co-founder and chief executive officer) is concerned and during the second-quarter conference call he had stated that this will restrain Twilio’s overall growth in 2017. Uber’s contribution to Twilio’s revenues was declined to approximately 9% in the second quarter from roughly 12% in the first quarter and 13% in the second quarter of 2016.Despite this, the company managed to report robust revenue growth in back-to-back two quarters, returning itself once again on growth trajectory mainly due to its sustained focus on rolling out products, global expansion, go-to-market sales and acquisition strategies.Our TakeWe believe back-to-back strong quarterly results and optimistic guidance will give a fresh boost to the company’s share price which is currently trading below 28% to its 52-week high level of $38.88.Notably, Twilio’s shares have underperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the year-to-date period. The stock has lost 3.5% of its value during the said period, while the industry recorded growth of 30%.Going forward, the company’s key initiatives, including product innovation, global expansion and acquisitions, are helping it gain customers, which bode well for long-term growth. We believe proliferation in cloud and mobile penetration across the globe will continue to fuel Twilio’s customer growth over the long run.Twilio boasts a strong clientele that includes the likes of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), salesforce.com (CRM  -  Free Report) and Twitter among others. Furthermore, the long-standing relationship with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) is particularly noticeable. Twilio uses Amazon Web Service (AWS) to host its platform.Nonetheless, intensifying competition in the communications market and growing prevalence of in-app push notifications are major concerns. Moreover, customer concentration is a headwind.Currently, Twilio carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2572,CRM,"It was another interesting week on Wall Street, with early optimism about progress made in ongoing trade talks between the U.S. and China giving way to caution after President Trump cancelled a proposed meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jung Un.On the earnings side of things, fresh reports from the likes of HP Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), and Gap (GPS  -  Free Report) helped mark one of the last busy stretches of the Q1 report season. Results were mixed this week, doing little to help broader indexes break out of the ranges they have been stuck in throughout recent months. Still, a few more marquee reports in the upcoming week have the potential to help that cause.With that said, investors can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases.

2573,CRM,"Investing in large-cap companies is a safe bet, especially during economic downturns and stringent credit conditions. Many consider large-cap stocks an essential part of their portfolio, given the stability, healthy dividends and safety cushion they offer.Large-cap funds are ideal investment options for those seeking high returns. These also come with lower risk than small-cap and mid-cap funds.Technology Sector OutshinesTechnology has been one of the most lucrative sectors for investors, year to date. This is evident from the NASDAQ Composite (IXIC) and the S&P 500’s (GSPC) rally of 7.5% and 25%, respectively, so far this year.Among sectors, technology continues to shine, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (“XLK”) registering a return of 9.5% year to date.The sector is benefiting from increasing demand for cutting-edge technology such as cloud computing, Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT), wearables, AR/VR headsets, drones, self-driving cars and artificial intelligence (AI).Although technology stocks will gain less from the corporate tax cuts, they hoard massive amounts of cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from Trump's repatriation policy. Moreover, higher domestic cash level will make the technology stocks less susceptible to an anticipated interest rate hike in 2018.Moreover, escalating demand for sensors and software for autonomous vehicles, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS), Augmented/Virtual reality devices (AR/VR) and Internet of Things (IoT) are significant catalysts.Further, rapid development of 5G platform and technology has emerged as the next growth driver for these companies.In view of these bullish sentiments, momentum investing can be a winning strategy for those seeking high returns in a short span. This strategy focuses on hot stocks that have been gaining over the past few weeks or months.Spending to Grow AggressivelyBlackRock expects ADAS market to grow at least 20% each year through 2025, creating significant growth opportunity for manufacturers of camera lenses, sensors and other items.Per market research firm IDC, global spending on robotics and drones solutions will increase 22.1% year over year to $103.1 billion in 2018. This spending is projected to grow at a CAGR of 25.4% over 2018-20121 time frame to $218.4 billion.Moreover, global spending on IoT will grow 14.6% year over year to reach $772.5 billion in 2018. IDC predicts global spending on IoT to surpass $1 trillion mark in 2020 and reach $1.1 trillion by 2021.Our ChoicesWe believe that the bullish projections present significant growth opportunity for momentum investors, who look for high returns in a short span.Momentum investing is not so easy due to market volatility but success comes only to those who can effectively ride the upswing and brave the downswing of the market with the same style. It is here that the Zacks Style Score System can come in handy.We use the Zacks Momentum Style Score to pick stocks. The style score indicates the best time to buy a stock and take advantage of its momentum with a highest probability of success. Moreover, we prefer large caps due to their fundamental strength and stability amid increasing volatility in markets.Back-tested results show that stocks with Momentum Style Scores of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) handily outperform other stocks.

2574,CRM,"Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) shares moved up and down over the past week, as investors continued to blow hot and cold about its prospects. But the Zacks methodology places it at a solid Hold right now, as indicated by the Zacks Rank #3. Buying opportunities in technology instead include Salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report), Upland Software (UPLD  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corp (NVDA  -  Free Report). Or, you can simply take a look at the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.As far as Apple is concerned, here are the top stories that drove the shares-Starts Paying Irish TaxIreland’s Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe has said that Apple has deposited 1.5 billion euros (1.3 billion pounds) into the escrow account named for the purpose in lieu of taxes that both Apple and the Irish government are appealing. In August 2016, the European Commission adjudged that the tax concessions the country granted Apple were illegal and that Apple therefore owed back taxes to the tune of 13 billion euros.Smaller countries usually offer these concessions to attract investment but the EC is of the opinion that the scale of the concessions provided weren’t justified by law and resulted in anticompetitive behavior that adversely impacted other European countries. In October, the EC threatened to take the two to the European Court of Justice for delayed recovery of dues.HomePod Captures 6% Market ShareStrategy Analytics says that HomePod, Apple’s Siri-powered smart speaker, garnered a mere 6% share of the market in the first quarter, trailing Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Alexa-powered Echo, which used its first mover advantage to pick up a 47% share and Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Assistant-powered Google Home, which is rapidly gaining ground with a 27% share.HomePod didn’t launch until February, so it was a partial quarter for the music-focused device. Apple has poached a Google engineer and is doubling down on Siri, which should generate desired results for the company.At the same time, none of these companies sell their smart speakers in China, which is growing rapidly, so domestic players like Xiaomi and Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) are taking share of the global market, leading both Alphabet and Amazon to concede market share.Bernstein on Apple Services BusinessApple’s services business grew 18% in the last-reported quarter, lifting investor sentiments with respect to an otherwise non-exceptional quarter. However, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi feels that the strength in Apple’s Services business, which has a $12 billion annual revenue runrate, was mainly because of a renegotiated contract with Google to keep it as the default search engine. He says that second half growth will decelerate both on account of “tougher comps and as the licensing business laps its contract renegotiation with Google.”“While we still doubt that Services can sustainably grow at 20%+ without new services offerings, we now see Apple as likely to hit its bogey of doubling Services to $49B by the end of FY20,"" he added.Still Fighting Samsung for $1 BillionThe two companies have been sparring over the amount of damages that Samsung needs to pay Apple for the infringement of three patents, including one about rounded corners. The patent office actually creates these problems by granting ridiculous patents (or maybe rounded corners were such a big breakthrough seven years ago that it was impossible for others to think it up on their own, so consumers should pay a premium for the feature).Apple thinks it needs to be paid on the value of the entire phone while Samsung says the damages should be determined on the component value alone. So while Apple wants a billion dollars, Samsung is thinking maybe $28 million. Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2575,CRM,"Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2019 results on May 29. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether or not this customer-relationship management solution provider will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.Notably, Salesforce has delivered positive earnings surprises for eight straight quarters. Over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 6.4%. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 46 cents, reflecting a massive year-over-year increase of 64.3%. Furthermore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal first-quarter earnings has moved up over the past seven days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $2.94 billion indicates around 23.2% growth from the prior-year quarter.Salesforce.com Inc Price and EPS Surprise Salesforce.com Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Salesforce.com Inc QuoteLet’s see what’s driving this overwhelming expectation.Partner Program Adding CustomersStellar growth in Salesforce partner certifications has been fueling the company’s top-line results. Notably, the company’s partner certification has witnessed five-time growth over the past four years and more companies are willing to invest in Salesforce activities. Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report) has emerged as one of the biggest examples for this. Notably, Accenture is currently a global leader in the Salesforce implementation service space, with more than 11,000 skilled consultants.Currently, a number of big organizations, including Dell, IBM, Amazon, and Google, are Salesforce’s partners. Analysts covering the stock anticipate the fiscal first quarter to have witnessed new partner additions, thereby bolstering this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s top-line performance. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Acquisitions Driving RevenuesAcquisitions have always been one of Salesforce’s key growth strategies. Over the last two years, the company has closed as many as 16 acquisitions worth billions of dollars, including its biggest ever buyout — MuleSoft. These acquisitions have strengthened its position in the customer relationship-management solution-providing space. We expect the acquisition synergies to have bolstered Salesforce’s fiscal first-quarter top-line performance.Partnerships Stoking International GrowthSalesforce still generates only about 30% of total revenues from international operations, which is lower than its rivals like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) or Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) composition of around 50%. Nonetheless, the company noted that its partnership agreements with the likes of Amazon and Alphabet for the firms’ cloud services have been helping it expand the company’s international operations.Earlier, the company used to run its software at its own data centers which had been curbing its growth potentials. However, in 2016, the company decided to utilize the geographical reach of other data-center service providers in order to expand its international business.The company’s first partnership in this space was with Amazon Web Services in 2016, followed by the next alliance with Alphabet last November. During fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, the company won several deals due to its international-expansion initiatives. Anticipations of the company winning more such deals will have bolstered its fiscal first-quarter top- and bottom-line results.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2576,CRM,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Intuit (INTU  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 11.3% over the past month. INTU hit a new 52-week high of $196.97 in the previous session. Intuit has gained 24.4% since the start of the year compared to the 5.9% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 14.2% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 22, 2018, Intuit reported EPS of $4.82 versus.the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.67 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.91%.For the current fiscal year, Intuit is expected to post earnings of $5.41 per share on $5.73 billion in revenues. This represents a 22.68% change in EPS on a 10.71% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $6.45 per share on $6.33 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 19.12% and 10.36%, respectively.Valuation MetricsIntuit may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for INTU? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Intuit has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 36.2X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 41.3X versus its peer group's average of 23.7X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.18. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Intuit Inc. Price and Consensus  Intuit Inc. Price and Consensus | Intuit Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Intuit currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Intuit passes the test. Thus, it seems as though INTU shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does Intuit Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Intuit have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also impressive, including Sapiens International Corporation N.V. (SPNS  -  Free Report), Salesforce.com (CRM  -  Free Report), and CACI International (CACI  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 26% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for INTU, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

2577,CRM,"Key foreign bank earnings that are scheduled for release next week are likely to provide a better understanding of the sector’s near-term prospects. The central focus for foreign banks in the short term will be the one-time U.S. tax charges and the way it will affect their full-year profits.Additionally, several major central banks across the globe are looking to normalize their monetary policy. This, in turn, will keep the momentum alive in the foreign banking sector this year after registering a steady recovery in 2017.Further, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) global economic growth is projected to expand by 3.9% in 2018, better than the pace of 3.8% witnessed in 2017. Also, the IMF expects tax cuts in the United States to benefit the global economy in the coming months. This along with a steady growth outlook in 2018 is expected to benefit foreign banks in the long run.In this context, The Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS  -  Free Report) and Bank Of Montreal (BMO  -  Free Report) which are scheduled to report on May 29 and May 30, respectively, assume greater significance. Both foreign banks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major stocks reporting earnings from May 28 to Jun 1 include salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) and HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report).Price PerformanceBank of Nova Scotia has gained 11.4% in the past one year, outperforming the broader industry that has moved up 6.3% over the same period. In comparison, Bank Of Montreal has not only outperformed the broader industry but is also ahead of Bank of Nova Scotia, gaining 17.3% over the same time frame.ValuationCompared with the S&P 500, the industry is clearly undervalued. This implies that the industry has upside potential for the near future. The industry has an average trailing 12-month P/B ratio – which is the best multiple for valuing banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next – of 1.40, which is below the S&P 500’s average of 3.86. Hence, it might be a good idea not to abstain from stocks belonging to this industry.Moreover, coming to the two stocks under consideration, with a P/B ratio of 1.67 in the last one year, Bank of Nova Scotia is clearly underpriced than both the industry and Bank Of Montreal’s P/B ratio 1.68.Dividend YieldBank of Nova Scotia’s dividend yield over the last year is 4.07%, higher than the broader industry’s figure of 2.94%. With a dividend yield of 3.65%, Bank of Montreal shareholders earns a lower dividend yield than Bank of Nova Scotia.Return on Assets (ROA)Return on assets (ROA) is one of the key financial ratios for banks as they rely heavily on their assets to create revenues.

This week, the hosts focuses on gaining limited exposure by buying mega-cap tech stocks that have added AI to their business models.Remember to subscribe and leave a rating on Apple Podcasts if you enjoy the show!There are several noteworthy “pure play” AI stocks, but these high-growth options might also bring significant risk. To avoid this, one who is bullish on AI might focus on existing tech behemoths that are working on artificial intelligence projects—either behind closed doors, or to complement their other businesses.For example, Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) use AI to improve the user experience.Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) have all developed natural language, virtual assistant programs.Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) uses AI to improve search results, and Salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report) uses it to improve customer relations platforms.Some of these projects are consumer facing, while others are R&D projects existing outside of the public view. Either way, these tech behemoths help investors gain some exposure to the budding AI industry.Similarly, AI powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) has added an artificial intelligence focus to its business model, which once focused almost exclusively on the gaming industry.

2582,CRM,"Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) recently completed the buyout of Accompany, an AI-based relationship intelligence platform, for $270 million in cash and “assumed equity awards.”Accompany boasts of robust enterprise AI capabilities that leverage machine learning which automates search, creation and update profiles on corporate executives. The newly acquired company is set to join Collaboration Technology Group (“CTG”) of Cisco.To further strengthen Cisco’s collaboration portfolio, CEO and Founder of Accompany, Amy Chang will lead CTG as a senior vice president. The company is expected to benefit enormously from the commendable AI experience that Chang brings on board.Intensifying Enterprise Collaboration CompetitionPer a Synergy Research Group article, both Cisco and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) are close contenders, with the former taking a marginal lead in the enterprise collaboration market, pertaining to fourth-quarter 2017 revenues data.The research further elaborates into premise and cloud collaboration. In premise division, Cisco has more than 5% point advancement over Microsoft and is greater than 15% ahead of IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) which is third in the pack. Meanwhile, cloud collaboration revenues were greater for Microsoft, roughly ahead of Cisco by 3% and Google (taking the third position) by almost 5%.The latest acquisition will help Cisco to take on Microsoft’s LinkedIn platform, which comprises users mostly seeking jobs or job holders who are required to update their profiles themselves.Notably, Accompany furnishes real-time insights on senior managers and the well-known position holders to empower the user with the required know-how before meeting the executive. Moreover, Accompany keeps a tab “for every single Fortune 500 CEO.”Cisco has already integrated its Cisco Spark with Webex Platform which enhanced Webex Meeting and enabled it to introduce Webex Teams which is capable of locking horns with Microsoft Teams.Per Tractica report, enterprise AI applications revenues are projected to grow at a CAGR of 64.3% from $358 million (in 2016) to a whopping $31.2 billion by 2025.With Webex Meetings, Webex Devices and Webex Teams yielding results, we believe Cisco is well poised to capitalize on the emerging AI based enterprise applications.

2584,CRM,"Shares of Twilio Inc. (TWLO  -  Free Report) jumped more than 4% during yesterday’s after-hours trade after the company reported splendid first-quarter 2018 results, wherein its revenues topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as management’s guided range. Also, the top line marked solid year-over-year growth.Talking about the company’s bottom-line results, though it posted a loss per share on non-GAAP basis, the figure came in much lower than the  Consensus mark and management’s guided range as well. Moreover, quarterly loss was in line with the year-ago quarter’s loss.Let’s discuss the first-quarter results in detail.RevenuesThe company’s first-quarter revenues surged 47.8% year over year to $129.1 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $116 million. Also, it came ahead of management’s previously-guided range of $115-$117 million. Furthermore, the company’s base revenues jumped 46% year over year to $117.5 million, also higher than management’s earlier guided range of $108–$109 million.The robust top-line performance was mainly driven by remarkable year-over-year growth in active customer account which resulted from the company’s continued focus on introducing products as well as its go-to-market sales strategy.The company registered a 32.7% surge in active customer accounts, adding more than 13,289 accounts over the last 12 months, bringing the total count to 53,985 as of Mar 31, 2018. During the first quarter alone, Twilio added more than 5,006 active customer accounts.Operating ResultsNon-GAAP gross profit climbed approximately 38.5% year over year to $71 million. However, gross margin contracted 360 basis points (bps) to 55%, as elevated cost of goods sold more than offset the benefit of higher revenues.Non-GAAP operating expenses flared up 37.6% year over year to $75.6 million. The year-over-year surge was mainly due to increased investment in research and development, and sales to capitalize on the market opportunity. However, as a percentage of revenues, the figure decreased to 58.6% from 62.9% in the year-ago quarter.Furthermore, the company reported non-GAAP operating loss of $4.7 million, wider than the year-ago figure of $3.7 million. Non-GAAP net loss came in at $4.2 million or 4 cents per share. In the year-earlier quarter, the company had reported net loss of $3.2 million or 4 cents per share. Benefits from higher revenues and efficient cost management were offset by elevated cost of goods sold.Nevertheless, the non-GAAP loss per share came way below management’s guided range of a loss of 6-7 cents. Also, the quarterly loss came in narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 7.Twilio Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Twilio Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Twilio Inc. Quote Balance SheetThe company exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities of $308 million, up from $290.9 million reported at the end of the previous quarter. In addition to this, during the quarter, the company generated cash flow of $16.9 million from operational activities.OutlookBuoyed by a stellar quarterly performance, Twilio provided encouraging outlook for the second quarter and raised its full-year revenue guidance.For the full year, Twilio now expects revenues between $538 million and $544 million (mid-point $541 million), up from the previous range of $506-$514 million (mid-point $510 million). This is significantly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $509.8 million.Similarly, base revenues are now estimated in the range of $507–$510 million, higher than the previous forecast of $483-$487 million. Projection for the non-GAAP net loss per share range has been lowered to 7-10 cents from the previous forecast of 10-14 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 12 cents.For the second quarter, Twilio estimates revenues to be between $129 million and $131 million (mid-point $130 million). This is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $122.6 million. Base revenues are anticipated in the range of $122-$123 million. Non-GAAP net loss is projected at 5-6 cents per share. The consensus estimate is currently pegged at a loss of 6 cents.Recovers From Uber HangoverThe recently-reported strong quarterly results indicate that the company has been able to mitigate the loss of revenues from Uber.It should be noted that Uber uses Twilio services for a variety of used cases such as driver and rider communication, driver marketing and several others. Till 2016, Uber used Twilio’s platforms in most of its geographical operations. However, since first-quarter 2017, Uber is “optimizing by used case and by geography” and is planning to ""move communications for some use cases in-app."" This means that Uber is now trying to operate its messaging services internally.Uber’s contribution to Twilio’s revenues declined to approximately 4% in the first quarter from roughly 12% in the year-ago quarter.Despite this, the company managed to report robust revenue growth in four back-to-back quarters, returning on growth trajectory, mainly due to its continued focus on rolling out products, global expansion, go-to-market sales and acquisition strategies.Our TakeWe believe the back-to-back impressive quarterly results and optimistic guidance will give a fresh boost to the company’s share price.Notably, Twilio’s shares have outperformed the industry to which it belongs to, in the year-to-date period. The stock has appreciated 88% during the said period, while the industry recorded growth of 6.4%.  The company’s key initiatives, including product innovation, global expansion and acquisitions, are helping it gain customers, which bode well for long-term growth. We believe proliferation in cloud and mobile penetration across the globe will continue to fuel Twilio’s customer growth over the long run.Twilio boasts a strong clientele that includes the likes of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), salesforce.com (CRM  -  Free Report) and Twitter among others. Furthermore, the long-standing relationship with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) is particularly noticeable. Twilio uses Amazon Web Service (AWS) to host its platform.Nevertheless, intensifying competition in the communications market and growing prevalence of in-app push notifications are major concerns. Moreover, customer concentration is a headwind.Currently, Twilio carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2585,CRM,"Five9, Inc. (FIVN  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results tomorrow. The company has a remarkable streak of beating earnings estimates. In fact, in each of the trailing four quarters, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, coming up with an impressive average positive earnings surprise of 193.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Five9 is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Five9 carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of -26.3%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. Furthermore, we note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the past 30 days.However, the company is likely to continue reporting top and bottom-line growth on a year-over-year basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter earnings is pegged at 3 cents, which indicates a massive improvement from the year-ago quarter’s breakeven earnings. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $55.1 million, up 17.2% from the year-ago quarter.Five9, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Five9, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Five9, Inc. Quote Factors to ConsiderFive9 offers a virtual contact-center cloud platform that acts as a hub for interaction between clients and customers. The company has strong partnerships with industry leaders such as Salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), Zendesk, and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report). These partnerships have enabled it to offer greater flexibility, enhanced experience and cloud-based solutions to consumers. This is likely to have generated incremental revenues through higher customer reach.It should be noted that the cloud-based contact-center solution industry has been witnessing growth for the past several quarters, as organizations are looking for ways to minimize costs and improve customer support. We believe Five9’s cloud contact-center software, along with the ongoing execution, places the company in a great position to capitalize on this opportunity. Consequently, this is anticipated to reflect in the to-be-reported quarterly results.Moreover, the company’s continued focus on expanding its product portfolio is anticipated to have bolstered the top-line performance.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2586,CRM,"The enterprise technology industry has been a hot stock option for years, and most investors interested in this space have heard of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report) and Salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report). With both companies presenting positive yet distinct stock signals, which should investors hop on now? Let’s dive right into the question.HPE is an integrated systems company focused on enterprise offerings like IT solutions, servers, and cloud-based products. The stock currently sports a “B” grade for Value and an “F” grade for Growth in our Style Scores System.Meanwhile, Salesforce is a cloud-based software company engaged in the customer relations management business. CRM is currently holding an “A” grade for Growth and an “F” grade for Value in our Style Scores System.HPE and Salesforce are both Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) options, so whichever direction an investor decides to move in, they can feel secure knowing that both stocks have an improving earnings outlook. Let’s break down why each stock has received their respective Style Scores to help better choose an investment strategy.Two Different StoriesA typical value investor will most likely invest in HPE, especially when compared to Salesforce. HPE currently has a P/E ratio of 12.5, while Salesforce has a PE ratio of 59.3. This is the most popular metric used to determine value and is a measure of price divided by earnings. Here we see HP clearly trades at a discount to CRM based on this metric.In regards to valuations, the P/B ratio is also useful and helps compare a stock’s market value with its book value. HP has a P/B ratio of 1.1, which is a strong discount to Salesforce and its P/B ratio of 9.4. These metrics highlight the huge discrepancies between HPE’s “B” grade in Value and Salesforce’s “F” in our Style Scores System.Although these stocks may seem lopsided in these regards, Salesforce’s strength and HPE’s weakness lie in growth. Salesforce’s arguably insane PE ratio is indicative of  fast growth to come in the near future to level out the price, while HPE’s P/E ratio is indicative of steady growth, but at a much slower rate.In addition, Salesforce is expected to witness EPS growth of 24.2% on an annualized basis over the next three to five years, almost triple that of HPE’s 8.5%. This further supports the earlier notion that Salesforce stock is overvalued because of anticipation for massive growth.Bottom LineBoth HPE and Salesforce are Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks, with overall positive earnings revisions. Although this is the case, they have very distinct and polar strengths and weaknesses.

2587,CRM,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we discuss about Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report), a stock with an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 10% and a Growth Score of B.Last year, the company has outperformed the industry it belongs to. While the stock has rallied 29.7%, the industry gained 17.5%.In fact, we believe Accenture has the potential to exceed expectations moving ahead. This optimism surrounding the stock is backed by the company’s strong cloud and digital marketing capacities owing to acquisitions and partnerships.Let’s delve deep to unearth the reasons behind the company’s impressive price performance.Acquisition: A Key Growth StrategyIn fiscal 2017, Accenture closed 37 acquisition deals worth $1.7 billion. So far this year, the company has either closed or is in the process of acquiring five businesses. Additionally, Accenture has invested approximately $3.4 billion in acquiring nearly 70 companies or start-ups over the last three fiscals. The company also intends to invest close to $1 billion on acquiring assets in fiscal 2018.In fact, we believe Accenture’s strategy of enhancing its cloud capabilities through acquisitions is a step in the right direction. This is evident from the recent forecast by several independent research firms. According to a research firm, Gartner, the public cloud services market is likely to witness a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.3% during the 2016-2019 period, reaching $383.4 billion by 2020-end. Moreover, Accenture has strengthened its digital marketing capabilities through some significant acquisitions, including Reactive Media, Acquity Group Ltd., dgroup and OCTO Technology. Again, the company inked a deal to acquire New York-based digital agency, Meredith Xcelerated Marketing, last month.Accenture Interactive is a well-integrated platform, enabling CMOs to devise marketing strategies and derive higher ROI (return on investment) from it. Considering the growing need for digital marketing, we expect Accenture’s investment in digital and marketing capabilities to boost its long-term growth.Further, Accenture has been aggressively trying to strengthen its position as a leading provider of Salesforce capabilities. To this end, the company has made several acquisitions, including the likes Cloud Sherpas, CRMWaypoint and Tquila UK. In fact, it is already a global leader in the Salesforce implementation service space, with currently over 3,700 skilled consultants.Accenture PLC Revenue (TTM) Accenture PLC Revenue (TTM) | Accenture PLC QuotePartnership Strategies Enabling Entry to New MarketsWe believe that Accenture’s regular partnerships with the likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) Web Services, Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report) and SAP are helping the company to enter new markets.In August 2017, Apple and Accenture joined hands to create a mixed team of designers, programmers and other Apple experts, within Accenture Digital Studios units in select locations across the globe. The team focuses on developing tools and services for building iOS apps in accordance to the requirements of Accenture’s clients across different industries.We opine that, the partnership should help Accenture in enhancing its digital transformation capabilities and bring in additional revenues. Apart from this, the agreement is expected to facilitate the company in effectively competing with other consulting companies such as IBM, Dell and Deloitte.Regular Quarterly Dividend Payment & Share RepurchasesAccenture’s strong operating cash flow has helped it to return cash through regular quarterly dividend payment and share repurchases. In fiscal 2017, the company paid a total dividend of $1.57 billion and repurchased $2.65 billion worth of its common stock.In first two quarters of fiscal 2018, the company repurchased share worth $1.37 billion and paid dividend of $854 million. Share repurchases and dividend payments are a good way of returning cash to investors while boosting the company’s earnings.Bottom LineRobust growth strategies in the forms of acquisitions and partnerships, strong prospects in cloud computing and digital marketing arenas along with a healthy track record of returning cash to shareholders lead us to have a positive outlook on the stock.Accenture has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2588,CRM,"There are many ‘calendar trends’ in the financial markets which indicate its outperformance or underperformance in a given time frame. The common axioms are“Sell in May and go away”, the “January Effect” and the “January Barometer”, to name a few.These calendar trends do have a logical basis in contrast to some random time frame showing gains and losses. For instance, markets typically scale north in two weeks after the Tax Day, which is on Apr 17 this year. This is because money flows into the market as a significant number of people start funding their Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA) in order to receive tax deduction.Tax Day, thus, brings a seasonal trend where you can make some gains, with a few sectors traditionally showing an improvement. Apr 17 is Tax Day This Year: Here’s WhySince 1955, Tax Day has been observed on Apr 15. But, if the date falls on a Saturday or Sunday, the filing of federal income tax returns is pushed to the next business day. This means that tax day should have been on Monday, Apr 16 this year.However, the Emancipation day holiday unique to Washington D.C. fell on Apr 16, postponing the tax filing deadline this year. District of Columbia observes Emancipation day, which marks the freeing of slaves in Washington in 1892. This makes Apr 17 the closing date for filing taxes in the United States.Tax Day TradeTax Day is always special for the stock market. Estimates are that 15% to 33% of all tax filers wait for this day to fund their IRAs. After all, IRAs are a basket of various asset classes, including stocks in which individuals invest money to prepare for retirement.The average daily gain, by the way, for the S&P 500 on the Tax Day has been around 0.3% over the past 10 years. But, don’t dismiss 0.3% as meager because it is nearly 7 points on the S&P that equates to an annualized gain of around 75% over the average 252 trading days in a year.In fact, April has always been one of the best months for the S&P. The broader index in the past 10 and five years has climbed about 90% and 80% of times this month, respectively.The benchmark index, however, this time around is down so far in the month. So, this indicates that some sort of a bounce back may take place during the remaining of the month that will push the index back into positive territory.End of Tax Season Throws Open Buying ProspectsThe stock market, historically, tends to gain momentum in the two weeks following the Tax Day. Conversely, stocks tend to remain flat or somewhat down in the first two weeks of April.The S&P has been nearly down on an average 0.2% in the first two weeks of the month, while it was up around 1.7% on an average during the weeks following the day, per data analytics firm Kensho. That’s a positive swing of about 2% on average for the S&P 500. Similarly, certain sectors like technology, financials and industrials have notched average gains of around 3%, 1.7% and 2.2%, respectively.Profit From Tax Season With These 5 StocksGiven that the aforesaid sectors are poised to make the most of the upcoming bullishness, investing in stocks from the same will be judicious. And why not? The Trump administration’s initiative to cut tax rates has provided the much-needed windfall to tech companies, while a recent move by the Fed to raise rates bodes well for financials. Firm business investment, in the meantime, helped factories expand at a record pace. Manufacturers are also on a hiring spree and are paying more than other jobs, reflecting sustained strength in the sector.We have, thus, selected five such stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Growth Style Score of A or B.

Notably, last month, the companies entered into a cash-stock acquisition deal, wherein Salesforce is set to buy MuleSoft for an enterprise value of $6.5 billion.Earlier, Salesforce had expected to fund the cash portion of the deal with its available cash in hand, and a $3-billion borrowing through term loans or issuance of debt securities. The lower amount of senior notes offering depicts the company’s sound financial position.Notably, as of Jan 31, 2018, Salesforce had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $4.52 billion, and during the last fiscal it generated operating cash flow of $2.74 billion and free cash flow of $2.2 billion.Salesforce.com Inc Free Cash Flow (TTM) Salesforce.com Inc Free Cash Flow (TTM) | Salesforce.com Inc QuoteThe huge available cash balances, along with strong cash flow generating capability, have supported the company’s acquisition strategy. It should be noted that acquisitions have always been one of Salesforce’s key growth strategies. Although the company remained almost silent throughout 2017 on the acquisition front (just one — Sequence), this year it might repeat the likes of 2016, when Salesforce bought 12 companies, to boost its capabilities, and grab newer and larger markets. In this year, so far, the company has either bought or is in the midst of three acquisitions.The MuleSoft buyout deal highlights Salesforce’s aggressive approach to attain the company’s target of reaching $20 billion in revenues by 2022.

Also, this will enable the marketers to help their clients enhance user engagement and sales conversion.The other important part of the deal is pairing up of Salesforce’s CRM platform with Google’s G Suite. G Suite is an office software platform similar to Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Office 365. Per the agreement, Salesforce clients who don’t use G Suite currently will get this offering free for a year.Additionally, Salesforce has announced Google Cloud as its preferred cloud partner. This implies it can use Google’s global data centers for overseas expansion just like it uses Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Amazon Web Services (AWS).What this Alliance Brings in for Salesforce?The collaboration will provide Salesforce another platform apart from Amazon’s AWS to sell its products. The worldwide presence of Google’s data centers will enable the company to expand its footprint in overseas markets.In addition to this, the enhanced offerings, including Google Analytics and G Suite, will lure enterprises to opt for Salesforce services, in turn bringing in additional revenues.Notably, Salesforce stock has gained 49.6% year to date, substantially outperforming the 26.8% rally of the industry it belongs to.Alphabet to Gain the MostThough the collaboration is beneficial for both companies, we believe Alphabet will gain the most. We see the move as Alphabet’s latest gambit to boost its market share in the lucrative cloud computing business.The alliance has brought in a new big channel partner for Google Cloud at a time when Alphabet is striving to compete with arch rivals — AWS and Microsoft — in this space. Notably, this is the second big partnership for Google Cloud in the past one month. Last month, it entered into a cloud computing alliance with Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report).Furthermore, the integration of G Suite with Salesforce’s customer relationship services will help Alphabet accelerate the adoption of its office software platform. This will also help it compete against Microsoft Office 365 which is currently the largest office software-platform provider globally.Also, it is most likely that Salesforce’s customers who will use G Suite free for a year will buy it in the next year as well. This, again, is encouraging since this will bolster the company’s revenue base.Shares of Alphabet have gained 31.6% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 24.4% rally.Zacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

2597,CRM,"Model N Inc. (MODN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings on Nov 7. We expect intense competition in the revenue management software market to mar results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Notably, the stock beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 14.19%. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 22.22%.Moreover, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in two of the trailing four quarters.Model N expects fourth-quarter GAAP revenues in the range of $34.6-$35.1 million. Non-GAAP operating loss is projected between $0.5 million and $1 million. Moreover, non-GAAP net loss is expected in the range of 8-9 cents per share.Model N’s shares have returned 61.6% year to date, substantially outperforming the 29.6% rally of the industry.  Key FactorsModel N is benefiting from a growing customer base, transition to cloud-based applications and synergies from the Revitas acquisition. Model N, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Model N, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Model N, Inc. Quote The Revitas acquisition has expanded Model N’s product suite and customer base. Moreover, elimination of duplicated general & administrative and sales & marketing costs as well as redundant products outside the life sciences vertical is expected to lower spending.However, we note that the company is yet to report profit. Further, the top-line growth has been unimpressive in the last two quarters, primarily due to increasing competition from well-established players like salesforce.com (CRM  -  Free Report) and Workday (WDAY  -  Free Report).Unfavorable CombinationWe believe that Model N is unlikely to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the fourth quarter due to an unfavorable combination of Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Stocks to ConsiderHere is a stock you may consider as our proven model shows it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.71% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

2599,CRM,"Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report) has opted for an inorganic path for enhancing its digital marketing capabilities. Over the last five years, Accenture has acquired 17 businesses and integrated into this segment.Moreover, the company recently entered into a negotiation to acquire Altima — a France-based digital commerce agency — which is specialized in customer experience design. If the deal materializes, Altima will mark its 18th buyout. Other recent notable acquisitions in the space are Karmarama and SinnerSchrader AG.In our opinion, these acquisitions have helped Accenture in providing end-to-end digital marketing services, bringing in a deeper and broader set of digital solutions to its clients. Also, the strategy has helped it diversify its offerings and expand its foothold in new markets.Industry Forecasts Support its StrategyThe increased penetration of Internet, PCs and smartphones has enhanced the scope of digital marketing. It should be noted that competent marketing is the key to success for every organization.According to the U.S. IT research firm — Gartner Inc. (IT  -  Free Report) — companies spent nearly 12% of revenues for marketing in 2016, of which spending on web, digital commerce and digital advertising were the top three categories of marketing. The report also suggests that 65% of the companies are planning to increase their 2017 digital marketing spending.Our TakeConsidering the growing need for digital marketing, we anticipate Accenture’s investment in digital marketing capabilities to be conducive to long-term growth. The company, in 2009, formed Accenture Interactive to tap the growing prospects in digital marketing space. Its Interactive platform is specialized in providing consulting, technology and analytics services to chief marketing officers (CMOs).The frequent acquisitions help the company in effectively competing with other digital marketing service providers, such as International Business Machines Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report), Dell and Deloitte.Going ahead, the company has applied similar approach for enhancing its capabilities in implementing Salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report)-based software solutions. Accenture has acquired seven businesses in this space.We believe the strategy will significantly contribute to the company's revenue stream over the long-run.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2600,CRM,"CRM platform provider salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) reinforced their strategic alliance through a new venture. Per the deal, Salesforce is now live on Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is likely to expand its customer base in Australia.Salesforce will now use AWS across all of its core products which include Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Analytics Cloud, Community Cloud and more, for customers in that region. The move appears to be a part of Salesforce's broader infrastructure expansion plan that offers customers better ways of managing their data. The AWS Sydney Region will help Salesforce to successfully expand international infrastructure.Salesforce Continues to ExpandGiven the rise in the uptake of its products and favorable performance, market research firm Gartner has acknowledged Salesforce as the world’s #1 CRM company based on total software revenues recorded in 2016.This is a big win for Salesforce, as it will join a list of AWS users that boasts of names like Netflix, Expedia and Adobe Systems. It must be noted that Salesforce’s flagship CRM offering competes with Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Dynamics CRM. Microsoft ranks second in the IaaS segment. This makes Amazon, which is currently the market leader, the best company Salesforce could have opted for.Notably, this is not the first time that Salesforce has inked a deal with Amazon. The strategic partnership between the two companies was first disclosed in mid-2016. Salesforce selected Amazon’s AWS as its public cloud infrastructure provider. It also agreed to invest $400 million on AWS services over the next four years.Cloud & CRM ProspectsAccording to IDC estimates, public IT cloud services spending will increase at a four-year compound annual growth rate of 23.5% in 2013-2017.Naturally, the overall growth expectation of the public cloud computing services market is quite bullish. According to Gartner, the worldwide public cloud services market is expected to expand 18% year over year to $246.8 billion in 2017. Further, the figure will increase to $383.3 billion by 2020.Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) is being projected as the highest growth service, driven by improvement in PaaS and massive adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), analytics and the Internet of Things (IoT). IaaS is projected to grow from $25.29 billion in 2016 to $71.55 billion in 2020.Moreover, per Gartner, the CRM market is anticipated to grow from $26.3 billion in 2015 to $36 billion in 2017. We believe that Salesforce is well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunity.Salesforce, with its solid portfolio and growing partnerships, is well poised to lead the market.Price MovementNotably, shares of Salesforce have returned 41.9% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the industry’s gain of just 28.7%.Bottom LineWe believe that the partnership will be mutually beneficial for the companies, going forward. It will ensure tighter integration between Amazon and Salesforce clouds, which will help customers to leverage the security and reliability of the AWS Cloud.Overall, the company’s diverse cloud offerings and considerable spending on digital marketing remain catalysts. Moreover, strategic acquisitions and the resultant synergies are expected to be beneficial over the long run.However, intensifying competition from International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report), Oracle Corp. and SAP SE remains an overhang.Salesforce currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?

2601,CRM,"Just within a month of announcing a $50-million artificial intelligence (AI) start-up fund, Salesforce.com Inc.’s (CRM  -  Free Report) investment arm venture — Salesforce Ventures — rolled out another $50-million fund which has been named Impact Investment Fund.Under the recently announced facility, Salesforce intends to invest in companies which are using its cloud platform to develop innovative solutions “to address challenges across workforce development, equality, sustainability and the social sector.”The company further noted that the fund “builds on previous investments in companies driving positive social change and aligns with Salesforce Ventures' charter to strategically invest in companies built on the Salesforce Platform, delivering unique capabilities to Salesforce customers.” Per the company, Angaza, Ellevest, Hustle and ViridisLearning are the first recipients of this funding.Salesforce stock has gained 40.7% year to date, substantially outperforming the 26.8% rally of the industry it belongs to.Investments in start-ups have always been one of Salesforce’s key growth strategies. Over the past several years, the company either acquired or partnered with many such companies. Citing John Somorjai, executive vice president of Salesforce Ventures, Reuters noted that Salesforce Ventures has invested over $700 million in more than 250 enterprise start-ups since 2009.We believe Salesforce’s consistent focus on expanding its business through strategic acquisitions and investments in start-ups will drive growth over the long run.However, stiff competition, currency fluctuations and stepped-up investments in international expansions and data centers are expected to thwart its near-term profitability.Currently, Salesforce carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), Micron Technology, Inc.

2602,CRM,"Shares of ServiceNow Inc. (NOW  -  Free Report) rallied to a new 52-week high of $119.47, eventually closing a tad lower at $119.38 on Oct 5.The share price momentum can primarily be attributed to the growing adoption of the company’s platform and tools by 2000 (G2K) companies, as defined by Forbes. The company is also gaining from its rapid penetration into the non-ITSM markets such as customer service, human resource and security.The company also posted impressive financials for the second-quarter 2017 where revenues of almost $478.5 million surged 40.2% year over year. The top-line figure also surpassed the guided range of $469–$474 million.ServiceNow stock has gained 60.6% year to date, substantially outperforming the 28.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.Key Drivers and CompetitionServiceNow has been a dominant name in the IT service market (ITSM). The company is steadily winning market share amid the ongoing trend of replacing legacy on-premise systems with cloud-based processes, especially among G2K companies. The growing penetration at G2K customer base has been driving ServiceNow’s top line, which has been exemplary, increasing at a CAGR of more than 70% over 2009–2016 time frame.Notably, with none of the customers exceeding 10% of revenues in the last couple of years, the customer base remains unaffected by the problem of customer concentration. Diversified clientele is another positive for the company.ServiceNow, Inc. Revenue (TTM) ServiceNow, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | ServiceNow, Inc. QuoteMoreover, the company’s expanding product portfolio (including emerging products) and strong renewal rate (almost 98%), are the other key growth drivers. Additionally, the popularity of its Customer Service Management product, launch of a new HR product and the availability of the Jakarta platform to all is anticipated to boost the company's performance further.Notably, in August 2017, ServiceNow was declared a Leader in the 2017 Magic Quadrant for IT Service Support Management Tools by Gartner for the fourth consecutive year. However, in spite of an improving top line, mounting losses and stiff competition in the non-ITSM markets from established players like Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and salesforce.com (CRM  -  Free Report) remain concerns for the company.Zacks Rank & Key Pick Service Now currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Micron Technology, Inc.

2603,CRM,"For many Americans, the tech world starts and ends in Silicon Valley. Yet in reality, many technology firms operate outside of the San Francisco Bay Area. This group of tech companies thriving away from the bubble of the Valley includes some of the most prominent and well-known startups and publicly traded firms.Silicon Valley has been synonymous with technology companies for decades, and the southern portion of the San Francisco Bay region is home to some of the biggest companies in the world, including Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Intel INTC, Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), and many more.But the area, which owes its name to the large number of silicon chip manufacturers that call it home, is certainly not the only place that has proved to provide fertile soil for some of the biggest tech companies in North America.Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), and several other multibillion-dollar tech giants call the state of Washington home, while new firms in Austin, Texas and Denver, Colorado pop-up seemingly every day (also read: 5 American Tech Companies Thriving Outside of Silicon Valley).At a time when so-called “unicorn” tech startups are all the rage, we are going to look at some of the most valuable and coolest startups in the wide-ranging tech space that are poised to succeed far away from Silicon Valley.SpaceX One of Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) CEO Elon Musk’s other companies, SpaceX, is a rocket and space exploration firm founded in 2002 that is currently valued at $21.2 billion. SpaceX has contracts with NASA, is the only private company to return a spacecraft from low-Earth orbit, and recently completed the first-ever “reflight” of an orbital class rocket—which could help create massive cost savings as private space exploration expands.Musk’s firm employs over 5,000 people spread out between its Hawthorne, California headquarters outside of Los Angeles and its launch facilities at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Vandenberg Air Force Base, as well as its rocket-development space in McGregor, Texas.WeWorkWeWork is tech startup founded in 2010 in New York City that helps provide private and shared workspaces and services for entrepreneurs, startups, small businesses. The firm currently boasts enterprise clients such as SalesForce (CRM  -  Free Report) and Sprint (S  -  Free Report).The “Airbnb of office space” is reportedly worth $20 billion and has effectively fused the real estate, hospitality, and technology businesses into one massively successful startup, which has flourished on the East Coast. The NYC-based company also has offices throughout the world.InforInfor, which builds cloud-based business software and platforms for firms of all shapes and sizes, also calls New York City home. Infor has 16,000 employees and boasts over 90,000 customers, which includes Kellogg’s, Nissan, Ricoh, and other big-name firms.The company has offices around the globe and is currently valued at $10 billion. But this NYC-headquartered company has true New York roots, and its logo will appear on the front of the Brooklyn Nets’ jerseys during the upcoming NBA season.Outcome HealthTwo Northwestern University students founded Chicago-based Outcome Health in 2006. Today, Outcome Health helps both patients and doctors by providing touch screen monitors to hospitals and healthcare offices around the country. The firm is one of the newer unicorn companies, having earned the honor in late May, and its $5 billion valuation already places it within the top 30 on the list of roughly 200 non-public companies valued at $1 billion or more.The healthcare technology company has received funding from Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report), Pritzker Group Venture Capital, and Alphabet’s equity investment fund CapitalG.Fanatics Founded in Jacksonville, Florida, this sports-based commerce giant is now valued at $4.5 billion. Fanatics helps power fans’ gear and memorabilia buying experience on digital platforms with online and mobile sites, as well as in-store and in-stadium purchases.The company operates more than 300 online and offline partner stores, which include the e-commerce platforms for the NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, NASCAR, MLS, PGA, 200 collegiate teams, as well as global soccer powerhouses Manchester United (MANU  -  Free Report), Real Madrid, and Manchester City.SoftBank  and Andreessen Horowitz are both investors, and the company currently has three different headquarters: Jacksonville, Manchester, England, and the San Francisco Bay Area.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2604,CRM,"About a month has gone by since the last earnings report for Salesforce.com Inc (CRM  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 2% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Salesforce 2Q18 ResultsContinuing its earnings streak for the sixth quarter in a row, Salesforce posted splendid second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein the top and bottom lines not only fared better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but also came ahead of management’s guided ranges. Quarterly revenues and earnings also marked year-over-year improvement.The world’s leading CRM platform provider reported non-GAAP earnings of 33 cents per share, which came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents, as well as the company’s guidance range of 31-32 cents. Moreover, the figure compared favorably with the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 24 cents, mainly driven by strong top-line growth and efficient cost management, partially offset by increased number of outstanding shares.Before discussing the fiscal second-quarter results in detail, here are some important business highlights of the quarter.Q2 Business HighlightsTremendous increase in Salesforce partner certifications has been fueling the company’s top-line results. During its fiscal second-quarter conference call, Salesforce announced that its partner certification witnessed growth of five times over the last four years, and more companies are willing to invest in Salesforce activities. Accenture has emerged as one of the biggest examples for this. Notably, Accenture is currently a global leader in the Salesforce implementation service space, with over 11,000 skilled consultants.A number of big organizations, including Amazon, 21st Century Fox, Jefferies Investment Bank and Samsung, picked Salesforce solutions during the quarter to drive their digital transformation.Furthermore, during the fiscal second quarter, Salesforce broke through the $10-billion run rate and named itself the first company in the history of enterprise cloud software industry to have achieved this milestone so fast, including its closest rivals like Microsoft, Oracle and SAP SE.Amazon Partnership Stoking International GrowthThe company still generates only about 30% of total revenues from international operations, which is much lower than its rivals like Microsoft or Oracle composition of around 50%. Nonetheless, Salesforce noted that its partnership agreements with Amazon’s Amazon Web Services (AWS), entered over the past year, have been helping it expand its international operations.Earlier, the company used to run its software at its own data centers which was curbing its growth potentials. However, last year the company decided to utilize the AWS data center’s geographical reach to expand its international business. In addition, Salesforce has planned to invest about $400 million on AWS’ cloud platform, over the next four years.Most recently, Salesforce entered into an agreement with AWS to run its software in the latter’s Canadian data center. This has opened up  fresh prospects in the Canadian market. Similarly, Salesforce is planning to do similar thing in Australia, in order to tap the growing opportunity in the Asia-Pacific region.During the fiscal second quarter, the company won several deals due to its international expansion initiatives. Companies like Toshiba, Nomura, Queensland Urban Utilities and Australia Post picked Salesforce’s solutions to fuel digital transformation.Having discussed the fiscal second-quarter business highlights, let’s now turn to the financial results.RevenuesSalesforce continued to witness solid growth in revenues. The company’s revenues of $2.562 billion not only jumped 25.8% year over year, but also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.514 billion. Furthermore, reported revenues came above the guided range of $2.51-$2.52 billion (mid-point: $2.515 billion).The improvement is primarily attributable to rapid adoption of the company’s cloud-based solutions. Also, higher demand for the Salesforce ExactTarget Marketing Cloud platform, part of the Salesforce1 Customer Platform, drove the year-over-year upside in revenues.Now, coming to its business segments, revenues at Subscription and Support climbed about 25.6% from the year-ago quarter to $2.369 billion. Professional Services and Other revenues surged almost 28.3% to $193.1 million.Geographically, the company witnessed constant currency revenue growth of 24%, 31% and 27% in the Americas, EMEA and APAC, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.MarginsSalesforce’s non-GAAP gross profit came in at $1.967 billion, up 26.1%. Additionally, gross margin expanded 20 basis points (bps) to 76.8%, primarily due to solid revenue growth, which was partially offset by increased investment in infrastructure development, including the expansion of the international data centers.Non-GAAP operating expenses flared up 22.3% from the prior-year quarter to $1.585 billion. However, as a percentage of revenues, operating expenses decreased to 61.9% from 63.7% in the year-ago quarter. This was primarily because of efficient cost management.Salesforce posted non-GAAP operating income of $381.3 million compared with the year-ago figure of $263.6 million, while operating margin advanced 200 bps to 14.9%. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP operating margin was mainly driven by improved gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.Non-GAAP net income grew 41.4% year over year to $240.9 million, while net income margin expanded 100 bps to 9.4%. The benefit from improved gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues on net income margin was partially offset by elevated interest and other expenses.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowSalesforce exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $3.50 billion compared with $3.22 billion in the previous quarter. Accounts receivable were $1.569 billion compared with $1.439 million at the end of the fiscal first quarter. Total deferred revenue, as of Jul 31, 2017, was $4.82 billion, up 26% on a year-over-year basis.During the first half of fiscal 2018, the company generated operating cash flow of $1.561 billion. Moreover, Salesforce generated free cash flow of $1.276 billion in the first half.GuidanceBuoyed by better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results, the company provided an encouraging guidance for the fiscal third quarter and raised its outlook for the full fiscal as well. For the fiscal third quarter, the company anticipates revenues in the range of $2.64-$2.65 billion (mid-point: $2.645 billion), representing a year-over-year increase of 23-24%.Further, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the band of 36-37 cents. On a GAAP basis, the same is anticipated to come between 4 cents and 5 cents.Furthermore, the company raised its revenues and earnings outlook for fiscal 2018. Revenues are now anticipated to come in the range of $10.35-$10.40 billion (mid-point $10.375 billion), up from the previous projection of $10.25-$10.35 billion (mid-point $10.3 billion), representing 23-24% year-over-year increase.By completing this target, the company will achieve the $10-billion mark in revenues faster than any other enterprise software company.Similarly, Salesforce now projects non-GAAP earnings to lie between $1.29 and $1.31, while GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of 7-9 cents.

2605,CRM,"Making the very first anniversary of Salesforce Einstein special,Salesforce.com Inc.’s (CRM  -  Free Report) investment arm venture — Salesforce Ventures — announced a $50-million fund to invest in start-ups focused on artificial intelligence (AI). Per the company, Highspot, Squirro and TalkIQ are the first recipients of this funding.AI: A Hot Trend in Tech SpaceAI has become a global rage these days. One huge advantage of AI is its potential to complete dull and mundane tasks through automation that will enhance efficiency and output. Broadly speaking, AI techniques can eliminate boring tasks of humans, and free them up for more innovative and nuanced creations.Revenue projections from AI are bullish. One estimate from research company Tractica puts revenues from AI at $59.8 billion by 2025. If such an optimistic forecast does come true, it would be a quantum leap over 2016’s level of a mere $1.4 billion.Therefore, several big technology companies like Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Alphabet aka Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report) are investing in this technology, either through in-house research or start-ups to stay ahead in grabbing this opportunity.According to the latest data from IDC, worldwide spending on AI systems will touch $12.5 billion in 2017, marking year-over-year surge of nearly 60%. The IDC is also calling for this global spending to achieve a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 54.4% through 2020, when total revenues will touch $46 billion.Citing CB Insights’ report, Reuters reported that, “Venture capital investment in AI start-ups is rising quickly. For 2017, global financing for AI start-ups is projected to surpass $10.8 billion - nearly double the $5.6 billion spent in 2016.”Salesforce in No Mood to Stay BehindThe leading CRM platform provider is in no mood to stay behind and therefore, has been investing heavily to enhance its AI capabilities for the last three years. The company took a major step in 2014 when it acquired RelateIQ, which specialized in making predictive tools.Since then, it has made several small start-up acquisitions on this front, with the likes of Tempo, MinHash and PredictionIO. The recent move of Salesforce Venture will help the company expand its use of AI technology.Furthermore, the company rolled out the Einstein toolkit last year which provides tools to build AI-fueled apps on Salesforce. Einstein is designed to analyze and understand information and data collected from the company’s customers.Einstein has contributed significantly to Salesforce’s revenues, in a year’s time. According to Matt Garratt, vice president of Salesforce Ventures, over 7,000 developers are currently building AI apps by using its Einstein tools.Salesforce stock has gained 39.3% year to date, substantially outperforming the 25.7% rally of the industry it belongs to.Bottom LineInvestments in start-ups have always been one of Salesforce’s key growth strategies. Over the past several years, the company either acquired or partnered with many such companies. Citing John Somorjai, executive vice president of Salesforce Ventures, Reuters noted that Salesforce Ventures has invested over $700 million in more than 250 enterprise start-ups since 2009.We believe Salesforce’s consistent focus on expanding its business through strategic acquisitions and investments in start-ups will drive growth over the long run.However, stiff competition, currency fluctuations and stepped-up investments in international expansions and data centers are expected to impact near-term profitability.Currently, Salesforce carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2606,CRM,"After the closing bell yesterday, software giant Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) reported fiscal first-quarter 2018 results. While the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings, it disappointed investors with a bleak outlook.Oracle Q1 Earnings in FocusEarnings per share came in at 62 cents, a penny ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and up 12% year over year. Revenues increased 7% year over year to $9.2 billion and were above our $9.02 billion estimate.The company’s long process of shifting to the Web-based cloud computing business is now paying off more than offsetting the decline in legacy business. Cloud software platform sales climbed 51% from the year-ago quarter to $1.5 billion and accounted for 16% of total revenue. Notably, Oracle is selling more cloud software platforms than any other company in the world and has grown three times faster in a year, gaining an edge over the software ace Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report). This indicates super-fast growth in cloud computing business (see: all the Technology ETFs here).For the fiscal second quarter, the world’s largest database software maker expects total revenues to grow 2-4% on a constant currency basis, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate growth of 4.73%. This is because cloud sales are expected to increase 39%-43%, lower than the growth of 51% in the recently reported quarter, suggesting a slowdown to the soaring cloud business. Further, the company expects earnings per share of 64-68 cents, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 69 cents, reflecting some concerns in the company’s future growth.The disappointing guidance pushed down shares of Oracle as much as 5% in the aftermarket trade. Currently, the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a solid Industry Rank in the top 41%. However, the Value and Growth Style Score is unimpressive at C and F, respectively.ETFs in FocusGiven this, ETFs with the highest allocation to this software giant look to be big movers this week and in the next.

2607,CRM,"Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings on Sep 14.Notably, the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14.10%.Adjusted earnings of 89 cents per share and revenues of $10.94 billion comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents and $10.48 billion, respectively. Revenue growth of 3.3% (4% in constant currency) was also better than management’s guidance of 1% to 2%. Oracle’s top-line growth benefited from the ongoing cloud-based momentum.Total revenue for first-quarter fiscal 2018 is anticipated to grow in the range of 4-6%. Earnings are anticipated to be between 59 cents and 61 cents for the quarter, with an impact of couple of cents from adverse currency headwind.Oracle Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Oracle Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Oracle Corporation QuoteOracle’s stock has gained 34.2% year to date, substantially outperforming the 25.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderOracle is benefiting from significant momentum in its Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings. This has also helped in improving the company's competitive position against salesforce.com (CRM  -  Free Report) and Workday.We believe that the company’s growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth. This is further evident from the expanding customer base.During the last quarter, Oracle’s cloud offerings attracted organizations like Advanced Drainage Systems, ARRIS, Australian Finance Group, Benchmark, Detroit Water and Sewerage, Immofinanz AG, Malmo stad, Marz Systems, Mebrom, Nuvias Group, Pernod Ricard Asia, Telesoft and Total.Moreover, Oracle Analytics Cloud has also gained significant traction. The updated product offers new features such as user-driven scenario modeling, next-generation mobile and social analytics and complete customer control. Oracle recently stated that 75% of Oracle Analytics Cloud customers are new to the platform that reflects strong adoption rate.However, higher investments on IaaS will affect gross margin expansion in the near term. Further, a strong U.S. dollar remains a headwind.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Oracle is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Oracle currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 61 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Oracle has a Zacks Rank #3 that increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderThe following stocks can be considered at the moment, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases:Applied Optoelectronics Inc. (AAOI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.76% and sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.ManTech International Corporation (MANT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.96% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2608,CRM,"Technology plays a crucial role in the evolution of various sectors, retail being prominent among them. The retail landscape has been witnessing a sea change with its focus shifting gradually from brick-and-mortar to online shopping.Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) has been in the spotlight for the last few years, as changing customer patterns have made the retail industry fall back more on e-Commerce. The company’s technological prowess has provided it an upper hand over other retailers who are still at their nascent stage in the e-Commerce field.Story Behind Amazon’s SuccessTechnology is giving shape to Amazon’s innovative business ideas. Apart from providing customers a seamless retail experience — user friendly website and mobile app as well as payment and delivery system — technology has been helping the company in saving costs and increasing transaction efficiency.Amazon has been also testing waters with innovations. These include a drive-in-grocery delivery service AmazonFresh Pickup wherein one can order groceries online and collect them from a store nearby, and “cashier-less” stores (Amazon Go – the company’s first brick-and-mortar grocery store). It has also added online and offline features to its bookstores.Not only this, Amazon always tries to bring in different user-friendly technological gadgets that even big tech companies haven’t thought of. The best example of this is Dash Button and Echo devices. These devices are highly coveted for their multi-utility feature.Amazon’s cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is providing the entire technological infrastructure. The company is continuously investing in enhancing its cloud infrastructure and Artificial Intelligence capabilities that are helping it to execute plans, better understand customer needs and simplify the overall retail process.Why NVIDIA & Other Tech Stocks Are in FocusWith Amazon’s recent acquisition of Whole Foods Market, the situation has worsened for retailers now. The acquisition has provided Amazon the scope to fortify its position in the brick-and-mortar space, and will enhance its distribution and fulfilment capabilities.Amazon’s move has raised question about the survival of other grocery store operators, particularly in the United States. Grocery stores already operate under razor thin margins and will thus face extreme difficulty in coping with Amazon’s pricing strategy and the technique of bringing in customers, for which it is well known.Computer and Technology Sector 5YR % Return Computer and Technology Sector 5YR % ReturnLooking at the successful run of Amazon, retailers have understood by now that in a changing landscape, market understanding and data information hold the key to gaining an edge over rivals. Therefore, to counter the growing threat from Amazon, various retail bellwethers are teaming up with tech companies.The latest tech company to benefit from this trend is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report). Recently, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) announced that it will build its own cloud-based data centers by using NVIDIA chips. Wal-Mart currently uses Amazon’s AWS for its cloud needs. The move will help it to shift from the rival’s infrastructure. Also, Wal-Mart partnered with Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google last month to give shoppers the ability to order thousands of products through Google Express using voice-activated shopping.Wal-Mart is not the only company making efforts to counter Amazon. Earlier this year, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) announced that it will invest $7 billion over the next three years in different areas, of which digital transformation is primary. Last month, the company also announced that it will reduce its use of AWS.As retailers are increasingly pumping up their investments to stay afloat, tech companies stand to benefit the most. The front-runners among them will be self-checkout technology and point-of-sale software providers. The space is dominated by players like NCR Corporation (NCR  -  Free Report), Honeywell International Inc. (HON) and Diebold Nixdorf, Incorporated (DBD  -  Free Report).Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) will benefit the most. It should be noted that with last year’s acquisition of Demandware, the company has forayed into e-Commerce shopping solution.Going forward, as more retailers try to shift from Amazon’s AWS, other cloud computing providers will likely prosper. In the cloud computing space, companies like Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Alphabet’s Google may see a rise in demand for their services by retailers.Apart from this, semiconductor companies NVIDIA, NXP Semiconductor (NXPI  -  Free Report) and ON Semiconductor (ON  -  Free Report) will also be the major beneficiaries. These semiconductor companies provide microchips that are complex tiny modules that store computer memory as well as provide logic circuitry for microprocessors.Currently, NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while Microsoft, Alphabet, Salesforce, NCR, Honeywell, NXP Semiconductor and ON Semiconductor carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2609,CRM,"Oracle Corp. (ORCL  -  Free Report) is taking another significant step to strengthen its position in the cloud services market. The company recently announced that it will hire more than 5K employees including engineers, consultants, sales and support people for expanding its cloud business.Cloud-based momentum has been a game changer for Oracle in recent times. We note that the company is a late entrant in the cloud computing market compared to its peers like IBM, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report).However, the company’s rapidly expanding Software as a Service (SaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) portfolios have boosted the top line in the past few quarters. Notably, cloud revenues increased 64.1% year over year to $1.41 billion in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. This led to a 3.3% increase in total revenue, which was also better than the guided range of (1%) to 2% for the fourth quarter.Shares of Oracle have gained 30.2% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 24.1% rally.Oracle Enhances Cloud OfferingsAccording to an IDC market report, SaaS will remain the dominant cloud computing service, with nearly two thirds of all public cloud spending in 2017 and roughly 60% in 2020. This presents significant growth opportunity for Oracle due to its dominant position in the Database as a Service market.Moreover, Oracle has introduced a number of cloud services like the retail merchandising solution, security solution over the last few quarters that have helped it to gain customers.However, with Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) still being one of the weaklings in the portfolio, the company is expected to spend more on it. This might affect gross margin in the near term. Nevertheless, the company anticipates SaaS gross margin to eventually rise to 80% in the long haul, thereby leading to an improvement in the bottom line.Oracle Corporation Revenue (TTM) Oracle Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Oracle Corporation QuoteCloud Takes Center StagePer a recent report by Gartner, the cloud shift will result in almost $1 trillion in information technology (IT) spending by 2020. Notably, all the big shot cloud service providers are gearing up to grab the opportunity.  Microsoft is reportedly planning a sales restructuring owing to its continuing shift to cloud. IBM recently announced the addition of four new data centers. It also unveiled cloud container service for Australian datacenters.Notably, cloud technology is increasingly being adopted at enterprises owing to its hyper-scalability and hyper-convergence. These enhance the flexibility of computing and enable flexible and cost effective storage and operations.We believe Oracle’s strategic initiatives to tap the accelerated growth of the cloud market are well paced. The new hirings will help the company aggressively market its products that will improve competitive position against the likes of salesforce.com (CRM  -  Free Report) and Workday. Moreover, enhancement of its cloud offerings will boost its revenues and eventually markets share going forward.Zacks RankOracle currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2610,CRM,"At times, it is prudent to hold on to certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions. Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) seems to be one such stock, which investors need to retain if they are looking to reap long-term benefits. Though the stock is facing a few headwinds at the moment, these are transitory in nature. There is enough scope for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to rebound in the long run. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In fact, Salesforce stock has gained 37.1% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s rally of 22.5%.Aspects In Favor of SalesforceContinuing its earnings streak for the sixth consecutive quarter, Salesforce posted splendid second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein the top and bottom lines not only fared better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but also came ahead of management’s guided ranges. Quarterly revenues and earnings also marked year-over-year improvement.Significant increase in Salesforce partner certifications has been fueling the top-line results. During fiscal second-quarter conference call, Salesforce announced that its partner certification witnessed growth of five times over the last four years, and more companies are willing to invest in its activities. Accenture has emerged as one of the biggest examples for this. Notably, Accenture is currently a global leader in the Salesforce implementation service space, with over 11,000 skilled consultants.A number of big organizations, including Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), 21st Century Fox, Jefferies Investment Bank and Samsung, selected Salesforce solutions during the quarter to drive their digital transformation.Furthermore, Salesforce broke through the $10-billion run rate and christened itself the first company in the history of enterprise cloud software industry to have achieved this milestone in such a short span of time, including its closest rivals like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and SAP SE.Most recently, Salesforce entered into an agreement with Amazon’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) to run its software in the latter’s Canadian data center. This has opened up fresh prospects in the Canadian market. Similarly, Salesforce is planning to do similar thing in Australia, in order to tap growing opportunity in the Asia-Pacific region.The company also won several deals of late owing to its international expansion initiatives. Companies like Toshiba, Nomura, Queensland Urban Utilities and Australia Post picked Salesforce’s solutions to fuel digital transformation.The higher number of deal wins and geographical contributions are encouraging. We consider the rapid adoption of the Salesforce1 Customer Platform to be a positive. Overall, the company’s diverse cloud offerings and considerable spending on digital marketing remain catalysts. Additionally, strategic acquisitions and the resultant synergies are anticipated to prove conducive to growth over the long run.In view of increasing customer adoption and satisfactory performances, market research firm, Gartner, acknowledged Salesforce as the leading social CRM solution provider. Also, just recently Forbes named Salesforce the most innovative company in the world again. We believe that the rapid adoption of Salesforce’s platforms indicates solid growth opportunities in the ever-growing cloud computing segment.Promising GuidanceThe company provided an encouraging guidance for fiscal third quarter and raised outlook for the full fiscal as well. For the fiscal third quarter, the company anticipates revenues in the range of $2.64-$2.65 billion (mid-point: $2.645 billion), representing a year-over-year increase of 23-24%.The guided range was higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.61 billion. Further, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the band of 36-37 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 35 cents.Furthermore, the company raised revenues and earnings outlook for fiscal 2018. Revenues are now anticipated to come in the range of $10.35-$10.40 billion (mid-point $10.375 billion), up from the previous projection of $10.25-$10.35 billion (mid-point $10.3 billion), representing 23-24% year-over-year increase. It also comes above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.28 billion.Similarly, Salesforce now projects non-GAAP earnings to lie between $1.29 and $1.31. This compares with the previous guidance range of $1.28-$1.30 on non-GAAP basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.30, in line with the mid-point of management’s non-GAAP guidance range.The company has an expected EPS growth rate of 26%. Notably, the stock has delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 7.1%.Risks PersistWe note that the Salesforce currently has a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 469.15. This level compares unfavorably to some extent with what the industry witnessed over the last year. The ratio is higher than the average level of 409.46 and is toward its higher end of the valuation range over this period. Hence, valuation looks slightly stretched from a P/E perspective.In addition, currency fluctuations and stepped-up investments in international expansion and data centers could hurt the bottom line.Our TakeWe expect the aforementioned factors to help the company sustain its strong momentum and stay afloat amid difficult times. Hence, we suggest that investors hold on to the stock for the time being.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

2613,CRM,"It has been an up-and-down week around the global markets already, and now that we have reached “hump day,” some investors might be in need of some midweek motivation. And in honor of Salesforce’s (CRM  -  Free Report) earnings announcement last night, this week’s edition of Wednesday Wisdom will feature words from the cloud king himself, Marc Benioff.Benioff started developing software as a kid and was reportedly raking in nearly $1,500 from royalties on his self-made computer games in high-school. After spending the first 13 years of his career at Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report), Benioff left to found Salesforce, which would quickly become the worldwide leader in customer relations management software.Just last night, Salesforce reported that it recently became the first enterprise cloud software company to break the $10 billion revenue run rate, and there’s no doubt that Benioff’s dynamic leadership was a major catalyst for this historic accomplishment (also read: Salesforce Posts Earnings and Revenue Beats, Solid Guidance).Benioff is, without question, one of the software industry’s titans, and like the great minds of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Larry Ellison, investors tend to listen when he speaks. So as earnings season wraps up and the technology sector remains relatively hot, let’s take a look at three Benioff quotes that every tech investor should benefit from.While this quote was likely aimed at the entrepreneurs and would-be-Benioffs of the world, it is also useful for tech investors to keep in mind. Are you just finally getting a grasp on the importance of the Internet of Things and self-driving cars? Great, but you can bet it won’t be long until the next big thing comes along, and you better be ready to adapt again.Again, here we see Benioff speaking to the up-and-comers and dreamers throughout the industry. Benioff believes in the value of the beginner’s mind—the kind that is fresh, inspired, and without hesitation. This is important for seasoned investors to remember too. Even if you’ve been trading stocks for years, the ability to approach your investment ideas with the excitement of a beginner can keep your portfolio crisp.Of course, this is easier said than done, but its meaning remains the same. As investors, we must have an eye on the future at all times—and we must be able to adapt to changes. What’s the point of predicting something will happen if you don’t have a winning strategy to profit from it?Want more advice from the investing greats?

2614,CRM,"Markets gained traction on Tuesday following reports that the Trump administration had made significant progress on tax reforms. All three benchmarks posted their best one-day percentage increase for the week. Also, Trump’s speech, during which he refused to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan sent defense stocks higher, further boosting broader markets. The Norwegian sovereign-fund, also world’s biggest sovereign fund, increased its exposure to the global market. This news also boosted the sentiment and overall the markets finished higher.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,899.89, gaining 0.9% or 196.14 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 1% or 24.14 points to close at 2,452.51. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,297.48, increasing 84.35 points or about 1.4%. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,955 to 847.  On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 1,965 to 855.Trump Administration Make Progress on Tax LegislationAccording to a report in Politico magazine, President Trump and his team have made considerable progress toward shaping tax reform plans. This report was received positively by the investors and broader markets gained. This also marks the GOP’s movement beyond the six-paragraph framework laid out in July. This development comes at the right time, just when the market is recovering from setbacks it suffered last week.The tax reform team is led by Chief Economic Advisor Gary Cohn, U.S. Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin, Senator Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Finance Chair Orrin Hatch, and Ways & Means Committee Chair Kevin Brady. Together, they are also known asthe “Big 6”. However, market watchers still remain skeptical of Trump administration’s ability to push through the much awaited reforms. This is because of the muddled domestic political scenario following the backlash the President faced after the Charlottesville incident, the investigation of a possible Russian involvement in 2016 elections and the divide within the Republican Party.President’s Speech on AfghanistanIn a primetime address on Monday, Trump announced that the U.S. would not be hasty in withdrawing troops from Afghanistan. He reasoned this would provide a chance for terrorists to almost instantly return to power, referring to the situation in Iraq post withdrawal of U.S. troops. This statement also boosted investor sentiment after defense stocks gained traction, led by shares of Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) which surged 1.7%. This resulted in the iShares U.S. Aerospace and Defense ETF (ITA) gaining 1.2%.Norwegian Fund to Raise Equity ExposureThe $970 billion Norwegian sovereign fund is slated to raise its equity holdings to 70% in a bid to increase its exposure to the global market. World’s biggest sovereign fund has returned almost 202 billion kroner or $26 billion in the second quarter. This development also boosted the overall sentiment and led to broad based gains for the market.Investors Await Jackson Hole MeetingThe market has suffered low trade volumes lately. At the day’s close, 2.76 million shares were traded on NYSE and 1.59 billion shares were traded on Nasdaq. The daily average volume for August for NYSE is 3.16 billion whereas that for Nasdaq is 1.84 billion.One of the reasons for such a lull is the reluctance of traders to make large bets ahead of the annual Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium to start this Thursday. Investors have also been closely following the bond market ahead of the meeting to have the central bankers in attendance. However, economists have clearly stated that it would be wrong to expect any major monetary policy related announcements.Stocks That Made HeadlinesVerizon Communications Restructures Unlimited Data PlansU.S. telecom behemoth, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), has restructured and modernized its unlimited wireless data plans, so as to reach out to customers’ more diversified needs.(Read More)Investors Punish Lowe's on Q2 Earnings & Sales MissLowe’s Companies, Inc. (LOW  -  Free Report) posted lower-than-expected second-quarter fiscal 2017 results.(Read More)Clorox Divests Aplicare Skin Unit to Medline IndustriesThe Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) announced the sale of its Aplicare skin antisepsis business to Medline Industries.

2615,CRM,"Continuing its earnings streak for the sixth quarter in a row, Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) posted splendid second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein the top and bottom lines not only fared better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but also came ahead of management’s guided ranges. Quarterly revenues and earnings also marked year-over-year improvement.The world’s leading CRM platform provider reported non-GAAP earnings of 33 cents per share, which came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents, as well as the company’s guidance range of 31-32 cents. Moreover, the figure compared favorably with the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 24 cents, mainly driven by strong top-line growth and efficient cost management, partially offset by increased number of outstanding shares.Looking at the last quarter’s strong results and encouraging outlook for the next quarter and fiscal 2018, we believe that the stock will likely see upside movement during today’s trading session. Notably, the stock has outperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the year-to-date period. Salesforce has returned 35.8% during the said time frame compared with the industry’s gain of 22.4%.Before discussing the fiscal second-quarter results in detail, here are some important business highlights of the quarter.Q2 Business HighlightsTremendous increase in Salesforce partner certifications has been fueling the company’s top-line results. During its fiscal second-quarter conference call, Salesforce announced that its partner certification witnessed growth of five times over the last four years, and more companies are willing to invest in Salesforce activities. Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report) has emerged as one of the biggest examples for this. Notably, Accenture is currently a global leader in the Salesforce implementation service space, with over 11,000 skilled consultants.A number of big organizations, including Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), 21st Century Fox, Jefferies Investment Bank and Samsung, picked Salesforce solutions during the quarter to drive their digital transformation.Furthermore, during the fiscal second quarter, Salesforce broke through the $10-billion run rate and named itself the first company in the history of enterprise cloud software industry to have achieved this milestone so fast, including its closest rivals like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) and SAP SE (SAP  -  Free Report).Amazon Partnership Stoking International GrowthThe company still generates only about 30% of total revenues from international operations, which is much lower than its rivals like Microsoft or Oracle composition of around 50%. Nonetheless, Salesforce noted that its partnership agreements with Amazon’s Amazon Web Services (AWS), entered over the past year, have been helping it expand its international operations.Earlier, the company used to run its software at its own data centers which was curbing its growth potentials. However, last year the company decided to utilize the AWS data center’s geographical reach to expand its international business. In addition, Salesforce has planned to invest about $400 million on AWS’ cloud platform, over the next four years.Most recently, Salesforce entered into an agreement with AWS to run its software in the latter’s Canadian data center. This has opened up  fresh prospects in the Canadian market. Similarly, Salesforce is planning to do similar thing in Australia, in order to tap the growing opportunity in the Asia-Pacific region.During the fiscal second quarter, the company won several deals due to its international expansion initiatives. Companies like Toshiba, Nomura, Queensland Urban Utilities and Australia Post picked Salesforce’s solutions to fuel digital transformation.Having discussed the fiscal second-quarter business highlights, let’s now turn to the financial results.RevenuesSalesforce continued to witness solid growth in revenues. The company’s revenues of $2.562 billion not only jumped 25.8% year over year, but also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.514 billion. Furthermore, reported revenues came above the guided range of $2.51-$2.52 billion (mid-point: $2.515 billion).The improvement is primarily attributable to rapid adoption of the company’s cloud-based solutions. Also, higher demand for the Salesforce ExactTarget Marketing Cloud platform, part of the Salesforce1 Customer Platform, drove the year-over-year upside in revenues.Now, coming to its business segments, revenues at Subscription and Support climbed about 25.6% from the year-ago quarter to $2.369 billion. Professional Services and Other revenues surged almost 28.3% to $193.1 million.Geographically, the company witnessed constant currency revenue growth of 24%, 31% and 27% in the Americas, EMEA and APAC, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.MarginsSalesforce’s non-GAAP gross profit came in at $1.967 billion, up 26.1%. Additionally, gross margin expanded 20 basis points (bps) to 76.8%, primarily due to solid revenue growth, which was partially offset by increased investment in infrastructure development, including the expansion of the international data centers.Non-GAAP operating expenses flared up 22.3% from the prior-year quarter to $1.585 billion. However, as a percentage of revenues, operating expenses decreased to 61.9% from 63.7% in the year-ago quarter. This was primarily because of efficient cost management.Salesforce posted non-GAAP operating income of $381.3 million compared with the year-ago figure of $263.6 million, while operating margin advanced 200 bps to 14.9%. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP operating margin was mainly driven by improved gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.Non-GAAP net income grew 41.4% year over year to $240.9 million, while net income margin expanded 100 bps to 9.4%. The benefit from improved gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues on net income margin was partially offset by elevated interest and other expenses.Salesforce.com Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Salesforce.com Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Salesforce.com Inc QuoteBalance Sheet & Cash FlowSalesforce exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $3.50 billion compared with $3.22 billion in the previous quarter. Accounts receivable were $1.569 billion compared with $1.439 million at the end of the fiscal first quarter. Total deferred revenue, as of Jul 31, 2017, was $4.82 billion, up 26% on a year-over-year basis.During the first half of fiscal 2018, the company generated operating cash flow of $1.561 billion. Moreover, Salesforce generated free cash flow of $1.276 billion in the first half.GuidanceBuoyed by better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results, the company provided an encouraging guidance for the fiscal third quarter and raised its outlook for the full fiscal as well. For the fiscal third quarter, the company anticipates revenues in the range of $2.64-$2.65 billion (mid-point: $2.645 billion), representing a year-over-year increase of 23-24%.The guided range is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.61 billion. Further, the company expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the band of 36-37 cents. On a GAAP basis, the same is anticipated to come between 4 cents and 5 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 35 cents.Furthermore, the company raised its revenues and earnings outlook for fiscal 2018. Revenues are now anticipated to come in the range of $10.35-$10.40 billion (mid-point $10.375 billion), up from the previous projection of $10.25-$10.35 billion (mid-point $10.3 billion), representing 23-24% year-over-year increase. It also comes above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.28 billion.By completing this target, the company will achieve the $10-billion mark in revenues faster than any other enterprise software company.Similarly, Salesforce now projects non-GAAP earnings to lie between $1.29 and $1.31, while GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of 7-9 cents. This compares with the previous guidance range of $1.28-$1.30 on non-GAAP basis and 6-8 cents on GAAP basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.30, in line with the mid-point of management’s non-GAAP guidance range.Our TakeSalesforce reported strong fiscal second-quarter results, wherein both top and bottom lines fared better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, as well as marked significant year-over-year improvement. The company continues to witness solid growth in revenues. The robust revenues were primarily backed by growth across all its business segments and the Salesforce ExactTarget Marketing Cloud platform.Going ahead, the company’s upbeat outlook for the full fiscal signifies that it will continue to witness growth throughout the fiscal. Additionally, the fiscal third-quarter revenue outlook is impressive. We are also encouraged by the fact that the company will achieve $10 billion in sales in fiscal 2018.The higher number of deal wins and geographical contributions during the reported quarter were encouraging. We consider the rapid adoption of the Salesforce1 Customer Platform will be a positive. Overall, the company’s diverse cloud offerings and considerable spending on digital marketing remain catalysts. Additionally, strategic acquisitions and the resultant synergies are anticipated to prove conducive to growth over the long run.In view of increasing customer adoption and satisfactory performances, market research firm, Gartner, acknowledged Salesforce as the leading social CRM solution provider. Also, just recently Forbes named Salesforce the most innovative company in the world again. We believe that the rapid adoption of Salesforce’s platforms indicates solid growth opportunities in the ever-growing cloud computing segment.Salesforce currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2619,CRM,"Shares of integration software maker MuleSoft  soared more than 20% in early afternoon trading Tuesday after news reports suggested that it was in advanced talks to be acquired by cloud computing giant Salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report).Citing people familiar with the matter, Reuters said Tuesday that Salesforce is interested in buying MuleSoft in order to bolster its offerings beyond customer relations software. The deal could be worth up to $6 billion and would represent Salesforce’s largest acquisition ever, the report said.Reuters also mentioned that the move would underscore Chief Executive March Benioff’s desire to supplement his company’s cloud-based solutions with new technology. The publication’s sources said that the deal could be announced as soon as this week, although an agreement is not yet certain.What Is MuleSoft?MuleSoft designs platforms for connecting applications, data, and devices. The company’s “Anypoint” technology was described as a “disruptive” force within the enterprise software market in a recent note from analysts at Nomura.“With a large potential TAM and product capabilities well ahead of the competition, MULE is poised to continue to gain share against the legacy incumbents in the integration software market,” the analysts said.Based in San Francisco, MuleSoft has already attracted interest from Salesforce in the past. Salesforce Ventures, the cloud firm’s venture capital wing, led a $128 million funding round for the software company back in 2015.MuleSoft claims more than 1,000 customers, including major clients like Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), and Spotify. MuleSoft’s solutions help companies’ own networks run faster, making them ideal for businesses that are not yet prepared for a full transition to the cloud.Why Does It Matter?Salesforce currently claims about 18% of the global CRM software market, but the company likely senses that its strongest growth potential lies outside of its current area of expertise. As companies of all shapes and sizes prepare for the next generation of technology, firms like MuleSoft—which promise to make this evolution more painless—should be extremely beneficial.Want more market analysis from this author?

Notably, the company boasts a strong earnings record, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 3%.Therefore, the question lingering on investors’ minds is whether this company will be able to continue with its upbeat performance this quarter as well.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that Accenture is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

Also, over the last three fiscals, Accenture invested approximately $3.4 billion in purchasing nearly 70 companies including start-ups.So far in fiscal 2018, the company has completed several acquisitions including Mackevision, Rothco and Altima. We believe these transactions to positively impact the company’s top-line performance in the period to be reported.  Accenture PLC Price and EPS Surprise Accenture PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Accenture PLC Quote New Client Additions and PartnershipsNotably, Accenture signed agreements with clients from a variety of industries during the quarter.

2623,CRM,"Salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) is set to buy a B2B eCommerce software provider, which will mark the company’s second acquisition this year. Though the world’s leading customer-relationship management-solution provider has not made any announcement regarding this, the to-be-acquired company — CloudCraze — has revealed this news on its website. However, financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.Founded in 2009, this Chicago-based start-up provides eCommerce platform to enterprises. The company’s B2B commerce software is built on Salesforce’s platform. Till its formation, CloudCraze had raised more than $30 million through venture funding, according to Crunchbase. Notably, Salesforce’s investment arm — Salesforce Ventures — had backed the company’s $20-million funding round in 2017.Rationale Behind the AcquisitionThe transaction is believed to be beneficial for Salesforce as the acquisition will enhance its capabilities and thereby help capture the growing opportunity in the B2B commerce industry. President and chief customer officer of CloudCraze, Ray Grady, in his blog yesterday, noted that the industry is anticipated to reach a value of $1.2 trillion by 2021 from the $889 billion at present.Furthermore, CloudCraze has a strong customer base with some big names like The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), Adidas, General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report), Cummins (CMI  -  Free Report), Ecolab, Land O’ Lakes, and WABCO. Therefore, with this acquisition, Salesforce will be able to pitch its existing B2B clients to use CloudCraze’s software.Bottom LineAcquisitions have always been one of Salesforce’s key growth strategies. Although the company remained almost silent throughout 2017 on the acquisition front (just one — Sequence), this year it might repeat the likes of 2016, when Salesforce bought 12 companies, to boost its capabilities, and grab newer and larger markets.We believe Salesforce’s continued focus on expanding its business through strategic acquisitions and investments will drive growth over the long run.Notably, the stock has appreciated 51.6% over the past year, significantly outperforming 40.2% growth recorded by the industry.Currently, Salesforce carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2624,CRM,"Cloud computing has been one of the most well-known drivers of growth in the technology industry over the last few years. And while the likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) hog the headlines, IT behemoth Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) is currently one of the largest cloud computing firms in the world.Oracle also competes directly with Salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report) and Workday (WDAY  -  Free Report) and has seen its cloud revenues climb recently. Last quarter, its cloud sales surged 44% to hit $1.5 billion.In the current quarter, the company is expected to see its overall sales climb by 5.51% to hit $9.79 billion. Oracle is also projected to see its adjusted quarterly earnings hit $0.72 per share, which would mark 4.35% growth from the year-ago period. Still, investors need to consider a few more metrics to understand if the company is poised to top this estimate.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to beat. Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Oracle currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.79%, which means earnings estimates have been higher directly ahead of ORCL’s Q3 results. When paired with the company’s current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) standing, investors should consider the stock as one that could be poised to top estimates.Investors should also note that Oracle has topped earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 7.49%.Oracle is set to report its Q3 fiscal 2018 earnings results after market close on Monday, March 19.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2625,CRM,"Mar 9 marked the ninth anniversary of the U.S. stock market’s bull run after the grueling slump following the Great Recession. Since then, stocks have scaled new heights on the latest Republican tax cuts and robust economic growth at home and abroad.In the meantime, rate hike and inflation fears failed to impede the rally. Investors also breathed a sigh of relief after the recent trade war fears on Trump’s tariffs plan eased. This calls for investing in some rock-solid stocks that have not only outperformed in the current bull market but also have scope to scale higher.Bull Market Celebrates 9th BirthdayU.S. stocks bottomed on Mar 9, 2009, with the S&P 500 losing more than 50% to hit a low of 676.53. The selloff had provoked President Barack Obama to say that “what you’re now seeing is profit-and-earnings ratios are starting to get to the point where buying stocks is a potentially good deal if you've got a long-term perspective on it.”Since then, the benchmark index has more than tripled, marking the second-longest and second-highest bull market run in its history. This record is second to the bull run that stretched through the 1990s.The Dow also went past the coveted 20,000 mark in late January and then blew past the 21,000 threshold just a month later. The bull market has helped the blue-chip index scale a whopping 14,300 points.Stocks Outshine Other InvestmentsDuring the nine years of the bull market, U.S. stocks handily beat other investments including gold and real estate. U.S. stocks also easily outdid their European counterparts. U.S. large-cap stocks have given a return of around 325% since Mar 9, 2009. This means that the investor who had $100,000 in a fund tracking large-cap stocks, will now have an account balance of about $425,000.Gold, in the meanwhile, has climbed only 43% from $925 per ounce in March 2009 to the current $1,325, per the World Gold Council. This means an investment of $100,000 in gold is now worth $143,000.The return on investments in U.S. homes have only risen 19% from March 2009 to February 2018, according to Zillow’s Home Value Index. Thus, the price of an American home has moved up from $175,000 to $208,000 in the last nine years.Meanwhile, the Europe Stoxx 600, a broad index of large European stocks, jumped 135% during the same time frame. Such gains boosted a $100,000 investment to $235,000, less than half of U.S. large-cap stocks.Catalysts Behind the Bull Market The bull run was no fluke, since the current stock prices are well supported by the Trump-induced rally. Trump’s polices including tax cuts, repealing regulations and increased infrastructure outlays restored expectations of a pro-growth agenda that helped the broader market push further into record territory.The new tax laws give companies a massive tax break as they will be paying between 8% and 15.5% instead of the earlier 35% to bring back money from overseas. This means around $1.2 trillion in foreign profits that the S&P 500 companies are sitting on will be returned. This in turn can be used to create jobs and reward shareholders — something the Trump administration has been aiming for since the election campaigns (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks).Trump’s economy also started 2017 on a stellar note. The U.S. economy expanded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.3% last year, marking the best growth in two years. Also, Americans are getting fatter paychecks, with wages growing at the quickest pace since the end of the last decade (read more: Wages See Fastest Growth Since 2009: Top 5 Gainers).But, there is another major factor behind the strong American growth. It’s the global economic growth, with every major country from China to Europe and Latin America to Japan expanding at a healthy pace. According to the International Monetary Fund, the global economy expanded at rate of 3.7% last year, the fastest since 2010.A healthier global economy, in turn, lifted corporate profits. In fact, for full-year 2017, total S&P 500 index earnings are expected to be up 7.1% on 5.9% higher revenues, way higher than the 0.7% earnings growth on 2.2% higher revenues recorded in 2016 (read more: A Very Positive Earnings Picture).Bull Market to Stay: 5 Winners The tax overhaul policy, solid global economic growth and encouraging earnings picture have certainly helped dismiss the fear that the Federal Reserve embarking on a quicker route to interest rate hikes might derail the record bull run. Odds of a trade war, in the meantime, ebbed after Trump exempted Canada and Mexico from steel and aluminum tariffs and allowed other countries to negotiate exclusions.Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial, further said that since 1950, if the S&P 500 increases 5% or more in January, the full-year returns are always positive. Needless to say, the benchmark index nudged up 5.6% in January.Banking on such positives, we have selected five solid stocks that have outperformed in the current bull market and have the scope to gain further. These stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Builders FirstSource, Inc. (BLDR  -  Free Report) manufactures and supplies building materials in the United States.

2626,CRM,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Salesforce.com Inc (CRM  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 13.61% over the past month. CRM hit a new 52-week high of $124.69 in the previous session. Salesforce.com has gained 21.76% since the start of the year compared to the 6.01% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 8.88% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a fantastic record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 28, 2018, Salesforce.com reported EPS of $0.35 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.33 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1.34%.For the current fiscal year, Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $2.03 per share on $12.65 billion in revenues. This represents a 50.37% change in EPS on a 20.72% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $2.56 per share on $15.07 billion in revenues. This represents changes of 26.32% and 19.14%, respectively.Valuation MetricsSalesforce.com may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for CRM? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Salesforce.com has a Value Score of F. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 61.45x current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 56.78x versus its peer group's average of 24.69x. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.54. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Salesforce.com Inc Price and Consensus  Salesforce.com Inc Price and Consensus | Salesforce.com Inc QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Salesforce.com currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Salesforce.com meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though CRM shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.

2629,CRM,"Q2 earnings season is finally wrapping up, and for the most part, results have been strong across the board. In fact, we’ve seen broad-based growth reaching the double digit level for the second quarter in a row, an abundance of earnings surprises, and favorable trends on the revisions front.At this point, well over 90% of the S&P 500 members have reported their latest results, but there are still several marquee reports to anticipate. Indeed, the upcoming week will include a handful of market favorites and bellwether brands, meaning that investors will need to be paying attention.With that said, investors can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.And today, we’ve made that task even easier for you. Using the Earnings Calendar, we looked ahead to next week—one of the last busy weeks of the earnings season—and selected the biggest reports to watch. Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of August 21:·         Salesforce.com (CRM  -  Free Report)) – August 22 – After Market CloseSalesforce, a cloud computing giant and global leader in customer relations solutions, is set to report its second-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on August 22. While currency fluctuations and stepped-up investments might prove to be challenges, Salesforce remains a dominant industry force with diverse cloud offerings and strong client satisfaction.Heading into its report, Salesforce currently sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). With an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, surprise prediction is difficult; however, the stock does sport an “A” grade for growth, and investors should be pleased with the company’s year-over-year comparisons this quarter. According to our current consensus estimates, Salesforce is expected to report EPS growth of 18.3% and sales growth of 23.5% for its latest fiscal period. ·         HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report)) – August 23 – After Market CloseA result of the 2015 split of Hewlett-Packard Company into two publicly traded entities, HP Inc. is focused on the brand’s PC and printing products and services. The company is scheduled to post its third-quarter 2017 earnings after the market closes on August 23. While the glory days of the PC are long gone, HP’s restructuring initiatives are finally starting to pay off, and its stock has been steadily rising all year.As we approach HP’s report date, the stock is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). While its Earnings ESP is at 0.00%, the company does have an “A” grade for Value, which is a bit of a rarity in today’s tech world. HP has also been able to post five-straight quarters of shipment growth, and if it can continue that momentum, it could be another solid report from the legacy PC brand. ·         Ulta Beauty (ULTA  -  Free Report)) – August 24 – After Market CloseUlta, the nation’s largest beauty retailer, will release its second-quarter earnings results after the closing bell on August 24. A long-time beacon of hope in the struggling retail industry, Ulta has slumped significantly since its last report. Still, the company has a strong earnings surprise track record and holds exciting growth prospects.However, with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -1.69%, it’s clear that analyst sentiment is not strong heading into the report. Current consensus estimates are calling for EPS growth of 24.2% and sales growth of 20.4% this quarter, and investors should keep their eye on the company’s online and same-store sales figures after the results are in. ·         Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report)) – August 24 – After Market CloseBroadcom, a key supplier for Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), will report its third-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on August 24. Despite rumors of an iPhone 8 delay, this semiconductor maker has soared more than 43% year-to-date and is looking to add to its streak of 12-straight earnings beats.Broadcom is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Growth. Our current consensus estimates are calling for EPS growth of 41.2% and sales growth of 32.6% this quarter, and it will be interesting to note if the company reveals any additional info about the production schedule for the upcoming iPhone.Of course, these are just a few of the nearly two-hundred companies that are expected to report next week.

2630,CRM,"salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Aug 22. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 20%. Additionally, the stock has a mixed earnings surprise history, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice, matching in one and missing in the other occasion. However, the average earnings surprise remains positive at 2.5%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderLast quarter, although Salesforce disappointed on the earnings front, it continued to witness solid growth in revenues. The improvement was primarily attributed to the rapid adoption of the company’s cloud-based solutions. Also, higher demand for Salesforce ExactTarget Marketing Cloud platform, part of the Salesforce1 Customer Platform, contributed to this improvement. We expect this trend to continue in the second quarter as well.A higher number of deal wins and geographical contributions are also likely to boost results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Overall, the company’s diverse cloud offerings and considerable spending on digital marketing remain growth catalysts. Moreover, strategic acquisitions and resultant synergies are anticipated to drive the fiscal second-quarter results.Considering increased customer adoption and satisfactory performances, market research firm –Gartner – acknowledged Salesforce as the leading social CRM solution provider. We believe that the rapid adoption of the company’s platforms indicates solid prospects in the expanding cloud computing space, which will, in turn, bolster results in the quarter to be reported.On the flip side, although the company has been growing reasonably in the cloud market, its prospects have been rationalized to a considerable extent due to intensifying competition from Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) Oracle Corp. and SAP AG. In addition, currency fluctuations and stepped-up investments in international expansion and data centers could hurt the bottom line in the fiscal second-quarter results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Salesforce will likely beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at 0.00%.

2631,CRM,"As the major indexes continue to flirt with all-time highs nearly every day, it should come as no surprise that many individual stocks are touching new heights on a regular basis—and targeting stocks that are breaking into new highs will always be a popular technique for momentum-focused investors.Despite some recent volatility caused by anxiety-inducing geopolitical drama related to North Korea, the bull market is raging on, and according to Barcharts.com, at least 68 stocks touched a new all-time high on Wednesday alone.And of course, we all know that the technology sector has been one of Wall Street’s driving forces this year. In fact, as the Zacks Sector Rank data shows, our “Computer and Technology” group has gained nearly 19% year-to-date, significantly outpacing the 11.3% growth of the S&P 500.Indeed, the list of today’s new all-time highs includes some of the tech world’s biggest names. For example, even though it has moved into the red during late afternoon trading hours, consumer electronics behemoth Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) hit a new peak today.Apple shares briefly trudged about 0.6% higher to hit a new high of $162.51. As customers eagerly await more details on the company’s upcoming 10th anniversary edition iPhone, investors are continuing to fuel the stock’s post-earnings surge. Currently, AAPL is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but the stock does have an “A” grade for Momentum in our Style Scores system.Another familiar tech stock hitting new highs today is Salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report). This cloud computing giant looks poised to end the day more than 1.5% higher, and earlier this afternoon, the stock touched a new all-time high of $92.40 per share. Salesforce is also a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but it has been able to earn an “A” grade for Growth.And Salesforce isn’t the only player in the cloud computing space that is moving to new heights today. Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report), a maker of cloud-based graphic design and imaging software, moved more than 1% higher to touch a new all-time high of $151.99 per share.ADBE has slumped back down a bit, but the stock will close in the green, and with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it could be poised to break even higher soon (also read: 3 Cloud Stocks to Buy Right Now).Investors interested in the cloud space might also notice that AppFolio (APPF  -  Free Report) is also on the new highs list. AppFolio, which offers cloud-based software solutions for property management and legal industries, debuted about two years ago and has been steadily climbing since then.Today, AppFolio climbed nearly 2.5% to touch a new high of $39.32 per share. As of right now, the stock is sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), as well as “A” grades in our Growth and Momentum categories.Finally, to give the video game space some love, investors should note that game developer Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report) hit a new high today. In early afternoon trading, Take-Two surged more than 1.9% and touched a high of $92.46 per share. TTWO is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).These five stocks are just a few of the many companies reaching new all-time highs today.

2632,CRM,"Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has completed the acquisition of Alexandria-based Phase One Consulting, a cloud computing and digital services provider. Notably, the two companies entered into the deal in June this year. However, financial details of the transaction remain undisclosed.Founded in 1997, Phase One offers Salesforce-based IT services and software solutions, mainly focused on the federal market. Its services and solutions help federal agencies in modernizing and digitizing.The company was owned by private equity firm – RLJ Equity Partners – which had acquired it in January 2015. Its stronghold in the federal market attracted investments from the venture capital arm of Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report), Salesforce Ventures in September last year.Post completion of this acquisition, Accenture intends to integrate under its Accenture Federal Services subsidiary. We believe that the recent acquisition will not only strengthen the company’s Salesforce capabilities, but will also help it in gaining more and more federal contracts, thereby boosting its top-line performance.Salesforce Capabilities Expansion ImpressiveSince 2014, Accenture has been aggressively trying to fortify its position as a leading provider of Salesforce capabilities. The recent buyout is the company’s seventh acquisition in the Salesforce space, while this is the first federal market acquisition related to Salesforce.Notably, Accenture is already a global leader in the Salesforce implementation service space, with currently over 11,000 skilled consultants. Moreover, given that Salesforce is one of the largest providers of cloud-based applications and software, it is imperative that Accenture enhances its capabilities in delivering the former’s services.Industry Forecasts Justify StrategyThe company’s strategy of boosting its cloud capabilities through such acquisitions is a step in the right direction, as evident from the latest forecast provided by several independent research firms. According to Gartner, the SaaS and cloud-based business application markets are likely to grow from $38.6 billion in 2016 to $46.3 billion in 2017, reflecting year-over-year growth rate of approximately 20%. Also, the research firm forecasts that the market will double by 2020 from the 2016 level.Another research firm – International Data Corporation (IDC) – predicts that the cloud software market will witness a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.3% during the 2014–2019 period, reaching $112.8 billion by 2019 end.Exponential growth in the amount of data, complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals compelled several companies to turn to cloud-computing vendors. Therefore, considering the increasing need for cloud-based applications and software, we anticipate Accenture’s investments in this space to propel long-term growth.Bottom LineWe are encouraged by Accenture’s strategy of growing through acquisitions. These buyouts have enabled the company to foray into newer markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio, and maintain a leading position. We believe that regular acquisitions will significantly contribute to the company's revenue stream.Nonetheless, Accenture’s announcement of creating 15K new jobs by 2020 and investment plan of $1.4 billion for employee training and opening of 10 innovation centers across the U.S. cities may dent its bottom-line results, in our opinion. Furthermore, increasing competition from other players like DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report) and NV5 Global, Inc. (NVEE  -  Free Report), and an uncertain macroeconomic environment may deter its growth to some extent.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.But here's something even more remarkable: You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar.

2633,CRM,"Shares of Twilio Inc. (TWLO  -  Free Report) jumped over 10% during yesterday’s after-hours trade, as the company’s splendid second-quarter results and upbeat 2017 outlook overshadowed the effect of loss of some business from Uber.Twilio reported second-quarter results yesterday, wherein the top line came ahead of our expectations, while the bottom line matches the same. Also, the company witnessed year-over-year improvement on both the counts.Recovers from Uber HangoverThe recently reported strong quarterly results clearly indicate that the company has been able to mitigate the loss of revenues from Uber.It should be noted that Uber uses Twilio services for a variety of used cases such as driver and rider communication, driver marketing and several others. Till 2016, Uber used Twilio’s platforms in most of its geographical operations. However, since first-quarter 2017, Uber is “optimizing by used case and by geography” and is planning to ""move communications for some use cases in-app."" This means that Uber is now trying to operate its messaging services internally.Looking at the recent development in its biggest customer’s strategy on communication services, Jeff Lawson is concerned and opines that this will restrain Twilio’s overall growth in 2017. Uber’s contribution to Twilio’s revenues has now declined to approximately 9% in the second quarter from roughly 12% in the previous quarter and 13% in the year-ago quarter.Despite this, the company managed to report robust revenue growth, as well as narrowed its quarterly loss per share on a year-over-year basis, returning itself once again on growth trajectory mainly due to its sustained focus on launching new products, global expansion, go-to-market sales and acquisition strategies.Notably, Twilio’s shares have outperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the last three months. The stock has gained 31.8% in the said period, while the industry recorded growth of just 3.1%.Let’s discuss second-quarter results in detail.Quarter in DetailThe company’s second-quarter revenues surged 48.6% year over year to $95.9 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $86 million. Also, it came ahead of management’s previously guided range of $85.5–$87.5 million. Furthermore, the company’s base revenue jumped 55% year over year, while excluding Uber, it escalated even at a faster rate of 65%.The robust top-line performance was mainly driven by remarkable year-over-year growth in active customer account which was a result of the company’s consistent focus on introducing products and its go-to-market sales strategy.During the reported quarter, the company registered a whopping 41% rise in active customer accounts, adding over 12,651 accounts in the last 12 months, bringing the total count to 43,431 as of Jun 30, 2017. During the second quarter alone, Twilio added over 2,700 active customer accounts.Moreover, the company announced that “We had a total of 42 product announcements around SIGNAL this year, including Twilio Functions, our serverless computing product, new analytics products, our voice recognition product we built in conjunction with Google and support for several new third-party communications channels like Alexa, Slack, Twitter and email for companies want to communicate with their customers in a growing list of new mediums.”Non-GAAP gross profit jumped 50.7% year over year to $54.9 million, while margin expanded 80 basis points (bps) to 57.2%. Per Twilio, year-over-year increase was stemmed by the combination of efficiency gains and a better product mix.Non-GAAP operating expenses flared up 41.4% year over year to $59.6 million. The year-over-year surge was mainly due to increased investment in research and development, and sales to capitalize on the market opportunity. However, as a percentage of revenues, the figure contracted 310 bps to 62.2% from 65.3% in second-quarter 2016.Further, the company’s non-GAAP operating loss came down to $4.7 million from $5.7 million reported in the year-ago-quarter. Non-GAAP net loss came in at $4.8 million or 5 cents per share, down from the year-ago quarter figure of $5.9 million or 8 cents. Also, non-GAAP loss per share came much below the management’s guided range of a loss of 10–11 cents. The year-over-year improvement in the bottom line was mainly driven by sturdy top-line growth, which was partially offset by elevated operating expenses and higher share count.The company’s adjusted loss (including one-time expenses and income but excluding stock based compensation) of 20 cents per share, came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Twilio Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Twilio Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Twilio Inc. QuoteThe company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $289.2 million, slightly up from $288.5 million at the end of the previous quarter. In addition, during the first half of the year, the company uses $4 million worth of cash for operational activities.OutlookBuoyed by strong quarterly performance, Twilio raised its full-year outlook and provided encouraging guidance for the third quarter. For 2017, Twilio now expects revenues to come between $371 million and $375 million (mid-point $373 million), up from $356–$362 million (mid-point $359 million) projected earlier. This is significantly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $359.16 million.Similarly, base revenue is estimated to be in the range of $348.5–$350.5 million, higher than the previous forecast of $340–$343 million. Non-GAAP net loss is now projected to come in the range of 22–24 cents, much lower than its previous projection of 27–30 cents per share.For the third quarter, Twilio estimates revenues to come between $91 million and $93 million (mid-point $92 million). This is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $89.04 million. Base revenue is anticipated to be in the range of $86.5–$87.5 million. Non-GAAP net loss is projected to come in the 7–8 cents per share range.However, the company expects that loss of business from Uber will continue to affect its base revenue growth and expansion rate till mid 2018.Our TakeSan Francisco, CA-based Twilio offers cloud-based software that helps developers make and receive phone calls, text messages and video chats. The company boasts a strong clientele that includes the likes of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), salesforce.com (CRM  -  Free Report) and Twitter among others. Furthermore, the long-standing relationship with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) is particularly noticeable. Twilio uses Amazon Web Service (AWS) to host its platform. Additionally, Amazon invested during Twilio’s Series E round funding in 2015.The company’s key initiatives, which include product innovation, global expansion and acquisitions, are helping it in gaining customers, which bodes well for long-term growth. We opine that proliferation in cloud and mobile penetration across the globe will continue to fuel Twilio’s customer growth over the long run.However, Uber’s recent strategy on utilizing communication services will have a negative impact on Twilio’s overall prospects throughout this year. Furthermore, intensifying competition in the communications market and growing prevalence of in-app push notifications are major concerns. Moreover, customer concentration is a headwind.Currently, Twilio carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Notably, the stock outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice and missed in one occasion, over the trailing four quarters. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 20.9%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that GrubHub is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of the two key components.Zacks ESP: GrubHub currently has an Earnings ESP of +23.8%.

Its strong presence offers a competitive advantage.Of late, the company has been gaining a lot of traction in the business, driven by its branding efforts, and ongoing improvements in products and delivery network.During its first-quarter earnings conference call, the company had revealed that its diverse restaurant base, along with broader marketing reach and continuous improvement in products, are helping it gain more new customers. In the first quarter, active diners were 8.75 million, increasing 26% year-over-year from 6.97 million active diners in first-quarter 2016.We anticipate the aforementioned factors to continue helping the company in attracting more new dinners to try GrubHub services, thereby bringing in more incremental revenues in the second quarter.Furthermore, early this year, GrubHub introduced ’Delivery X: Delivery Without Limits’ to enable quick and timely delivery of food to dense urban metro areas.Also, GrubHub integrated its ordering system with Amazon’s Alexa, enabling users of Amazon Echo, Echo Dot and Amazon Tap to order their food through voice command.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Salesforce.com Inc.

2636,CRM,"Equinix Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 16.95%. Notably, the stock outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 20.96%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayEquinix is a global provider of network-neutral data centers and internet exchange services for enterprises, content companies, systems integrators, and network service providers. The company operates across various geographical regions and its increasing popularity among major tech industry players looking for data management will likely drive revenues in the second quarter.Acquisitions have been a major growth driver for Equinix and helped it expand data center capacity in many of its key markets since 2003. We anticipate the company’s buyouts of Telecity Group, Bit-isle and Nimbo, to boost the top line in the quarter.Expansion in important markets and consolidation of facilities in existing ones have been important parts of Equinix's core strategy. We believe that the company’s focus on offering upgraded technology to attract clients will bolster its revenues and profitability in the to-be-reported quarter.However, we remain slightly cautious about the huge capital outlays, which may dent Equinix’s second-quarter profitability. It should be noted that Equinix had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $4.938 billion, while the total debt principal outstanding was $9.27 billion as on Mar 31, 2017. Growing debt burden will affect the company’s profitability in the quarter as interest expense would go up.Moreover, increasing competition from established internet data center operators, such as AT&T (T  -  Free Report), Level 3 Communications, COLT and Verizon, will affect product pricing, thereby thwarting margins.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Equinix is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in its upcoming release. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Equinix is 0.00%.

Notably, the stock outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 40.85%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to ConsiderCirrus Logic is a premier supplier of high-performance analog circuits and advanced mixed-signal chip solutions. The company delivered better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results.  The year-over-year comparisons on both earnings and revenue front were also favorable.Continued investments in the audio segment have helped Cirrus Logic to come with innovative products time to time. This helps the company in attracting new customers and brings in additional revenues. We expect this factor to positively impact the company’s to-be-reported quarter results as it did in the earlier quarters too. Additionally, synergies from acquisitions and expansion in the LED market are anticipated to drive the fiscal first-quarter results.Nonetheless, sluggish economic growth, as well as IT spending may affect its fiscal first-quarter performance.

Conversely, stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Symantec’s Zacks Rank #2 and a positive ESP make us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat.Symantec Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Symantec Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Symantec Corporation QuoteWhat's Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?Symantec has been clocking solid returns, and in the year-to-date period it has gained approximately 29.9%, outperforming 22.3% growth recorded by the industry, which it belongs to.We believe that the company will continue to benefit from strong demand for cybersecurity solutions. It should be noted that the financial well-being, brand image, and reputation of enterprises and governments are always exposed to the risk of cyber threats. Consequently, cybersecurity has become a mission-critical, high-profile requirement.With rapid technological advancement, organizations are increasingly adopting the “bring your own device” (BYOD) policy to enhance employee productivity, with anytime/anywhere access. This trend, in turn, calls for stricter data security measures.Moreover, various independent research firms had forecast strong demand in 2017. Gartner had predicted that the worldwide Information Security spending would reach $90 billion in 2017, marking 7.6% growth from the 2016 level of approximately $83.6 billion.We believe that Symantec must have capitalized on this opportunity. We anticipate that this might be well reflected in the company’s results in the quarter to be reported.Furthermore, the company’s mobile and cloud security products are gradually gaining market acceptance. The storage and server management business provides recovery solutions and heterogeneous storage-end server platforms. We believe that these innovative products and solutions will have helped Symantec win customers in the last quarter, thus increasing its business volume.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Salesforce.com Inc.

2639,CRM,"The success of an investor depends on proper identification of overpriced toxic stocks and the rightly priced ones. However, the over-bubble stocks and the fairly priced stocks are intermixed in the market place in such a way that it becomes very tough to differentiate between them. Investors who can figure out the toxic stocks and dump them at the right time are likely to benefit.Usually, toxic stocks are susceptible to external shocks and are burdened with huge amount of debt. Moreover, the price of the toxic stocks is unjustifiably high. The irrationally high price of the toxic stocks is only short-lived as the intrinsic value of these stocks is lower than the current bloated price.The high price of the toxic stocks can be attributed to either an irrational exuberance associated with them or some serious fundamental drawbacks in the stock. If you own such stocks for a long stretch of time, you are likely to witness huge erosion in your wealth.On the other hand, if you can pinpoint the toxic stocks, you may gain by resorting to an investing strategy called short selling. This strategy allows you to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls.While short selling excels in bear markets, it typically loses money in bull markets.So, identifying toxic stocks and disowning them at the right time is the key to shield your portfolio from big losses. Profits can be made by short selling them.Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks:Most recent Debt/Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average: High debt/equity ratio implies high leverage. High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount.P/E using 12-month forward EPS estimate greater than 50: A very high forward P/E implies that a stock is highly overvalued.% Change in F (1) and F (2) Estimate (12 Weeks) less than -5: Negative EPS estimate revision for this and the next fiscal year during the past 12 weeks points to analysts’ pessimism.Zacks Rank more than or equal to #3 (Hold): We have not considered Buy-rated stocks that generally outperform the market.Here are five of the 16 toxic stocks that showed up on the screen:Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (LYV  -  Free Report) is a Beverly Hills, CA-based live entertainment company. Over the past 30 days, its second-quarter 2017 estimates have declined 5.9% to 16 cents a share.

2640,CRM,"IBM Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has added four new global data center facilities. Two of these are located in London, England, one in San Jose, CA and the other in Sydney, Australia.The recent additions take the tally of IBM’s global data centers to 60 across 19 countries. The new data centers are equipped with the required cloud infrastructure to help clients develop cognitive artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions and Blockchain applications.IBM had opened four data centers in April this year, two in Dallas, TX and two in Washington, D.C. The company is spending on its cloud offerings and data centers and we believe the segment will help the company to post a turnaround.Notably, the company has underperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the index gained 12.1%, the stock lost 9.5% over the same time frame.IBM’s Cloud PerformanceIBM has been shifting from its traditional businesses to cloud and data analytics. In the recently reported second-quarter 2017 results, cloud revenues increased 17% to $3.9 billion. The annual run rate for cloud as-a-service revenues increased 30% (up 32% at cc) on a year-over-year basis to $8.8 billion. Cloud revenues, on a trailing 12-month basis, are now over $15 billion, almost 20% of the company’s total revenue.International Business Machines Corporation Revenue (TTM) International Business Machines Corporation Revenue (TTM) | International Business Machines Corporation QuoteThe company is also pushing into the hybrid cloud segment, which is a combination of private and public cloud infrastructure. Llyods Bank and American Airlines chose IBM’s hybrid cloud services in the second quarter.In a recent article, Forbes quoted Bain & Company stating that global cloud information technology market revenues are expected to increase from $180 billion in 2015 to $390 billion in 2020, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17%. Per Gartner, by 2020, 90% of organizations will adopt hybrid infrastructure.We believe IBM is slowly establishing its footprint in the cloud services market with the addition of new data centers, introduction of services like cloud container services in Australia datacenters and deployment of solutions like BlockChain and Watson on its cloud platform. These will eventually assist the company to compete against the likes of Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report).Zacks RankIBM currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3 Top Picks to Ride the Hottest Tech Trend                   Zacks just released a Special Report to guide you through a space that has already begun to transform our entire economy...Last year, it was generating $8 billion in global revenues.
