In the last reported quarter, the company generated 39.2% of its total revenues from the highest revenue generating segment.We are optimistic about the IC business that will help the company maintain impressive global growth, courtesy of an innovative portfolio and robust commercial teams. The division performed well in the last reported quarter, despite the LOTUS recall in Europe. Worldwide IC growth came on the back of strength in Structural Heart and complex PCI (percutaneouscoronary intervention) portfolio. However, the upside was partially offset by weak performance by the drug-eluting stents.Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Scientific Corporation QuoteWithin Structural Heart, we are looking forward to Boston Scientific’s WATCHMAN, ACURATE and IRIS product lines that are expected to contribute to the top line in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. The company expects revenues from WATCHMAN and ACURATE TAVR franchise to total approximately $400 million in 2018.The WATCHMAN program depicted impressive performance in first-quarter 2018. The product has been used in more than 50,000 implants, worldwide. Moreover, the company expects continued growth in this platform on the back of increased utilization and geographical expansion.Additionally, recent launches within the IC business like the WOLVERINE cutting balloon and the company’s next-generation rotational atherectomy platform — ROTAPRO — are expected to contribute significantly to the top line in the upcoming quarterly results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IC revenues is pegged at $658 million, indicating an increase of 9.1% on a year-over-year basis. The company is expected to keep gaining strength in the business.In the last reported quarter, the PI business performed impressively on the back of higher sales of Drug-Eluting Eluvia Stents and Ranger Balloon in Europe. Geographically, the company witnessed strength in Asia as well. Boston Scientific’s Atherectomy Jetstream platform also performed well in the first quarter of 2018.The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter. Accordingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter PI revenues is pegged at $296 million,  reflecting a rise of 8.4% year over year.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $2.47 billion indicates an increase of 9.6% from the prior-year quarter’s tally. Also, the earnings estimates of 34 cents reflect a 6.3% rise on a year-over-year basis.Other Factors at PlayAmong the other segments, MedSurg is estimated to demonstrate a steady performance, led by endoscopy. Urology and Women’s Health are also projected to surpass market levels, driven by investment strategies in the key international geographies.We are impressed with Boston Scientific’s recent acquisitions that have added several products (though many are under development) with immense potential. NxThera and nVision buyouts in Urology and Pelvic Health along with EmCision buyout in Endoscopy deserve a mention.The company is gradually strengthening its presence in the emerging markets  of Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC). In first-quarter 2018, business from the emerging markets registered a 17% growth. Business in China was once again remarkable (up 23% year over year). The company is currently looking forward to an improved performance ahead in China, following the recent approval of SYNERGY in this region.Boston Scientific is gaining traction in India as well.

The company is also optimistic about core cardiology segment which is gradually stabilizing with growth in the BRIC nations. This trend is expected to continue in the yet-to-be reported quarter’s results.However, although immaterial for the to-be-reported quarter, the ongoing tensions between the United States and China regarding the imposition of tariffs on imports have raised concerns for major MedTech players as any adverse move might affect the top-line numbers in the upcoming quarters.The company also provided second-quarter 2018 financial outlook.

3,BSX,"Stryker Corporation’s (SYK  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2018 results are scheduled for release on Jul 24, after market close. The company’s acquisition-driven strategy is expected to boost growth by expanding product offerings across all segments.We expect the company to witness steady growth in sales from Orthopaedic Implant — one of its major revenue-generating components. While this is projected to drive second-quarter 2018 earnings, an expected improvement in revenues in other segments, especially MedSurg, will help the company drive impressive results.Notably, in the last reported quarter, Stryker posted earnings of $1.68, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5%.For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.32 billion, reflecting a rise of 10.2% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pinned at $1.73, indicating a year-over-year increase of 13.1%.Stryker Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Stryker Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Stryker Corporation QuoteOrthopaedic Implant in FocusOrthopaedic Implant contributed 37.7% to net revenues in the last reported quarter. In the last reported quarter, revenues at the segment were up 5% organically. The upside can be attributed to a significant year-over-year increase in Mako robot installations. The coveted Mako platform also recorded strong performances in Japan, South Pacific and Canada.

Revenues in the segment grew 9.1% at constant currency (cc) to $1.43 billion.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for MedSurg equipment revenues is pegged at $1.48 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 10.4%.Domestic & International RevenuesStryker is well balanced on its high domestic and international revenues.In the last reported quarter, domestic revenues accounted for a significant 71.3% of net sales.

Entellus is integrated within Stryker’s core Neurotechnology & Spine segment. This will enable physicians to conveniently perform a broad range of ENT procedures. However, the acquisition is expected be dilutive initially to Stryker’s 2018 adjusted earnings per share by approximately 4 cents. This is likely to affect the top line in the quarter to be reported.

6,BSX,"If you’re looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks that will offer the best of value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy. It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued and have impressive growth prospects.However, one should not confuse GARP investing with the blend strategy. While the blend strategy promotes investment in both value and growth stocks, GARP investing requires both value and growth features in a single stock.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)Here are seven of the 14 stocks that made it through the screen:Anthem Inc.

7,BSX,"Investors interested in stocks from the Medical - Products sector have probably already heard of Lonza Group Ag (LZAGY  -  Free Report) and Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Right now, both Lonza Group Ag and Boston Scientific are sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.LZAGY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 20.06, while BSX has a forward P/E of 22.93. We also note that LZAGY has a PEG ratio of 2.01. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. BSX currently has a PEG ratio of 2.27.Another notable valuation metric for LZAGY is its P/B ratio of 3.08. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, BSX has a P/B of 6.25.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to LZAGY's Value grade of B and BSX's Value grade of D.Both LZAGY and BSX are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that LZAGY is the superior value option right now.

9,BSX,"With several tailwinds gradually flowing in, opportunities are growing enormously within the medical device space. The sector is currently enjoying the investment world’s attention. While investors are putting their efforts in picking a subindustry that is beaming with prospects, the name which pops up first is the cardiovascular devices market.Per World Health Organization (WHO), cardiovascular diseases are disorders of the heart and blood vessels. It includes coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions.Going by the latest Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics 2018 report by American Heart Association, around 92.1 million U.S. adults are living with some form of cardiovascular disease or the after-effects of stroke. Further, cardiovascular diseases have been deemed to be a major cause of death of around 836,546 people in the United States.  Notably, this is gradually taking the shape of a deadly epidemic. Globally, the scenario is quite intriguing. Per a WHO report, cardiovascular diseases are the major cause behind 31% of all global deaths and took the lives of 17.7 million people in 2015.Notably, projections related to the disease hint at the continuation of the present trend. In this regard, the number of deaths globally due to cardiovascular diseases is expected to increase to more than 23.6 million by 2030. Moreover, total direct expenditures related to cardiovascular diseases are expected to rise to $749 billion in 2035.It goes without saying that the rising incidence of cardiovascular diseases globally has opened up opportunities for cardiovascular device makers. The market is expected to witness CAGR of 6.7% to reach $81.38 billion between 2017 and 2027 (per a report by Visiongain).Accordingly, for investors who are keen to effectively put their money for longer-term gains, the cardiovascular devices market undoubtedly holds immense potential.Factors Driving Cardiovascular Devices MarketRising healthcare expenditures, unhealthy lifestyle practices along with expanded treatment options have been driving demand. Per a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board, U.S. healthcare spending is projected to rise to around $5.5 trillion by 2025, representing 19.9% of GDP (based on the assumption that the Affordable Care Act will continue through 2025).The cardiovascular devices market is largely dependent on the aging population. Per the U.S. Census Bureau report, in 2050, people aged 65 or more are likely to total 83.7 million, almost double its estimated population of 43.1 million in 2012. Data also shows that the median age is increasing in most areas of the country and the global scenario is pretty similar.Strengthening emerging markets have been contributing largely to the rise in demand for cardiovascular devices. Per an article by a leading market intelligence firm, Life Science Intelligence, the demand for some cardiovascular devices has been growing at solid double-digit rates in many emerging countries, including the BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) and Turkey of late.AI Brings a New EraAccording to a research firm TechEmergence, AI is being broadly used in the following three categories for better management of cardiovascular diseases.Artificial intelligence is being applied to automate the Atrial fibrillation process falling under the ECG monitoring category. It is also being used by companies to accurately predict the risk of cardiovascular disease and its related impacts. Finally, the companies are also involved in actively using the AI platform to improve the accuracy of patient scans for detecting cardiovascular diseases.There are certain developments, which deserve a mention here. A leading digital health company Analytics 4 Life is actively involved in designing a machine learning algorithm to detect coronary artery disease non-invasively (without radiation or accelerating the heart).Cardiotrack, an India-based start-up, recently introduced a technology platform that uses a hand-held device, cloud storage and artificial intelligence to capture and analyze electrocardiogram signals for specific heart conditions.Stocks to Watch Out ForWe have selected three companies, which we believe can tap the promising prospects of the cardiovascular devices market.Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report): This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has Cardiovascular and Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) as two of its three reportable segments. Cardiovascular includes Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions businesses. The company is one of the leading players in the interventional cardiology market with its coronary stent product offerings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company also markets balloon catheters, rotational atherectomy systems, guide wires, guide catheters, embolic protection devices, and diagnostic catheters, as well as intravascular ultrasound imaging systems.Within the CRM segment, the company deals with implantable devices that monitor the heart and deliver electricity to treat cardiac abnormalities.Boston Scientific’s projected earnings growth rate for the current year is 10.3%.  The stock delivered positive earnings surprise in two of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 2.4%.Over the past three months, Boston Scientific outperformed its industry. The stock has improved 19.9% compared with the industry’s 7.5% gain during the period. Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report): This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG) as one of the reportable segments. CVG comprises Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF), Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH) and Aortic & Peripheral Vascular divisions (APV). The CRHF division develops, manufactures, and commercializes products for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of heart rhythm disorders and heart failure. The APV division offers a comprehensive portfolio of products and therapies to treat aortic disease (such as aneurysms, dissections, and transections) as well as peripheral vascular disease, and critical limb ischemia.Further, CSH division offers therapies to treat coronary artery disease and heart valve disorders.Medtronic has an expected earnings growth rate of 7.3% for the current year.  The stock has delivered positive earnings surprise in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 3.9%.Over the past three months, Medtronic outperformed its industry. The stock has improved 10.4% compared with the industry’s 7.5% gain during the period. Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report): This Zacks Rank #3 company has Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation business under the broader Medical Devices segment. The company offers a wide range of rhythm management, electrophysiology, heart failure, vascular and structural heart devices for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, as well as neuromodulation devices for the management of chronic pain and movement disorders. These products are manufactured, marketed and distributed globally.Heart failure related products, including the HeartMate left ventricular device family, vascular products, including the XIENCE family of drug-eluting coronary stent systems developed on the Multi-Link Vision platform, and rhythm management products, including Assurity MRI and Endurity MRI pacemaker systems are some of the prominent products offered by the company.Abbott has an expected earnings growth rate of 14.4% for the current year.  The stock has delivered positive earnings surprise in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 2%.Over the past six months, Abbott outperformed its industry. The stock has improved 10.4% compared with the industry’s 9.1% gain during the period. ConclusionAs they say, strike while the iron is hot. It is the opportune time to cash in on the bountiful opportunities in the rapidly-growing cardiovascular devices market.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

10,BSX,"Uncertainty gripped the equity markets on the news that the Trump administration is mulling to impose tariffs on imported cars, citing an obscure ruling to protect domestic auto manufacturers. The purported move is likely to backfire and adversely impact the operations of several auto manufacturing firms, leading to job loss and decline in production. With the on-again off-again trade war between the United States and China still remaining a potential threat, the domestic trade concerns appear far from over and are likely to continue weighing on the equity markets.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless these are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE more than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screen:General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report): Founded in 1908, Detroit, MI-based General Motors is a leading global automotive firm. The company is engaged in designing, building and selling cars, trucks, crossovers and automobile parts worldwide.

12,BSX,"The medical device industry has been benefiting from favorable consumer behavior, the growing prevalence of minimally-invasive surgeries, demand for liquid biopsy tests and the use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.Further, considering favorable demographics, changing market dynamics toward Artificial Intelligence (AI) & big-data applications, and increased business investments, this sector has been going strong. Broadly speaking, the latest Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which slashed corporate tax rates to 21% from the earlier 35%, has also buoyed optimism among investors.Additionally, the Senate’s decision, to defer the implementation of an industry-wide excise tax — known as the Medical Device — for another couple of years, has instilled confidence in investors. The tax will be effective from Jan 1, 2020. The bill also delays the Cadillac tax — 40% tax on employer insurance — until 2022.

13,BSX,"The on-again off-again trade war between the United States and China took a new turn when President Trump imposed a fresh salvo of tariffs worth $50 billion on Chinese imports last week. This followed an immediate retaliation by China, which promised to match the scale of the trade restrictions on a vast array of U.S. goods.

14,BSX,"With the suspension of the controversial 2.3% medical device tax for another two years, the medical device industry is currently riding high on optimism. AdvaMed, the medical device industry’s lobbying group, which strongly advocated for this relief, noted that the tax repeal will provide a huge impetus to the companies to channelize their turnovers into strategic consolidations, research and developments and also help in creating new job opportunities.According to an article published in Daily News, the tax before going into effect from January 2020 will save the device companies as much as $3.7 billion during the two-year suspension.The U.S. medical device market is undergoing substantial transformation. An aging population, longer expectancy for life, growing healthcare awareness in emerging economies combined with powerful long-term tailwinds, including mergers & acquisitions (M&As) and product innovation, have been contributing to growth of the sector.M&A Boom Continues It is yet to be seen how far the benefits of the tax repeal have been redirected to M&As till now. Meanwhile, according to Mark Bonifacio, President of Bonifacio Consulting Services, private equity and strategic OEM (Original equipment manufacturer) buyers are competing for assets in all sectors of medical contract manufacturing and broadening their portfolios or investing in new technologies.He strongly stated that although the start of 2018 was sluggish with respect to M&As, it was due to uncertainties over changes in the global healthcare market and the fate of Obamacare’s medical device tax. Now that the doubts are gradually getting cleared, the industry is once again heading toward another year of significant M&A activity.This year’s biggest M&A deal seems to be in the cards with the Wall Street Journal’s latest rumored news related to two mammoths of MedTech space, Boston Scientific BSX and Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report). The report says that both the rivals may consider a bid for consolidation.The analysts seem to be optimistic about the rumored deal and believe that after the colossal mergers of Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report)-Covidien and Abbott (ABT)-St. Jude Medical in the last couple of years, Boston Scientific also needs to make a mammoth move to maintain its foothold in the highly competitive medical-technology space.Following the company’s $25 billion consolidation with St. Jude Medical in January, Abbott ABT recently closed the $5.3-billion acquisition of Alere. With the successful wrap up of this transaction, the combined company is anticipated to emerge as a leading player in the $7 billion point-of-care diagnostic space.Another mega consolidation in the recent times was that of medical device major, Becton, Dickinson and Co. and medical, surgical, diagnostic, and patient care devices provider C. R. Bard, for $24 billion. After the completion of the deal in January, Becton, Dickinson is on its way to expand to new areas like vascular access segments – PICCs (peripherally inserted central catheters), midlines and drug delivery ports.Baxter International BAX purchased RECOTHROM Thrombin topical and PREVELEAK Surgical Sealant from specialty pharmaceutical company Mallinckrodt plc (MNK  -  Free Report).Varian Medical (VAR  -  Free Report) also inked a major M&A deal. The company recently signed an agreement to acquire Australia-based global life sciences company, Sirtex Medical Limited for a total deal value of $1.28 billion. The investment will strengthen the company’s position in interventional oncology therapies. This apart, in its effort to gain foothold in the emerging economy, the company recently acquired Cooperative CL Enterprises, a leading distributor of radiotherapy equipment in Taiwan.Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) subsidiary DePuy Synthes inked a deal to acquire Medical Enterprises Distribution in May.This apart, in 2018, Boston Scientific announced several strategic acquisitions including NxThera and nVision in Urology and Pelvic Health, EmCision in Endoscopy, Securus in EP and Millipede in Structural Heart. This inorganic expansion plan bodes well for the stocks’ operational growth.Divestments Medical device majors continue to offload their non-core business lines and assets that are similar to the ones acquired through mergers to focus on the main segments. These divestures have been mandated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and other international anti-trust regulators. This restricts chances of monopoly in the market.Earlier this month, Johnson & Johnson got a $2.7 billion offer from Fortive Corporation to sell its subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc.’s Advanced Sterilization Products business units to Fortive. If JNJ accepts the proposal, it will be a step toward streamlining of its business per its strategic roadmap for better resource utilization and higher shareholders’ return.This apart, according to a MASSDEVICE report, Medtronic recently divested its stake in LifeTech Scientific to China Everbright Ltd. and another unnamed investor. BD also divested its soft tissue core needle biopsy line and Aspira product line to Merit Medical for $100 million. The divestment is related to its acquisition of C.R. Bard.In April, Henry Schein HSIC announced its decision to spin off the company’s major segment global Animal Health business. We believe this initiative remains part of Henry Schein's 2018-2020 Strategic Plans to focus more on dental and medical businesses.

Following the new healthcare reform announcement in December 2017, a Gallup poll revealed that the past decade marked the biggest increase in the uninsured rate.Meanwhile, with exploding population, rising middle class and increasing governmental awareness of health issues, emerging geographies are facing huge demand for modern but cheaper healthcare options. Going by a report in The Guardian, International Finance Corp’s (IFJ) data shows that developing countries account for 80% of global deaths from chronic diseases indicating enormous market opportunity.Per a recent BCG report, the share of emerging markets, which is currently less than a quarter of global MedTech revenues, is likely to increase to nearly one-third of revenues by 2022. The MedTech market in China, currently the second largest in the world, is projected to grow about 13% annually from 2015 through 2022. India, the fifth largest MedTech market in the world, currently records 17% annual growth. At this pace, India may emerge as a strong competitor to Japan and Germany by 2022.Given the huge potential in these regions, long back, Johnson & Johnson had set up manufacturing and R&D centers in Brazil, China and India. The company’s emerging markets medical device segment continues to grow three to four times faster than the developed markets.Abbott continues to lead the emerging market investment trend with about 50% of sales from this region.

15,BSX,"The global medical device industry has demonstrated strong and sustainable growth in the recent past. Banking on an aging population, increasing incidence of chronic and lifestyle diseases, increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and big-data applications, upbeat consumer sentiment and increased business investments, this sector appears to be in the pink of health.Going by KPMG data, the medical device industry’s global annual sales is forecast to rise more than 5% a year to reach nearly $800 billion by 2030.A CISION report says that the United States is the largest medical device market in the world at present, raking in more than $180 billion in revenues. Despite several socio-political hazards and economic dips, U.S. medical device companies have been riding high on R&D innovation, increasing consolidation, emerging market expansion and tax cuts.Undoubtedly, it has been a very profitable investment space of late.Here are a few major developments:Abolition of MedTech Tax The bipartisan two-year suspension of the Medical Device tax, which imposed a 2.3% excise tax on MedTech manufacturers, marks a temporary relief. It will be again put into effect from Jan 1, 2020.The repeal is expected to boost hiring and investment at 9,000 America-based medical device manufacturers, thus instilling investor optimism.The ratification of the tax-repeal amendment has encouraged massive investments in the sector.M&A Uptrend ContinuesApart from the tax relief, the MedTech fraternity has also been riding high on the ongoing merger and acquisition (M&A) trends in the space. In fact, various reports suggest that M&A has been the key catalyst driving the U.S. healthcare space of late. Per data provided by BioSpectrum Asia, M&A activity in the MedTech space surged 50% in 2017, increasing the value of aggregate M&A to more than $200 billion.Some of the major acquisitions in the recent past include Becton, Dickinson and Company’s (BDX  -  Free Report) acquisition of C. R. Bard and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) buyout of Actelion.PBM-Health Insurers ConsolidationLately, health insurers have been looking to collaborate with pharmacy benefit managers in the MedTech space to streamline costs in the drug supply chain.Buoyed by continued capital inflow, strategic M&A policies by key medical device players have expanded customer bases, moderated leverage and enhanced cash flow. These have also alleviated pricing pressure and competition in the MedTech space.In this regard, the latest buyout announcement of Express Scripts by Cigna (CI  -  Free Report), which comes just three months after drug chain and pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp’s (CVS  -  Free Report) announcement to acquire the nation's third-largest health insurer, Aetna, is important.Digital Revolution and MedTechLatest trends like robotic surgeries, Big-data analytics, bio printing, 3D printing, electronic health records (EHR), predictive analytics, real-time alerting and revenue cycle management services in the U.S. MedTech space are gaining prominence.Various reports suggest that the strategic application of AI in every sphere of healthcare can provide an impetus to productivity. Companies that adopted AI technologies have witnessed a 50% reduction in healthcare costs and have also experienced improved patient outcome of more than 50%.This along with a rise in minimally-invasive surgeries, higher demand for liquid biopsy tests and use of IT for quick and improved patient care, and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model have been driving profits at medical device companies of late.Trade War Fears Grip MedTechThe 10 sectors that have been identified by Trump for imposition of higher tariff are now on investors’ radar. Healthcare, including medical equipment, is one of the sectors, likely to bear the brunt of the trade dispute.Going by data provided in an article by Christian B. Jones in Mondaq, MedTech firms in the United States currently sell $4.7 billion annually to China, while the nation imports from China a total of $5 billion in medical device. U.S. exports of medical devices last year totaled $52 billion, creating a $1 billion worldwide trade surplus. Needless to say, the medical device lobby is extremely apprehensive about the proposed tariffs on Chinese products as it could significantly affect international trade.Zacks Industry RankWithin the Zacks Industry classification, Medical Device is broadly grouped into the Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) and further sub-divided into four industries at the expanded level: Medical - Instruments, Medical - Products, Medical - Dental Supplies and Medical Info Systems.We rank all 250-plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each.The Zacks Industry Rank is #70 (top 27% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries) for Medical Info Systems, #84 (top 33%) for Medical - Dental Supplies, #108 (top 42%) for Medical - Instruments and #189 (bottom 26%) for Medical - Products. Our backtesting shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Upon analyzing the Zacks Industry Rank for different Medical Device segments, it can be said that apart for certain medical product stocks, the near-term outlook for the aforementioned Medical device subsectors is overall positive.Price PerformanceThe price performance of two major Zacks categorized sub industries, are as follows:Over the past 30 days, while the S&P 500 has gained 2.2%, the med instruments space has risen 3.6%. Some of the stocks within this space that have been trading above the S&P are Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report), STERIS plc (STE  -  Free Report) and Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW  -  Free Report).While the Medical Product subsector’s industry rank indicated a bearish tone, the sector has increased 2.9% in this period. Some players from this space are Haemonetics Corp. (HAE  -  Free Report), Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) and Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report).Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

16,BSX,"Growth at a reasonable price or GARP is an excellent way for investors to make some quick gains. This strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks that have impressive prospects and are trading at a discount.The GARP approach leads to the identification of stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.That means a portfolio created on the basis of GARP strategy is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth and solid prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that are likely to offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)Here are seven of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:VMware, Inc.

17,BSX,"The Medical Instrument industry within the broader Medical universe has been gaining on R&D innovation, higher consolidation, focus on emerging market and tax abolition. The industry increased 3.6% in a month’s time, higher than the S&P 500 index’s rise of 2%.Fundamentally, the industry has benefited by a massive change in consumer behavior as well. This is evident from the rise in minimally-invasive surgeries, higher demand for liquid biopsy tests as well as use of IT for quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.It will be interesting to analyze the best Medical Instrument stocks that are likely to yield solid returns in the days to come. But first, let us glance at the latest headlines from the space. Latest Medical Instrument Headlines at a Glance Stryker’s Takeover Plans of Boston ScientificThe Medical Instrument fraternity has been riding on the current merger and acquisition (M&A) trends.Per a recent report by the Reuters, Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) is likely to take over Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report), creating a market value of more than $110 billion. However, the possibility of the deal is uncertain. Thre are no confirmatory statements or press releases from the company representatives.In fact, investors should never forget about Stryker’s highly-rumored acquisition plans of Smith & Nephew in 2015, which never materialized. On the brighter side, this is not the first time Stryker has been tied up with Boston Scientific. The company acquired Boston Scientific's neurovascular unit in 2010 for $1.5 billion, which indicates probability of a second collaboration (read more: Stryker Likely to Acquire Boston Scientific).Stryker has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).If the deal materializes, the combined entity will have one of the MedTech’s broadest spectrums of product offerings that include cardiology, orthopaedics, surgical supplies and neuroscience. This will reduce pricing pressure and competition. Further, the companies with a strong acquisition policy will gain from rapidly-expanding customer base, moderate leverage and enhanced cash flow.Glancing at major acquisitions in the recent past, Becton, Dickinson and Company’s takeover of C. R. Bard for $24 billion and JOHNSON & JOHNSON’s buyout of Covidien for about $43 billion deserve a mention.Abiomed Reserves Slot in the S&P 500 Leading Medical Instrument player Abiomed Inc (ABMD  -  Free Report) replaced Wyndham Worldwide Corp and entered the S&P 500 Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Health Care Supplies Sub-Industry index.Per a research report by The Globe and Mail, Abiomed is following the trend of medical device and technology companies reserving the top slot in the S&P 500 index. To remind investors, Align Technology Inc (ALGN  -  Free Report) topped the index in 2017.Abiomed currently has a market capitalization of $18.6 billion. Further, the company’s financial viability, adequate liquidity, reasonable price and sector representation has lent it a competitive edge in the U.S. Medical Instrument industry (read more: Abiomed to Replace Wyndham in the S&P 500 Benchmark).Tax Abolition Boosting R&DA bipartisan two-year suspension of a ‘Medical Device’ tax, which imposed a 2.3% excise tax on MedTech manufacturers, has been a temporary relief. This tax took a toll on the entire medical device industry since its enactment. Per the Advanced Medical Technology Association lobbying group, this tax had a negative impact on medical innovation resulting in loss or deferred creation of jobs.For now, the deferral will encourage R&D activities in this space. The repeal of the tax paradigm is expected to boost hiring and investment among the 9,000 America-based medical device manufacturers, instilling investor’s optimism. The ratification of the Tax-repeal amendment has invoked massive investment in the sector.3 Top Medical Instrument StocksConsidering the existence of the number of players in the Medical Instruments industry, choosing the right stocks with the potential to yield returns might be a daunting task.Our proprietary Zacks methodology makes it fairly simple for you.We have taken the help of the Zacks Stock Screener to select favorable stocks.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year earnings is currently pegged at $4.50, up 25% year over year.In June, Varian Medical Systems demonstrated its comprehensive portfolio of advanced brachytherapy solutions in the American Brachytherapy Society Annual Meeting. The development is likely to boost Varian's Oncology Systems segment. Apart from various volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), stereotactic radiosurgery and stereotactic radiotherapy, the brachytherapy unit is a significant contributor of Oncology Systems.The company has been gaining consistently from its coveted Halcyon platform — a cost-effective radiotherapy cancer treatment system. Notably, the company also launched Halcyon 2.0 with kilovoltage imaging. Solid revenues from Oncology, growing adoption of Particle Therapy and strong overseas presence, particularly in the emerging countries are positives.Varian has also been going global in acquisitions and agreements. Recent buyouts include Sirtex of Australia and COOP of Taiwan along with a partnership with the Ministry of Health, Brazil. A solid guidance for fiscal 2018 instills confidence. Intuitive Surgical Inc (ISRG  -  Free Report) outperformed its industry in a month. The stock has risen almost 6.1% and sports a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year earnings is currently pegged at $10.26, up 14.1% year over year.Growing adoption of the company’s da Vinci system, increasing procedure volumes, continuous innovation and solid recurring revenue base are the key catalysts.Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci surgical system enables minimally-invasive surgery that helps avoid the trauma associated with open surgery. The da Vinci System is powered by robotic technology that allows the surgeon’s hand movements to be translated into smaller, precise movements of tiny instruments inside the patient’s body.da Vinci has bolstered the company’s foothold in the markets of Cardiac Surgery, Colorectal Surgery, General Surgery, Gynecologic Surgery, Head & Neck Surgery, Thoracic Surgery and Urologic Surgery. The da Vinci system has made available minimally invasive surgery to more than 3 million patients worldwide.Recently, the system has cured patients diagnosed with inguinal hernia.Integer Holdings Corporation (ITGR  -  Free Report) outperformed the industry in the last three months. The stock has returned 13.3%, against the industry’s decline of 14.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year earnings is currently pegged at $3.37, up 19.9% year over year.The company witnessed an impressive start to 2018 on high organic and year-over-year growth in earnings and revenues. The Cardio & Vascular arm deserves a special mention here. The other segments have also been delivering a solid performance.The strategic divestment of the Advanced Surgical, Orthopedics & Portable Medical wing to MedPlast, LLC is expected to prove profitable in the quarters ahead. The company has a multi-year plan for long-term developments. An impressive guidance, declining operating expenses and the clearing of debt are other major positives. The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

18,BSX,"Shares of Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) gained 7.4% to close at $34.32 on Jun 11, 2018, following a speculation that the company's rival Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) might consider a bid for acquiring the former. This news is per a Wall Street Journal report.Trading in both stocks was temporarily paused during Monday's session on the NYSE. Per yesterday’s close, Boston Scientific’s market cap was $47.5 billion as compared to Stryker's $63 billion.Following the above, a Reuters’ report stated that it is still unclear whether Boston Scientific is open to a potential buyout proposal by Stryker. The prospective acquirer too declined to comment on the report.Meanwhile, a Benzinga report wrote, “Any bid would have to surpass $40 per share, according to Stifel Nicolaus, and Wells Fargo predicted shares could be valued around $42, based on the Becton Dickinson-CR Bard deal, according to Bloomberg.”Previous BSX-Stryker AllianceSignificantly, this is not the first time that Stryker and Boston Scientific have come up for strategic collaborations. Back in 2010, the orthopaedic devices giant bought Boston Scientific’s Neurovascular unit for $1.5 billion. That time, the rationale behind this divestment decision by Boston Scientific came as part of the company’s aggressive restructuring initiatives. More specifically, the neurovascular division, one of the company’s non-core businesses, was struggling with depressed sales.Rationale Behind Latest Rumored DealWhile Boston Scientific’s position on the prospects of the possible sell-off rumor is still unknown, some analysts believe that the reason behind the company’s contemplation over a probable sell-off might lie in its interest to gain a further competitive edge in the medical device space.It is important to note that post the colossal mergers of Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report)-Covidien and Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report)-St. Jude Medical over the last couple of years, Boston Scientific also needed to make a mammoth move to maintain its foothold in the highly competitive medical-technology space.If the merger gets to materialize finally, considering both Boston Scientific and Stryker’s present market cap, then the consolidated entity will have a combined market cap of more than $110 billion. According to Wells Fargo Securities, this is a position only behind Medtronic and Johnson & Johnson in terms of total device revenues.Reacting to this widely speculated buyout bid, retired Twin Cities med-tech stock analyst Thom Gunderson said that it  “makes perfect sense to me. Go big or go home is the rule of the day.""The analysts seem optimistic about the alleged deal and believe that if it finally works out, Boston Scientific will score a vantage point in the fast-growing competitive heart valve replacement market where it is currently trailing behind Edwards Lifesciences (EW  -  Free Report) and Medtronic.Also, this merger is expected to reduce costs for the combined company at a time when the healthcare industry is already battling against severe pricing pressure.Share Price ComparisonOver the past year, shares of Boston Scientific have rallied 22.9%, ahead of Stryker’s 20.3% increase. While the broader sector remained much below with a 2.2% rise.Both Boston Scientific and Stryker currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

21,BSX,"Per a recent report by the Reuters, Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) is likely to take over Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report), creating a market value of more than $110 billion.If the deal materializes, the combined entity will have one of the MedTech’s broadest spectrums of product offerings that include cardiology, orthopaedics, surgical supplies and neuroscience. Yesterday, shares of Stryker have dropped 5.1% to close at $169.78. Boston Scientific’s shares have increased 7.4% to close at $34.32.How Likely is the Deal to Materialize?The chances of the deal are uncertain because there are no confirmatory statements or press releases from the company representatives.In fact, investors should never forget about Stryker’s highly-rumored acquisition plans of Smith & Nephew from 2015, which never materialized.On the brighter side, this is not the first time Stryker has been tied up with Boston Scientific. Stryker acquired Boston Scientific's neurovascular unit in 2010 for $1.5 billion, which indicates probability of a second collaboration now.However, reaching any particular conclusions at this moment might be a bit too early.Analysts’ OpinionThe Wall Street Journal claims this agreement to be “one of the largest in a year that is shaping up to be one of the busiest ever for mergers and acquisitions”.If the deal matures, Wells Fargo Securities analyst Lawrence expects it to outpace Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) in total device revenues.Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang focused on the need of increasing consolidation in healthcare to provide a comprehensive product portfolio to customers. Stryker’s supposed deal with Boston Scientific seems prudent in this regard.How Will Stryker Benefit?If the deal happens, Stryker will gain control of Boston Scientific's line of heart devices such as stents, defibrillators and Watchman device to prevent blood clots. Boston Scientific achieved clinical milestones for Ranger Drug Coated Balloon and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device.Further, the company will also leverage on Boston Scientific’s solid foothold in the underpenetrated emerging economies. The company also registered double-digit growth on a year-over-year basis in the emerging markets in the last reported quarter. If the deal materializes, Stryker might profit from Boston Scientific’s strength, especially in the BRIC nations.Stryker has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Shares of the company have outperformed the industry over a year’s time. The stock has returned almost 20.2%, better than the industry's rise of 14.7%.  Stryker’s Acquisition Profile Shines BrightStryker has been following an acquisition-driven strategy to boost growth. Recently, the company acquired Entellus Medical, Inc in an all cash transaction for $24 per share or an equity value of approximately $662 million.Stryker also acquired VEXIM for €183 million. VEXIM specializes in the development and sale of vertebral compression fracture solutions for.In 2017, Stryker completed the acquisition of NOVADAQ for a net purchase price of $674 million. NOVADAQ is a leading developer of SPY fluorescence imaging technology that provides surgeons with visualization of blood flow and perfusion with more than250 clinical studies and array of specialties. The company's product portfolio is highly complementary to Stryker's visualization platform.‘Let’s Wait and Watch’If Stryker manages to acquire Boston Scientific, the Medical world will achieve a solid benchmark in terms of providing a comprehensive suite of MedTech solutions. This will reduce pricing pressure and competition. Further, the companies with a strong acquisition policy gain from rapidly-expanding large customer base, moderate leverage and enhanced cash flow.Meanwhile, the MedTech fraternity has been riding on the ongoing merger and acquisition (M&A) trends, making it one of the most profitable investment arenas.Glancing at major acquisitions in the recent past, Becton, Dickinson and Company’s takeover of C. R. Bard for $24 billion and JOHNSON & JOHNSON’s buyout of Covidien for about $43 billion deserve a mention. Per data provided by BioSpectrum Asia, M&A activity in the MedTech space surged 50% in 2017, increasing the value of aggregate M&A to more than $200 billion.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!

22,BSX,"On May 31, 2018, we issued an updated research report on Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report). The company is gaining traction in the emerging markets, particularly in the BRIC zone. However, product recall issue continues to impede growth. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past three months, shares of Boston Scientific have outperformed the industry on several issues. The stock has gained 11.6% versus the industry's 2.1% decline.Notably, Boston Scientific posted an impressive first-quarter 2018 on the back of growth across all business lines and geographies. The 2018 view also paints a bright picture for the near term. Boston Scientific is leaving no stone unturned to strengthen its core businesses as well as invest in new technologies. The company achieved clinical milestones for Ranger Drug Coated Balloon and WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device.Also, post the suspension of Lotus valve in Europe, ACURATE TAVR valve platform continues to build momentum for the company’s growth. During the first quarter, Boston Scientific announced several strategic acquisitions including NxThera and nVision in Urology and Pelvic Health, EmCision in Endoscopy, Securus in Electrophysiology and Millipede in Structural Heart. This inorganic expansion plan bodes well for the stocks’ operational efficiency. Also, a gradually improving foreign exchange scenario has started to contribute to the company’s overall top-line performance.Boston Scientific is pulling out all the stops to pump its resources into new technologies and global markets, accounting for higher sales across all its geographical regions in the third quarter. Additionally, we are encouraged by the company’s number of approval gains for its products both in the domestic as well as overseas markets.However, we are concerned about the company’s recall of one of its prime products, Lotus range of heart devices. The fate of Lotus valve issue thrown in the throes of uncertainty for some more time for Boston Scientific. Recently, the company announced a delay in its earlier-reported timelines for the commercial return of the LOTUS Edge Aortic Valve System in Europe as well as the United States, following the product’s voluntary recall in February 2017.Per the latest update, the company expects to launch LOTUS Edge in the United States and the European markets not before 2019. We currently fear about the indefinite future of the company’s fast-growing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) business within interventional cardiology wherein Lotus valve line is a prime product.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc (AMED  -  Free Report).

23,BSX,"The U.S. equity markets seem to be bracing up for another roller-coaster ride after President Donald Trump flip-flopped on his trade policy with China and renewed threats to impose 25% tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods to retaliate against unfair trade practices. The volte-face could derail the trade negotiations between the two warring countries, reducing United States’ negative balance of trade, as China vouched to counter the move with similar trade restrictions.Although overall markets recovered from a sudden steep sell-off triggered by Italy’s political crisis (which threatened the stability of the eurozone) as two anti-establishment parties renewed efforts to form a government, domestic trade concerns appear far from over.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE more than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 17 stocks that qualified the screen:General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report): Founded in 1908, Detroit, MI-based General Motors is a leading global automotive firm. The company is engaged in designing, building and selling cars, trucks, crossovers and automobile parts worldwide.

24,BSX,"Emerging market investment has taken a backseat of late, thanks to the nonstop blows to the economy. The lingering geopolitical tension in Gulf, debt and policy related hazards in Latin America or the missile tests in North Korea have led stock investors to reconsider their outlay in these markets, earlier proclaimed to offer better growth opportunities than the United States.Going by the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, the last five-year annualized growth rate was just 5.02%. On the other hand, GDP per capita growth rate over the last five years for the United States was 5.83% (International Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook Database).In the face of such adversities, Goldman Sachs’ statement to Bloomberg last week, addressing emerging market stocks as world’s best bet, has created quite a stir in the investment world. According to the report, following the selloff in February and unlike other market corrections, investors are keen to put money in riskier assets of the emerging economy this time around.Although the MSCI Index has not shown any significant improvement since then, the comment by Sheila Patel, chief executive officer of International GSAM, has forced investors to think all over again before taking their assets out of this market.Going by the Bloomberg report, Goldman Sachs is particularly betting on Indian healthcare firms, Mexican consumer stocks and Argentine debt. “She expects India’s government will boost spending on public health under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. And although political risks can’t be ignored investors’ pessimism toward Mexico and Argentina is overdone”- the report says.Emerging Market Healthcare Scenario Way Better Than the United StatesWhile Patel particularly talked about the growing prospects of the Indian healthcare market, data shows that the prospects of the broader emerging market are equally encouraging. On the contrary, the healthcare scenario in the United States is muddled.A survey report by Gallup Analytics last July revealed that U.S. adults cited healthcare as the second major problem faced by the country under the new presidential administration. Following the new healthcare reform announcement in December, a Gallup poll the next month stated that the past decade marked the biggest increase in the uninsured rate. Whatever the new healthcare reform may bring in, the near-term scenario remains pretty unclear as of now.Meanwhile, with exploding population, rising middle class and increasing governmental awareness of health issues, emerging geographies are facing huge demand for modern but cheaper healthcare options. Going by a report in The Guardian, International Finance Corp’s (IFJ) data shows that developing countries account for 80% of global deaths from chronic diseases indicating enormous market opportunity.Emerging Market Openings for MedTechPer a recent BCG report, the share of emerging markets, which is currently less than a quarter of global MedTech revenues, is likely to increase to nearly one-third of revenues by 2022. The MedTech market in China, currently the second largest in the world, is projected to grow about 13% annually from 2015 through 2022. India, the fifth largest MedTech market in the world, currently records 17% annual growth. At this pace, India may emerge as a strong competitor to Japan and Germany by 2022.Among other emerging geographical regions, Latin America, even in the face of economic stagnation, holds enormous potential. Per a January 2017 report by MedTech Intelligence, Central and South American nations significantly increased per capita spending on healthcare between 2008 and 2014.Given the huge potential in these regions, long back, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) had set up manufacturing and R&D centers in India, China and Brazil. The company’s emerging markets medical device segment continues to grow three to four times faster than the developed markets.Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) continues to lead the emerging market investment trend with about 50% of sales from this region. In the recent quarters, sales in key emerging markets were up in double digits, driven by strength in BRIC as well as strong growth in several countries throughout Latin America, including Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Argentina.At Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report), in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, businesses in China, Latin America, and Southeast Asia showed sustained strength, growing in double digits. Overall, Medtronic’s long-term outlook on emerging markets is encouraging.Boston Scientific’s (BSX  -  Free Report) emerging markets’ business registered 13% organic growth in fourth-quarter 2017, reflecting a significant increase from 8% growth in 2013. Business in China was once again remarkable (up 19% year over year).ConclusionThe growth pace of the emerging market has declined from the pre-financial crisis years. However, this market has historically played a crucial role for large corporations by hedging their international trade risk.  According to a BCG report, going forward, emerging market GDP is projected to grow around 2% faster than that of developed economies. The market will account for around 40% of total consumer spending — more than $20 trillion by 2020. From an investor point of view, it will be imprudent to disregard the immense growth potential of the emerging economy due to the occasional rough spots.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

25,BSX,"The U.S. Medical Device industry has been riding high on optimism, courtesy of the Senate’s latest decision to postpone an industry-wide excise tax for another two years, known as the ‘Medical Device’ tax.Notably, the tax will be effective from on Jan 1, 2020. The bill also delays the so-called Cadillac tax, a 40% tax on employer insurance, until 2022.The repeal of the tax paradigm is expected to boost hiring and investment among the 9,000 America-based medical device manufacturers, instilling investor’s optimism in them.The Medical-Device Tax “This is a tax on innovation, a tax on jobs and a tax on the health and well-being of millions of American patients.” – Scott Whitaker, president and CEO of the Advanced Medical Technology Association.The Medical-Device taxes were originally implemented in 2013 as part of the Obamacare. The taxes imposed a 2.3% excise tax on MedTech manufacturers, reducing the research and development (R&D) prospects.Considering the headwinds, the senate placed a temporary suspension on these taxes from January 2016 to December 2017. Per data provided by the medical device trade group (in a Ken Blackwell article published by The Daily Caller), the partial two-year repeal of the MedTech tax resulted in around 83% rise in R&D investments by MedTech players.However, the taxes were again brought back on Jan 1, 2018. But on Jan 22, the Fed came with its new law of respite with a $31-billion bill of tax cuts.Why is the MedTech Fraternity Happy? Revamps R&D StatureMedTech companies will now be able to reinvest profits (tax savings) and enhance the R&D stature, launch new products, reduce capital depreciation, invest in early stage med-tech companies, execute clinical trials and ‘fuel the next generation of life-changing technologies for patients.’A report by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation suggests that big shots like Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report) expressed concern in an email statement regarding lesser investments in innovative projects with leading medical facilities if the taxes were back. EmploymentThe tax repeal is likely to reinforce domestic production, increase hiring of skilled professionals and lower the nation’s overdependence on offshore productions. Reports suggest that a complete repeal could generate more than 53,000 jobs very soon and increase wages.Per a report by Modern Healthcare, reports suggest that 28,000 jobs were lost nationally in three years in which the tax was in effect. If the taxes were reestablished, the nation might have suffered cumulative loss of 25,000 jobs by 2021.Let’s take a quick look on three major MedTech companies that are going to make the best out of the recent Tax-Repeal upheaval.3 Stocks to Ride High on the TrendsThere are hardly any evidences of MedTech companies witnessing strong R&D growth and margin expansion because of the tax-repeal in 2016. However, the market expects the recent tax-repeal to have a favorable impact on R&D and margin in the upcoming quarters. If that happens, the following three companies would be the leading ones.We have taken the help of the Zacks Stock Screener to select favorable stocks. To shortlist the stocks from the vast universe of medical devices, we have picked the ones that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Surmodics, Inc. (SRDX  -  Free Report): The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1. In the past year, the stock has returned 39.1%, higher than the industry’s return of 16.9%.Surmodics’ efforts to improve research and development stature have been a key growth driver. The company’s whole product solutions pipeline and sirolimus-based below-the-knee DCB (Drug Coated Balloon) program deserve a mention. Surmodics has been making progress using its internally developed .014 DCB balloon platformIn the non-drug delivery R&D pipeline, Surmodics received the FDA clearance for its Telemark support microcatheter. The Telemark support microcatheter offers superior crossability for complex coronary and peripheral lesions. This microcatheter combined Surmodics' extreme composite shaft technology with a high performance pristine hydrophilic coating, that together provide exceptional deliverability, kink resistance and complex lesion crossing.First quarter of fiscal 2018, R&D expenses were 46% of net sales, up from 33.6% of net sales in the year-ago quarter. Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW  -  Free Report): The stock has a Zacks Rank #2. In the past year, the stock has returned 49.1%, higher than the industry’s return of 24.7%In December 2017, Edwards Lifesciences announced a strategic framework. The outlook indicates the company’s long-term growth strategy and recent progress in technology pipeline. In THV (Transcatheter Heart Valves), Edwards Lifesciences expects to maintain its leadership in the global TAVR market through increased focus on expanding patient access.On the margin front, the company anticipates moderate expansion in gross margin on an improving mix, partially offset by capacity investments. More specifically, in terms of capacity investments, heavy investments are going into facilities and expanding the capacity in the United States and outside. Edwards Lifesciences also expects the global TAVR opportunity to exceed $5 billion by 2021. Haemonetics Corporation (HAE  -  Free Report):The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1. In the past year, the stock has returned 57.7%, higher than its industry’s return of 15%Continued momentums in new business generation and geographical expansion have helped the company deliver strong results in the quarter. The company’s strong cash position boosts investors’ confidence. The expansion in gross and operating margin buoys optimism. The raised fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings guidance is also impressive. The ParadoxNot to forget, the brunt of this tax relief is huge!A report published by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that the two-year suspension will cost the federal government about $3.7 billion during that period and $310 billion to federal-budget deficits over the next decade.Notably, the federal budget deficit reached $228 billion in the first three months of the current fiscal, $18 billion more than the deficit in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.However, Republicans spurned these concerns with the belief that tax cuts will drive faster growth and national prosperity.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more. Those gains, however, came with serious volatility and risk. Bitcoin sank 25% or more 3 times in 2017.Zacks’ has just released a new Special Report to help readers capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly.See 4 crypto-related stocks now >>

27,BSX,"Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report) recently broadened its Endoscopy portfolio with the buyout of a privately-held company — EMcision, Limited — with presence in the U.K. and Canada. Although the financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps, the company expects the deal to prove accretive to earnings post 2018.Post-acquisition, Boston Scientific’s Endoscopy portfolio will include EMcision’s FDA approved and CE Marked Habib EndoHPB probe. Notably, Habib EndoHPB probe is an innovative endoscopic bipolar radiofrequency device that coagulates tissue in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Moreover, the Habib EndoHPB probe aids in the treatment and palliative care of patients diagnosed with pancreaticobiliary cancer.A Glimpse of the Endoscopy BusinessBoston Scientific’s Endoscopy division develops and manufactures devices to treat a variety of digestive diseases, including those affecting the oesophagus, stomach, liver, pancreas, duodenum and colon. Revenues at this division rose 14.8% year over year to $436 million in the last reported quarter.The upside was driven by strength in the biliary, hemostasis and EndoChoice ambulatory surgery center portfolio. The company also witnessed organic revenue growth of 10% at the segment.  Last November, Boston Scientific completed the integration of EndoChoice into the Endoscopy business. Acquired in 2016, EndoChoice Holdings, focuses on the development and commercialization of pathology services, infection control products and single-use devices for treating a variety of gastrointestinal conditions. Thus, we believe the latest buyout will help Boston Scientific boost top-line contributions from the Endoscopy business.Market ProspectsPer a Market Data Forecast report, the global pancreatic cancer therapeutics market is projected to reach a value of $2.99 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 7.5%, during the 2016-2021 period. The upbeat prospects of the market are primarily based on rising consumption of tobacco, unhealthy lifestyle practices like smoking, an aging population and obesity.Per the company, around one million deaths annually can be attributed to pancreaticobiliary cancer globally. Thus, the addition of Habib EndoHPB probe will help Boston Scientific cash in on the abundant opportunities in the pancreatic cancer therapeutics market.Share Price MovementOver the past three months, Boston Scientific has been outperforming its industry.

29,BSX,"The transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) market, which is projected to witness CAGR of 18.3% between 2017 and 2022 (per a report by Azoth Analytics published on ReportsnReports), has been constantly under the radar of market experts, courtesy of the stir caused by one of the forerunners within this space — Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report).Last February, the company voluntarily recalled all its core Lotus Valve devices, including Lotus with Depth Guard. This dragged down its shares by 9.4% in the pre-market trading session (per an article on Medical Device and Diagnostic Industry).Sadly, again in November, Boston Scientific announced a further delay in the re-launch of the LOTUS Edge Aortic Valve System after it failed to meet the committed timeline, hurting shareholder sentiments even more. Per an article on the Medical Device and Diagnostic Industry, the company had opted out from the Piper Jaffray healthcare conference in New York on the same day, pulling down the stock by 7.5%, which was followed by a decline in its market cap by around $2.9 billion.Meanwhile, rejoicing at this situation is Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), a leading player in the TAVR market. Encouragingly, the company’s shares have soared 45.4% since Lotus Valve devices’ recall last February. Let’s take a sneak peek into what’s brewing in this market for investors who are keen to effectively put in their money in the healthcare space.The BackdropBoston Scientific has been consistently dominating headlines on developments in the Lotus Valve devices, though for all the unpleasant reasons. Last February, the company had to call back all Lotus Valve devices due to issues related with the premature release of a pin which connects Lotus Valve to the delivery system.  However, this was not the first time when the company had to face such a situation.Earlier in 2016, the company had to retract the Lotus Edge Valve system on similar grounds. Even in 2014, it had to face the brunt of the FDA’s order and withdraw 278 units of Lotus Valve from circulation in Europe, due to the Lotus Valve getting unlocked from the delivery system during release.The company has also been disappointing investors by continuously delaying the filing of the premarket approval (PMA) with FDA for the Lotus Edge Valve system.Currently, the company expects LOTUS Edge to be back in the European market not before 2019. It also intends to roll out the same in the United States in the same year.Nevertheless, some major market analysts believe such numerous product missteps have always ended up tarnishing the brand image, along with deviated customer and clinician interests.Edwards Lifesciences - Seizing the OpportunitiesWhile Boston Scientific hit a rough patch on issues surrounding its Lotus Valve devices in 2017, Edwards Lifesciences reaped the maximum benefits from its solid Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy (THVT) platform. During the company’s annual investor conference, its chairman and CEO Michael A. Mussallem noted, ""As we come to the end of 2017, our performance and accomplishments this year significantly exceeded our expectations, and we expect 2018 to be another strong year for Edwards Lifesciences.” “The primary factor driving the company’s global growth is the prospering transcatheter aortic valve therapy business,” he further asserted.In this regard, management currently projects sales of $2.1-$2.4 billion in Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy in 2018.Moreover, Edwards Lifesciences expects the global TAVR opportunity to be more than $5 billion by 2021. And to make the most of it, the company has been firing on all cylinders, lately.In line with this, Edwards Lifesciences has its near-term product pipeline on track. It expects that the new SAPIEN 3 Ultra system, featuring an on-balloon delivery system and next-generation sheath technology, will be launched in the United States and Europe later this year. Also, the company anticipates to begin the U.S. pivotal trial for the CE Marked CENTERA valve system in 2018. Furthermore, Edwards Lifesciences expects results from its PARTNER 3 trial of the SAPIEN 3 valve to be presented at ACC 2019, followed by the FDA’s approval later that year.We note that some market speculators believe Edwards Lifesciences’ solid global presence, particularly in high-potential regions like Europe and Japan, along with delay in the comeback of some key competitive products like Boston Scientific’s Lotus Valve, will help the company further cement its hold in the highly potential TAVR space.Other Major Players Riding the Gains Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report), with its CoreValve Evolut TAVR platform comprising the CoreValve, CoreValve Evolut R and the CoreValve Evolut PRO systems, has well maintained the company’s position as a formidable player in the TAVR space. Per an article by Reuters, shares of Medtronic had inched up 1% on Boston Scientific’s announcement of the withdrawal of Lotus Valve devices, last February. Notably, the company recorded TAVR growth in the mid-20s in the United States and low 40s in international markets, in the last reported quarter.Furthermore, post the acquisition of St. Jude Medical in 2017, Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) integrated the popular CE Marked Portico TAVR of the former into its Structural Heart portfolio and is expected to gain momentum in this space.Boston Scientific — A Rebound in the Cards?As Winston Churchill had rightly said,“All men make mistakes, but only wise men learn from their mistakes.”Unwilling to let go of the bountiful opportunities in the TAVR market, Boston Scientific acquired Symetis SA, a structural heart company focused on minimally-invasive TAVR devices, in 2017. The company has started selling ACURATE neo Aortic Valve in Europe. It is also working on designing the ACURATE neo 2 Aortic Valve System equipped with an enhanced outer sealing skirtfeature.Moreover, Boston Scientific is looking forward to leveraging on its existing LOTUS infrastructure to enhance the ACURATE neo AS Valve system through better field support, geographic expansion and next-generation products. The company plans to invest in the United States and Japan trials as well.Will ACURATE Replace Lotus?However, several opinions have been making rounds in the TAVR space, of late.  Some market experts believe the company will eventually replace the Lotus Valve devices with the Symetis’ portfolio, while others speculate that the deal has been clinched to cushion it from the jitters which might stem from the Lotus Valve devices’ withdrawal. A few analysts are also of the opinion that Boston Scientific expended the huge amount on the Symetis buyout deal to use it as a contingency plan in case the Lotus Valve device issue remains unresolved.Nonetheless, dismissing all such speculations, Boston Scientific has been consistently emphasizing on the Symetis acquisition as a move to broaden its TAVR suite and not a replacement of Lotus Valve devices.To end all speculations, let’s wait and watch to find out whether or not Boston Scientific’s Lotus (valve) will find the right weather to bloom again.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

30,BSX,"Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) recently presented favorable real-world data from the TRUE-HD study at the annual congress of the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA). This latest move is in line with the company’s strategy to gain traction in the global Electrophysiology (EP) market, which is poised to reach a value of around $4.73 billion by 2019 (as per data by Markets and Markets).Study Results in DetailThe observational, prospective, non-randomized study — TRUE-HD study — covered 572 patients suitable for cardiac mapping and ablation for treating arrhythmia. However, the patients diagnosed with de novo atrial fibrillation were not enrolled under the study.Notably, the TRUE-HD study evaluated the procedural process, acute success and safety for the mapping and ablation of various clinical arrhythmias.Per the company, the study results displayed the safety and efficacy of RHYTHMIA Mapping System when used with INTELLAMAP ORION Mapping Catheter for mapping and supporting the treatment of different types of arrhythmias. Also, it included the cases where ablation of atrial fibrillation based on other techniques was a failure. RHYTHMIA Mapping Systemis a catheter-based, 3D cardiac mapping and navigation solution for helping in diagnosing and treating different types of arrhythmias.  A Glimpse of the EP BusinessBoston Scientific’s EP business develops less-invasive medical technologies to diagnose and treat disorders of heart rate and rhythm.Revenues at this division in fourth-quarter 2017 improved 20.7% year over year to $77 million (up 17.7% at CER). The upside was driven by higher uptake of the new RHYTHMIA HDx platform. Management continues to roll out the HDx platform in Europe and recently launched it in the United States as well as Japan.Overall, the company continues to expand the toolkit that supports RHYTHMIA HDx, providing ablation technologies that match the excellence of its Mapping System. Additionally, it focuses on adding tools that expand the reach and utility of RHYTHMIA HDx in different procedures. In this regard, Boston Scientific expects the full-fledged commercialization of DirectSense technology in Europe and the United States in 2018 followed by a successful initial launch in Europe.Moreover, in order to expand its EP business, Boston Scientific acquired Apama Medical Inc in October 2017. The company also intends to integrate its RHYTHMIA HDx Mapping System with Apama RF balloon system to improve the visualization of the heart during ablation processes.Market PotentialBoston Scientific’s strategy to boost the EP business seems to be aligned with data provided by Allied Market Research.  Per the report, the global Cardiac Monitoring and Cardiac Rhythm Management market is expected to see a CAGR of 7.6% from 2016 to 2022 to reach a value of $32,216 million.We believe that unhealthy lifestyle and a rise in aging population should continue to result in high incidence of cardiovascular diseases. This is further supported by data provided by GBI Research. Per the report, the global cardiovascular disease market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 4.1% by 2019, and within this space, the U.S. market is expected to witness the highest momentum at a CAGR of 4.7%.Share Price PerformanceBoston Scientific has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results.

31,BSX,"On Feb 4, 2018, we issued an updated research report on leading medical devices company, Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Notably, the U.S. House and Senate’s decision to suspend the medical device tax for another two years has come as a breath of fresh air to medical device mammoths like Boston Scientific. Per the company, this temporary suspension will in turn allow it to continue with its plans for investing in innovative medical products. Meanwhile, the company is intent on working toward complete repeal of the MedTech tax.We are also encouraged by Boston Scientific’s major investment in Santa Rosa, CA-based Millipede. This move is expected to consolidate the company’s position in the growing field of mitral regurgitation (MR) falling under its structural heart business. Millipede is the developer of IRIS Transcatheter Annuloplasty Ring System for treatment of severe MR. On a positive note, the product claims to be highly customizable to a specific patient's anatomy and disease state.This apart, a gradually improving foreign exchange scenario has started to contribute to the company’s overall top-line performance. The promising 2018 view is also impressive.On the flip side, declining worldwide pacemaker sales over the recent past continued to weigh on Boston Scientific's CRM (Customer Relationship Management) results. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company witnessed a high single-digit decline in pacemaker performance due to tough comparisons drawn with stronger revenues reaped after the U.S. launch of the company’s Brady MRI linepost in April 2016. Although of late, the company has taken several measures to rebound this trend, the near-term outlook still looks bleak.Additionally, the fate of Lotus valve issue seems in limbo for some more time for Boston Scientific as recently, the company announced a further delay in its earlier-reported timelines for the commercial return of the LOTUS Edge Aortic Valve System in Europe and the United States, following the product’s voluntary recall last February. In sync with the above downtrends, Boston Scientific has been trading below the broader industry over the past three months. The stock has lost 5.5% compared with the broader industry's 3% rise in the period.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Abiomed (ABMD  -  Free Report), athenahealth (ATHN  -  Free Report) and Cardinal Health (CAH  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Abiomed has an expected long-term growth rate of 31.5%.

32,BSX,"Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) posted adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 34 cents in the fourth quarter of 2017, up 13.3% from the year-ago quarter. The figure remained in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and fell within the company's guided range of 32-35 cents for adjusted EPS.The adjustments take into consideration the estimated net income tax charge related to the deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by the benefit related to the re-measurement of the company's deferred taxes arising from a lower U.S. corporate tax rate.Without these adjustments, the company reported a loss of 45 cents per share compared with EPS of 9 cents in the year-ago period.For the full year, adjusted EPS came in at $1.26, a 13.5% increase from the year-ago number. However, this was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The full-year adjusted EPS also remains within the company’s projected band of $1.24-$1.27.Revenues in DetailRevenues in the fourth quarter were up 9.9% year over year on a reported basis and up 8.1% on operational basis (at constant exchange rate or CER) to $2.41 billion.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year revenues is pegged at $9.1 billion, below the guided range.Adjusted EPS guidance for 2018 is issued in the range of $1.35-$1.39. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.37 is within this guided band.The company also provided its first-quarter 2018 financial outlook. Adjusted earnings are expected in the band of 30-32 cents per share on revenues of $2.320-$2.350 billion. The consensus mark for EPS stands at 31 cents while for revenues, $2.29 billion.Our TakeBoston Scientific posted a mixed fourth-quarter performance with earnings in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues, ahead of the mark. However, balanced growth across all business lines and geographies were impressive. Also, a gradually improving foreign exchange scenario has also started to contribute to the company’s overall topline performance. The promising 2018 view is all the more encouraging and indicative of this overall bullish trend to continue in the near term.Boston Scientific is leaving no stone unturned to strengthen its core businesses and invest in new technologies as well as global markets, accounting for higher sales across all its geographies in the fourth quarter. We are also optimistic about the company gaining a number of product approvals both in the domestic and overseas markets.Among the recent developments, worth mentioning are the FDA approvals for the company’s Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation System (to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease) and the Spectra WaveWriter Spinal Cord Stimulator System (to simultaneously provide paresthesia-based and sub-perception therapy). The company has also invested in Millipede, a privately-held company having developed the IRIS Transcatheter Annuloplasty Ring System for treating severe mitral regurgitation.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBoston Scientific carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

33,BSX,"Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) has recently announced a major investment in Santa Rosa, CA-based Millipede, Inc., to augment its position in the field of mitral regurgitation (MR). Millipede is the developer of IRIS Transcatheter Annuloplasty Ring System for the treatment of severe MR.Per the terms of the agreement, Boston Scientific has purchased a portion of Millipede for $90 million. The company has also kept an option to acquire the remaining shares of Millipede at any point of time prior to the completion of a first-in-human clinical study that meets certain parameters.Also, Millipede has the option to compel Boston Scientific to purchase its remaining shares upon the closure of the clinical study. The full buyout of Millipede needs additional $325 million payment by Boston Scientific and a further $125 million will be paid upon achievement of a commercial milestone.In this regard, management noted that MR occurs by a leaking mitral valve causing blood to regurgitate from the left ventricle to the left atrium of the heart. This condition can gradually lead to heart failure and heart rhythm problems. Patients with severe MR often complain of compromised heart functions and  cannot tolerate open-heart surgery for the repair or replacement of the leaking valve.Management is optimistic  about the large patient population in this space, which is  unfortunately underserved at the moment. Hence, this area represents a lucrative market to be tapped into. This patient population could benefit from a fully-percutaneous transcatheter procedure that can fix the dilated mitral annulus and reduce regurgitation without undergoing surgery.Encouragingly, the Millipede IRIS annuloplasty ring claims to be highly customizable to a specific patient's anatomy and disease state. This device is supplied via a transcatheter-transseptal delivery system and follows the standard surgical approach to mend and decrease the size of a dilated mitral annulus.On a positive note, the global transcatheter mitral valve replacement market is growing stupendously at a CAGR of approximately 22% over 2016-2020, as per the data provided by Technavio.Apart from Boston Scientific, other major players in this field are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) and Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report).Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

34,BSX,"Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results before the opening bell on Feb 1.Last quarter, the company delivered earnings in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the average trailing four-quarter beat is pegged at 0.84%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Preliminary ResultsOn Jan 9, Boston Scientific announced an upbeat fourth-quarter 2017 preliminary sales performance. Year over year, preliminary net sales for the quarter has been forecast at $2.41 billion, up 9.9% on a reported basis, 8.1% on an operational basis (at constant exchange rate or CER) and approximately, 6.8% on an organic basis. This reported preliminary revenue figure lies above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.35 billion.Notably, organic revenue growth excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as well as sales from the recent acquisitions of EndoChoice Holdings and Symetis SA.For 2017, the company has announced preliminary net sales of $9.05 billion, reflecting 7.9% growth on a reported basis, 7.8% increase on operational basis and a 6.6% rise on an organic basis compared with the prior-year number. The company’s preliminary tally again compares favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.99 billion.Key CatalystsBoston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Scientific Corporation Quote We are optimistic about the company’s gradually improving performance in Interventional Cardiology (IC), led by an innovative portfolio and robust commercial teams, globally. More specifically, the company has of late successfully gained within this business on strong sales of WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device and its portfolio of complex PCI products.The WATCHMAN platform is expected to experience another excellent quarter on consistent global momentum as Boston Scientific’s multiple market development efforts continue to push for growth. In this regard, Medicare reimbursement rates for DRG 274 increased by an average of 10.6% effective Oct 1, under which, 93% of WATCHMAN implants fall.All these developments are expected to have significantly boosted the IC business in the fourth quarter itself. The company earlier stated that it expects to end 2017 with more than 375 accounts implanting WATCHMAN and increased reorder rates in previously opened accounts.However, ahead of the company’s earnings release for the fourth quarter, we believe its IC business to be grossly impacted by the product recall issue within Europe. Notably, in February 2017, the company recalled one of its prime products, the Lotus range of heart devices from Europe, due to device malfunctions. The company also delayed submission of its U.S. marketing application for its Lotus Edge device.Recently, the company has announced a further delay in its earlier-reported timelines for the commercial return of the LOTUS Edge Aortic Valve System in Europe as well as the United States. Notably, while recalling the product last February, Boston Scientific announced the expected time of reintroduction of the LOTUS Edge delivery system in Europe by the first quarter of 2018. The company also expected to file the final Pre-Market Approval (PMA) module with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by January 2018.However, per the latest press release, the company is likely to provide a further update on the status of the LOTUS Edge Valve on Feb 1, 2018. This delay has been justified by Boston Scientific citing its continuous focus on manufacturing and regulatory milestones to support the long-term success of the Lotus platform. The company stated that it is working hard to implement necessary modifications in the device to pass the internal quality standards.However, this extra delay might lead to a further setback for the company’s fast-growing transcatheter aortic valve replacement business within the IC in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter IC revenues is pegged at $622 million, a 6.3% higher than the year-ago reported number of $585 million.Other Factors at PlayAmong the segments, MedSurg is estimated to demonstrate a steady performance, led by endoscopy. Urology and Women’s Health are also projected to grow beyond market levels, driven by investment strategies in key international geographies.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter endoscopy revenues is pegged at $417 million, 9.7% above the prior-year quarter’s reported count of $380 million. For Urology and Women’s Health, the consensus mark of $303 million remains 10.5% ahead of the year-earlier quarter’s reported tally of $274 million.On the flip side, severe currency headwinds that Boston Scientific has been facing of late remain a concern. In fact, as the company records 47% of its sales from the international markets, it gets highly exposed to currency fluctuations. For the full year, Boston Scientific predicts an unfavorable foreign exchange challenge to the tune of 700 basis points or 8 cents per share on earnings.Here’s What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Boston Scientific does not have the right combination of the two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Boston Scientific has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult.

35,BSX,"Boston Scientific Corporation’s (BSX  -  Free Report) successful result from its WHISPER randomized controlled trial (RCT) further boosts its neuromodulation business. This announcement follows the recent FDA approval of Spectra WaveWriter Spinal Cord Stimulator System (SCS) within the neuromodulation arm.Presented at the North American Neuromodulation Society in Las Vegas, The WHISPER RCT is a multi-center, prospective, cross-over, randomized and controlled study, evaluating the long-term safety and effectiveness of SCS therapy. The data demonstrated that when both sub-perception and paresthesia-based SCS therapies are utilized as a combined therapy regimen for chronic pain relief, it delivers superior outcomes in comparison to patients with a single SCS therapeutic option.Notably, SCS technology sends low electrical pulses in varied frequency, pulse width and amplitude to the spinal cord to interrupt pain signals. While paresthesia-based therapy provides pain relief with a light tingling sensation, sub-perception therapy works without it.Per Boston Scientific, this study provides favorable data on people, suffering from chronic pain for years and also exposed to the challenges of long-term usage of SCS. Management stated, “if patients are able to choose between the SCS therapy that provides the most effective pain relief, the number of subjects whose pain was effectively controlled by SCS increased by 62%”.The results also demonstrated that lending patients with the choice to use sub-perception or paresthesia-based therapy, provides superior patient outcomes and affirms that SCS is a clinically valuable treatment option.In this regard, it is encouraging to note that this study result remains well-aligned with the company’s latest FDA approved SCS system — Spectra WaveWriter. The company claims that this latest technology effectively enables physicians and patients to combine therapeutic options, customize therapies and capture the real-time feedback to treat chronic and debilitating pain besides addressing individual distinctive pain-relief needs.With Spectra WaveWriter System at its disposal, Boston Scientific can certainly vouch for the fact that patients may easily combine both paresthesia-based and sub-perception therapies to target one specific area of pain. Also, they can provide a real-time feedback using the system's remote control.Per data provided by Markets and Markets, the global neuromodulation market is projected to reach $6.20 billion by 2020 from $3.65 billion in 2015 at a CAGR of 11.2%. Boston Sciebntfic earlier noted that more than 100 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, thereby making it the prime cause of disability in adults in the United States. The company’s commitment to invest in research and expansion of treatment options for chronic pain by identifying new, non-opioid solutions like the SCS appears to be perfectly strategic.Share Price Movement Boston Scientific has been outperforming the broader industry over the past 30 days. The stock has gained 6.6% compared with the broader industry's 3.4% growth.Stocks to ConsiderBoston Scientific carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) and Molina Healthcare Inc. (MOH  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Bio-Rad has a whopping expected growth rate of 141.5% for the first quarter of 2018. The stock has jumped 35%, surpassing the broader industry over a year.Centene has an expected long-term growth rate of 14%. The stock’s performance on the bourses has been solid in a year’s time with a high return of 70.4%.For 2018, Molina Healthcare has a sturdy projected growth rate of 178.6%. In the last three months, the stock has surged 37.8%, higher than the broader industry’s rally of 17.9%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

36,BSX,"The year 2018 may bring ample reasons for Americans to cheer from the standpoint of the latest Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was finally signed by the President on Dec 22. Effective Jan 1, there are seven income tax brackets with five offering reduced tax rates. Corporate tax rates too have been slashed to 21% from 35% earlier. This apart, the new legislation has almost doubled the standard deduction.While the nation is delighted with these huge tax slashes, economists are quite apprehensive that its damage to the healthcare community will be realized before long. Going by a Vox article, “The bill also includes tax cuts so large that they would trigger across-the-board spending cuts — including billions for Medicare. The last time Medicare was a hit with cuts like this, patients lost access to critical services like chemotherapy treatment.”The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) apprehends that if it doesn’t find any alternative to meet the fiscal deficit from the huge tax cut, automatic cuts worth $136 billion from mandatory spending in 2018, including $25 billion in Medicare cuts, may be triggered.Not only that, the latest law also repeals the individual mandate, which is an essential part of Obamacare proving health coverage to majority of Americans. CBO expects 13 million people to drop their plans with this repeal. As per the Vox article, care for the elderly will be disrupted, bringing about erratic changes in the health care system.Device Tax Back in 2018 -- Serious Threat to MedTechWithin the MedTech space, the situation is all the more grave. The medical device community was earlier extremely hopeful about Trump’s regulatory agenda as it had promised the complete abolition of the infamous 2.3% medical device tax that was first included in the 2010 health care reform law.The dreaded tax, imposed on the selling price instead of net profit and amounting to a stupendous sum, wiped out almost a quarter of the profits for medical technology companies.As per an article published on LA Times, “In Congress, it [Device Tax] was unpopular not only with Republicans, but with many Democrats from states such as Massachusetts and Minnesota, which have large numbers of medical device companies.” Realizing this, the U.S. House and Senate temporarily suspended it for two years at the beginning of 2015.Going by the available data, it is quite evident that this partial two-year repeal of the medical device tax has benefited the sector’s overall development. Per data provided by the medical device trade group (in a Ken Blackwell article published by The Daily Caller), within this period, there was a roughly 83% rise in research and development (R&D) investments by MedTech players.The temporary suspension however had taken into account the expectation that the government will permanently put an end to this tax before 2018. Obviously, this is not going to happen.Undoubtedly, its comeback will be an additional burden on the MedTech fraternity, largely discouraging R&D activities. Per the LA Times article, AdvaMed and the Medical Imaging & Technology Alliance warn that the tax will take a $20-billion bite out of the medical device industry over the next decade.3 Medtech Stocks to be Affected Most by Tax BackPer an article by Matt Murphy in wbur, sectors that are likely to be hampered the most by the re-imposition of this levy are X-ray and MRI machines, surgical instruments and pacemakers. In such a tumultuous scenario, we have handpicked three MedTech bigwigs that are playing majorly in these controversial sectors with hefty investments each year, and are hence over-exposed to a significant level of risk associated with the tax reinstatement.Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report)Medical device mammoth and a leading player in the field of heart stent, Boston Scientific’s unimpressive pacemaker performance within the core CRM has been a drag in the recent past. According to a USA Today article, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company estimates that the reinstatement of the tax will cost the firm $75 million in 2018. Boston Scientific stated that, post the temporary suspension of the tax, it invested the savings in projects including a partnership with Mayo Clinic that combines manufacturing expertise with ideas for advanced medical device products. However, the reinstatement of this 2.3% tax hints at continued investments in programs like these.Boston Scientific Corporation Price Boston Scientific Corporation Price | Boston Scientific Corporation QuoteStryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report)This giant orthopedic device maker is facing hiccups in 2018 with the reintroduction of the device tax. The company, while recently announcing its preliminary 2017 sales numbers, stated that with respect to the U.S. tax reform, its anticipates a modest headwind in 2018.

Earlier, a report by FierceMedical Device revealed that, in 2014, before the temporary suspension of the deal, Smith & Nephew shelled out $25 million as medical device tax.However, post the suspension of the tax, this company has accelerated investments in product development and manufacturing with the rescued money. The reinstatement will definitely act as a hindrance in the path of Smith & Nephew’s new-age innovations and developments. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #4.Smith & Nephew SNATS, Inc.

37,BSX,"Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report) stock gained 8.33% to $27.96 at Jan 9’s close of trading, following the company’s announcement of an upbeat fourth-quarter 2017 preliminary sales performance. Notably, Boston Scientific is slated to release fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Feb 1, before the market opens.Year over year, preliminary net sales for the quarter has been forecast at $2.41 billion, up 9.9% on a reported basis, 8.1% on an operational basis (at constant exchange rate or CER) and approximately, 6.8% on an organic basis. This reported preliminary revenue figure lies above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.35 billion.Notably, organic revenue growth excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as well as sales from the recent acquisitions of EndoChoice Holdings and Symetis SA.For 2017, the company has announced preliminary net sales of $9.05 billion, reflecting 7.9% growth on a reported basis, 7.8% increase on operational basis and a 6.6% rise on an organic basis compared with the prior-year number. The company’s preliminary figure again compares favourably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.99 billion.Boston Scientific has three global reportable segments: Cardiovascular, Rhythm Management and MedSurg.The company generates maximum revenues from its Cardiovascular segment. Per the fourth-quarter preliminary performance, sales from its subsegments, Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions, are up 6.9% year over year and 6.7%, year over year on operational basis, respectively.The second largest contributor to Boston Scientific's top line has been Rhythm Management, including Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) and Electrophysiology. While CRM reflects a 1.2% year-over-year increase in sales on an operational basis, Electrophysiology sales have shot up 17.7% year over year on an operational basis.Other segments like Endoscopy, Urology and Pelvic Health plus Neuromodulation (under the MedSurg broader group) also record operational sales growth of 13.1%, 11.3% and 14.6%, respectively.Share Price PerformanceIn the past three months, Boston Scientific has been trading below the broader industry. The stock has lost 4.5% compared with the broader industry's 6.2% gain during the period.  Significantly, Boston Scientific's unimpressive pacemaker performance within the core CRM continues to remain a drag. Also, based on the recent announcement, a further delay in relaunching the earlier-recalled Lotus range of heart devices is expected to hamper sales in 2018 as well.However, a promising 2017 sales announcement is likely to revive the growth trend to a great extent.We believe that an improving foreign exchange scenario has already started to drive the company’s overall top line. It is also important to note that the company is leaving no stone unturned to strengthen its core business and invest more in the global markets.Zacks Ranks & Key PicksBoston Scientific carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) and Exelixis Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Bio-Rad has a projected long-term growth rate of 25%. The stock has rallied 13.4% in the last six months, outperforming the industry’s rise of 6.9%.Centene has an expected growth rate of 16.4% for 2018. Over the last 30 days, the stock has gained 6.2%, higher than the broader industry’s increase of 1.5%.Exelixis has an impressive growth rate of 120% for the first quarter of 2018. The stock has soared 64.6% against the industry’s decline of 0.9% in a year.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

38,BSX,"Asia-Pacific, or APAC, is home to more than half of the world's population, so demand for healthcare is also exceptionally high in the region. Furthermore, the need for cutting-edge MedTech products and services is significantly high across the world, with APAC being no exception.In fact, a research report by McKinsey shows that APAC is expected to outpace the European Union as the world’s second-largest MedTech market pretty soon (after the United States). Almost 1.1 billion people in the region are expected to enter the 50-plus age group by 2025, indicating emerging demand for healthcare needs. Also, APAC accounts for two-thirds of the global disease burden.Further, a research report by Statista shows that the MedTech market in the Asia-Pacific region is estimated to reach nearly $78 billion in 2018.Trump’s Focus on AsiaWith the above data pointing toward the huge and unmet healthcare needs within the APAC market, investors may find President Trump’s recent 12-day long Asia trip (with stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines) to be a positive sign.Furthermore, his recent tweet – “Our great country is respected again in Asia. You will see the fruits of our long but successful trip for many years to come!”–is indicative of a favorable Republican stance on APAC, especially with respect to business and trade.Here we take a sneak peek at two major postulates of Trump’s recent Asia visit:Bilateral Trade AgreementTrump’s promise to augment bilateral trade agreements with Indo-Pacific nations instills our confidence in his APAC policies. However, Trump specifically mentioned that these agreements are bound to follow the ""principles of fair and reciprocal trade."" He also voiced for “free and open Indo-Pacific trade,” emphasizing on increased focus in the nations of Japan, Australia, and India.Prospects in China“Pacific is big enough to accommodate both China and the United States,” said China’s President Xi Jinping during Trump’s visit.China undoubtedly poses serious competitive threat to the United States, not just in the healthcare space, but also in electronic, semiconductors, retail, and other areas. Jinping’s statements clearly hint at the possibility of the countries coexisting peacefully despite the political tensions. This might also be indicative of strategic mergers between companies in the two nations in order to enhance trade practices.MedTech Companies Eye APACConsidering Trump’s growing focus on APAC, the region seems to be poised to yield accretive returns in the long term. In fact, stakeholders in the medical universe have been eyeing the emerging market over the last couple of years. These companies are bullish on the growing medical awareness, economic prosperity, an aging population, increasing wealth, government focus on healthcare infrastructure, and the expansion of medical insurance coverage in the APAC space.Meanwhile, despite the health-policy debacle in the United States and deteriorating economic conditions in Europe, we can conclude that growth in the emerging markets of China, India, Japan, and others will bolster the global foothold for MedTech companies. Below, we take a look at four leading MedTech players that are tapping into and also gaining from the bountiful opportunities in the APAC market:Baxter International (BAX  -  Free Report)Baxter’s solid presence in Asia, precisely in India, is worth a mention; the company has research hubs in Japan and China. In the just-reported third quarter, Baxter completed the acquisition of India-based Claris Injectables, a global generic injectables pharmaceutical company, for almost $625 million. In December 2016, Baxter had initiated the agreement. Per management, the acquisition will bolster Baxter’s foothold in the generic pharmaceuticals space. In the second quarter of 2017, Baxter signed an agreement with India-based Dorizoe Lifesciences for the expansion of its generic injectables pipeline. Further, Baxter’s strong presence in peritoneal dialysis, nutrition, IV fluids, and anesthesia gases fortifies its footprint in China.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has had an impressive run on the bourses in the last two years. The stock has returned 70.6%, significantly higher than the broader industry’s gain of 16.2%.  BostonScientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report)An important part of Boston Scientific’s growth strategy is to continue pursuing development opportunities outside the United States.In the just-reported third-quarter 2017, business from the emerging markets registered an 18% organic growth rate. It remained above the company’s target of reaching 15% of sales by 2017 (from 8% in 2013). Business in China was also remarkable (up 23% year-over-year). The company is currently looking forward to an improved performance in China, banking on the recent approval of SYNERGY.Boston Scientific is also optimistic about its core cardiology segment, which is gradually stabilizing with growth in the BRIC nations. The cardiology capacity in China is expected to double by 2017-end. In India, business is projected to grow more than 15% annually.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has yielded a stellar return of 59.3% in the last two years, way ahead of the broader industry’s 16.2% over the same time frame. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.  Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG  -  Free Report)Intuitive Surgical’s growing interest in the emerging markets, specifically in the APAC region, bodes well. Over the last couple of years, the company’s procedure performance in Asia showed continued strength, with solid growth in China, Japan, and Korea. In the just-reported third quarter, Intuitive Surgical’s system placements included 14 in Japan, five in India, four in New Mexico, and one in China.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has returned 135.4% over the last two years, much higher than the broader industry’s 25% during the same period.  Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report)Becton, Dickinson and Company, or BD, is focused on geographical expansion in overseas markets, and in particular, emerging nations. We note that the company is especially focused on broader emerging markets like India and China, which are seeing rapid growth in economic and healthcare sectors. We believe that significant emerging market exposure will boost the company’s top line, which in turn should lead to accelerated EPS growth.BD revenues grew 6.9% in the just-reported fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Emerging market revenues grew a strong 12.7% year-over-year in the quarter at constant currency, driven by strong performance in greater Asia and China, where revenues saw double digit growth.This leading player in the MedTech space is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock has returned 45.1% in the last two years, much higher than the broader industry’s growth of 10%.  The ParadoxHowever, Trump’s ‘Americafirst!’ pitch at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, or APEC, which was held in Vietnam (November 6-11), has been a serious threat to U.S. multilateral trade. It has been clearly portrayed that Trump’s primary focus was, is, and will be the betterment of the United States.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

We are also encouraged with the company gaining a number of approvals for its products, both in the domestic and overseas markets.Among the recent developments, worth mentioning is the company's recent acquisition of Apama Medical, the developer of the single-shot Apama Radiofrequency (RF) Balloon Catheter System for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.This apart, the company received an FDA approval forMRI labeling and announced the U.S. launch of the Resonate family of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) systems.

40,BSX,"President Donald Trump’s calling off of the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last Thursday was quite a shocker.The abandonement of summit plans dealt a blow to the underpenetrated and emerging markets of Asia, which are a solid source of revenues for more than 80% of U.S.-based multinational companies. The effects of the political mayhem caused the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, South Korea’s KOSPI and Japan’s Nikkei to plummet.Major Wall Street indices, S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, lost ground as well.Considering this trend of downward movements, the White House decided to conduct the meeting. The United States announced its plans to send a “pre-advance team” to Singapore to prepare for Trump-Kim summit on Jun 12.MedTech appears to be one of the very few sectors that might shelter investors from the political tension. Shrugging off the current volatility, the Medical-Products industry has returned 0.2% since the call-off against the S&P 500’s fall of 0.4%. In fact, analysts believe that the MedTech sector will be able to strengthen its foothold at a faster rate if the meeting goes on as planned.This is because there are a number of U.S.-based MedTech companies operating in Asia. Post the success of the summit, these companies will be able to spread their network in North Korea and augment overall production. Per research by Statista, the MedTech market in the Asia-Pacific region is estimated to reach a worth of around $78 billion in 2018.Buoyed by the encouraging projections, it would rather be interesting to see how the Medical-Product companies are placed amid the political turmoil.4 MedTech Stocks to GainMeanwhile, the Medical-Product companies have already been gaining from organic growth, R&D innovation, higher consolidation, tax abolition as well as focus on emerging markets including Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam, India, Philippines and more.In fact, stakeholders in the medical universe have been eyeing these markets over the last couple of years. These companies are bullish about growing medical awareness, economic prosperity, an aging population, increasing wealth, government’s focus on healthcare infrastructure and expansion of medical insurance coverage in the APAC space.Below, we take a look at four leading MedTech players that are gaining from the prospects in the APAC market:Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report), popularly known as BD, particularly focuses on broader emerging markets like India, China, Brazil and Turkey, whose economic and healthcare sectors are growing rapidly. In particular, safety-engineered products continue to drive growth in the emerging markets. We believe that exposure in these markets will boost the top line, which in turn will accelerate EPS growth.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have returned 16.2% in a year, significantly higher than the S&P 500 index’s gain of 11.4%.Baxter International’s (BAX  -  Free Report) solid presence in Asia, precisely India, is worth a mention. The company has research hubs in Japan and China. Recently, Baxter completed the acquisition of India-based Claris Injectables, a global generic injectables pharmaceutical company, for almost $625 million.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has outperformed the S&P 500 index in a year’s time. The stock has returned 21%. Intuitive Surgical Inc’s (ISRG  -  Free Report) growing interest in the emerging markets, specifically in the APAC region, bodes well. In the past two years, the company’s procedure performance in Asia projected consistent strength. The company registered solid growth in China, Japan and Korea.The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s shares have returned 49.1% in a year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Boston Scientific Corporation’s (BSX  -  Free Report) growth strategy comprises the pursuit of development opportunities outside the United Station through strengthening of global presence, inclusive of emerging markets. Against the backdrop of flattening or declining sales growth in developed markets like the United States and Europe, Boston Scientific is fortifying its foothold in the emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC).In first-quarter 2018, business from the emerging markets registered 17% growth. Business in China was once again remarkable (up 23% year over year). The company is currently projecting an improvement in performance in China banking on the recent approval of SYNERGY.This Zacks Rank #2 stock has returned 11.7% in a year. Things to Remember“Things are not so easy as they appear to be!”Americans should never forget that former president George W. Bush referred North Korea as an ‘Axis of evil,’ as it sponsored terrorism and had solid access to nuclear weapons.Further, North Korea's multiple trials of nuclear warheads have dampened the inter-country relationship. Analysts believe that an unforeseen summit may not solve these age-old problems. Further, no one can guarantee that Kim Jong Un’s ‘tremendous anger and open hostility’ will not offend Trump anymore as it did last week.However, Trump’s team is expecting to reach an agreement to settle the North Korean nuclear and other issues in the meeting.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

Solid performance in Subscription revenues has been a key catalyst.

We are encouraged by Veeva Systems’ consistent efforts in product innovation and launches through R&D. Growing global demand for cloud-based vault applications also boost opportunities.On the flip side, high expenses on the operational side are causing a drag on the company’s margins, partially dampening its revenues. Furthermore, intense competition and a saturating life sciences market are key concerns. Volatility in foreign currency exchange rate is a headwind.Q1 Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space which reported solid earnings this season are Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report), Varian Medical Systems, Inc (VAR  -  Free Report) and Intuitive Surgical, Inc (ISRG  -  Free Report).Intuitive Surgical reported adjusted earnings of $2.44 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22.6%.

44,BSX,"The equity markets continued to breathe easy as the U.S.-China trade concerns abated with President Trump pledging support for the beleaguered Chinese telecom firm, ZTE, and the Qualcomm-NXP merger review process getting a roll-on with urgency from the top administration of China. Although apprehensions related to the U.S. pullout from the Iran nuclear deal remained a subtle threat, overall markets appeared to be headed for a smooth sail.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Parameters Used for ScreeningIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE more than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 17 stocks that qualified the screen:General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report): Founded in 1908, Detroit, MI-based General Motors is a leading global automotive firm.

47,BSX,"The latest Earnings Preview depicts a bullish run in the ongoing reporting cycle. Till Oct 20, 87 S&P 500 members (24.7% of the total market cap) reported their numbers. Total earnings for these members have gone up 9.4% on 7.3% higher revenues.However, investors are concerned about the Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) that saw a lot of struggle during the first nine months of the year, thanks to the political change and the ongoing policy-restructuring related battle.The ensuing lack of visibility has roiled the favorable trend that this sector maintained in the trailing few quarters. For the third quarter, the expected earnings growth rate stands at a mere 2.2% on a 4.8% revenue-growth projection. In comparison, the second-quarter earnings growth was quite impressive at 7% on 4.4% revenue growth.What’s in Store for the Medical Product Space?While twists and turns continue to unfold at Capitol Hill, the scenario within the Medical - Products space, an important part of the medical device subcategory within the broader Medical sector, is getting gloomier. The latest executive order released by the Republicans points to a shrinking customer base, indicating a cut in demand for expensive medical procedures and devices. This may lead to major supply/demand disequilibrium within this space.However, major medical device players have been pinning hopes on the abolition of the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax, though its elimination is far from reality.Considering these tax issues, investors interested in the Medical Product space eagerly await earnings reports of MedTech bigwigs throughout this week.

While the downbeat IC business tangled under product recall issue will possibly gain some boost from the company’s recent $435 million acquisition of Switzerland-based Symetis SA, a full recovery may take time.

48,BSX,"The Q3 earnings season had kick-started last week with results from 87 S&P 500 participants (24.7% of the total market cap) having been reported so far. We observed the S&P 500 index to have made a pretty good opening with respect to both earnings and revenue growth. Per the latest Earnings Preview, till Oct 20, 2017, total earnings for these members went up 9.4% on 7.3% higher revenues.With 180 S&P 500 members lining up for releasing their quarterly results this week, we are decidedly bullish about the equity market scenario, gradually demonstrating an improvement from the sequentially last quarter.A Look at MedTech Space Within Medical SectorWhile overall growth has been steadily accelerating from the preceding few quarters’ performances, investors are concerned about the Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) that has seen a lot of struggle during the past half year, thanks to the political power change and the ongoing policy restructuring related battle.This lack of visibility befuddles the favorable trend this sector was maintaining over the past few quarters. For the third quarter, the expected earnings growth rate is standing at 2.2% on 4.8% revenue growth projection. In comparison, the reported earnings growth rate of second-quarter 2017 was quite impressive at 7% on 4.4% revenue growth.Needless to say, that the current crisis in the U.S. MedTech industry, integral part of the broader Medical sector, shows no signs of abating. MedTech space was earlier hopeful about the change of power within the White House. However, it is currently fussing over the total failure of the Republicans’ ObamaCare repeal and replacement. Considering the prevailing uncertainty over the implementation of the health policy, any respite from it in the near term seems unlikely.Political turmoil and the health policy related battle apart, majority of the stocks’ bottom line within this space is likely to be hurt in the third quarter on escalating costs induced by the consecutive hurricanes and Mexico earthquakes.Given this gloomy backdrop, investors interested in the MedTech space will keenly await the earnings reports of key MedTech companies namely, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report) and C. R. Bard, Inc.  on Oct 24.Per our quantitative model, when stocks with a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) are combined with a positive Earnings ESP, then chances of beating estimates are always high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.A Sneak Peek at Both StocksSimilar to the sequentially-last quarter, Edwards Lifesciences seems to be gaining from its strong Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy (THVT) segment. Banking on continued therapy adoption across all geographical regions with notable strength in the United States, the company is expected to maintain this bullish trend in the third quarter of 2017 as well.Growth in THVT was driven by excellent clinical performance results from SAPIEN 3 as well as a continued strong therapy implementation across all regions in the last quarter. Also, with the receipt of an expanded FDA approval for SAPIEN 3 valve in early June, the top line at the THVT segment is expected to get a further boost this yet-to-be-reported quarter. (Read: Will Edwards Lifesciences Gain on THVT in Q3 Earnings?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for THVT net sales of $496 million reflects an increase of 20.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for transcatheter heart valves (THV) sales in the United States of $322 million shows an increase of 23.8% from the year-ago quarter. Overall, third-quarter revenues are projected at $833.89 million. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales in the United States of $467 million reflects an increase of 11.9% from the year-ago quarter.Notably, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 10.8% in the trailing four quarters. While Edwards Lifesciences has an Earnings ESP of -2.32%, it carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Further, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings of 87 cents per share being revised a penny downward over the last seven days. However, it has shown a rally of 26.4% from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues is pegged at $834 million for the yet-to-be-reported quarter, an 11.5% improvement from the year-ago reported number of $748 million.In this regard, we also anticipate the company’s arch rival in transcatheter heart valves space, Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report), to fare well in the business this third quarter. Boston Scientific is slated to report third-quarter 2017 numbers on Oct 26, before the market opens.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Edwards Lifesciences Corporation price-eps-surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Quote Looking into C.R. Bard’s recent performance trend, we believe that the growing adoption of the company’s flagship Lutonix drug coated-balloon (DCB) will continue to be the key growth catalyst in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Within the Endovascular business, peripheral PTA line sales are solely driven by an accelerating demand for the Lutonix DCB in the United States. We expect this product to significantly contribute to the company’s top line in this quarter. (Read: Can CR Bard Spring a Surprise This Earnings Season?)Notably, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 4.03% in the trailing four quarters. While C.R. Bard has an Earnings ESP of -0.09%, it carries a Zacks Rank of 3.The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings of $2.95 per share being revised a penny downward over the last 30 days. However, it has shown an improvement of 15.6% from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues is pegged at $992 million for the yet-to-be-reported quarter as compared to the year-ago reported figure of $932 million, reflecting a 6.4% gain.In this regard, we note that C.R. Bard is slated to be acquired by Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report) for $24 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. This acquisition is expected to strengthen the company’s footprint in the home healthcare market in the United States.C.R. Bard, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise C.R. Bard, Inc. price-eps-surprise | C.R. Bard, Inc. Quote Comparative AnalysisAnalyzing all the revenue drivers and other fundamental factors for both Edwards Lifesciences and C.R. Bard along with their respective Zacks Consensus Estimates, we may conclude that Edwards Lifesciences is expected to perform better than C.R. Bard in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

49,BSX,"Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 26.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.23%. The trailing four-quarter average beat is pegged at 0.84%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsWe are optimistic about the company’s gradually improving performance in Interventional Cardiology (IC), led by an innovative portfolio and robust commercial teams globally. The company while gaining share in a number of cardiovascular segments and DES (Drug Eluting Stent). continues to build momentum globally.Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Boston Scientific Corporation price-eps-surprise | Boston Scientific Corporation Quote However, ahead of earnings release, we believe the quarter’s IC business to be grossly impacted by the company’s product recall issue within Europe. Notably, last February, the company recalled one of its prime products, the Lotus range of heart devices from Europe due to device malfunctions. The company also delayed submission of its U.S. marketing application for its Lotus Edge device.The above product line has little hope to return to the European and other markets before the fourth quarter. This might lead to a major setback for the company’s fast-growing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) business within IC in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.While we believe the downbeat IC business to earn some boost from the company’s recent $435-million acquisition of Switzerland-based Symetis SA, a full recovery may take time.Accordingly, the  Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter IC revenues is currently pegged at $580 million, lower than the sequentially last quarter’s reported number of $603 million.Other Factors at PlayAmong the segments, MedSurg is expected to demonstrate a consistent performance, led by endoscopy. Urology and Women’s Health are also estimated to grow beyond market levels, driven by investment strategies in key international geographies.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter endoscopy revenues is pegged at $403 million, significantly higher than the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $367 million. For Urology and Women’s Health, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $266 million remains ahead of the year-ago reported tally of $248 million.On the flip side, severe currency headwinds that Boston Scientific has been facing of late, remain a concern. In fact, as the company records 47% of its sales from international markets, it remains highly exposed to currency fluctuations. In 2017, Boston Scientific expects an unfavorable foreign exchange challenge to the tune of $85 million on revenues and 700 bps or 8 cents per share on earnings.Overall, Boston Scientific’s third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings are expected in the band of 29-31 cents per share on revenues of $2.18-$2.21 billion.Here’s what our quantitative model predicts:Boston Scientific does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks ESP: Boston Scientific has an Earnings ESP of +0.69%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Boston Scientific carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which fails to increase the predictive power of ESP.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat estimates this quarter:Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.33% and a Zacks Rank #2.Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.06% with a Zacks Rank #3.Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.33% and also carries a Zacks Rank of 3.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

50,BSX,"Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report) recently launched an advanced Resonate family of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) systems featuring the HeartLogic Heart Failure Diagnostic.Notably, these devices are FDA approved for conditional use in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) environment and help physicians improve heart failure (HF) management through personalized care. The devices combine the company's SmartCRT Technology with EnduraLife Battery Technology. This allows physicians to customize device settings according to individual patient needs, without draining the battery or having to go through unnecessary replacement procedures.HeartLogic Diagnostic alarms doctors about worsening HF conditions by combining data from sensors assessing heart sounds, respiration rate and volume, thoracic impedance, heart rate and activity.All CRT-Ds in the Resonate family of devices are enabled with SmartCRT Technology. This helps physicians modify where, when and how to pace the lower chambers of the heart using the Multisite Pacing capability for multi-electrode pacing.The company recently initiated enrolment of patients in the MANAGE-HF study to further assess HeartLogic Diagnostic. Boston Scientific recently announced positive clinical trial data from the Multisensor Chronic Evaluation in Ambulatory Heart Failure Patients (MultiSENSE) study. The study (based on 900 patients) was conducted to examine the performance of HeartLogic Diagnostic for prediction of possibilities of HFdecompensation. The study demonstrated that HeartLogic Diagnostic increases the ability to classify patients at high or low-risk of experiencing an HF event.In the last reported second quarter, Boston Scientific’s Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) segment reflected a 2% year-over-year increase in sales. Meanwhile, the company has been consistently focusing on product development to strengthen its position in this niche.According to a report by GlobalData, the heart failure market is estimated to reach a value of $11.8 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 13.7%. Considering the huge potential of the market, we believe the latest development is strategically placed.However, the company is facing tough competition in the global cardiac monitoring and rhythmmanagement devices market from established players like Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report), Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) and Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report).Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

51,BSX,"Boston Scientific Corporation's (BSX  -  Free Report) MedSurg business group (comprising three sub segments viz. Endoscopy, Urology and Pelvic Health and Neuromodulation) has been recording operational sales growth over the last few quarters. We expect this upside to further find reflection in first-quarter 2018 results, scheduled for release on Apr 25.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q1 performance is expected to be.Key CatalystsMedSurg is estimated to demonstrate a steady performance, primarily led by endoscopy. Notably, last quarter, the endoscopy business was fueled by biliary, hemostasis and consistently strong contributions from the EndoChoice and Symetis acquisitions. With Endochoice being fully integrated now, the company is once again expected to deliver solid, organic and operational growth within this segment in the first quarter of 2018 as well.Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $420 million for endoscopy revenues indicates an 8.5% rise from the year-ago quarter.Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Scientific Corporation Quote Within Urology and Pelvic health too, we expect another quarter of strong growth. Notably, last quarter, the company’s single-use digital ureteroscope, LithoVue, helped drive double-digit growth in core stone franchise within this sub segment. We are also looking forward to the company’s yet another sturdy quarterly performance at Prostate health. Significantly, Urology represents a $4-billion attractive global market potential with large unmet patient needs and hordes of international expansion opportunities.The consensus mark of $289 million for endoscopy revenues reflects an increase of 9.1% from the year-ago number.Within Neuromodulation, the company is optimistic about a robust performance through 2018, considering the rapidly-growing niche market. We believe, innovative product launches in both spinal-cord and deep-brain stimulation franchises will likely fuel growth within this segment. We are particularly hopeful about the newly-launched WaveWriter SCS System, the first and the only platform approved by the FDA to simultaneously provide a paresthesia-based, sub-perception therapy for patients suffering chronic pain. Also, the Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation System to treat Parkinson's disease, launched last December, should prove accretive to the company’s Nuromodulation revenues in the first quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $160 million for neuromodulation revenues translates into a 12.7% gain from the year-ago tally.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderBoston Scientific carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report) and Abiomed, Inc.

52,BSX,"Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 25.Last quarter, the company delivered earnings in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the average trailing four-quarter earnings surprise is pegged at -0.03%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsWithin structural heart, we are looking forward to Boston Scientific’s WATCHMAN, ACURATE, and IRIS product lines, expected to strongly contribute to the company’s top line in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. Earlier, the company stated that in2018, it expects revenues from WATCHMAN and ACURATE TAVR franchise to gross approximately $400 million.We are optimistic about the gradually improving performance in Interventional Cardiology (IC), led by an innovative portfolio and robust commercial teams, globally. More specifically, the company has of late, successfully gained within this business on strong sales of WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device and its portfolio of complex PCI (percutaneouscoronary intervention) products.The WATCHMAN platform is anticipated to experience another excellent quarter on consistent global momentum as Boston Scientific’s multiple market development efforts continue to push for growth.This apart, new launches within IC business like the WOLVERINE cutting balloon and the company’s next-generation rotational atherectomy platform called ROTAPRO, are likely to strongly contribute to the top line in the upcoming quarter.We are also upbeat about the company’s ACURATE (TAVR (transcatheter aortic valve replacement) program, which has recently completed training of European sales and clinical teams.Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Scientific Corporation Quote However, ahead of the company’s earnings release for the first quarter, we believe its IC business to be once again deeply impacted by the product recall issue within Europe. Notably, the company has recently announced a further delay in its earlier-reported timelines for the commercial return of the LOTUS Edge Aortic Valve System in Europe as well as the United States, following the product’s voluntary recall, last February.Other Factors at PlayAmong the segments, MedSurg is estimated to demonstrate a steady performance, led by endoscopy. Urology and Women’s Health are also projected to grow beyond market levels, driven by investment strategies in the key international geographies.However, the company is expected to face some downsides within this business too in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. These headwinds may come in the form of year-over-year difficult pacer comparisons and more competitions in the drug eluting stent space with some new entrants.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter endoscopy revenues is pegged at $420 million, 8.5% above the prior-year quarter’s reported count of $387 million. For Urology and Women’s Health, the consensus mark of $289 million remains 9.1% ahead of the year-earlier quarter’s reported tally of $265 million.On the flip side, severe currency headwinds that Boston Scientific have been facing of late, remain a concern. In fact, as the company records 47% of its sales from the international markets, it gets highly exposed to currency fluctuations. This apart, although immaterial for the to-be-reported quarter, the ongoing tensions between the United States as well as China regarding the imposition of tariffs on imports, have raised concerns for major MedTech players as any adverse move might affect the top-line numbers in the future.Here’s What Our Quantitative Model PredictsPer the proven Zacks model, a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.Boston Scientific has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. Together, the combination does not suggest that the company is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around.Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.61% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Henry Schein, Inc.

53,BSX,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) recently initiated a post-market FORWARD PRO Clinical Study to measure the performance of CoreValve Evolut PRO transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) system in regular clinical treatments.This study will evaluate the long-term performance of the next-generation self-expanding TAVI system in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and who are at an intermediate, high or extreme risk for open heart surgery. Notably, this system has recently been approved for commercial use in Europe and the United States.Per management, this multi-center study will enroll 600 patients across 35 sites in Europe. Moreover, the study involves measuring the safety standards of CoreValve Evolut PRO valves by analyzing the all-cause mortality and all stroke rates at 30 days along with clinical performance covering valve hemodynamics and paravalvular regurgitation. Moreover per the company, patients will be continued to be followed and evaluated out to five years.We encouragingly note that, in March 2017, the CoreValve Evolut PRO system had received FDA approval for use on symptomatic patients who are at high or extreme risk for open heart surgery. Moreover, this self-expanding TAVI system has been granted regulatory approval in Europe as well. Thus, we believe a clinical study data displaying the efficiency of the product will help the company gain traction in the Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH) space.Interestingly, Medtronic’s CSH revenues were up 7% (8% at constant exchange rate) to $817 million on the back of high 30s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong customer uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform in the United States and continued demand for the CoreValve Evolut R 34mm valve in the United States as well as Europe.Notably, per a report by Medgadget, the global heart valve repair and replacement market is expected to grow from $2,281.2 million in 2014 to $3,767.0 million in 2020, at a CAGR of 8.7%.We believe that unhealthy lifestyle and a rise in ageing population will continue to result in high incidence of cardiovascular diseases. This is further supported by data provided by GBI Research. Per the report, the global cardiovascular diseases market will see a CAGR of 4.1% by 2019, and within this space, the U.S. market is expected to witness the highest momentum at a CAGR of 4.7%.Medtronic is based in a highly fragmented heart valve repair and replacement market. However, the market is dominated by some well-established players like Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report), Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) and Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), among others. Boston Scientific’s LOTUS Valve platform and Edwards Lifesciences’ SAPIEN XT SAPIEN 3 offerings are worth a mention here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

54,BSX,"On Sep 5, 2017, we issued an updated research report on leading medical devices company, Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report).Over the past three months, Boston Scientific has been trading below the broader industry on several issues. The stock has improved 2.3% compared with the broader industry’s 5.4% gain during the period.While adverse foreign exchange continues to pose challenges, we are concerned with the company’s recall of one of its prime products, Lotus range of heart devices. It is important to note that last quarter, foreign exchange headwind affected the company’s top line by $23 million and adjusted gross margin by 50 basis points. Also, a dull defibrillator sale within core Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) continues to remain a drag for overall growth. The woes of challenging economy and competitive landscape persistently burden the stock.Boston Scientific Corporation Price and Consensus  Boston Scientific Corporation Price and Consensus | Boston Scientific Corporation QuoteHowever, given the company’s bullish second-quarter 2017 results and several recent developments, we find quite a few positive factors to rely on. The company is leaving no stone unturned to strengthen its core businesses and invest more in global markets.Among the recent upsides, worth mentioning is the company’s acquisition of Symetis, in a bid to fortify its European structural heart business. We are also encouraged with the company securing multiple product approvals both in domestic and overseas markets. Notably, the company received an FDA approval for the RESONATE family of ICD and CRT-D systems.Additionally, the market holds optimism on the stock, following the company’s recent release of an outline on sustained growth strategy, focusing on planned expansion in new markets and consolidating product lines across all business segments. The company particularly plans to launch products into high-growth adjacent markets with strong potential to reap an incremental $13 billion in market opportunity by 2020.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBoston Scientific carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc.

55,BSX,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) has made another encouraging move with respect to its Medical Devices business. The company recently announced FDA approval for Full MagLev HeartMate 3 Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD).Built on the sophisticated Full MagLev (fully magnetically-levitated) Flow technology, the HeartMate 3 system provides advanced short-term hemodynamic support to advanced heart failure patients.The Full MagLev technology enables HeartMate 3 system to lower trauma to the blood passing through the pump while optimizing blood flow. Interestingly, HeartMate 3 is an upgraded version to the existing HeartMate II system, which is used for longer duration.The much-awaited FDA approval was awarded to Abbott post successful results from the MOMENTUM 3 clinical study. We also encouragingly note that HeartMate 3 received CE Mark in 2015.Per management, over 5.7 million people in the United States suffer from heart failure and roughly 915,000 new patients are diagnosed with the condition every year. Supporting this data, Statista’s report on the U.S. Heart Failure market states that the market is projected to value $1,969 million by 2020, witnessing a CAGR of 16.2%. Moreover, they see an encouraging growth in the user penetration rate (as a share out of all ailing people) to 11.1% in 2020 from 8.1% in 2017. Thus, considering this data base, we believe that the latest FDA nod will accelerate the top-line growth.Per a report by Culrav.org, the global LVAD market is projected to value $2,323.4 million witnessing a CAGR of 8.9% from 2017 to 2025. Moreover, as per Transperency Market Research, the North American market for ventricular assist devices is expected to see a CAGR of 9.2% in the 2016 to 2024 period.Thus, considering the market potential, Abbott’s latest development will help it gain traction in the LVAD space.Interestingly, Abbott’s Medical Devices operating segment (39.1% of total revenues) stood out as the highest revenue grossing business in the second quarter of 2017.  Moreover, the company’s Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation sub-segment was the highest contributor, making up for 87.1% of the total Medical Devices revenues with 49.1% sales from the United States alone. Thus, the company’s latest development will help boost performance in this segment.We believe an ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle and rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in the heart failure market.However, this market is dominated by many well-established players with Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) and Boston Scientiific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) being the most prominent ones.Moreover, Abbott has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Over the past three months, the company’s share price has outperformed the industry. The stock has gained 11.7%, higher than the broader industry’s gain of 0.8%. The company has also outperformed the 1% gain of the S&P 500 market over the same time frame.Zacks Rank & Key PickAbbott carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

56,BSX,"With the second-quarter earnings season gaining momentum, the broader picture no longer looks as bright as it was expected to be. Putting together all the 128 S&P 500 members’ released results as of Jul 25, constituting 36% of the index’s total membership, we note that earnings growth pace is less than the last quarter. However, it is more or less in line with the trailing four-quarter average earnings growth and exceeds the trailing 12-quarter average.Per the latest second-quarter scorecard, total earnings increased 7% year over year on 4.2% higher revenues. While earnings beat ratio remains at 77.3%, revenue beat ratio is at 70.3%. (For more information, please consult our Zacks Earnings Analysis).What’s in Store for the Medical Space?Investors are concerned about the healthcare space, a sector that has been seen through a lot of struggle during the past half year, thanks to the political power change and the ongoing policy restructuring related battle.While yesterday, it was finally President Donald Trump’s win with the Republican healthcare bill passing one more barrier by a very narrow margin, investors are however not much optimistic about this development. Per a Vox article today, in its effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, “President Donald Trump continues to make bold promises about what that bill would do — promises that all available analysis suggests the bill will not keep”.While there are still chances that the Senate will amend the latest bill, its extent still remains unclear. Accordingly, uncertainty within the medical space is towering high. Investors are currently adopting a wait-and-see policy about this space.Let’s sneak a peek into the performance of five major Medical – Products companies within the broader Medical space expected on Jul 27.Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report): We are upbeat about Align Technology’s execution of strategic initiatives like international expansion, which ensured Invisalign treatment for a growing base of patients. In this context, the company strengthened its foothold internationally by acquiring the Invisalign distributors in the highly lucrative Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region as well as Brazil in February. This is likely to drive the company’s results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Align is expected to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results before the market opens, as it has the right combination of two key ingredients. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has an Earnings ESP of +2.74%. We note that, while a positive Zacks ESP serves as a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise, a bullish Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of the ESP.

Price and EPS Surprise Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Align Technology, Inc. Quote Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report): We believe, this medical device major’s second-quarter performance will be grossly impacted by the company’s product recall issue within Europe. On the other hand, the company’s downbeat interventional cardiology business may get some sort of a boost with the company’s $435 million acquisition of Switzerland-based Symetis SA.Boston Scientific is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results after the market closes. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Hence, we are unable to conclude whether Boston Scientific is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. Note that all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.  (Read More: Boston Scientific Q2 Earnings: What Awaits the Stock?)Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Scientific Corporation Quote Cerner Corporation (CERN  -  Free Report): We believe, Cerner’s strong sales performance as well as its solid portfolio and strategic initiatives have positioned it well for stellar growth. Cerner announced that it has been chosen by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to develop an electronic health record (EHR) system. Department of Veterans Affairs will use the same system the company is developing for the U.S. Department of Defense, which began its operation at its first site in February. This system will facilitate the exchange of data between military care facilities and civilian health providers, where current and former service members receive care.This leading healthcare information technology (HCIT) company is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 earnings after the market closes. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +1.75%. Hence it is expected to beat expectations this quarter.

Notably, this indicates a rise of 6.5%-9.4% on a year-over-year basis. We believe that the growing adoption of MAKO robots will drive sales in the orthopedic and reconstructive surgery market. Additionally, Stryker is well poised on the acquisitions of both Sage and Physio-Control in the past.The company also expects to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell. This is because the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of +0.66%. (Read More: Will Stryker Deliver a Beat this Earnings Season?)Stryker Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Stryker Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Stryker Corporation Quote McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report): This major player in the pharmaceutical and medical supplies distribution market expects to gain from a gradually stabilizing generic and branded market. The company’s distribution solutions segment performed favorably in fiscal 2017 despite weak pricing trends and customer consolidation.We are unable to conclude whether McKesson is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. We need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.(Read More: McKesson Q1 Earnings: Stock Likely to Beat Estimates?)McKesson Corporation Price and EPS Surprise McKesson Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | McKesson Corporation QuoteThe Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

57,BSX,"Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) recently announced the acquisition of Securus Medical Group, Inc — a privately-held developer of thermal monitoring system for the continuous measurement of esophageal temperature. The buyout is in line with the company’s strategy to gain traction in the global Electrophysiology (EP) market, which is poised to reach a value of around $4.73 billion by 2019 (per data by Markets and Markets).Securus Medical Group’s integrated catheter-based probe and imaging system produces real-time images of the temperature of the esophagus and helps in performing cardiac ablation procedure by avoiding thermal injury. Notably, this infrared esophageal temperature monitoring system has received a 510(k) clearance from the FDA.Boston Scientific plans to introduce the thermal monitoring system in the United States in the first half of 2019. Further, the company will integrate the thermal monitoring system with its RHYTHMIA HDx Mapping System improve the level of comprehensive cardiac imaging during ablation procedures.Financial Terms of the DealBoston Scientific has an existing investment in Securus Medical Group and will pay a net upfront payment of approximately $40 million in cash for the remaining stake and milestone fees of nearly $10 million.However, the transaction is not expected to be accretive to the company’s adjusted earnings per share.A Glimpse of the EP BusinessBoston Scientific’s EP business develops less-invasive medical technologies to diagnose and treat disorders of heart rate and rhythm.In fourth-quarter 2017, revenues in this division improved 20.7% year over year to $77 million (up 17.7% at CER). The upside was driven by higher uptake of the new RHYTHMIA HDx platform. Management continues to roll out the HDx platform in Europe and recently launched it in the United States as well as Japan.Overall, the company continues to expand the toolkit that supports RHYTHMIA HDx, providing ablation technologies that match the excellence of its Mapping System.Additionally, it focuses on adding tools that expand the reach and utility of RHYTHMIA HDx in different procedures.In this regard, Boston Scientific expects the full-fledged commercialization of DirectSense technology in Europe and the United States in 2018 followed by a successful initial launch in Europe.Moreover, to expand its EP business, Boston Scientific acquired Apama Medical Inc in October 2017. The company intends to integrate its RHYTHMIA HDx Mapping System with Apama RF balloon system to improve the visualization of the heart during ablation processes.Market PotentialBoston Scientific’s strategy to boost the EP business seems to be aligned with data provided by Allied Market Research.  Per the report, the global cardiac monitoring and cardiac rhythm management market is expected to reach a value of $32,216 million from 2016 to 2022, at a CAGR of 7.6%.We believe that unhealthy lifestyle and a rise in aging population will continue to result in high incidence of cardiovascular diseases. This is supported by data provided by GBI Research. Per the report, the global cardiovascular disease market is projected to witness a CAGR of 4.1% by 2019. Within this space, the U.S. market is expected to witness the highest momentum at a CAGR of 4.7%.Thus, the addition of the thermal monitoring system will help Boston Scientific cash in on the abundant opportunities in the global cardiac monitoring and cardiac rhythm management market.Share Price PerformanceBoston Scientific has been gaining investors’ confidence on consistently positive results. Over the past three months, shares of the company have outperformed its broader industry. The stock has rallied 5.8% versus the industry’s 4.2% decline. Zacks Rank & Key PicksBoston Scientific carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), athenahealth, Inc.

58,BSX,"Leading its way through the growing market of Urology, Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) has recently entered into an agreement to buy Minnesota-based NxThera for a deal value of up to $406 million. Privately-held NxThera is the developer and marketer of the Rezum system in the United States and Europe. The transaction is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.Financial Terms of the DealThe transaction consists of an upfront payment of $306 million in cash and up to an additional $100 million in potential commercial milestone payments over the next four years. Notably, the company has an existing minority investment in NxThera, expected to result in a net upfront payment of approximately $240 million upon closing and milestone fees of nearly $85 million.NxThera, Rezum and BPH: A Strategic Deal for BSX?For patients with symptoms arising from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), the Rezum system of NxThera comes as a minimally invasive therapy option. BPH or non-cancerous prostate gland enlargement is quite common among aged males, creating an attractive market. While the disease affects 110 million men worldwide, more than 12 million symptomatic men alone in the United States are undergoing treatment for the condition with medications or procedural approaches. Notably, BPH may cause symptoms affecting a patient's qualify of life such as pain and a frequent need to urinate. Among the many positives about the Rezum system of NxThera, we are impressed by its hassle-free procedure, which can be performed at a physician's clinic without general anesthesia, thereby reducing the cost of a BPH therapy to the core. Moreover, the treatment applies water vapor to remove excess prostate tissue, alleviating obstructions to urine flow. This further helps mitigating BPH-related symptoms and also prevents unwanted side effects that come along with the intake of maintenance medications to control BPH.Boston Scientific mentioned about two favorable clinical studies related to the Rezum system. Management stated that “A study published in the March issue of the Journal of Urology demonstrated that over a three-year period, patients treated with the Rezum system had clinical progression rates that were five times lower than the reported rates of patients treated with daily, long-term medications. Additional clinical data from a randomized controlled trial demonstrated that patients treated with the Rezum system had a 51% reduction in their symptoms at 24 months post-treatment and maintained a 50 percent reduction in BPH symptoms at three years’ post-treatment.”Projected Synergies From the DealPost the deal’s closure, the buyout of NxThera is expected to remain immaterial to Boston Scientific’s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) through 2020 and be only accretive afterwards. The consolidation is likely to be dilutive or less beneficial on a reported basis due to amortization and transaction and integration costs.We reckon that the Boston Scientific’s Urology Pelvic Health arm is one of its highest operating margin businesses. Per the company, acquisition of the AMS urology portfolio has burgeoned its urology business size to almost double at a value of $1 billion.Significantly, urology represents a $4-billion attractive global market potential with large unmet patient needs and considerable international expansion opportunities. We believe, this NxThera buyout post completion, will enable the company to capitalize on this opportunity.Share Price Performance Boston Scientific has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Last month, shares of the company have outperformed its broader industry. The stock has rallied 1.7% compared with the industry’s 1.5% gain.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBoston Scientific carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

59,BSX,"In the era of big data, unless one's portfolio is in tune with the evolving digital trend, making prudent investment choices can prove to be a daunting task. Millennials have started to recognize the increasing need of the emerging automation trend and subsequently robotics, IoT, 3D printing are becoming part of our daily life with the latest buzzword being Artificial Intelligence (AI).While Siri and Ok Google have made life easier, the latest version of Global Positioning System helps track almost anything and everything along with its intelligent route map. Also, not being a pro on social network sites like Facebook, Twitter or snapchat can be seen as primitive.According to investment giant Jim Cramer, AI along with big data will soon let companies to bat a thousand. Interestingly, the benefits of the same will not remain restricted to any particular industry but will be felt across all business segments and investment arenas.AI to Help MedTech Gain TractionNon-healthcare bigwigs like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Google, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), IBM and Microsoft with their digital affluence are already eyeing the healthcare and device market of late, courtesy of its solid prospects. Two things to be noted here:Health treatment costs have skyrocketed over the past few years. Surprisingly, medical devices and pharmaceuticals account for only a small portion of healthcare expenses. Per Josh Makower, MD, general partner venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates, the greater part of healthcare costs goes in paying the salaries of healthcare employees. AI can help to curtail this high labor cost.Going by 2018 Deloitte data, global health care spending is projected to increase at an annual rate of 4.1% in 2017-2021, a significant escalation from just 1.3% in 2012-2016. Per the report, rising labor cost is acting as a major spending growth driver.Also, with growth in the aged population, the necessity for AI has increased by leaps and bounds. Per the U.S. Census Bureau report, between 2012 and 2050, there will be a significant rise in the aged population in the United States. In 2050, the population aged 65 or older is projected to be 83.7 million, almost double its estimated population of 43.1 million in 2012. Data also shows that the median age is increasing in most areas of the country and this is the global scenario as well.Notably, the industry is bearing the brunt of an exploding population at present. The World Health Organization's (""WHO"") latest available data show that more than 45% of WHO Member States worldwide report to have less than 1 physician per 1000 population. The density of physicians to patients in the United States is 2.3:1000.The strategic application of AI in every sphere of healthcare can provide an impetus to  productivity. Evidently, companies that adopted AI technologies have already witnessed a 50% reduction in healthcare costs and have also experienced improved patient outcome by more than 50%.MedTech Stocks Going the AI WayMedtronic (MDT  -  Free Report) is undoubtedly among the first MedTech manufacturers forging ahead with initiatives to bring in AI techniques in manufacturing processes. Back in 2016, the company partnered with IBM Watson to utilize the latter’s machine learning algorithms to incorporate AI in its diabetes app MiniMed.  In 2017, they jointly launched the first artificial pancreas systems. Metronic has utilized sugar IQ with the cognitive computing capability of IBM Watson to detect important patterns and trends for diabetes.EHR technologies developer Cerner (CERN  -  Free Report) is also adopting AI techniques rapidly. Lately, the company has been in the headlines, courtesy of its efforts to digitize electronic health record systems. In this regard, the company recently entered into two collaborations, one with Salesforce, a renowned player in the field of customer relationship management, and the other with Centrus Health, a clinically integrated, physician-led network. With the latest development, the company is planning to advance its flagship big-data platform HealtheIntent.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report) designs, manufactures and markets the da Vinci surgical system — an advanced robot-assisted surgical platform. This AI platform enables minimally-invasive surgery that helps negate trauma associated with open surgery. The company plans to expand the usage of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, colorectal surgery and hernia repair.Of late, Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report) has also been putting an all-out effort to incorporate AI techniques in neuromodulation, cardiac rhythm management, cardiology, electrophysiology, peripheral interventions, oncology, endoscopy, urology and pelvic health.ConclusionA long debate can be structured on how an intelligent machine intensive technology can make human capabilities outmoded gradually — but that’s a different story. Despite several adversities, AI undoubtedly has emanated to change the behavioral pattern of consumers in medical device space like all other sectors. Once again going by Jim Cramer’s say, “I love behavior-change investing. It can be incredibly lucrative, and when you have a behavior-change theme you can use selloffs to pick stocks based on those changes.” Thus, it goes without saying that the market holds ample promise and the proper execution of AI will definitely prove to be a trump card for the space.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

60,BSX,"The fourth-quarter 2017 earnings season is gaining momentum with 133 S&P 500 participants having already released financial numbers as of Jan 26. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the reporting cycle was off to an encouraging start with above-average proportion of companies edging past the top and bottom-line expectations.Total earnings for these members have improved 11.6% on 6% increase in revenues.With results of roughly 121 members slated to be announced this week, per the Zacks data, estimates for the period are gradually trending upward across the board for nine of the 16 Zacks sectors. The Medical as one in the bracket, is expected to witness a 2.1% earnings rise in the fourth quarter on 2% revenue growth projection.What’s in Store for Medical Device Industry?The medical device space within the broader Medical sector somewhat displays a mixed bag of sorts. As part of the tax overhaul, corporate tax rates have been slashed down to 21% from the previous 35%, thus lending a huge relief to the MedTech mammoths.However, ahead of the industry’s fourth-quarter earnings release, a section of analysts expect this new tax law to negatively impact the industry due to a possible cut in overall Medicare spending, if certain criteria are not fulfilled by a specific date. The Congressional Budget Office apprehends that in absence of any alternative to meet the fiscal deficit from the huge tax reduction, automatic cut backs worth $136 billion including $25 billion in Medicare cuts from the mandatory budget of spending in 2018, could be triggered.Amid tax reform related concerns, the news of Congress delaying the medical device tax for another two years came as a huge boost to industry players and investors. This 2.3% tax was earlier delayed by Congress in 2015 for a couple of years. The deferral will once again largely propel R&D activities within this space.Let’s take a sneak peek at the performance of five major medical device companies, waiting to report earnings on Feb 1.Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report): We are optimistic about the company’s gradually improving performance in Interventional Cardiology, led by an innovative portfolio and robust commercial teams, globally. More specifically, The WATCHMAN platform is expected to experience another excellent quarter on consistent global momentum as Boston Scientific’s multiple market development efforts continue to push for growth.The company has a positive Earnings ESP of +1.07% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). While a favorable Zacks ESP indicates a likely positive surprise, a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.  (Read More: Will WATCHMAN Boost Boston Scientific's Q4 Earnings?)Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Scientific Corporation QuoteBaxter International Inc.

At the end of the second quarter, the company had a total long-term debt of $5.84 billion, a marginal increase from $5.14 billion at the end of the first quarter.GuidanceBoston Scientific has provided an update to its full-year 2017 guidance.The company raised its 2017 revenue guidance to the range of $8.89-$8.99 billion (annualized growth of 6-7% on reported basis and growth of 6-8% on operational basis including contribution of approximately 120 bps from EndoChoice and Symetis) from the earlier band of $8.80–$8.90 billion (annualized growth of 5-6% on reported basis and growth of 6-7% on operational basis). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $8.87 billion, below the guided range.Adjusted EPS guidance range for 2017, has been slightly increased to $1.22−$1.27 from the earlier range of 1.22−$1.26. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24 is within this guided range.The company also provided its third-quarter 2017 financial guidance. Adjusted earnings are expected in the band of 29–31 cents per share on revenues of $2.18–$2.21 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS stands at 31 cents while for revenues, it is $2.19 billion.Our TakeEven amid challenging economic conditions, a competitive environment and severe currency headwinds, Boston Scientific posted a better-than-expected second quarter, with earnings missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues, ahead of the mark. While foreign exchange headwinds continue to pose challenges, we are concerned with the company’s recent recall of one of its prime products, Lotus range of heart devices. Also the unimpressive defibrillator performance within the company’s core CRM segment continues to remain a drag for the overall growth.Nevertheless, Boston Scientific is leaving no stone unturned to strengthen its core businesses and invest in new technologies and global markets, which accounted for higher sales across all its geographies in the second quarter. We are also encouraged with the company gaining a number of approvals for its products, both in the domestic and overseas markets.Among the recent developments, worth mentioning is the company’s recent acquisition of Switzerland-based Symetis SA, in a bid to fortify its structural heart business in Europe. This apart, the company received an FDA approval for the RESONATE family of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) systems. It also received CE Mark for the Vercise Gevia Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) System and the first MR-conditional directional DBS system for treatment of movement disorder symptoms in patients with Parkinson’s disease, dystonia and essential tremor.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksCurrently, Boston Scientific carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some other better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

64,BSX,"Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report) is hitting headlines with successive new developments, the latest feat being the company’s Spectra WaveWriter Spinal Cord Stimulator System (SCS) getting an FDA nod. Per Boston Scientific, this is the only FDA-approved SCS system to provide paresthesia-based and sub-perception therapies.Notably, SCS technology sends low electrical pulses in varied frequency, pulse width and amplitude to the spinal cord to interrupt pain signals. While paresthesia-based therapy provides pain relief with a light tingling sensation, sub-perception therapy works without it.The company claims that the latest Spectra WaveWriter System effectively enables physicians and patients to combine therapeutic options, customize therapy as well as capture real-time feedback to treat chronic and debilitating pain plus address each individual's distinctive pain-relief needs.With Spectra WaveWriter System at its disposal, Boston Scientific views that patients can easily combine both paresthesia-based and sub-perception therapies to target one specific area of pain. Or else, they may pick a particular therapy required to best manage the multiple areas of pain. Additionally, patients can provide a real-time feedback using the system's remote control.Per data provided by Transparency Market Research, the global pain management therapeutics market is expected to witness a CAGR of 3.7% from 2016 to 2024. Accordingly, the market is anticipated to rise from $60.2 billion in 2015 to $83 billion by 2024. This promising data makes us confident about the growing acceptance of Boston Scientific’s Spectra WaveWriter Spinal Cord Stimulator System.The company noted that more than 100 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, thus making it the prime cause of disability in adults in the United States. The company’s commitment to invest in research as well as expanding treatment options for chronic pain by identifying new, non-opioid solutions like the SCS appears to be perfectly strategic.Share Price Movement  Boston Scientific has been outperforming the broader industry over the past 30 days. The stock has rallied 6.6% compared with the broader industry's 3.4% gain.Key PicksBoston Scientific carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) and Molina Healthcare Inc.

65,BSX,"AngioDynamics Inc. (ANGO  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings of 16 cents per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and declined 15.8% on a year-over-year basis.Meanwhile, net sales fell almost 2.6% year over year to $86.7 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $88 million.U.S. net sales were $68.3 million, down 4.4%, due to decline in Venous, Core and PICCs businesses. International net sales were $18.4 million, up 4.6% on a year-over-year basis, owing to robust sales in the Oncology/Surgery business.Declines in Venus Insufficiency, Core Businesses and across the majority of the company’s Vascular Access non-BioFlo products are the primary reasons for the downside in overall revenues.No significant impact of currency has been observed in the reported quarter.AngioDynamics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise AngioDynamics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | AngioDynamics, Inc. QuoteSegment DetailsPeripheral Vascular (PV) business: Sales at this segment totaled $51.4 million in the reported quarter, down 4.3% from the year-ago quarter.Growth in the Fluid and Thrombus Management product lines was offset by declines in the Venous Insufficiency and Angiographic Catheter businesses, as well as the persistent winding down of the company’s supply agreement with Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX  -  Free Report).Notably, AngioDynamics is a leading player in the thrombolytic catheters space (catheter directed thrombolysis). The company boasts highly unique catheters like Uni-Fuse, SpeedLyser and Pulse Spray under the thrombus portfolio.Vascular Access (VA) business: Sales at this segment were $22.6 million, down 4.2% from $23.6 million on a year-over-year basis. The segment witnessed solid sales in BioFlo related products. However, it was offset by declines in the remaining product lines within the segment.Oncology/Surgery business: AngioDynamics witnessed sales of $12.8 million in the second quarter, an increase of 8.4% from $11.8 million on a year-over-year basis. The upside was primarily driven by additional sales of the recently launched Solero Microwave Tissue Ablation System.Margin DetailsAs a percentage of revenues, adjusted gross margin contracted 130 basis points (bps) to 49.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, from 50.6% in the year–ago quarter. The decline in gross margin was primarily because of an inventory write-off related to VOLTA, the company’s radio frequency ablation product, that was previously sold in Japan.Adjusted EBITDAS in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $13.3 million compared with $15.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.Financial ConditionAngioDynamics had a strong cash flow balance in the second quarter. Per management, the company generated $10.2 million in operating cash flow and $9.4 million in free cash flow.Additionally, AngioDynamics ended the quarter with $51.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and debt of $95 million.FY18 View Lacks LusterAngioDynamics reduced its guidance for fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2018, the company expects net sales in the range of $345-$350 million compared with the previous range of $352-$359 million.Free cash flow is expected in the range of $30-$35 million.However, the company has reaffirmed previously announced adjusted earnings per share guidance range of 64-68 cents, excluding any impact from the recently legislated 2017 Tax Reform Act.Our TakeAngioDynamics reported a dismal second quarter of fiscal 2018, wherein adjusted earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company also reiterated guidance for fiscal 2018. AngioDynamicis rides on the market’s solid response to Solero, especially within the Microwave Ablation space. Per management, AngioDynamics’ consistent focus on financial discipline and building a high-quality capital structure will boost investments toward innovative product portfolio and pursue strategic acquisitions.On the flipside, a drop in the core Angiographic Catheter business has affected the Peripheral Vascular Business segment. The company also has a high outstanding debt level. Higher debts impose certain operating and financial restrictions which might limit the execution of the company’s core business strategies.Price PerformanceAngioDynamics has been performing below the industry. Over the last 6 months, the stock has lost 0.8% against the industry’s gain of 7.8%.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAngioDynamics holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are ABIOMED Inc.

66,BSX,"On Jan 2, 2018, we issued an updated research report on leading medical devices company, Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past three months, Boston Scientific has been trading below the broader industry on several issues. The stock has declined 13.5% compared with the broader industry's 3.9% gain during the period. On a positive note, a gradually improving foreign exchange scenario has also started to contribute to the company’s overall top-line performance. The raised guidance is all the more impressive and indicative of this overall bullish trend to continue through the rest of 2017 til the company reports its final quarter’s earnings performance.Boston Scientific is leaving no stone unturned to strengthen its core businesses and invest in new technologies and global markets, which accounted for higher sales across all its geographies in the third quarter. We are also encouraged by the company’s gain of a number of approvals for its products both in the domestic as well as overseas markets.Among the recent developments, worth mentioning is the company's recent acquisition of Apama Medical, the developer of the single-shot Apama Radiofrequency Balloon Catheter System for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. This apart, the company received an FDA approval for MRI labeling and announced the U.S. launch of the Resonate family of implantable cardioverter defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) systems. This combines the HeartLogic Heart Failure Diagnostic, EnduraLife battery technology and SmartCRT Technology.However, we are concerned about the company’s recall of one of its prime products, Lotus range of heart devices. Recently, the company announces a delay in its earlier-reported timelines for the commercial return of the LOTUS Edge Aortic Valve System in Europe and the United States, following the product’s voluntary recall that took place in last February.On the upcoming fourth-quarter 2017 earnings conference call, scheduled on Feb 1, 2018, the company now expects to provide a further update on the status of the LOTUS Edge Valve.Also, a dull defibrillator sale within the core Cardiac Rhythm Management continues to be a drag for overall growth. Additionally, the woes of a challenging economy as well as a competitive landscape persistently burden the stock.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the broader medical space are Akari Therapeutics PLC.

67,BSX,"Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) has been dominating the headlines of late, courtesy of the FDA approval for its Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) System. The device is used to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). The first commercial implant with the Vercise System will be done at the University of Minnesota Medical Center in Minneapolis, MN.Studies Supporting the SystemThe approval came on the back of encouraging data from INTREPID study — the first multi-center, prospective, double-blind, randomized sham-controlled study on DBS for PD in the United States. The study confirmed the effectiveness and safety of the system. Moreover, the system recorded positive safety data at the European multi-center, prospective, single-arm VANTAGE study.Developments in DBS PortfolioBoston Scientific witnessed improvement in its Neuromodulation business in the last reported quarter on several product launches, including that of Vercise Gevia MRI DBS in Europe with the Cartesia Lead in June which provided the first directional, rechargeable and magnetic resonance (MR) conditional system. The company also introduced Neural Navigator 2 — programming software to allow physicians to visualize the stimulation field while configuring DBS programs for patients. Boston Scientific is also currently supporting a research on the use of DBS for stroke recovery and treating Alzheimer's disease.Market PotentialPer a Transparency Market Research report, the global DBS market is projected to reach a value of $3.21 billion by 2020, at a CAGR of 8.9%. The prospects in the market are primarily based on an increasing number of people suffering from neurological diseases across all age groups. Per the company, more than one million people in the United States and 10 million globally are suffering from PD. Thus, the latest FDA approval will help Boston Scientific cash in on the bountiful opportunities in the DBS market.Share Price MovementOver the past three months, Boston Scientific has been underperforming the broader industry. The stock has declined 12.3% in contrast to the broader industry's 0.3% gain. The latest FDA approval is expected to help the stock bounce back.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksBoston Scientific currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked medical stocks are PetMed Express, Inc.

68,BSX,"The fate of Lotus valve issue seems to be in limbo for some more time for Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report). Recently, the company announces a delay to its earlier-reported timelines for the commercial return of the LOTUS Edge Aortic Valve System in Europe and the United States, following the product’s voluntary recall that took place back in February 2017.Following this sudden announcement, share price of the company dropped 8.4% over the last three days to reach $26.28 before closing the session on Nov 30. Per editor Amanda Pedersen’s newsletter published on MDDIonline.com, investors were overly worried due to the sudden change of plans foreshadowing another Lotus setback.Notably, in February, while recalling the product (based on certain device malfunctions), Boston Scientific announced the expected time of reintroduction of the LOTUS Edge delivery system in Europe by the first quarter of 2018. The company also expected to file the final Pre-Market Approval (PMA) module with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by January 2018.However, per the latest press release,on the fourth-quarter 2017 earnings conference call on Feb 1, 2018, the company now expects to provide a further update on the status of the LOTUS Edge Valve. This delay has been justified by Boston Scientific citing continuous ‘focus on manufacturing and regulatory milestones to support the long-term success of the Lotus platform.’ The company stated that it is currently working on to implement necessary modifications in the device to pass the internal quality standards.While the company has not specifically mentioned the exact reasons behind this postponing of Lotus Valve relaunch, we however, fear about the uncertain fate of the company’s fast-growing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) business within interventional cardiology, wherein Lotus valve line is a prime product. Meanwhile, the company observed that this delay is not expected to bring any financial impact to its fourth-quarter and 2017 guidance.Boston Scientific has been trading below the broader industry over the past three months. The stock has lost 4.8% compared with the broader industry's 4.9% rise during the period. Zacks Rank & Key Picks      Boston Scientific carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

69,BSX,"A few months down the line, the Republicans will complete a full year in power. Unfortunately, since the political power change, the healthcare community hasn’t had many opportunities to rejoice.A survey report by Gallup Analytics last month revealed that  U.S. adults cited healthcare as the second major problem faced by the country under the new presidential administration. In fact, the debate over repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare has been raging for a while now. Per the report, it peaked when it reached the Congress in August. Considering the prevailing uncertainty in the implementation of the health policy, any respite from it in the near term seems unlikely.MedTech in the United States: A Blurred PictureNeedless to say, the current crisis  in the U.S. MedTech industry, an integral part of the broader healthcare space, shows no signs of abating. A few months back, companies  in the space were hopeful about the promised cancellation of the 2.3% MedTech tax of Obamacare under the new government. Unquestionably, the latest political developments have landed the MedTech space in an uncertain territory.Investors are mulling over whether they should retain their existing MedTech stocks or forego their holdings  in favor of companies in other industries to boost their financial resources. That said, in spite of what the future may hold, we believe investors should stick to the MedTech space as it has shown signs of prosperity in recent times globally.Yes, you read that right. Even considering the dull performance of the U.S. medical device market (that still holds the leading position with almost one-third of the world market share) on rising regulatory and legislative uncertainty, global growth has been quite encouraging. In 2016, this industry grew 5%, a pace last seen before the financial crisis.Emerging Markets Hold Immense PromiseThe uncertainty in the United States along with the worsening economic condition in Europe automatically shifted the focus to emerging geographies like China, India, Latin America and others.These emerging economies are seeing  a rise in the uptake of medical devices largely due to growing medical awareness and economic prosperity. An aging population, increasing wealth, government focus on healthcare infrastructure and expansion of medical insurance coverage make these markets a happy hunting ground for global medical device players. Add to it, rising healthcare spending and improving healthcare infrastructure, this growth should continue in 2017 and beyond.Going by a recent BCG report, the share of emerging markets, which is currently less than a quarter of global MedTech revenues, is likely to increase to nearly one-third of revenues by 2022. The MedTech market in China, currently the second largest in the world, is projected to grow about 13% annually from 2015 through 2022. India’s Medtech market, the fifth largest in the world, is currently demonstrating 17% annual growth. If this continues, India may give good competition to Japan and Germany by 2022.Among other emerging geographies, Latin America, even in the face of general economic stagnation, holds enormous potential. Per a January 2017 report by MedTech Intelligence, the Central and South American nations significantly increased per capita spending on healthcare in the period between 2008 and 2014. According to World Bank data, Guatemala increased spending by 27%, Brazil 31%, Chile 54%, Colombia 58%, Uruguay 95%, Paraguay 115%, Bolivia 138%, and Ecuador 139%. Lower domestic production in Latin America has made it as an open market for U.S. exporters. Investment in Emerging Market Players Looks SensibleIn such a scenario, we believe it will be wise of investors who are keen on MedTech stocks to keep an eye on companies who have turned the emerging markets into a happy hunting ground with their expertise and network. No wonder, these stocks, cashing in on the enormous growth potential of these emerging geographies have perfectly shielded themselves from the political turmoil within the United States.Let us look at a few MedTech players with significant emerging market presence.Given the huge potential in these regions, long back, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) had set up manufacturing and R&D centers in Brazil, China and India. The company’s medical device segment of emerging markets is growing three to four times faster than the developed markets. It has been doing business in China for nearly 30 years and is expanding further here on the back of the Synthes acquisition. Johnson & Johnson Price and Consensus Johnson & Johnson price-consensus-chart | Johnson & Johnson Quote Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) continues to lead the emerging market investment trend with about 50% of sales from this region. In recent quarters, sales in key emerging markets were up in double digits, driven by strength in BRIC as well as strong growth in several countries throughout Latin America, including Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Argentina.Abbott Laboratories Price and Consensus Abbott Laboratories price-consensus-chart | Abbott Laboratories Quote At Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report), in the last-reported first quarter of fiscal 2017, businesses in China, Latin America, and Southeast Asia showed sustained strength, growing in double digits. Overall, Medtronic remains confident about its long-term outlook for emerging markets.

70,BSX,"On Oct 9, 2017, we issued an updated research report on leading medical devices company, Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report).Over the past three months, Boston Scientific has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has improved 7% compared with the broader industry's 4.7% gain during the period.Among the recent upsides, worth mentioning is the company’s acquisition of Symetis, in a bid to fortify the European structural heart business. We are also encouraged by the company securing multiple product approvals both in domestic as well as overseas markets. Notably, the company received an FDA approval for the RESONATE family of ICD and CRT-D systems.Additionally, the market holds optimism on the stock, following the company’s recent release of an outline on sustained growth strategy, focusing on planned expansion in new markets and consolidating product lines across all business segments. The company particularly plans to launch products into high-growth adjacent markets with a strong potential to reap an incremental $13 billion in market opportunity by 2020.Boston Scientific Corporation Price and Consensus Boston Scientific Corporation Price and Consensus | Boston Scientific Corporation QuoteWhile adverse foreign exchange continues to pose challenges, we are concerned with the company’s recall of one of its prime products, Lotus range of heart devices. It is important to note that last quarter, foreign exchange headwind affected the company’s top line by $23 million and adjusted gross margin by 50 basis points.Also, a dull defibrillator sale within its core Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) continues to remain a drag for overall growth. The woes of a challenging economy and a competitive landscape persistently burden the stock.However, given the company’s bullish second-quarter 2017 results and several recent developments, we find quite a few positive factors to rely on. The company is leaving no stone unturned to reinforce its core businesses and invest more in global markets.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBoston Scientific carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the medical sector are Orthofix International N.V. (OFIX  -  Free Report), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

71,BSX,"Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) recently announced plans to acquire Campbell, CA-based privately-held company Apama Medical Inc. for a total value of around $300 million. This is in line with the company’s strategy to gain traction in the Electrophysiology market, which is poised to reach a value of more than $9 billion in 2017 (as per data by Articles Factory).The deal is slated to close in the fourth quarter of 2017, subject to customary closing conditions.Per the acquisition agreement, subject to the attainment of certain clinical and regulatory targets, Boston Scientific is scheduled to pay a maximum of $125 million in contingent payments between 2018 and 2020 along with $175 million in cash on an immediate basis. However, the company does not expect this buyout to prove accretive to adjusted earnings in 2017 or even 2018.Apama Medical is involved in research and development of Apama Radiofrequency (RF) Balloon Catheter System for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). Per management, AF is a heart rhythm disorder which has affected roughly 33 million globally.Through this deal, Boston Scientific aims to expand its suite of arrhythmia solutions which fall under the Electrophysiology sub-segment of the company. The company also intends to integrate its RHYTHMIA HDx Mapping System with Apama RF balloon system in order to enhance the visualization of the heart during ablation processes.Although Apama RF balloon is expected to receive CE Mark approval in late-2018, the AF-FICIENT study results presented at the AF Symposium Annual Meeting in January have been favorable.Interestingly, Boston Scientific’s Electrophysiology revenues improved in the last reported quarter on higher uptake of the new RHYTHMIA HDx platform. Management continues to roll out the HDx platform in Europe and recently initiated the same in the United States and Japan.Overall, the company continues to expand the toolkit that supports RHYTHMIA HDx, providing ablation technologies that match the excellence of its Mapping System and adding tools that expand the reach and utility of RHYTHMIA HDx in different procedure types. In this context, the company plans to launch IntellaNav MiFi Open-Irrigated Therapeutic Catheter in Europe and the United States in the third quarter.Moreover, Boston Scientific’s strategy to gain traction in the Electrophysiology sub-segment seems to be aligned with data provided by Allied Market Research.  Per the report, the global Cardiac Monitoring and Cardiac Rhythm Management market is expected to see a CAGR of 7.6% from 2016 to 2022 to reach a value of $32,216 million.We believe that unhealthy lifestyle and a rise in ageing population will continue to result in high incidence of cardiovascular diseases. This is further supported by data provided by GBI Research. Per the report, the global cardiovascular disease market will see a CAGR of 4.1% by 2019, and within this space, the U.S. market is expected to witness the highest momentum at a CAGR of 4.7%.Share Price PerformanceBoston Scientific has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Over the last month, the company’s share price has outperformed the broader industry. The stock has gained 7.2%, compared with the broader industry’s 1.4% gain.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksBoston Scientific currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the medical sector are Orthofix International N.V. (OFIX  -  Free Report), Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

72,BSX,"Abbott’s (ABT  -  Free Report) Ellipse implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) recently gained FDA approval for magnetic resonance (MR) conditional labeling. This should solidify the company’s footprint in the Rhythm Management space.Post-approval, patients implanted with an Ellipse device and Durata or Optisure leads will be able to undergo MRI scans. Moreover, Ellipse will now be available to patients suffering from severely high heart rhythms and in need of an ICD along with a MRI scan. Thus, we believe that this latest regulatory approval will expand the company’s customer base and drive its top line.Moreover, Ellipse is embedded with features known as Abbott's TailoredTherapy and is capable of directly, securely and wirelessly forwarding all therapy and related data to a patient's physician through the Merlin.net Patient Care Network.Continuing with its efforts to expand the MR-conditional labeling enabled devices, the company received FDA approval for MR-conditional labeling for Assurity MRI pacemaker and Tendril MRI pacing lead. Also, the company has received certain prior MR-conditional labeling approvals in Europe.Meanwhile, Abbott had applied for FDA approval of MRI-conditional labeling for its Quadra Assura Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillator (CRT-D) products and Quartet family of left ventricular leads.Interestingly, the company witnessed softness in its Rhythm Management segment majorly due to tough competition in the MRI-conditional category of products. The market is dominated by some well-established players like Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report), Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) and Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), among others.Abbott’s strategy to gain traction in the Rhythm Management sub-segment seems to be aligned with data provided by Allied Market Research.  Per the report, the global Cardiac Monitoring and Cardiac Rhythm Management market is expected to see a CAGR of 7.6% from 2016 to 2022 to reach a value of $32,216 million.We believe that unhealthy lifestyle and a rise in ageing population will continue to result in high incidence of cardiovascular diseases.

73,BSX,"Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report) announced positive clinical trial data from the Multisensor Chronic Evaluation in Ambulatory Heart Failure Patients (MultiSENSE) study. This study (based on 900 patients) was conducted to examine the performance of the HeartLogic Heart Failure Diagnostic to predict impending heart failure (HF) decompensation.The study demonstrated that HeartLogic Diagnostic iincreases the ability to classify patients at high or low-risk of experiencing a future HF event. Presently, physicians recommend blood test to diagnose HF or determine disease severity. However, this method is less reliable as the assessment loses relevance when patients’ conditions change. The MultiSENSE trial data showed that HeartLogic Diagnostic expanded the ability of a baseline blood test to identify patients at a high risk of a HF event.Notably, the HeartLogic Diagnostic is already CE Marked and FDA approved and will be available commercially later this year under the Rhythm Management segment.In the last reported second quarter, Rhythm Management was the second largest contributor to Boston Scientific's top line, which includes Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) and Electrophysiology. CRM reflected a 2% year-over-year increase in sales in the reported quarter.According to a report by GlobalData, the heart failure market is estimated to reach a value of $11.8 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 13.7%. Considering the huge potential of the market, we believe the latest development is a strategic fit.Over the past year, Boston Scientific has been trading above the broader industry. The stock has risen 23.1% over this period, as against a 9.5% gain of the broader industry.Estimate Revision TrendThe estimate revision trend has been favorable for the company. For the current year, seven estimates moved north compared with no movement in the opposite direction over the last two months. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the full year has increased to $1.25 per share from $1.24 over the same period.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBoston Scientificcarries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Amedisys, Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report).

74,BSX,"Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 27. Last quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.3%. However, it posted an average beat of 0.03% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayAhead of Boston Scientific’s earnings release, we believe, the quarter’s performance will be grossly impacted by the company’s product recall issue within Europe. Notably, earlier this year, the news surfaced that Boston Scientific is recalling one of its prime products, the Lotus range of heart devices from Europe because of device malfunctions.Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise  Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS Surprise | Abbott Laboratories QuoteThe company also delayed the submission of its U.S. marketing application for its Lotus Edge device. While ‘LOTUS remediation work’ is currently on track, this product line has little hope to return to the European and other markets before the fourth quarter. This may lead to a major setback for the company’s fast-growing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) business within interventional cardiology, which has high chances to severely weigh on the company’s second-quarter revenue results.This apart, the severe currency headwinds that Boston Scientific has been facing lately remain a concern. We note that as the company records 47% of its sales from international markets, it remains highly exposed to currency fluctuations. In 2017, Boston Scientific expects an unfavorable foreign exchange headwind to the tune of $125 million on revenues and 700 bps or 8 cents per share on earnings. Adjusted gross margin for the full year assumes a negative foreign exchange impact of 50 bps.From a positive angle, the company’s downbeat interventional cardiology business may get some sort of a boost with the company’s $435-million acquisition of Switzerland-based Symetis SA, a privately-held structural heart company.With the completion of the acquisition back in May, Boston Scientific should have already begun selling these valve systems in Europe and in other geographies outside the U.S.  The company believes that Symetis’ ACURATE group of valve products strongly complements its aortic valve platform.Integrating these technologies will not only diversify Boston Scientific’s structural heart portfolio but also provide cardiac surgeons with multiple TAVI offerings for varying patient pathologies and anatomy. We expect to see contribution from this development in the second-quarter revenue itself.Subsegments namely MedSurg is expected to demonstrate a consistent performance, led by endoscopy, while Urology and Women’s Health are also estimated to grow beyond market  levels, driven by investment strategies in key international geographies.As stated earlier, the company’s overall second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings are expected in the band of 30–32 cents per share on revenues of $2.19–$2.22 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS stands at 31 cents, while for revenues it is $2.21 billion.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Boston Scientific is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Boston Scientific’s Earnings ESP is 0.00% since both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 31 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Boston Scientific currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Please note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) from going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are three better-ranked companies you may want to consider, as our proven model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #2.
