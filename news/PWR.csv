8,PWR,"Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 were little changed early Wednedsay, after the major averages rose modestly on Tuesday.While Dow industrials components Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) and many shale plays remain in sharp downtrends, BP (BP), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and First Solar (FSLR) are among energy stocks that are approaching buy points. Crude oil prices rose for a fifth straight session ahead of OPEC's key meeting Thursday at which the cartel and key allies such as Russia are expected to extend production cuts for another nine months.X Dow industrials were trading just below fair value. S&P 500 index futures were flat. Nasdaq 100 futures rose fractionally.U.S. crude futures were little changed early Wednesday after the American Petroleum Institute said late Tuesday that U.S. crude and gasoline supplies fell last week. On Wednesday, the Energy Information Administration will unveil its official weekly petroleum stockpile and production figures.The July U.S. crude futures contract, which is now the near-month contract, rose 0.7% to $51.47 a barrel on Tuesday. Even though energy prices have rebounded sharply in the past few weeks, energy stocks have not roared back en masse. Exxon Mobil is moving sideways near its recent lows. Chevron is pinned below its declining 50-day moving average. Shale plays such as EOG Resources (EOG) and oil services giants like Halliburton (HAL) also haven't found their footing.But here are five energy plays that are faring well and near possible entries.The U.K. energy giant has been rallying strongly for the past month, building the right side of a base, though shares dipped 0.1% to 36.93. BP has a potential buy point of 38.78.BP's relative strength line is well off recent highs, signaling the stock's underperformance vs. the S&P 500 this year. That's a common problem for energy stocks right now. Generally you want to focus on stocks that are outperforming the broader market and moving out to new highs ahead of the share price.The Anglo-Dutch oil and gas titan slipped 0.2% to 55.16 on Tuesday, but it's a saucer-with-handle formation with an entry point of 56.35. Shares have surged in May after Royal Dutch reported $9.5 billion in cash flow in Q1.First Solar isn't as closely tied to oil or even natural gas prices. But ultimately fossil fuel prices are a benchmark for solar power. The more expensive that oil and especially natgas are, the more economical solar is.First Solar has formed a bottoming base with a 37.77 buy point above a handle. First Solar rose as high as 37.40 intraday Tuesday, closing up just 0.1% at 36.47.SunPower (PWR) rose 2.85% to 7.95 on Tuesday, moving above its 200-day moving average for the first time since early January 2016. SunPower is in a bottoming base, like First Solar, with a buy point of 9.29.Marathon Petroleum (MPC) is a refiner and gasoline retailer. Marathon Petroleum is in a flat base with a traditional buy point of 54.69, just above its 2017 high. Aggressive investors could see 53.62 as a potential alternative entry.Shares edged up 0.2% to 53.08.In Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei climbed 0.5% while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.1%. China's Shanghai composite sank 0.4% but that was off session lows.Looking ahead to Wednesday, highly rated Lowe's (LOW) and Dycom (DY) report earnings before the market open.

10,PWR,"U.S. diversified stock mutual funds extended their rally in February, picking up steam while tacking on 2.68% on average after gaining 1.83% in January, according to Lipper Inc.That reflected gains by the broad stock market, measured by the S&P 500, which advanced 3.97% last month after notching a 1.90% gain in January. But market leadership rotated back to more defensive sectors, reflecting growing caution among investors.""The more-defensive stocks did well, while cyclical energy and materials did not outperform,"" said Lew Piantedosi, who is lead manager of seven Eaton Vance funds, totaling $3.9 billion in assets. ""It was a complete reversal from the Q4 postelection market rally, which was a cyclicals rally.""Sentiment flipped back in favor of growth-oriented cyclicals after President Trump's address to Congress on the last night of February.But the tilt earlier in February toward cyclicals reflected investors' concern that Trump and the Republican-majority Congress may have a harder time than previously expected in implementing pro-growth policies.Reflecting the optimistic portion of February's market performance, health/biotechnology funds led sectors last month, gaining 6.72%.Among U.S. diversified stock fund categories, S&P 500 index funds led the way with a 3.87% gain.World equity funds lagged U.S. diversifieds, advancing just 1.90%, led by India region funds' 6.08% climb.Taxable bond funds eked out an 0.87% gain on average last month. Emerging markets local currency funds outpaced other taxable categories, rising 1.94%.Piantedosi is guardedly bullish, going forward. ""The bull market is in place until proven otherwise,"" he said. Many investors and market observers have tried to call a market top. But the economy keeps getting better, Piantedosi says. ""Corporate earnings keep getting better, and earnings support the market,"" he added.The wild card that could derail the rally is the political landscape, he warns.As long as the economy stays on track, Piantedosi likes the shift to digital by advertising. ""That benefits Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL),"" he said. ""And Amazon (AMZN) dominates online retail.""Another area he likes is biotech, which is producing a parade of treatments for diseases. ""Celgene (CELG) is a leader within cancer treatments,"" he said. ""It has an unbelievable pipeline. It is growing earnings north of 20% annually and trades at a 17-times forward multiple, just below the market multiple of 18.""IBD'S TAKE: Celgene is ranked No. 2 in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group. See which biomed/biotech firm is No. 1, and check out its easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data at IBD's Stock Checkup.In energy, he likes energy explorer and producer Anadarko Petroleum (APC) and field services provider Halliburton (HAL).He said, ""Anadarko is once again profitably growing production, generating significant cash flow and is attractively valued."" He added, ""Halliburton's exposure is mainly to North American shale, and with oil prices (steady) in the mid-50s, you're starting to see rig counts increase. That increases the need for field services. They put rigs together, service them, replace broken parts and so on.""He added, ""In consumer discretionary, it's hard to find good names. But there's Advance Auto Parts (AAP). They're an auto parts retailer. That sector is less susceptible to be Amazoned. Their business doesn't require a lot of capital expenditure, so it's a good cash flow type of business. And Advance got a new CEO three or four months ago. He's a supply chain expert, which is what Advance needs.""One key reason it is hard for investors to find consumer discretionary that names they like is because so many big-box retailers are getting kicked by online retailers, says James Abate, chief investment officer of Centre Asset Management and manager of its $125 million Select Equity (DHAMX). Add to that the risk that many will be forced to cope with higher costs stemming from the border adjustment tax — basically, a value-added tax on imports — proposed by Trump, Abate says.Names in the sector that he does still like include media company CBS (CBS) and specialty food retailer Whole Foods Market (WFM).Sporting an OK 86 Composite Rating from IBD, CBS is trying to clear a consolidation after a run-up that started in the fall.Whole Foods has a very weak Composite Rating of 20 from IBD and is trading at less than half its late 2013 high.The supermarket chain in January reinstalled co-founder John Mackey as sole CEO.Also, the Trump push for infrastructure construction should benefit a number of telecommunications and utility companies, including Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon (VZ), Abate says. Comcast has been running up since the election and is near its all-time high. Verizon, range-bound between 57 and 46 since July, is trading near 49, 12% below its 52-week high.Flow-control systems manufacturer Parker-Hannifin (PH) also stands to gain from infrastructure spending. Likewise, Quanta Services (PWR), which provides engineering and construction services. ""They should benefit from increased spending on pipelines and energy transmission projects,"" he said.The market faces risks in the form of geopolitical uncertainty, possible trade wars and rising stock valuations, Abate says. ""There's a lot of downside risk facing this market,"" he said. ""I expect a lot of volatility going forward.""RELATED:Mutual Fund Managers Cite Tech, Financial, Energy And Industrial Names They Like For '17

17,PWR,"Stocks quickly turned slender gains to losses Thursday, navigating mixed influences from overseas markets, early economic data and a raft of quarterly results.The Nasdaq slipped 0.3%. The S&P 500 and the Dow struggled with fractional losses. Volume was unusually soft on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE, suggesting large-scale investors were standing back from early trade.Today's stock market set out with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 recovering to narrow gains so far this week. The market's young uptrend is seeing some affirmative data points and has thus far managed to avoid distribution days -- days in which selling by institutional investors sends the market lower in rising volume. But a positive finish to the week would help bolster investor confidence.Europe's markets hung on to their early advances in afternoon trade, with the CAC-40 in Paris and London's FTSE 100 up more than 2% apiece.But a European rally and a positive surprise in January durable goods orders weren't enough to buck up investor confidence, as weekly jobless claims rose slightly more than expected, and the bulk of early earnings reports offered at least some disappointing news.The December Housing Price Index from the Federal Housing Finance Agency fit that same pattern, rising 0.4% -- good but below November's 0.5% increase and just missing consensus views for another 0.5% gain.Still, the Dow opened with two-thirds of its stocks positive. Nike (NKE) rose 1.5% to lead the index. Chevron (CVX) posted the widest loss, down 1.5%.Salesforce.com (CRM) topped the S&P 500 with a 10% advance. The cloud-based software leader posted Q4 results late Wednesday, with strong guidance drawing similarly strong support from investors. The advance stopped at the stock's 50-day moving average, which could present some resistance as shares attempt to climb the right side of a 37%-deep consolidation.Quanta Services (PWR) muscled 6% higher on above-forecast fourth-quarter results. HP Inc. (HPQ) dropped 7% following disappointing Q4 results.Among IBD 50 stocks, theater real estate investment trust EPR Properties (EPR) pared gains and was up more than 2% after an initial 5% surge. After Wednesday's close, the Kansas City, Mo.-based firm reported better-than-expected funds from operations, but a 7% revenue gain was just shy of estimates, and management lowered its guidance on full-year funds from operations. The move left shares in frustrated stasis, just below a 62.66 buy point.

73,PWR,"The first-quarter earnings season is well past the halfway mark, with earnings and revenue growth on track to reach its highest level in the last seven years.Around 267 S&P 500 companies have reported first-quarter 2018 financial numbers as of Apr 27, reflecting a decent performance across the earnings season. Total earnings for these companies increased 25.1% year over year on 10% higher revenues, with 76.8% beating earnings estimates and 73.8% surpassing top-line expectations. Based on the hitherto observed pattern, the first quarter is anticipated to register an impressive double-digit percentage earnings growth year over year.Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for S&P 500 companies are now expected to rise 22.6% on 8.4% increase in revenues. This represents an improved growth projection from the previous quarter, driven by a corporate tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data. Also, experts believe that the bottom line is likely to grow steadily in 2018 and beyond. Notably, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to rise 18.5% on a year-over-year basis owing to 5.5% improvement in revenues, which if realized will mark the highest annual growth pace for the index since 2010.Given this healthy backdrop, most sectors are anticipated to deliver an impressive performance in this reporting cycle. For instance, per the above report, 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors are projected to deliver double-digit earnings growth on a year-over-year basis. Only the Auto sector is expected to end the quarter with earnings decline.Of these high-flying sectors, Construction appears to be quite strong. For the sector, earnings are likely to increase 46.7% year over year, while revenues are anticipated to rise 17.3%. Moreover, factors such as a rise in GDP, low unemployment level, strong job additions and positive consumer confidence work in favor of the sector. Additionally, President Trump’s business-friendly policies, including tax cuts and repeal of regulations, are expected to mitigate some of the risks arising from the recent imposition of tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.Notably, per the latest U.S. Census Bureau report, construction spending during March dropped 1.7% from the previous month. However, for the first three months of 2018, the metric increased 5.5% compared with the same period last year. Amid this backdrop, it will be interesting to wait and see how some of the Construction stocks fare when the companies release their results on May 3.Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report), a premium engineering and construction firm is scheduled to report results for the first quarter of 2018. The company has surpassed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 8.4%. In the last reported quarter, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.1%. Notably, the company’s long-term prospects remain strong backed by existing growth opportunities in renewable energy, gas-fired combined cycle generation and air emissions compliance projects for current coal-fired power plants.Fluor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Fluor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Fluor Corporation QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $4,838 million, relatively flat compared with its reported value in the year-ago quarter.

74,PWR,"Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on May 3.The company's earnings surprise history is decent, with two beats and two misses in the trailing four quarters. In the last reported quarter, the company reported earnings of 45 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.3%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Consider  Quanta Services remains optimistic about the prospects of its end markets in both of its segments namely, Electric Power and Oil & Gas segments, over the next couple of years. Particularly, the company’s communications infrastructure services business seems to be performing brilliantly. Of late, the company is actively pursuing opportunities with various U.S. telecom and cable MSOs. With the larger diameter pipeline market expanding, and a multi-year cycle ahead of it, the company remains optimistic about its communications infrastructure services operations.Moreover, Quanta Services’ oil and gas segment outlook looks promising primarily owing to the improving mainline and natural gas distribution and integrity markets. Moving ahead, the company continues to expect healthy levels of base load work, including supporting midstream infrastructure, downstream support services and natural gas distribution. Additionally, it anticipates strong performance from pipeline projects driven by a considerable increase in large pipeline revenue contributions amid an active bidding and negotiating environment.Further, the company’s decentralized and entrepreneurial business model allows it to combat challenges that arise from a bleak macroeconomic scenario. Also, Quanta Services enjoys strong prospects in end markets supported by key growth drivers like an aging grid, shifting generation mix and grid modernization. These factors are expected to prove conducive to the company’s top line going ahead.Meanwhile, the company remains optimistic about its solid backlog levels, which are likely to grow further. This apart, its recent bolt-on acquisitions are anticipated to boost top-line growth in the quarter under review and beyond.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Quanta Services in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Quanta Services has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 32 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Quanta Services, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Quanta Services, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Quanta Services, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of the ESP. However, its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.As it is we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.28% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.

75,PWR,"The length of the current U.S. economic expansion cycle is nearing a record, which makes it tricky for investors to choose stocks for their portfolio. Ideally, we need companies that will perform well even when the economic cycle takes a turn for the worse. For instance, companies that are less dependent on discretionary spending will fare better when the economy treads downward.Also, companies with lower debt burdens will be more resistant to recessionary shocks. Recently, a fair bit of volatility has been witnessed in the market. This, coupled with hawkishness on the part of the Federal Reserve, indicate that the best course of action for investors right now is to play safe. For a portfolio, market anxiety can easily be balanced by investing in a less volatile industry.So which industry can guarantee stability during a recession?Screening Industries for SafetyLet’s get the obvious out of the way. In a recession, retailers rarely have the benefit of a floor on sales. Industries that deal in consumer staples witness lower margins as customers cut corners and shift habits.Focusing on infrastructure companies, their growth is likely to be hampered as new projects are delayed in a recessionary environment. However, infrastructure must be maintained, which grants such companies a steady, stable revenue base. Infrastructure companies have long-term master agreements with utilities to maintain and service pipelines, electrical grids or telecom equipment.The replacement of outdated and risky infrastructure is as essential. Doubtless these companies benefit from economic expansion. But this revenue base makes them a good choice in bad times too.Likewise, renewable energy calls for the improvement of existing electrical grids and construction of new power sources. Transmission and distribution spending are reaching new highs and are set to sustain the trend in the upcoming days. Innovative technologies like fracking require new infrastructure in under-developed regions, which gives another boost to infrastructure companies.Stocks that FitThere is one American company that stands out as a leading provider of infrastructure solutions — Quanta Services Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report). Other companies in the same space include Fluor Corp. (FLR  -  Free Report), Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report), KBR, Inc. (KBR  -  Free Report), and AECOM (ACM  -  Free Report). While all these companies provide exposure to the industry we discussed, it will be prudent to assess these companies comparatively as well.Assessing Stocks Under Different MetricsIn terms of earnings history, Quanta Services beat estimates just twice in the trailing four quarters, while Jacobs Engineering managed to generate four healthy beats with an average of 11.4%. Fluor has generated three strong beats in the trailing four quarters with an average of 8.4%.Quanta Services’ forward PE multiple stands at 13.4 right now, lower than the industry’s PE of 17.8. Jacobs Engineering is undervalued as well, with its PE of 15.  Fluor is priced almost at par with the industry, as its PE multiple currently stands at 17.7.In the past year, Quanta Services’ shares have lost 6.4%, which indicates that the company is trading at a discount right now relative to its growth prospects. In contrast, Jacobs Engineering’s shares have returned 8.1%, while Fluor’s shares have rallied 8.3%.However, what we are concerned about safety in turbulent times. Let’s take a look at the companies’ debt-equity ratios. Quanta Services’ debt-to-equity ratio currently stands at just 0.18, much lower than the industry ratio of 0.42. Jacobs Engineering compares unfavorably with the industry with a ratio of 0.43.  Fluor is also riskier than the industry in terms of debt burden, with a ratio of 0.46.Quanta Services’ inherent stability is underlined by its low beta of 0.86, which compares favorably to that of Jacobs Engineering at 1.54 and Fluor’s beta co-efficient of 1.52.Also, in terms of growth, Quanta Services is expected to grow 34.6% this year, higher than the industry’s growth expectation of 23.6%.Estimate RevisionsLet’s see how the analyst community currently feels about these stocks.Quanta Services, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has been attracting bullish analyst attention in recent times. The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has trended up from $2.47 to $2.65, in the past two months, which indicates that analysts expect good things from the company this year.Jacobs Engineering, which holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has also witnessed positive estimates revisions. Its Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings rose from $3.60 to $4.00 in the past 60 days, highlighting bullish analyst sentiment.Fluor sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has been enjoying favorable estimates revision activity. Its Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has jumped from $2.38 to $3.26 in the past two months.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Clearly, analysts are feeling optimistic about the space as a whole. The Engineering-R&D Services industry currently holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 72 out of more than 250 industries, and lies among the Top 27% of all industries. Positive industry developments will benefit the stocks as well.While all the stocks hold strong growth potential and enjoy favorable industry trends, in terms of valuation and financial stability, Quanta Services trumps Jacobs Engineering and Fluor. However, in terms of earnings history and Zacks Rank, Jacobs Engineering and Fluor beat Quanta Services.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

77,PWR,"Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Nov 2.Quanta Services has had a dismal earnings surprise history, with three misses and one in-line earnings over the trailing four quarters, for an average negative surprise of 4.5%. Last quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.4%.However, we expect Quanta Services to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Quanta Services has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Quanta Services has an Earnings ESP of +1.05%, as the Most Accurate estimate of 60 cents is pegged above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank of 3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors Driving the Better-than-Expected ResultsQuanta Services has been deriving sturdy benefits from the company’s diligent three-pronged growth strategy. The strategy focuses on the timely delivery of projects, leveraging on its core business areas to expand in complementary service lines and venturing into new service lines as well.Quanta Services’ thriving engineering and project management services are anticipated to bolster its revenues for the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Of late, the company has been witnessing a solid rebound in its end markets, on the back of key growth drivers, like an aging grid, shifting generation mix and implementation of clean energy initiatives. These factors will likely boost the segment’s top line.Moreover, the company is currently pursuing several high-voltage electric transmission award opportunities, amid substantial bidding activity, in Australia, Canada and the United States, which would reflect in the upcoming quarterly results. Quanta Services, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Quanta Services, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Quanta Services, Inc. QuoteQuanta Services raised its 2017 earnings and revenues guidance last quarter, and we believe its optimism stems from healthy backlog levels, which are anticipated to benefit the results in the to-be-reported quarter. Upbeat industry trends will act as major growth catalysts for the quarter to be reported.This apart, the company is likely to benefit directly from increasing U.S. production of liquid fuels. Also, Quanta Services wins more construction and engineering contracts as the performance and production levels of the energy sector increase. Robust pipeline projects in the oil and gas sector, supported by active bidding and negotiating environment, can also act as huge profit churners for the top line in the third quarter.In addition, Quanta Services’ previously completed acquisitions are likely to contribute significantly to the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment’s top line. Particularly, the recent Stronghold acquisition will drive the company’s revenues with increased penetration in downstream and midstream petrochemical markets, which, in turn, will be beneficial for the quarter under review.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

83,PWR,"Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Aug 3.Quanta Services has had a dismal earnings surprise history, with three misses and one in-line earnings over the trailing four quarters, for an average negative surprise of 17.3%. Last quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.5%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderQuanta Services has been deriving strong benefits from its diligent three-pronged growth strategy. The strategy focuses on the timely delivery of projects, leveraging on its core business areas to expand in complementary service lines and venturing into new service lines as well.Quanta Services’ thriving engineering and project management services are expected to boost its revenues for the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Of late, the company has been witnessing a solid rebound in its end markets, on the back of key growth drivers, like an aging grid, shifting generation mix and implementation of clean energy initiatives.Moreover, the company is currently pursuing several high-voltage electric transmission award opportunities, amid substantial bidding activity, in Australia, Canada and the U.S. Quanta Services’ optimism stems from healthy backlog levels which are anticipated to benefit the results in the to-be-reported quarter. We believe that these positive industry trends will act as major growth catalysts for the quarter to be reported.Quanta Services, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Quanta Services, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Quanta Services, Inc. QuoteThis apart, robust pipeline projects in the oil and gas sector, supported by active bidding and negotiating environment, can also act as huge profit churners for the top line in the second quarter. In addition, Quanta Services’ previously completed acquisitions are likely to contribute significantly to the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment’s top line.However, Quanta Services has been grappling with adverse weather conditions in recent times. In the last reported quarter, the company’s revenue growth was marred by regulatory delays on some large mainline pipe projects and fluctuations in timing of large projects. Also, the company believes that obtaining sighting and permission for energy infrastructure projects may continue to dent profitability.Going forward, the company expects fluctuations in backlog due to its faster book-and-burn nature and the timing of larger pipeline project awards. Moreover, there is the risk of oil and gas customers delaying commencement of work, which could impact margins in the quarter to be reported.Further, the initial optimism surrounding Donald Trump's infrastructure plan seems to have waned, as worries grow about the feasibility of the plan. The plan to improve America's infrastructure could have provided a welcome boost to Quanta Services’ operations and profitability.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Quanta Services will likely beat earnings estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is currently pegged at -6.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 47 cents is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Quanta Services’ Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP, but its negative Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Sempra Energy (SRE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +11.25% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is expected to release earnings results on Aug 4. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Galapagos NV (GLPG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +33.33% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is anticipated to release earnings on Aug 4.Calumet Specialty Products Partners, L.P. (CLMT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +26.09% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is likely to release earnings on Aug 4.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

84,PWR,"Shares of Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) rose on Monday after a BMO Capital Markets analyst upgraded the construction equipment giant, just one day before it reports its second-quarter financial results.BMO’s Joel Tiss said in a note to clients on Monday that he expects Caterpillar will be positively impacted by a surge in global construction, among other optimistic factors. Tiss raised his price target from $110 to $125 per share.Caterpillar’s stock is up 1.43% through afternoon trading, and it peaked just $1.50 below its 52-week high earlier today. The company is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and scored an A for Momentum in our Style Scores system.“A strong rebound in demand is likely a 2018 occurrence at the earliest, and the stock has historically jumped in earnest 9-12 months in advance of a cyclical pickup,” Tiss wrote in a note to clients. “If this pattern repeats, the shares could trade to our upside scenario.”According to MarketWatch, the BMO analyst also noted that he thinks shares of Caterpillar could “trade at a valuation that yields a long-term upside target for the shares in the range of $208 to $224.” If Caterpillar were able to double its stock price in the relatively near future, it would be an impressive move for a company with a market cap of $62.79 billion.Tiss noted three major reasons why he raised his Caterpillar price target. The first factor was the possibility of a global recovery in the construction industry.On top of that, the analyst pointed to Caterpillar’s push to cut cost and focus on profitability going forward. The company’s new CEO Jim Umpleby, who officially took over from former CEO Doug Oberhelman on January 1, is said to be driving this new cost-cutting initiative with a focus on making the company profitable for investors.Other Construction Stocks Caterpillar’s big upgrade on Monday has helped other companies in the infrastructure and construction industry.Shares of infrastructure company MasTec, Inc. (MTZ  -  Free Report), which operates heavily in the telecommunications sector, rose 2.65% through afternoon trading. The company reached just $0.40 below its 52-week high earlier today.Vulcan Materials Company (VMC  -  Free Report) and Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (MLM  -  Free Report) were both up marginally in afternoon trading. Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report), which works primarily with the oil, gas, and electrical industries, climbed 1.69%.However, some of the bigger infrastructure ETFs have not felt a boost from Caterpillar’s upgrade. iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB  -  Free Report), SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB  -  Free Report), and PowerShares Dynamic Building & Const ETF (PKB  -  Free Report) were all down marginally in afternoon trading.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

85,PWR,"Houston-based Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report) successfully accomplished the acquisition of Stronghold, Ltd. and Stronghold Specialty, Ltd. (Stronghold) against an upfront payment of $450 million.

86,PWR,"Shares of Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report) have surged about 13.3% in the past year compared with the industry’s rally of 1.2%. The price performance is backed by impressive earnings history. The company has an average positive surprise of 6.7%, beating estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters.Quanta Services is enjoying strong prospects in its electric power segment, courtesy of maintenance and replacement of aging infrastructure, generation mix shifting to more renewable and natural gas, grid modernization as well as regulations to improve grid reliability. Also, the company’s oil and gas segment outlook bodes well, owing to improving mainline and natural gas distribution along with integrity markets.Also, earnings estimates have moved up in the past few weeks, which indicate that sentiments on the company are treading in the right direction. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings rose 5.3% to $2.79.Also, earnings estimates for the next year have improved 5.2%. This positive trend reflects analysts’ bullish sentiments. Also, the company’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term.Let’s delve into the factors that will continue to propel Quanta Services upward in the near future. Electric Power and Oil & Gas Segments Bode WellQuanta Services is experiencing solid prospects in its electric power segment. Particularly, the company’s communications infrastructure services business is performing brilliantly. For instance, the company booked about $400 million of backlog with eight customers in the United States in 2017. The company is optimistic about communications infrastructure services operations, courtesy of expansion of larger diameter pipeline market and a multi-year cycle ahead.The Fort McMurray West 500 kilovolt transmission project, which is the single largest one secured by the company, continues to be a major profit churner and is currently undergoing construction. The North America electric transmission and distribution markets are expected to act as one of the key growth drivers for the company, as the region continues to deploy more capital in transmission and distribution upgrades to improve system reliability and deliver renewable electricity from new generation sources to demand centers.In a nutshell, growth of the electric power segment is expected to be fuelled by the need to maintain and replace aging infrastructure, generation mix shifting to more renewable and natural gas, grid modernization and regulation aimed at improving grid reliability.    Quanta Services’ Oil and Gas segment outlook looks promising, primarily owing to the improving mainline and natural gas distribution and integrity markets. The release of customer budgets, favorable weather and commencement of scheduled projects will boost results in the coming quarters.Going forward, the company continues to expect healthy levels of base load work including supporting midstream infrastructure, downstream support services and natural gas distribution. The company expects strong performance from pipeline projects, driven by a considerable increase in large pipeline revenue contributions amid an active bidding and negotiating environment.Solid contributions from these two segments are expected to boost revenues and earnings. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at 10.6% and earnings are projected at 41.6% for 2018.Encouraging Strategic BuyoutsQuanta Services considers acquisition as a fundamental component of its strategy to boost market share. In January 2018, the company completed the acquisition of Northwest Lineman College, a dominant educational and training organization. The buyout has enabled the company to offer training services across the entire lifespan of a line worker's career.In 2017, it closed the acquisition of specialized services company, Stronghold, which provides high pressure and critical path solutions to the downstream and midstream energy markets. Quanta Services was able to capture a greater portion of the industry operations and capital, on the back of this deal.Also, the company closed First Infrastructure Capital (“FIC”), a partnership between the company and select infrastructure investors, which is likely to provide opportunities for investments. FIC can offer approximately $750 million of capital for investment in infrastructure projects in markets served by Quanta Services. This partnership is a major milestone of the company’s broader strategy of partnering with customers and providing fully integrated, differentiated infrastructure solutions.Valuation Looks RationalQuanta Services has a Value Style Score of B, putting it in the top 40% of all the stocks we cover from this perspective. This combined with a good earnings growth prospects makes us reasonably confident that though the company is currently trading at a discount, it has ample opportunities in the near future.The company currently has a forward P/E ratio (price compared with this year’s earnings) of 12.7 compared with the industry’s 17.5. This indicates a more value-oriented path for Quanta Services compared with its peers.Industry Outlook PositiveThough the Zacks Engineering - R and D Services Industry underperformed the S&P 500 index’s rally so far this year, it carries a solid Zacks Rank. An impressive industry rank (among the top 18% out of 265 industries) indicates that the companies in this space are likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future.Other Stocks to ConsiderA few other top-ranked stocks in the same sector are Installed Building Products, Inc. (IBP  -  Free Report), PGT, Inc. (PGTI  -  Free Report) and Patrick Industries, Inc. (PATK  -  Free Report). All the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Installed Building Products, PGT and Patrick Industries have a long-term earnings growth rate of 30%, 19.3% and 12.7%, respectively.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider.

87,PWR,"KBR, Inc.’s (KBR  -  Free Report) global government services business, KBRwyle, recently secured a seat on a multi-award contract by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Engineering Research and Development Center.Per the contract, KBRwyle has been selected as one of the six prime contractors on the $900 million indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract, under which the company is entitled to provide rapid solutions for fixing problems identified through the Department of Defense's (DoD) Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&E) Program.This 10-year, cost-plus-fixed-fee contract also allows KBRwyle to assist the JT&E program in finding options for U.S. warfighters to achieve their missions. Moreover, KBR will also have the chance to bid on task orders issued by the JT&E Program Offices to address and resolve critical warfighter issues.KBR Banking on Government Services BusinessesThe company’s Government Services segment, accounting for more than 65% of its total revenues, has been performing pretty well. The segment performed impressively in the last reported quarter, driven by organic growth and new award wins from the U.K. Ministry of Defence, U.S. Air Force and Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division. The division’s revenues rose an impressive 31.5% year over year to $677 million. Further, the company expects growth across all key markets in the United States, UK and Australia on account of continued opportunities across the lifecycle of its projects.Recently, KBRwyle secured a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract modification from the Army Contracting Command. Per the deal, KBR will offer base life-support services to the U.S. Army throughout Iraq, supporting the Operation Inherent Resolve. Estimated revenues related to this one-year task order modification will be booked as unfilled orders in the Government Services business segment’s backlog. (Read more: KBR Secures Modification Contract From ACC to Support OIR).Share Price PerformanceKBR, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, has a robust inorganic strategy in place for expanding its market share. In this regard, the company completed the Stinger Ghaffarian Technologies (“SGT”) and the Aspire buyouts in April. These additions are in sync with its strategies to expand high-tech professional services across the Government Services sector and have helped the stock to gain 4.4% in the past three months, outperforming the industry it belongs to.The company remains optimistic about the prospects of both the buyouts, mainly on account of increased government spending across space and defense. We believe such strategic buyouts will likely give a major boost to KBR’s top line, going ahead.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the same space include Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report), Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report) and Gibraltar Industries, Inc. (ROCK  -  Free Report).Jacobs Engineering Group holds the same rank as KBR.

88,PWR,"AECOM (ACM  -  Free Report) recently announced that its joint venture with Aecon and SNC-Lavalin secured a Fuel Channel and Feeder Replacement (FCFR) contract from Bruce Power at the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station, located in Kincardine, Ontario. Valued at CAD 475 million, the joint venture will perform its work under Shoreline Power Group. Notably, AECOM’s interest in the deal will be booked in its backlog in third-quarter fiscal 2018.This project falls under Bruce Power’s Major Component Replacement (MCR) program - Unit 6, a part of its Life-Extension Program, which will enable Bruce Power’s units to operate safely through to 2064. Notably, under the MCR program, Unit 6 is the first of six reactors to be refurbished by Bruce Power.Work related to the deal will include removal and replacement of calandria tubes, pressure tubes and feeders, construction management as well as trade labor. The project is scheduled to start in June 2020 and expected to be completed in 2022.Separately, the joint venture also entered into a Preferred Supplier Agreement with Bruce Power. Per the terms of the agreement, Bruce Power will be able to award similar contracts to this joint venture for the remaining five units under the MCR Program.Our TakeAECOM has a diversified portfolio that comprises both designing and construction services. In addition, the company’s business is spread across a number of key markets that mitigates operating risks. It is also efficient in dealing with cyclical market volatility, which helps AECOM capitalize on upside of the company’s business during downturns. Currently, over 70% of AECOM’s profits are generated from infrastructure and defense markets that are poised to benefit from the favorable political climate both in the United States and abroad.In a year’s time, shares of AECOM have returned 3.3% compared with the industry’s increase of 0.4%. Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is witnessing robust prospects in all of its segments. Evidently, all three segments of AECOM performed impressively in the fiscal second quarter, with strong growth in building construction and steady improvement in Americas design business. Meanwhile, the Construction Services and the Management Services segments continue to benefit from higher margin work in the building construction businesses. At the end of the fiscal second quarter, the company registered an all-time high backlog of $50 billion. The company’s solid backlog levels, which are a key indicator of revenue growth, reflect significant opportunities in the forthcoming quarters.However, cyclical demand for the company’s services and currency fluctuations are likely to thwart growth moving ahead. Also, lower capital spending on part of major clients remains a major concern for AECOM. This apart, volatility in the oil and gas market, with declining prices and spending levels, has been hurting the company’s projects and orders.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report), KBR, Inc. (KBR  -  Free Report) and Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report). All these three companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

91,PWR,"When considering valuation metrics, price-to-earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice as calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy. However, price-to-sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development, generating meager or no profits.While a loss-making company with a negative price-to-earnings ratio falls out of investor favor, price-to-sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business. This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company's growth is not overvalued.A stock’s price-to-sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company.If the price-to-sales ratio is 1, it means that investors are paying $1 for every $1 of revenues generated by the company. So, it goes without saying that a stock with a price-to-sales below 1 is a good bargain, as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar’s worth.  Thus, a stock with a lower price-to-sales ratio is a more suitable investment versus a stock with a high price-to-sales ratio.Price-to-sales is often preferred over price-to-earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures. However, sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable.However, one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low price-to-sales is not an ideal choice. The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point, leading to further share issuance and a rise in market cap and ultimately a higher price-to-sales ratio.In any case, the price-to-sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick. One should also analyze other ratios like Price/Earnings, Price/Book and Debt/Equity before arriving at any investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry: The lower the price-to-sales ratio, the better.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry: The lower, the better.Price to Book (common Equity) less than Median Price to Book for its Industry: This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock.Debt to Equity (Most Recent) less than Median Debt to Equity for its Industry: A company with less debt should have a stable price-to-sales ratio.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are seven of the 21 stocks that qualified the screening:MGM Growth Properties LLC (MGP  -  Free Report) engages in owning, acquiring, and leasing casino resort properties in the United States.

92,PWR,"AECOM (ACM  -  Free Report) recently announced that Savannah River Remediation LLC — a joint venture led by AECOM — has secured a liquid waste management contract extension from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Savannah River Operations Office in Aiken, SC. Valued at $450 million, this contract extension is effective from Jun 1, 2018 to Mar 31, 2019. Notably, the value of this deal will be booked in AECOM’s backlog in second-quarter fiscal 2018.Per the deal, Savannah River Remediation will provide services including operation of the Defense Waste Processing Facility and Saltstone Processing Facility. Also, this AECOM-led joint venture will work on the progress of the Tank Closure Cesium Removal demonstration and construction project as well as the construction of Saltstone Disposal Unit 7. Notably, the company’s comprehensive experience in liquid waste disposition will help in managing the radioactive waste system at the site safely, thus reducing the area’s environmental risk.Existing Business ScenarioAECOM has been witnessing robust prospects across all of its business segments. Evidently, all three segments of the company performed exceedingly well in the fiscal second quarter, with strong growth in building construction and steady improvement in Americas design business. Meanwhile, increase in the proportion of higher margin work in building construction businesses is benefiting AECOM’s Construction Services and Management Services segments. Further, the company’s solid backlog levels may lead to solid revenue growth in the forthcoming quarters. Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s diversified portfolio comprises both designing and construction services. Also, its business is spread across a number of key markets that mitigates operating risks. Moving ahead, the company remains confident that favourable political climate will continue unlocking growth opportunities of the infrastructure and defense markets, which generate more than seventy percent of its profits. In a year’s time, shares of AECOM have gained 4% against the industry’s decline of 0.9%.However, volatility in the oil and gas market with declining prices and contracting spending levels has been hurting the company’s projects and orders. In addition, cyclical demand for AECOM’s services and currency fluctuations are likely to thwart growth moving ahead. This apart, lower capital spending on part of major clients remains a major concern for the company.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.

95,PWR,"AECOM (ACM  -  Free Report) recently announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, JT4 Limited Liability Company, has clinched a 15-year contract from the U.S. Air Force. This cost-plus-award-fee contract, worth $3.1 billion, is likely to be completed by Apr 15, 2033.

Work related to the deal will be executed at the 412th Test Wing and the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division in California, the Nevada Test and Training Range, the Utah Test and Training Range as well as the Space Test and Training Range in Colorado.Our TakeAECOM’s diversified portfolio comprises both designing and construction services. Also, its business is spread across a number of key markets that mitigate operating risks. In fact, more than 70% of the company’s profits are generated from the infrastructure and the defense markets that are poised to benefit from the favorable political climate in the United States and abroad. The global consensus toward the need for substantial infrastructure investments is expected to act as primary growth driver.Moreover, AECOM is witnessing robust prospects in all of its segments. The Construction Services and the Management Services segments continue to benefit from higher margin work in the building construction businesses. Furthermore, the company’s solid backlog levels, which are a key indicator of future revenue growth, reflect significant opportunities in the forthcoming quarters. In a year’s time, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has gained 1.3%, against the industry’s decline of 0.7%.However, volatility in the oil and gas market along with declining prices and contracting spending levels has been hurting AECOM’s projects and orders. This apart, cyclical demand of the company’s services and currency fluctuations are likely to thwart growth, moving ahead.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are KBR, Inc.

96,PWR,"General Electric Company’s (GE  -  Free Report) Power Services business recently entered into an agreement with Saudi Cement to upgrade the latter’s three GE 6B gas turbines at Hofuf plant, based in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Per the deal, GE Power will upgrade these turbines by installing its Advanced Gas Path (AGP) solution, which would enable Saudi Cement to boost power output and efficiency.Notably, this deal marks the first installation of GE Power’s AGPtechnology solutionto boost power generation productivity in a cement industry globally.

It clinched another service agreement from Ohgishma Power Co. Ltd. to upgrade three GE 9F gas turbines with AGP, DLN2.6+ and OpFlex technologies at the Ohgishima Power Station, based in Kanagawa.Our TakeGeneral Electric is poised for long-term growth backed by improved performances from the emerging markets like India and China. In order to focus more on its core business activities, the company has exited from the financial business and has increased its investments in key industrial businesses through restructuring, state-of-the-art technology, and R&D initiatives. Notably, General Electric’s three core segments — power, aviation and healthcare equipment — require advanced hi-tech products with a high degree of reliability. These products often generate higher margins and are likely to contribute to improved long-term growth.With the company boasting a strong international presence, significant portion of the company’s total revenues are generated from emerging markets. In fact, General Electric has been selling big-ticket items such as locomotives and power turbines to India and China. Moving ahead, it expects to benefit from these regions, given their faster economic growth.In the past three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 2.3%, outperforming the industry’s decline of 4.8%.Furthermore, General Electric’s solid free cash flow allows it to invest in product innovations, acquisitions and business development. This, in turn, offers the company a competitive advantage over its peers. Its stringent cost-cutting measures are also likely to improve profitability, going forward.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space include Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report), Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report) and Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report). All these companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

99,PWR,"When considering valuation metrics, price-to-earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice as calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy. However, price-to-sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development, generating meager or no profits.While a loss-making company with a negative price-to-earnings ratio falls out of investor favor, price-to-sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business. This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company's growth is not overvalued.A stock’s price-to-sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company.If the price-to-sales ratio is 1, it means that investors are paying $1 for every $1 of revenues generated by the company. So, it goes without saying that a stock with a price-to-sales below 1 is a good bargain, as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar’s worth.  Thus, a stock with a lower price-to-sales ratio is a more suitable investment versus a stock with a high price-to-sales ratio.Price-to-sales is often preferred over price-to-earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures. However, sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable.However, one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low price-to-sales is not an ideal choice. The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point, leading to further share issuance and a rise in market cap and ultimately a higher price-to-sales ratio.In any case, the price-to-sales ratio used in isolation can’t do the trick. One should also analyze other ratios like Price/Earnings, Price/Book and Debt/Equity before arriving at any investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry: The lower the price-to-sales ratio, the better.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry: The lower, the better.Price to Book (common Equity) less than Median Price to Book for its Industry: This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock.Debt to Equity (Most Recent) less than Median Debt to Equity for its Industry: A company with less debt should have a stable price-to-sales ratio.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are seven of the 19 stocks that qualified the screening:United Natural Foods, Inc.

103,PWR,"Investors are always on the lookout for companies that consistently yield good returns over a considerable time frame. Currently, the Construction space is one of the sectors that is enjoying multiple growth drivers. Per the U.S. Census Bureau’s data for January, the sector experienced positive year-over-year growth in terms of spending.Moreover, recovery in the housing market has led to an increase in property and other forms of real estate tax collections in recent quarters. This, in turn, is expected to allow a number of public agencies to boost spending, ultimately boosting construction activities further. Comprehensive tax cuts, pro-growth regulatory environment and sustained increases in defense spending are other major catalysts that bode well for this space.Given this backdrop, let’s focus on the comparative analysis on some key metrics of two companies in the Engineering - R&D Services industry falling under the broader Construction space — Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report) and AECOM (ACM  -  Free Report). At present, Quanta Services has a market capitalization of $5.55 billion, while that of AECOM stands at $5.79 billion.ValuationAECOM’s stock is presently trading at a forward P/E multiple of 12.2, while Quanta Services is trading at a multiple of 20.1. Relative to the industry’s PE multiple of 15, we see that Quanta Services is richly valued while AECOM is trading at a discount.Past One-Month Share Price PerformanceIn the past month, Quanta Services’ stock has gained 5.4%, compared with AECOM’s return of 4.3%.However, both companies trumped the industry’s modest increase of 0.3%. Zacks Rank While both Quanta Services and AECOM carrya Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), the industry is ranked #101 out of the 265 industries in Zacks coverage.Favorable infrastructure spending as well as strong US job demand has been driving the performance of the engineering, procurement and construction services providers from the Construction space. Notably, the Engineering - R&D Services industry currently falls within the top 38% of the 265 different industries tracked by Zacks. Thus, any positive industry developments should benefit both companies.Earnings TrendAs far as earnings history is concerned, Quanta Services has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the trailingfour quarters, with an average negative surprise of 1.4%. AECOM has delivered positive earnings surprises thrice in the trailing four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 17.4%. So in terms of earnings trends, AECOM clearly comes out as the better play.Estimate RevisionsFor 2018, Quanta Services witnessed four upward estimate revisions versus two downward in the last 60 days. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate moved north from $2.47 to $2.63, depicting bullish analyst sentiment surrounding the stock. AECOM’s consensus mark for 2018 also climbed from $2.66 to $2.69 on three upward estimate revisions versus none downward, reflecting bullish analyst outlook.Other Key FactorsQuanta Services is enjoying strong prospects in its electric power segment, fuelled by the need to maintain and replace aging infrastructure, generation mix shifting to more renewable and natural gas, grid modernization and regulation aimed at improving grid reliability. Also, the company’s oil and gas segment outlook looks promising, courtesy of the improving mainline and natural gas distribution, and integrity markets.Moving ahead, the company is expected to benefit from healthy levels of base load work, including supporting midstream infrastructure, downstream support services and natural gas distribution. However, Quanta Services' operations remain vulnerable to unpredictable weather, the timing of projects and customer budget releases.In the meantime, AECOM is witnessing robust prospects in all of its segments. Its Construction Services and Management Services businesses continue to benefit from higher margin work in the building construction and power businesses. This apart, the company’s solid backlog levels, which are a key indicator of future revenue growth, indicate significant opportunities in the forthcoming quarters.Bottom LineEven though Quanta Services and AECOM carry the same rank, the latter enjoys a lead in terms estimate revisions, valuation and earnings trend.Key PicksInvestors interested in the same sector may consider also Fluor Corp. (FLR  -  Free Report) and Owens Corning Inc (OC  -  Free Report). While Fluor sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Owens Corning carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

104,PWR,"Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has successfully acquired Northwest Lineman College (NLC), a dominant educational and training organization, in January 2018. Based in Boise, Idaho, Northwest Lineman College serves the electric power industry. Hence, this latest deal will allow Quanta Services to offer training services across the entire lifespan of a line worker's career. However, the terms of the acquisition were kept under wraps.Acquisition RationaleQuanta Services expects its end markets to continue to experience historic levels of capital and operating investments, thus increasing the demand for skilled labor. This acquisition will enable the company to meet the training and recruiting demands for its workforce. In addition, NLC’s ongoing development of natural gas distribution and communications curriculum will benefit Quanta Services as well as its customers. Furthermore, the application of NLC's educational models in all of the company’s service lines is expected to facilitate the development of extra curricula over time.Expansion PlansQuanta Services intends to pursue growth and develop incremental backlog through acquisition of companies or assets to improve its service offerings. In this context, one of the notable acquisitions made by the company in recent times is Stronghold — a specialized services company. Going forward, Stronghold is expected to provide Quanta Services access to a greater portion of the industry’s operating and capital spends. This apart, in 2016, the company completed five acquisitions, four of which were integrated in its Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment and one in the Oil and Gas segment.Our TakeQuanta Services is experiencing solid prospects in its Electric Power segment. Also, the company’s communications infrastructure services business is performing brilliantly. The company’s oil and gas segment outlook looks promising too, primarily owing to the improving mainline and natural gas distribution, and integrity markets. Going forward, the company continues to expect healthy levels of base load work including supporting midstream infrastructure, downstream support services and natural gas distribution.Moreover, Quanta Services’ growing engineering and project management services are anticipated to be among its key growth drivers. Additionally, the company expects a strong rebound in its end markets as it enters a renewed multiyear up-cycle for businesses.We note that Quanta Services’ optimism stems from healthy backlog levels, which are expected to grow further. Also, large high-voltage electric transmission project opportunities with numerous utilities and merchant transmission companies in North America bode well for long-term growth.

105,PWR,"Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Feb 22.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 63 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.8%. Overall, Quanta Services has a dismal earnings surprise history, having missed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average negative surprise of 2.8%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayQuanta Services remains confident about the prospects of its end markets in both of its segments — Electric Power and Oil & Gas — over the next two years.

For instance, at third-quarter end, the company managed to clinch more than $200 million of new contracts for several major North American communications companies.In the Unites States, the company is looking to expand its communications infrastructure as well. In this regard, Quanta Services is pursuing opportunities with various telecom and cable MSO customers.Moreover, the company’s thriving engineering and project management services are anticipated to be among its key growth drivers going forward. Also, Quanta Services has been witnessing a solid rebound in its end markets fuelled by key growth drivers like an aging grid, shifting generation mix and grid modernization. These factors are expected to prove conducive to the company’s top line in the coming quarters. The stock remains optimistic about its healthy backlog levels that are expected to grow further.Meanwhile, Quanta Services’ oil and gas segment outlook looks promising on improving mainline and natural gas distribution, and integrity markets. Going forward, the company continues to expect healthy levels of base load work including supporting midstream infrastructure, downstream support services and natural gas distribution. This apart, it is currently pursuing several high-voltage electric transmission award opportunities, which would reflect in the upcoming quarterly results.Additionally, the company’s Stronghold acquisition is likely to facilitate increased penetration in downstream and midstream petrochemical markets, consequently acting as a key factor influencing growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Quanta Services in the to-be-reported quarter.

107,PWR,"Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report) was chosen by NextBridge Infrastructure to construct the Ontario East-West Tie Line Project in northern Ontario through a competitive bidding process. The leading specialized contracting services company booked undisclosed value of the contract, which is expected to commence late next year and conclude in late 2020.Per the deal, Quanta Services, through its operating subsidiary, Valard Construction, will offer construction services including project management, material management as well as construction permitting. The company will also provide installation services for around 290 miles of double circuit 230 kilovolt transmission line connecting Marathon Transformer Station and Lakehead Transformer Station.The company will lend its expertise to safely and cost-effectively execute the project, which is intended to improve the long-term reliability of the electricity supply in northwestern Ontario. Further, the company believes the project is capable of creating up to 700 jobs during construction and providing extra economic benefits to the local community.Existing Business ScenarioCurrently, the company is pursuing multiyear capital programs, which include both large and smaller electric power infrastructure projects. Large high-voltage electric transmission project opportunities with numerous utilities and merchant transmission companies in North America bode well for long-term growth. Particularly, the North America electric transmission and distribution markets are expected to act as one of the key catalysts for the company.The company remains confident about the prospects of end markets in both of its segments, namely, Electric Power and Oil & Gas segments, over the next two years. The company’s oil and gas segment outlook also looks promising, primarily due to the improving mainline and natural gas distribution and integrity markets. Notably, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has returned 20.5% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 15.5%.Despite these positives, the company’s business is anticipated to be affected by uncertain global political and economic conditions. The current volatility in the oil and gas market, along with reduced consumer spending, has been affecting the company’s projects and orders. Further, the company’s considerable exposures to foreign currency risks have been weighing on financials.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks from the same space include Norbord Inc. (OSB  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) and NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report). While Norbord sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), D.R. Horton and NVR carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

108,PWR,"Construction sector stocks have performed well in the past six months, with the sector gaining 16.7% on average, more than double the S&P 500’s gain of 8.1%. We believe growth-conducive policies of the government and expectations of higher infrastructure spending drove the shares’ performance.Within the sector, the engineering and R&D services space has gained 15.8% in the same time frame, also outperforming the broader market comfortably.We shall focus on this space, particularly on a comparative analysis of three companies in the industry — Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report), Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report) and AECOM (ACM  -  Free Report). The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 70 (Top 26% in more than 250 industries).Price PerformanceBeginning with share price performance, Fluor rose 4.9% over the last six months. Fluor compares badly to Quanta Services as well as AECOM, which have charted an impressive trajectory of late, appreciating 20.8% and 14.2% during the same time frame. While AECOM still lags the industry’s average return of 15.8%, Quanta Services has soared past that as well.Earnings Trend Fluor has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the last four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 6.3%, while AECOM has managed to meet earnings estimates twice for as many beats. Quanta Services, however, has missed earnings estimates thrice, for an average negative surprise of 2.8% over the trailing four quarters.Recent Quarterly PerformanceIn the last reported quarter, all three companies witnessed revenue growth. Fluor’s revenue growth of 3.7% year over year helped it beat on the bottom line, driven by increased project execution activities for certain downstream, and mining and metal projects and several large multi-year decommissioning and cleanup projects.Quanta Services’ top line surged an impressive 27.8% year over year in its last quarterly report. Robust revenues generation at the Oil and Gas Infrastructure as well as Electric Power Infrastructure Services segments acted as the primary catalyst.AECOM’s revenues grew 12.3% year over year, driven primarily by Building Construction and Power business, and improvement in Oil & Gas business.Estimate Trend & Analyst OutlookFor 2017, Fluor has witnessed four upward estimate revisions in the last 30 days, which led to the Zacks Consensus Estimate rising 6.1% to $1.56. This signifies decidedly bullish analyst sentiment for the stock.On the other hand, Quanta Services’ Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has seen five downward estimate revisions and fell 2% over the last month to $1.97, underlining bearish analyst outlook. Analysts are not favouring AECOM either, as its Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved south from $2.75 to $2.66 over the last month, a fall of 3.3%.Growth ExpectationsFor the next year, we anticipate Fluor earnings to grow a whopping 46.4%, while Quanta Services’ and AECOM’s growth expectations are pegged at 23.7% and 10.5%, respectively.ValuationFluor’s stock is currently trading at a trailing-12-month P/E multiple of 17.4, which is cheaper than the industry’s P/E of 18. Quanta Services’ P/E is 19.8, while that of AECOM is 12.8. So we see that in terms of trailing-twelve-months P/E ratio, AECOM is the cheapest, while Fluor is also trading at a discount to the industry.VGM ScoreSince none of these engineering heavyweights are standing out particularly, let us review them using our VGM Score. This score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and pick the winners.Fluor and AECOM currently boast a VGM Score of A, while that of Quanta Services is F.Final CallEven though the three companies carry the same Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Fluor leads in terms of expected earnings growth, earnings surprise trend and estimate revisions. Its valuation is decent, and a top VGM Score further tilts the scales in favour of Fluor.A better-ranked stock in the same space is KBR, Inc. (KBR  -  Free Report), holding a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.KBR has beaten estimates twice in the trailing four quarters. In the last reported quarter, the company surpassed estimates by 16.7%.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

110,PWR,"Quanta Services Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report) is a leading national provider of specialty contracting services, and one of the largest contractors serving the transmission and distribution sector of the North American electric utility industry. Over time, the company has grown organically and made strategic acquisitions to expand its geographic presence.The company has been witnessing a solid rebound in its end markets, on the back of key growth drivers, like an aging grid, shifting generation mix and implementation of clean energy initiatives. The company’s decentralized and entrepreneurial business model has been driving growth in recent times. Also, favorable government regulations to generate significant incremental electric transmission investment are proving conducive to growth.Despite these positives, PWR has been grappling with adverse weather conditions in recent times. Also, unfavorable timing of revenues and corresponding income contributions of certain projects remain concerns for the company’s operational results.

111,PWR,"A few industrial companies are gearing up to report quarterly numbers later this week. The Q3 earnings season is in full swing, with about 272 S&P 500 companies having already reported results, reconfirming broad-based expectations of impressive earnings (as on Oct 27).Earnings of these companies (accounting for 64.2% of the index’s total market capitalization) are up 8.7% on 6.7% higher revenues. Of these companies, 75.7% have surpassed earnings estimates, with 66.2% coming ahead of revenue estimates.As per the latest Earnings Preview, dated Oct 27, data projects that total earnings for the S&P 500 companies are now on track to be up an impressive 5.4% from the year-ago period, on 5.5% higher revenues.The Industrial Products space (which accounts for about 2% of the S&P 500 index’s total market capitalization) is anticipated to chart the highest earnings growth rate this quarter amongst all Zacks sectors. In fact, its earnings are on track to be up 18% in the quarter, on 4.2% higher sales compared with last year.The Industrial Products stocks have performed well in the past six months, with the sector gaining roughly 10.4%, outperforming the S&P 500’s rally of 7.6%. We believe growth-conducive policies of the government and expectations of higher infrastructure spending drove the shares’ performance.Further, there are economic indicators which point toward a strong operating environment for the industry. Industrial production — which measures the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors — grew at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter, led by robust growth in mining and utilities. Other tailwinds are the strengthening housing, automotive and commercial construction markets, as well as steady growth in new job additions. These indicators bode well for the industry.Let’s have a look at how some industrial companies are positioned, ahead of their scheduled announcements this week:Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report) offers engineering, procurement, construction and maintenance services through a number of subsidiaries. The company also provides its operations and maintenance services to major industrial clients. It has a decent earnings surprise history, having beaten estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 9.9%. In the last reported quarter, the company surpassed estimates by 22%.Fluor is unlikely to beat expectations this quarter. Though the company has a positive Earnings ESP, its Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) makes surprise prediction difficult. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 58 cents. (For more details, read: Fluor to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in the Cards?)For a possible earnings beat, the company should have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold). It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.

Last quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.4%.However, our quantitative model hints at a likely earnings beat for this Zacks Rank #3 company in Q3.
