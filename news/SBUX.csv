0,SBUX,"Starbucks (SBUX) Chairman Howard Schultz will leave the coffee chain later this month, bringing to a close a nearly four-decade run at the company that ushered coffeehouse culture into mainstream American life and carved out a global restaurant empire to rival McDonald's (MCD).XSchultz, 64, who helped grow Starbucks from 11 stores to more than 28,000 in 77 countries, will become chairman emeritus on June 26. Myron Ullman will take over as the new head of the board, the company said in a statement.His exit will likely fuel speculation he could be gearing up for a presidential bid. In a letter to employees announcing his exit, he said that he is ""thinking about a range of options for myself, from philanthropy to public service, but I'm a long way from knowing what the future holds.""Schultz's announcement was calculated to make a big splash. He gave an extended interview to the New York Times in advance, with an interview on CNBC scheduled for Tuesday morning. If Schultz decides to make a bid for the presidency, he could lean on the experience of one of a longtime board member, the former presidential candidate and ex-Senator Bill Bradley.Schultz is leaving a Starbucks that is still growing in the U.S. -- but not at the spectacular rates of the past. The company, now one of the world's largest restaurant chains, is betting big on China, where it plans to more than triple revenue in the next five years. But investors have been underwhelmed by the company's new outlook, with the shares falling about 11% in the last year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The chain closed about 8,000 company-owned stores for an afternoon of anti-bias training last week, a decision that some shareholders questioned for the expense.Last April, Schultz transitioned from chief executive officer to executive chairman, where he oversaw the company's social impact initiatives. He also was working on growing the chain's premium Reserve brand that includes flagship roastery locations, as well as the partnership with Italian bakery Princi. His top lieutenant Kevin Johnson took over the CEO role last year.New chairman Ullman is a retail executive, who left the helm of J.C. Penney (JCP) in 2015 after stints at LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA and what's now Macy's (M).Schultz will be spending more time with his family this summer, as well as working on a book about the chain's social impact, the company said.Shares fell as much as 2.8% in late trading after the announcement.

1,SBUX,"It's no secret that Starbucks (SBUX) is laser-focused on growing its presence in China, and the java giant announced Tuesday plans to ramp up store openings to 600 annually. The goal is to have 6,000 stores in the country, more than tripling revenue and more than doubling operating income there by the end of fiscal 2022 vs. 2017.""No Western company or brand is better positioned to evolve with the rapidly expanding Chinese middle class — and we continue to mindfully evolve a coffee culture in China where the reward will be healthy, long-term, profitable growth for decades to come,"" said Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson in a statement. ""We are committed to long-term investment in China.""That's not the first time Starbucks has ramped up its China plans. Less than two years ago, the chain created goals to lift its store count to 5,000 by 2021, which was already a slightly accelerated version of its previous targets.There are currently around 3,300 Starbucks locations in China, which means the company is looking to nearly double its overall store count over the next four years.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been trending lower for more than two years.Starbucks and Nestle recently inked a $7.15 billion deal, giving Nestle the rights to sell packaged Starbucks coffee abroad. Starbucks said Wednesday that it is planning to leverage that partnership to bring more off-the-shelf packaged coffee to Chinese consumers.Stateside, the ubiquitous coffee shop chain's promotion and marketing strategies are undergoing a makeover. Instead of its broad-based ""Frappuccino Happy Hour"" promotion on summer afternoons, it is now targeting certain customers with invitations to buy discounted espresso beverages — and hopefully sign up for its Starbucks Rewards program.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Frappuccinos, Sometimes: Starbucks' New Strategy To Grow Rewards MembershipHere's How McDonald's Will Invest $6 Billion In The U.S. Through 2020Cashless Stores And Cryptocurrency: What Is Starbucks Up To?Still Bullish On Bitcoin?

3,SBUX,"Americans' long-running joke about a Starbucks (SBUX) on every corner may be nearing its end.The coffee behemoth is retrenching in its home market as it contends with sales growth that Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson acknowledges isn't fast enough. The cafe chain said Tuesday it expects comparable sales to rise just 1% globally for the current quarter—the worst performance in about nine years. That's well below the 2.9% analysts were expecting, according to Consensus Metrix.Starbucks also plans to close about 150 company-operated stores in densely penetrated U.S. markets next fiscal year, three times the number it historically shuts down annually.""Our growth has slowed a bit,"" Johnson said in an interview. ""I expect better, I think our shareholders deserve better, and we're committed to address that.""At the same time, the company appears headed for a tough quarter in China, with comparable sales flat or slightly negative in the current period, Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw said in a presentation. China remains a key market for Starbucks, with the chain betting that revenue there will triple over the next five years.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAlthough business abroad has been booming and the chain has been opening more and more cafes, U.S. sales growth has stalled for the company that brought espresso to the masses. With about 14,000 stores domestically, Starbucks is now pumping the brakes on licensed and company-operated locations, with a renewed focus on rural and suburban areas—not over-caffeinated urban neighborhoods where locals already joke that the next Starbucks will open inside an existing store.The closing stores are often in ""major metro areas where increases in wage and occupancy and other regulatory requirements"" are making them unprofitable, Johnson said. ""Now, in a lot of ways, it's middle America and the South that presents an opportunity.""For the ubiquitous chain, moving slower and shutting unprofitable stores may trigger some deja vu. In 2008, longtime leader Howard Schultz returned to the company that was struggling after expanding too quickly across the U.S., giving competitors like McDonald's (MCD) a chance to elbow back into breakfast. Investors cheered as Schultz retook the helm and closed some underperforming stores, and share prices at the chain have been up eight of the last 10 years. So far this year through Tuesday's close, shares have been essentially flat.But now, with Schultz stepping back from his beloved company, the task of the righting the ship will fall to Johnson, who took over as a CEO just over a year ago. Schultz, who had already transitioned away from running the coffee chain's day-to-day operations, announced earlier this month he'd be leaving the company, fueling speculation he could be gearing up for a political career. Veteran retailing executive Myron Ullman is taking over as the new head of the board as Schultz departs.While Schultz had been trying to expand the Seattle company's premium business, dubbed Reserve, along with Italian bakery Princi, analysts have speculated that these may be put on the back burner under the new leadership. The company is also facing a resurgent McDonald's, which has been advertising $2 cold-brew coffees, along with other steep discounts from fast-food rivals.""The competitive environment has really become a lot stronger in the U.S. and a lot of that is the fast-food chains really improving the quality and breadth of their offerings in terms of hot beverages and breakfast,"" said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Bartashus. Americans can ""get that same flavor profile at a much lower price somewhere else. That becomes an area of concern for Starbucks.""Starbucks has also faced backlash this spring after two black men were arrested at one of its stores in Philadelphia while waiting for a meeting to begin. The company and Johnson apologized, calling the arrests ""reprehensible."" Last month, Starbucks closed about 8,000 cafes so its employees could undergo racial-bias training, which did hurt sales in the quarter, Johnson said. After stores reopened following the May 29 training, sales have started to rebound at U.S. locations, with the chain expecting domestic same-store sales growth of around 3% in June, according to the company.The company now expects to report adjusted earnings of between $2.39 and $2.43 per share this fiscal year, down from an earlier forecast of $2.48 to $2.53, according to an investor presentation.""The competitive environment has really become a lot stronger in the U.S.""Starbucks says it can attract more diners in the U.S. with new menu items and will focus on its expanding tea business, as well as capitalizing on health and wellness trends. Starbucks just added a new mango-dragon fruit iced drink to its permanent menu in the U.S. and Canada. And it's focused on improving its food lineup with sous vide egg bites, plus a new line of lunch salads and sandwiches that it's expanding across the nation.""We're putting more of our energy into that afternoon day part and the portfolio of beverages that are offsetting some of the declines we're seeing in Frappuccino beverages,"" Johnson said, citing a consumer shift away from sugary drinks. The company is also preparing to ""lean into more plant-based beverages,"" he said, noting that a new plant-based protein cold-brew drink will be introduced this summer.The chain is also relying on its digital initiatives to contribute between 1 and 2% to comparable sales next fiscal year. There's going to be a new way for non-rewards customers to earn stars and rewards starting next spring, allowing visitors to cash in on loyalty without fully signing up.On Tuesday, Starbucks said that it will return more cash to shareholders—about $25 billion in buybacks and dividends through fiscal 2020, representing a $10 billion increase from the previous guidance. Additionally, it plans to cut general and administrative costs, and has hired a consultant to help in this area. It's also exploring options to license some company-operated stores ""in other appropriate markets,"" it said.The company earlier this year said the cash it got from a licensing deal with Nestle SA would go to support the company's growth in the U.S. and China, where its expansion has been explosive. Starbucks plans to more than triple revenue in China in the next five years and open a new store every 15 hours through 2022 in that market. Johnson confirmed Tuesday that China may one day be a larger market for Starbucks than the U.S.""The China market still offers a lot of potential,"" Bartashus said. ""But the current political environment with trade wars looming or the governments picking at each other—it definitely casts a shadow over the long-term prospects for large western brands that are in China.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:IBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

4,SBUX,"When you drink a cup of coffee, you can avoid getting burned badly by taking sips instead of just gulping it down.It's much the same in investing. If you find a stock with top-notch fundamentals and technicals, don't jump in all at once. Start by using a portion of your allotted capital for the trade and build up into a full position as the stock rises.This process of pyramiding a position is a way to enter a trade and at the same time reduce risk. Investors can use all of their allocated capital and buy their entire position at one time. But just be aware that while you can make more money this way, you can also quickly lose more money by going all-in.For example, if you use $10,000 to buy 200 shares of a $50 stock, all of your initial investment is at risk. If the stock falls 8% and you adhere to the golden rule of investing, you'd lose $800. If you started with half of a $10,000 position, or $5,000, you'd lose less if you were forced to cut losses at 8%.Pyramiding involves making multiple purchases to build your position. You can divide your purchases into three installments.For your first buy, use half of your maximum capital that you would allocate for a single stock investment. So if you have $10,000 to invest, use $5,000 for your initial position. Start things off right by buying a leader once it goes through the buy point of a proper base in volume that's at least 40% above average.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOnly buy more shares if the stock moves 2% to 2.5% above your initial purchase price. If it does, use 30% of your allotted capital for your second buy. Now you're 80% invested.If the stock goes up another 2% to 2.5% from your second buy point, use the remaining 20% of your allocated capital for your final buy. Now you're fully invested and the stock is acting right.Pyramiding is smarter, as you're only putting more money to work after a stock has proven that it can go higher. What you are essentially doing is averaging up, the opposite of average down. The latter is often a losing proposition.On Oct. 12, 2010, more than a year after the March 2009 market bottom, Starbucks (SBUX) bolted past a 26.67 entry from a cup-with-handle base in about twice its average trade (1). An initial position that made up 50% of your designated full stake could havebeen put on there.A second buy could also have been established Oct. 12 — the same day as the breakout — or in the next few trading sessions as shares rose more than 2% past the 26.67 trigger.A final buy in Starbucks could have been made as early as Oct. 14 as it rallied 4% past the initial 26.67 buy point (2), near 27.74.The stock rose 25% by early January 2011 before pulling back to its 50-day moving average.Let's examine a more recent example in Shake Shack (SHAK). The fellow retail restaurant group member sprinted up to a peak of 96.75 in just 16 weeks after its NYSE debut in January 2015 at 21 a share. The stock then melted into a long, deep correction lasting years.But 2018 is a different story.The premium hamburger and shake chain broke out of an excellent 17-week cup with handle on April 26. The stock rallied 2.15, or 5%, to 45.40. Volume edged 13% above its 50-day average. The buy point was 44.50, a dime above the highest price within the handle.Let's say you wanted to invest $50,000 in Shake Shack. You could buy roughly $25,000 worth, or 560 shares, as soon as they hit a price of 44.50. Once the stock rallied 2.5% above the 44.50 correct buy point, or 45.61, then you could add another 330 shares.The time to do that? The next day, April 27.Shake Shack bolted 1.85 points, or 4.1%, and got as high as 47.50 intraday. That marked a new 52-week peak. Volume improved to a 69% jump vs. usual levels.Your total stake now: 890 shares, $39,971.30 deployed, average cost of $44.91 a share.The session on April 27 proved so strong that you could have completed the full position with the third buy of 215 shares at 46.73 apiece ($10,046.95).Three layers of goodness. Just five sessions later, Shake Shack rocketed up 18% and hit new multiyear highs following strong Q1 results (earnings up 50% on an adjusted basis, sales up 29% to a quarterly record of $99.1 million).Today, shares are trading around 64, up a beefy 41% from your average cost of $45.27 a share in the full position.(Editor's Note: A version of this article originally ran in the Jan. 24, 2012, edition of IBD.

5,SBUX,"Free Markets: Big businesses in Seattle face a substantial new tax to build more affordable housing. This is after the city thwarted private developers who were building affordable housing on their own dime. Only to government officials could this make any sense.This week, the city council unanimously passed a ""head tax"" of $275 per full-time worker on any company in the city that makes more than $20 million in gross revenues. The city says the $48 million in new taxes will go toward affordable housing and providing emergency services for the city's swelling homeless population.Major employers like Amazon.com (AMZN) and Starbucks (SBUX) opposed the tax, so naturally they became the villains of the story. How could anyone be opposed to taxing mega-corporations to build affordable housing?What all the news accounts fail to mention, however, is that the city itself is to blame for the housing shortage and skyrocketing rents.As IBD noted, from 2010 to 2013, the city saw an explosion in the construction of ""congregate housing units"" — basically, affordable, dorm-room size apartments with shared kitchen and living areas. Within those three years, private developers constructed 1,800 units. But by 2015, not one was built.Why? In 2014, the city stepped in and smothered this option with regulations that required the apartments to be bigger, banned them from more desirable areas, and forced builders to jump through costly design reviews.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSeattle's then Mayor Edward B. Murray warned the council in 2014 that this would exacerbate the city's housing problems, telling the council ""our regulations need to help and not hinder the process and the outcomes we are hoping to achieve. And one of those achievements is more housing. That is a priority."" The council ignored his entreaty.David Neiman, principal at Neiman Taber Architects, said that as a result the city government ""strangled a practical, modest, sustainable, unsubsidized form of inexpensive living that held enormous potential both for Seattle and for the rest of Cascadia.""Under the new rules, developers could put half as many units in each building, Neiman said. That, of course, raised rental prices considerably.Was this micro-housing option for everyone? Of course not. But there are plenty of young people who care more about location and low rents than a spacious kitchen and a family room. The private market was meeting that need.Seattle officials nevertheless deemed such housing as ""beneath human dignity"" — as though living on the street is more dignifying.So now Seattle, after having hampered private developers from building more affordable housing, is forcing its biggest and most successful businesses to cough up $48 million more in taxes so the government can do it.How much do you want to bet that the new tax does nothing to relieve the city's homeless problem? After all, Seattle and King County spent almost $200 million on homeless programs last year, according to the Seattle Times, only to see the number of homeless increase. Don't be surprised if, a few years from now, city officials hike the head tax on the promise that — this time — it will work.Seattle's leaders don't seem to understand that taxing success to reward government failure won't work for long. Eventually, Starbucks and Amazon and other businesses will simply pick up and move to places with friendlier, more-competent governments.Seattle might solve its housing shortage, but it will end up creating a new one: A shortage of jobs and opportunity.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Government Meddling Is Killing Affordable Housing In SeattleTax Revenues Jump 13% To Record High In April — When Will Dems Admit They Were Wrong About Trump's Tax Cuts?The 3.9% Unemployment Rate Doesn't Mean A Tight Labor Market

There's a good chance it will surprise on the upside.Economists expect average hourly wage growth of 2.7% from a year earlier, same as in March. Yet a host of large companies including CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX) and Target (TGT) have announced wage hikes rolling out this spring that may start to show up in Friday's report.This year is beginning to look lot like 2016, when wage gains accelerated into summer after Walmart (WMT) hiked its base wage to $10 an hour. Then Target, Costco (COST) and others followed. Walmart's minimum wage hike to $11 an hour has contributed to the same kind of dynamic early this year. Target subsequently hiked its base pay to $12 an hour and CVS to $11 an hour.And as those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same.

13,SBUX,"Starbucks (SBUX), faced with concerns of slowing growth, outlined on its earnings call late Thursday its new promotions and marketing strategy to bring more java drinkers to its U.S. cafes.While its summertime Frappuccino Happy Hour, i.e. a broad discount available to anyone who happened to walk into a Starbucks at the right time of day, ""worked for a few years,"" the offer has not been as appealing ""from a profitability standpoint"" in recent years, said management.The company now plans to structure its offers in a more targeted fashion, and on a range of products beyond Frappuccinos throughout the year. In late March, the coffee shop chain said that only customers who had received invitations would be able to get 50% espresso beverages from 3 p.m. to close. Those invitations come via email or the Starbucks app.So far, the results have been encouraging. The company tried out its new  approach during the quarter and reported ""strong incremental profit"" that ""appealed disproportionately"" to customers that were not yet signed up for its Starbucks Rewards program, said executives on the call Thursday.""We are optimistic about what we saw in response to happy hours and we are seeing greater response from happy hours from our non-(rewards customers) versus (rewards) customers, so everything is very early, but it's very promising,"" said Starbucks Global Chief Strategy Officer Matt Ryan.The company said it also plans on introducing a new Frappuccino next week.Shares are sliding late after closing up 2.9% to 59.38 in the stock market today, gapping up above their 50-day average, as the stock builds the handle in a cup-with-handle base with 60.80 entry point.After the closing bell Thursday, Starbucks met Q2 earnings views and just squeaked by revenue forecasts, following Dunkin' Brands' (DNKN) solid earnings beat in the morning.Starbucks posted EPS of 53 cents on sales of $6.03 billion. Same-store sales rose 2% globally and in the U.S., said the company.Zacks Investment Research analysts expected an 18% rise in profit to 53 cents a share on 11% revenue growth to $5.899 billion, per Zacks Investment Research. Same-store sales at company-owned locations were seen growing 1.9%, including 1.8% comps in the key Americas market, according to Consensus Metrix estimates.""While we continue to be pleased with the sustained growth from espresso, tea, and improvements in throughput during peak hours, we still worry that SBUX does not have the meaningful initiatives to improve its sales trajectory to support valuation expansion,"" wrote Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh late Thursday, before the call started.For the year, Starbucks reaffirmed fiscal 2018 guidance for $2.48-$2.53 EPS and high-single-digit revenue growth, but noted that the current outlook doesn't account for its planned store closings on May 29.Management remained bullish on its plans for China, an area of growth for the company.Starbucks only has a Relative Strength rating of 46, meaning that it is outperforming 46% of other publicly traded companies.

16,SBUX,"The economy added 164,000 jobs in April as the jobless rate fell to 3.9%, the lowest since 2000. Yet wage growth, the key number for stock market investors on edge about more Fed rate hikes, surprised on the downside, coming in at 2.6%.The jobs and wage data slightly lowered odds of four Fed interest-rate hikes in 2018, which should be positive for the stock market. The data didn't initially provide much of a boost. The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite opened moderately lower after the jobs data, but the major market indexes staged a midmorning rally, fueled by Apple (AAPL). The Nasdaq led the way into positive territory, soon followed by the Dow Jones and S&P 500.Wall Street expected 191,000 new jobs, 4.0% unemployment and a 2.7% annual rise in average hourly wages. Yet the undershooting on two of three key jobs metrics may make the job market look less robust than it is.First, job gains in the prior two months were revised up by a combined 30,000, leaving the 3-month average at a rock-solid 208,000.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFurther, Jefferies economist Thomas Simons noted that wage growth is sometimes depressed in months that the Labor Department's survey of businesses doesn't include the 15th of the month, which occurred in April. If that's the case, wage growth could take a leap in May. However, March's wage gain was also revised down, from 2.7% to 2.6%.Jim Baird, chief investment officer for Plante Moran Financial Advisors, noted that other gauges of wage growth have pointed to stronger gains. The Employment Cost Index released last week showed that private-sector wages and salaries grew 2.9% from a year ago in March.After the jobs data, the 10-year Treasury yield eased to 2.935% while the 2-year yield, which more closely tracks Fed rate expectations, held around 2.49%. The narrow spread between long-term and short-term interest rates may reflect concerns that the Fed will hike rates too much in the near term as the economy gets a boost from tax-cut and spending stimulus, leading to an economic letdown.The stakes have increased for each jobs report as inflation has picked up close to the Fed's target 2% and interest rates have hit multiyear highs. The combination of low and falling unemployment with accelerating wage gains would fit perfectly with the Phillips curve theory that has long guided Federal Reserve policy. For investors, the key point is that most Fed policymakers still seem confident that inflation pressures won't lag too far behind wage pressures, as businesses pass along a portion of their higher wage bills.To some extent, it's already happening as the Fed's favored gauge of core inflation hit 1.9% in March. Meanwhile, Wall Street has bumped up odds for a fourth rate hike this year to about 40%. Still, the Fed signaled on Wednesday that it won't be overly concerned if inflation rises a bit above 2% for a few months.There's good reason to expect a further pickup in wage growth in coming months. A host of large companies including CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX) and Target (TGT) have announced wage hikes rolling out this spring that may start to show up in Friday's report.This year is beginning to look lot like 2016, when wage gains accelerated into summer after Walmart (WMT) hiked its base wage to $10 an hour.

18,SBUX,"Imagine being told one day that your paychecks would be in Bitcoin. Pretty cool, right? Except your liquid assets could tumble in value at any moment in this cryptocurrency future. And you'd have to convert your cryptocurrency to dollars to buy groceries at Walmart (WMT), coffee at Starbucks (SBUX) or books on Amazon (AMZN).The surge in value of Bitcoin and its digital currency rivals has not been matched by their everyday utility. Payment processor Stripe cut off Bitcoin support in January, citing slow transaction times and high fees.""We've seen the desire from our customers to accept Bitcoin decrease,"" explained Stripe product manager Tom Karlo.Bitcoin and other digital rivals are nowhere near ready for prime time. They might never match the utility of today's financial-system incumbents, the banks and payment companies that facilitate the flow of funds over tens of millions of merchant locations.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseYet much like millennials will never have a landline, a coming generation might do without bank accounts thanks to secure, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions. Blockchain technology and the vast new crypto wealth have opened the door to four cryptocurrency futures that could usher in a new financial order.What are these possibilities?""Virtual currencies might just give existing currencies and monetary policy a run for their money,"" International Monetary Fund director Christine Lagarde predicted last fall. ""Citizens may one day prefer virtual currencies, since they potentially offer the same cost and convenience as cash — no settlement risks, no clearing delays, no central registration, no intermediary to check accounts and identities,"" she said.That explosive potential helps explain why so many tech entrepreneurs and investors turned cryptocurrencies into a 21st Century gold rush, even as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon has trashed Bitcoin as ""a fraud.""Dimon and other titans of finance voice certainty that commercial banks will remain indispensable, cryptocurrencies will stay on the fringe, and governments will want to keep it that way.Blockchain's potential to revolutionize the financial system has some central banks studying whether to issue their own digital currency. Yale University scholars have proposed the FedCoin. In this cryptocurrency future, FedCoin could make monetary policy more flexible and forceful, even allowing for negative interest rates.If a cryptocurrency acted as a reliable, widely accepted store of value, people could cut ties to their banks. They could keep some crypto cash in digital wallets, with other liquid assets in mutual funds, stocks and government bonds.A Bank of England study concluded that a central-bank cryptocurrency could boost GDP by 3%. Gains would come, in part, from shrinking ""monetary transaction costs that are analogous to distortionary tax rates.""Yet FedCoin looks far-fetched at present because of the massive disruption it could cause. Central bank crypto dollars ""could endanger the economically and socially important financial intermediation function of commercial banks,"" JPMorgan analysts warned.The contribution of fractional reserve banking to global growth — turning each $1 of deposits into $10 in loans — could fade. ""We would expect that central banks would think twice before disturbing this source of capital to the private sector."" Dimon is surely right about one thing: The cryptocurrency future will depend heavily on government. That could mean smothering it with regulation, stealing its thunder via FedCoin or cultivating it with a light regulatory touch.Bitcoin hit its 2018 low early on Feb. 6, the morning of a key Senate cryptocurrency hearing, briefly undercutting $6,000. The chairmen of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission both urged stronger oversight. But the financial regulators stopped short of sounding an alarm. Nor did they call for any legislation to rein in cryptocurrencies. In the weeks after that hearing, Bitcoin rebounded to around $11,000 but it has retreated yet again to below $7,000.Bitcoin had doubled in the first half of December, hitting a peak above $19,000 just as Bitcoin futures began trading on Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) and CME (CME). The anticipation of futures trading, touted as validation from U.S. regulators, stoked speculation.At the Senate hearing, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who earned his fortune as an early investor in the cell phone industry, said he sees a parallel between mobile phones then and cryptocurrencies now. ""The same kind of transformation is about to take place,"" he said.Warner criticized the CFTC for embracing Bitcoin options at this stage. He fretted that total cryptocurrency market capitalization could hit $20 trillion — vs. $300 billion now — with another 2017-like surge.""This rises potentially to the level of a systemically relevant event,"" Warner said.Yet there's reason to doubt that cryptocurrency frenzy will return. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) — Ma Bell in Warner's analogy — banned credit-card purchases of cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, the SEC and foreign governments have cracked down on initial coin offerings. And lately, Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Google, Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) have banned cryptocurrency ads.Even Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin warned via Twitter not long ago that cryptocurrencies ""could drop to near-zero at any time."" He added that ""traditional assets are still your safest bet.""The Bank for International Settlements, the central banker for global central banks, has warned that cryptocurrencies in the future could become a ""threat to financial stability"" if regulators aren't vigilant. U.S. regulators appear to be playing catch-up. As of Feb. 6, the cryptocurrency working group put together by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had held a single meeting.Politicians and central bankers worry that cryptocurrencies won't hold value in a panic. ""When things really go bad, where do Americans turn?"" Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker asked a fintech conference last fall. ""Well, they're going to come back to the government. That's the history of the country.""Harker did allow that other currency models might work if another ""large player"" besides the government provided trust.Who could fill that role? Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz offered some thoughts on the coffee chain's January earnings call.""I personally believe that there is going to be one or a few legitimate, trusted digital currencies off of the blockchain technology,"" Schultz said. He doubted that Bitcoin would be one of them.Cryptocurrencies ""will have to be legitimized by a brand in a brick-and-mortar environment, where the consumer has trust and confidence in the company that is providing the transaction.""Starbucks wants to play a role but isn't making a big investment in a cryptocurrency future right now, Schultz said.Cryptocurrency investors have speculated that Amazon might accept Bitcoin or one of its digital rivals. That specific cryptocurrency would vault past competitors as a trusted store of value and useful medium of exchange. Amazon even registered the domains AmazonEthereum.com, AmazonCryptocurrency.com and AmazonCryptocurrencies, kicking such talk into high gear.Alternatively, Amazon, Walmart — or a consortium of large companies — might issue their own cryptocurrency. Doing so could let them save on transaction costs and act as a competitive weapon.But Amazon has also been cozying up with JPMorgan. Recently, Amazon and JPMorgan have partnered in a health care venture and in creating a new type of bank account.Yet imagine if Amazon or Walmart rewarded loyal customers with tokens that could escalate in value. The tokens would jump to the head of the cryptocurrency pack with potential for broad acceptance as a currency. Customers would likely hoard the tokens, rather than spend them. The effect on sales and profits might be electric.For a digital currency to gain wide acceptance from outside businesses, the issuer would have to act like a central bank. Governing a currency requires trust, so some functions might need independence from corporate issuers.Those milestones could ease fears of a massive cryptocurrency crash. The Fed shouldn't need to rush in and save the day if AmazonCoin or WalmartCoin crashed.Currencies rely on conservative and predictable rules to assure the public that massive money printing won't destroy value. Could people trust the central bank of Amazon?Then again, will people always be able to count on the Fed?The Fed controls the creation of money, but central bankers seem to be losing their grip. Any loss of faith in the dollar and the Fed bodes well for a cryptocurrency future as dollar-skeptics look for an alternative store of wealth — besides gold.Bitcoin's peer-to-peer electronic payment system, first proposed in 2008 to verify transactions through a decentralized public blockchain, arrived on the scene as the global financial crisis triggered bailouts of one big bank after another.Bitcoin fulfilled famed economist Friedrich Hayek's idea of denationalizing money. He believed competition could help keep central banks honest and prevent runaway inflation.Doubts fueled by ""ballooning balance sheets of the major central banks in the aftermath of the global financial crisis"" motivated early cryptocurrency investors, JPMorgan analysts wrote. Yet the lack of any upsurge in inflation since ""has surely reduced concerns about fiat (legal tender issued by a central bank) money.""Yet the Fed now faces a much different challenge: a runaway federal deficit even amid a strong U.S. economy. The deficit will top $1 trillion in fiscal 2019 and $2 trillion by 2027, and there's no fix in sight. Republicans have overseen big deficit-financed tax cuts and increased government spending. Democrats want more generous Social Security benefits, Medicare for all and debt-free college.""The continued growth of public debt raises eventual sustainability questions if left unchecked,"" Goldman Sachs economists warned recently.The Fed seems on track to suffer the same fate as the Bank of Japan. The BoJ has been forced to accommodate sky-high government deficits with easy money and asset purchases. Japan, with a falling working-age population, hasn't had a whiff of inflation. But the U.S. might be a different story.Deutsche Bank global credit strategist Jim Reid put this shocking headline on a November report: ""The Start of the End of Fiat Money?"" Reid argued high debt levels will keep the Fed and other central banks too accommodative, putting fiat currencies at risk.""The fiat currency system may be seriously tested over the coming decade and ultimately we may need to find an alternative,"" Reid wrote. ""Cryptocurrencies are all the rage at the moment and are as much about blockchain as anything else, but there could be an increasing desire for alternative"" mediums of exchange in the years to come.""Keep in mind that fiat money is a relatively young innovation. It's only truly been the norm since President Nixon ended the dollar's quasi-gold standard in 1971.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Before You Buy Bitcoin, Read ThisBurned By Bitcoin?

19,SBUX,"Starbucks (SBUX) was downgraded Thursday over fears the company will see slower growth, including from its ambitious plans to expand in China.Wedbush Securities lowered its rating for the coffee giant's shares to neutral from outperform and slashed its price target to 56 from 70. Its fiscal 2018 EPS estimate was also trimmed to $2.48 from $2.50 and its fiscal 2019 view was cut to $2.79 from $2.84.""We no longer see drivers of upside to (same-store sales) growth and EPS consensus expectations in FY18, and see rising risks to FY19 expectations,"" Wedbush's Nick Setyan said in a research note.During the company's annual meeting of shareholders earlier this month, CEO Kevin Johnson boasted, ""Starbucks has cracked the code in China"" and said the firm plans to accelerate growth there.However, Setyan poured cold water on Starbucks' claims it can brew up a quarter of total revenue growth from mainland China in fiscal 2018 and 2019. His analysis showed the business will instead drive around a fifth of 2019's total revenue growth absent a meaningful acceleration in unit growth and same-store sales growth.""In order for China to make up 25% of total estimated FY19 Starbucks revenue growth, a step-up in new unit additions in FY19 to 1,000 units from the FY18 level of 600 would be needed,"" Setyan said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAnd while Starbucks has seen success with its rewards membership program and mobile-order-and-pay technology efforts, he noted a deceleration in spending per rewards member and now sees comparable-store sales growth from technology initiatives over the near term at 1%-2%, down from a prior view of 2%-3%.Another factor in the downgrade is slowing growth in volume and prices for the overall market for packaged coffee and single-serve packets. Starbucks has increased its market share in this segment, but the overall deceleration represents a risk to consensus views, Setyan said.But Starbucks hit back, with a company spokeswoman telling IBD in a statement that ""we continue to see Starbucks as a growth company, uniquely positioned in our industry.""Starbucks fell 1 cent to 57.89 on the stock market today. The stock has been forming a cup-with-handle base, Marketsmith analysis shows, with an entry point of 60.70. But the relative strength line, which tracks the stock vs. the S&P 500 index, is just starting to break a long slump.Fast-food giant McDonald's (MCD), which has become more competitive in the coffee market, edged up 8 cents. Dunkin' Donuts parent Dunkin' Brands (DNKN), dipped 0.2%.Starbucks had just over 3,000 China locations as recently as December and plans to grow that total to 10,000 within a decade. Management also expects China eventually will become a bigger market for the company than the U.S. during that time.Meanwhile, Starbucks' home turf has been a weak spot.

20,SBUX,"Wage growth will likely accelerate in the March jobs report and beyond, with hawkish implications for the Fed interest-rate outlook. Goldilocks is on her way out.Wall Street economists expect the monthly employment report out at 8:30 a.m. ET to show a gain of 175,000 jobs. The unemployment rate should dip to 4%, the lowest since December 2000. Average hourly wage growth should tick up to 2.7% on an annual basis from a so-so 2.6% in February.Expect the improvement in wage growth to be the start of a trend for two reasons.First, dozens of major employers announced wage hikes over the past few months, but few came early enough to show up in February's jobs report. Walmart (WMT) and CVS Health (CVS) hiked their minimum wages to $11 an hour. Six months after raising its minimum wage to $11, Target (TGT) said last month that it will pay all current associates at least $12 an hour starting this spring.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSecond, wage growth receded in the spring of 2017, rising just 2.2% at an annual rate from March through June. As those months that saw depressed pay gains drop off, replaced by months with firmer growth this year, the annual rate will trend higher.Take a closer look at Walmart's wage changes. Before its pay hike announced in January 2018, Walmart hadn't raised its base wage in nearly three years. That's a big deal. When Walmart hiked its minimum wage for all current associates to $10 an hour in February 2016, that wage hike was contagious.Walmart is big enough to put upward pressure on wages for other employers. Target and Costco (COST) were among those who quickly hiked pay shortly after that 2016 move. Average hourly earnings growth rose to 2.8% that July before momentum flagged.Walmart's 2016 wage hike came when the jobless rate was nearly 5%. Now it's around 4%, so competition for workers has intensified. At least for workers on the lower end of the wage spectrum, pay hikes appear to be broad-based. Starbucks (SBUX), Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all have said they're raising pay. Meanwhile, dozens of banks, including Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) hiked their minimum wage to $15 an hour for tellers.As wage gains accelerate and the jobless rate moves below 4% in coming months, Fed policymakers may lean toward four interest-rate hikes in 2018, not just three. Fed models assume that inflation will follow wage growth higher. There's reason to be skeptical. For example, Kroger said last month that it will use the bulk of its tax cut to offset the cost of higher wages and lower prices.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Check Out These 4 Dow Jones Stocks; One Is Near A Buy PointBoeing, GE, United Tech Fall As China Hits Aviation But 737 Orders Roll InHow To Invest In A Late-Stage Bull Market As FANG Stocks SlumpStocks To Watch: These Stocks Just Got Added To IBD 50, IPO LeadersTop Stock LGI Homes Breaks Out To Buy Zone On Strong Growth

43,SBUX,"Nike (NKE) earnings and sales are due after the close Thursday, and the world's dominant athletic apparel brand will be expected to address the question of whether its primacy in North America is under any threat.Sales in the U.S. and Canada have declined, year over year, for the last three straight quarters. On the most recent Nike earnings call in March, Chief Executive Mark Parker pointed to a ""reversal of trend"" happening in the fourth quarter (the period to be reported on Thursday), an expected inflection point that comes as Nike rethinks its retail distribution and focuses on online commerce.Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expect Nike earnings to grow 7% to 64 cents, on an 8% increase in revenue to $9.39 billion.Within the North America segment, footwear sales have been leading declines. Nike has expressed confidence in its new products, however, including the VaporMax, Air Max 720 and Epic React, as it looks to fend off Adidas' (ADDYY) resurgence in recent years.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs Nike pulls itself away from ""undifferentiated, mediocre"" retail outlets, Adidas sees an opportunity, says Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy.""Overall, management sees the (North American) marketplace cleaner in 2018 and anticipates their growth in the region to be led by shelf-space expansion within existing distribution (12k doors vs. >24k for NKE) as the brand is fully distributed in about 10% of its footprint,"" she wrote last week. ""Adidas sees any proactive Nike distribution reduction as a windfall for them.""Shares were down 1.5% at 72.35 on the stock market today amid a broad market retreat sparked by fears of a spiraling trade war. Nike is now back in buy range after clearing a 70.35 entry point from a flat base and rising into extended territory by early June. Adidas dropped 1.8%, while Under Armour (UAA) dipped 0.3%.Still, even if U.S. sales are sluggish, Nike earnings may not see much downside. At its investor day last October, Parker said he expects nearly 75% of the company's growth to come from outside the U.S., and maintained that the company would hit $50 billion in revenue within its five-year target. Nike's greater China segment has been outperforming other units, and sales in Europe are solid.""Outside the U.S., while growth remains strong, Nike is likely taking share in Europe while sustaining (positive double-digit) growth in China,"" wrote Wedbush analyst Christopher Svezia on June 14.He raised his price target to 82 from 75 on the expectation that Nike will exceed estimates throughout fiscal 2019 due to accelerating growth in North America and possibly abroad, among other factors.But Nike's exposure to China also represents a risk, as President Trump escalates a trade war with the world's No. 2 economy.While Beijing's use of retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. may not affect Nike's Asia-based production, the government can still make business difficult via regulatory moves.Government officials also could call for a boycott of U.S. goods, for example, impacting companies like Nike, Starbucks (SBUX) and Disney (DIS), which have a big presence in the country.Meanwhile, Nike is likely to field questions about its slew of executive departures, which number close to a dozen, in the wake of its #MeToo moment and reports of a ""boy's club"" working environment.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Nike, Marijuana Earnings Due; Big Bank Payouts: Investing Action PlanFIFA Fever: It's Really These Two Teams Vying For The World CupNike Rival Adidas Says This 'Massive Category' Is Growing The FastestAdidas' U.S. Boss Talks Amazon, Retail Strategies, And Kanye's Real ImpactStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

44,SBUX,"Starbucks (SBUX) didn't impress investors with its lackluster holiday-quarter sales figures, but the coffee shop giant — a first-mover among its restaurant peers in technology advancements — has its eye on cashless shops and cryptocurrency.X ""The ubiquity of mobile and credit card payment is enabling us to begin an exploration of cashless stores in the U.S.,"" said Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson on the earnings call late Thursday.While not quite as future-forward as Amazon.com (AMZN) Go's cashless and cashier-less Seattle storefront, Starbucks has reportedly stopped taking cash payments at its Russell Investments Center coffeehouse in the city, located not far from Amazon's Go concept store. The Puget Sound Business Journal said that particular Starbucks location is testing the idea for at least two weeks, citing a barista who works there.In the U.S., mobile payment usage has grown to account for over 30% of total tender, said Johnson, and loyalty membership rose 11% during the quarter to bring Starbucks Rewards to 14.2 million active members. Until recently, only Rewards members were able to use the app's Mobile Order and Pay function that allows customers to order food and drink ahead of time. The company is accelerating the rollout to all customers starting in March, he said.And the springtime will bring the debut of Starbucks' co-branded Chase and Visa credit card, which shoppers can use to earn Starbucks Rewards points, or ""stars,"" at any store that accepts Visa.RBC analyst David Palmer wrote that he is ""optimistic"" the credit card can attract new users, and that user growth can ramp up as more non-Rewards members are allowed to use mobile checkout.Separately, in responding to a question about tax reinvestments, Starbucks Executive Chairman Howard Schultz began musing about the future of money.He made clear that the company is not investing in cryptocurrency or thinking of creating one of its own, but said, ""as we think about the future of our company and the future of consumer behavior, I personally believe that there is going to be one or a few legitimate trusted digital currencies off of the blockchain technology.""IBD'S TAKE: Before you buy bitcoin, read this.He doesn't think that Bitcoin will be the winner, but whatever it is, ""that legitimacy and trust in terms of its consumer application will have to be legitimatized by a brand and a brick-and-mortar environment, where the consumer has trust and confidence in the company that is providing the transaction.""Schultz further alluded to Starbucks' potential involvement in the space, albeit somewhat mysteriously.""I believe that we are heading into a new age, in which blockchain technology is going to provide a significant level of a digital currency that is going to have a consumer application,"" he told investors. ""And I believe that Starbucks is in a unique position to take advantage of that ... we are actively demonstrating the level of entrepreneurial curiosity and DNA of our company to do the things that we've done in the past to ensure the fact that we are at the cutting edge of this technology.""Starbucks shares tumbled 4.2% to 57.99 in volume that was 500% above normal in the stock market today. The stock plunged below its 50-day moving average and a 60.15 buy point, though it did close above its 200-day after undercutting that level intraday.

The Nasdaq was just below recent highs and the S&P 500 was eyeing the 2,800 mark.(For updates on this story and other market coverage, visit Stock Market Today.)Currencies were central to Wednesday's early action across global markets, after the People's Central Bank of China hoisted its reference rate above the high end of economist expectations. The bank set the rate, which links the yuan to the dollar, at 6.4586. The surprise move halted the yuan's steep, two-day slide. It also eased global concerns that China might devalue the yuan and allow its stock markets to suffer the consequences in response to the country's trade standoff with the U.S.China's stock markets responded by kicking up out of mixed trade to a solid finish.

Some of the biggest names, Baidu (BIDU), Alibaba Group (BABA), NetEase (NTES) and JD.com (JD) were little changed.Among the more volatile plays, Huya (HUYA) bounced 6%, after taking a 12% dive on Tuesday. IQiyi (IQ) popped 3.6%, looking to grab back Tuesday's 3% loss. Both pullbacks could be positive for investors looking for entry points into these China-based tech IPOs.21st Century Fox vaulted 6.6% higher after Disney agreed to raise its bid for company assets to 38 per share, up from 28. That lifted the total value of 50% cash/50% stock deal to $71.8 billion. Fox agreed to the deal, which would give Fox shareholders 19% of Disney ownership following the transaction.  Fox shares ended Tuesday 15% above a flat base buy point at 38.66. Disney shares were up 0.7% in early action. The stock is mired in a 13-month consolidation.Comcast (CMSA), who's earlier bid was topped by Disney's new offer, rose 0.7% in early trade.Winnebago hitched up an 10% opening gain, after reporting above-forecast earnings and revenue for its fiscal third quarter. A 9% jump in earnings surprised analysts expecting a 3% decline. Winnebago shares remained below their 40-week moving average, aiming to start up the right side of a six-month consolidation.FedEx (FDX) slipped 2.2% after its fiscal fourth-quarter report. Oracle dropped 4.1% after reporting fiscal fourth-quarter results.Netflix powered up 1.4% at the start of trade. The streaming entertainment titan rammed nearly 4% higher against a falling market Tuesday, lifted by a trio of analyst upgrades. The gain points the IBD Leaderboard stock to an open more than 20% above the stock's 338.92 buy point from a May breakout.

Crude oil prices rebounded sharply as OPEC agreed on a modest output increase.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) will replace General Electric in the Dow Jones industrial average on June 26. GE stock, leaving the Dow Jones after 111 years, has lost half its value over the past year as the industrial conglomerate slashed its profit outlook and halved its dividend. A long-awaited decision about GE's future could come this month, CNBC said Thursday, as GE stock made a new longtime low of 12.61. As GE looks to shrink its portfolio, slash costs and shed $20 billion in assets, it could even split off core divisions, such as power, health and aviation, into separately traded companies.Micron Technology and Smart Global Holdings (SGH) both topped estimates for their fiscal third quarters.

The cartel will increase the official production target by 1 million barrels per day. The actual boost will likely be around 600,000 bpd as some members like Venezuela are unable to ramp up. Oil prices and stocks, which had trended lower ahead of the meeting, rebounded Friday. Crude futures rose more than 5% for the week to $68.58 a barrel, with the most of the gains coming Friday.

But Disney followed with a $38-a-share offer of $71 billion in cash and stock, up from an all-stock bid of $28 a share. Comcast is expected to counter again. Separately, Comcast and Fox are in the midst of a bidding war for European broadcaster Sky. Fox stock soared.Shares of Darden Restaurants (DRI) shot up 15% on Thursday, blowing by a 100.21 buy point.

Martin Tripp , who worked at the Nevada Gigafactory as a process technician, claims he is a whistleblower. The discovery of what CEO Elon Musk described as a saboteur comes as Tesla is trying hard to meet the oft-delayed production goal of 5,000 Model 3s a week in the third quarter. Tesla stock hit a nine-month high Monday but reversed to lose 6.85% for the week.

That should provide a GDP boost near term. But existing-home sales unexpectedly slipped 0.4% in May, and 3% from a year ago amid tight supply and higher mortgage rates. Rising mortgage rates have hit affordability and seem to have slowed the increase in home prices. The FHFA house price index edged up just 0.1% in April and 6.4% from a year ago, slowing from 7.4% earlier this year.

47,SBUX,"Mellody Hobson, president of Ariel Investments, provided the luncheon keynote presentation at the Morningstar Investment Conference 2018 by offering a smorgasbord of tasty tidbits about her firm's evolution, about the value of ethnic diversity in a workplace and about how financial advisors should relate to their clients.Hobson said her firm – which had $13.4 billion in assets under management as of March 31 — staunchly sticks to a long-term focus in deciding which securities to buy because other, larger financial firms have essentially cornered the market on investing in today's hot, faddish stocks. ""They've commoditized that market,"" she said. And because of the size of those firms, they can offer mutual funds that focus on such stocks at lower cost than rivals like Ariel.That forces Ariel to rely on its wits – especially the insights of its analysts and portfolio managers. That means Ariel very much is an active-management mutual fund complex. ""And people should be willing to pay for that,"" Hobson said.Hobson, who is African-American, said that Ariel is proud of its diversity. She said that 51% of Ariel's staff is female, 27% is African-American, 13% is Asian and more than 7% is Hispanic. Two-thirds of the leadership team is female, the Chicago Tribune reported in September.One result is that the firm draws employment inquiries from minority students at many of the nation's most prestigious colleges and graduate schools, she said.Hobson is the first African-American woman to head the Economic Club of Chicago. She is a director of firms such as Starbucks (SBUX). When Starbucks' Howard Schultz – who is stepping down as executive chairman — asked what she thought about his plan for closing stores to conduct diversity training, she endorsed the idea despite the negative reaction it would elicit from some people, she said.Hobson also urged individual investors to take a long-term approach in their investing.And she said that financial advisors should think about their clienteles in terms of individual investors, not in terms of aggregate assets under management. ""Think in terms of your impact on individual lives,"" she said.A Tuesday afternoon panel set its sights on cryptocurrency and blockchain. The panel sought to address audience members' concerns that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are excessively volatile and lack transparency.""Just because Bitcoin rises and falls (in value) doesn't mean it is speculative and risky,"" said panelist Sean Ristau of SVRN Asset Management. ""So do regular stocks.""Ristau said cryptocurrencies ""are not rat poison,"" as investor Warren Buffett has charged.Moderator Tayfun Icten of Morningstar noted that Fidelity Investments is opening a cryptocurrency exchange. Fortune.com says Goldman Sachs may not trade Bitcoin initially.To avoid theft, Ristau said anyone who buys Bitcoin should store it in a ""cold wallet"" that is not left plugged into a device with internet access.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Morningstar Investment Conference 2018: How Investors Can Profit From Human Nature

48,SBUX,"Starbucks (SBUX) plans to spend $250 million on new employee benefits, including a pay boost for domestic workers, in the wake of the federal tax overhaul.X The coffee chain will increase pay for its 150,000 U.S. hourly and salaried employees in April, following its regular annual raise earlier this month. It's also taking its paid-sick time benefit national, allowing workers to save up time off to use for themselves or family, Seattle-based Starbucks said on Wednesday.Starbucks becomes the latest U.S. company to pledge a portion of its federal tax-cut windfall to employees, which the coffee giant calls ""partners."" Apple Inc. said earlier this month that it's giving most of its staff a $2,500 bonus. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., meanwhile, plans to hike its starting wage to $11 an hour and give out $400 million in one-time bonuses.""Investing in our partners has long been our strategy,"" Starbucks Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson said in a memo to employees. ""Due to the recent changes in U.S. tax law, we are able to accelerate some significant partner investments.""Unlike Wal-Mart, Starbucks isn't touting a new starting wage. The coffee giant says the new level will vary by region, and it already pays more than the minimum wage in all 50 states.Starbucks also has been investing in mobile technology to fix congestion at pickup counters in the U.S., where sales have struggled to keep pace with international growth. The company is slated to give investors an update on its progress when it reports earnings on Thursday.The employee changes come after Starbucks hired Aon to compare its benefits with similar companies. The analysis found that the coffee company could improve its sick-time policies. Starbucks also is giving an extra 2018 stock grant to U.S. employees, and will expand parental leave to include non-birth parents.

50,SBUX,"The favored Fed inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, rose 0.2% on the month and 1.6% from a year ago in February, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.Core inflation came in a tad hotter than the 1.5% annual rate expected. Including food and energy prices, the PCE price index rose 0.2% on the month and 1.8% from a year ago vs. expectations of 0.2% and 1.7% increases.After the report, Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index futures rose a little more, while the 10-year Treasury yield was little changed around 2.77%.If the inflation data stay tame, and core PCE inflation remains well below the Fed's 2% inflation target, the U.S. central bank probably won't hike its key interest rate four times this year. At last week's Fed meeting, policymakers' projections saw core inflation rising to 1.9% this year as the Fed hikes three times.Policymakers are getting more confident that inflation will start to firm. Their projections point to 2.1% core inflation in 2019, just above their target.The Fed still believes in the Phillips curve, which predicts rising wage growth as unemployment falls. Before too long, wage pressures put upward pressure on consumer prices.So far, official measures haven't detected a pickup in wages. The Labor Department reported weaker-than-expected 2.6% annual average hourly wage inflation in February. But faster wage growth should begin to show up this spring, reflecting recently announced wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS) and Starbucks (SBUX) that didn't happen soon enough for the latest jobs report.As those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same. Earlier this month, Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all said they're raising wages for employees, and their stocks sold off amid worries about profit margins.The competitive environment facing Kroger from Walmart and Amazon (AMZN) via its Whole Foods division, among others, offers at least some reason to doubt whether wage pressure will feed through to higher prices. Kroger said on Thursday that it will use one-third of its tax cut to boost shareholder returns, but the other two-thirds will go to higher wages and lower prices.Still, inflation is likely to remain near the top of investors' concerns this year. Fed policymakers expect to hike rates another three times in 2019 and two more in 2020, which is far more than financial markets think can or should happen.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Inflation And The Fed Rate-Hike Outlook: What You Need To KnowStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To WatchWill Techs Drive Stock Market Into Bear Territory?

51,SBUX,"The trigger for Friday's stock-market freakout that carried through to Monday was the sudden emergence of respectable wage growth, most analysts agreed. The trigger for the next freakout is very likely to be the federal budget.X While wage hikes from the likes of Walmart (WMT), Starbucks (SBUX), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) in the wake of tax reform provide some reason to expect a pickup from the lackluster gains of recent years, IBD presented three reasons why the January pay raise reported by the Labor Department was less than meets the eye. Still, investors' reaction reflects Wall Street's nervousness about leaving behind a Goldilocks era of so-so economic growth and tepid inflation, accompanied by strong stock market gains.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all saw accelerating losses on the stock market today, as a key fear gauge hit its highest level since November 2016.Now that Wall Street has gotten a case of nerves because tax cuts have helped kick the economy into higher gear, markets are going to be none too comfortable with the big spending increase Congress is moving toward.In order to clear away Democratic opposition to a boost in military spending, Republicans are prepared to offer a nearly comparable increase in outlays on domestic programs — above and beyond the increases to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, whose funding runs on autopilot.Politico reported on Friday that Republicans are eyeing a $300 billion increase in spending over two years. On an annual basis, that would boost government spending by about 0.75% of GDP. But the actual boost to government spending is likely to be significantly higher, once continued emergency funding for recovery from last year's big hurricanes is included. There's a package of $81 billion in emergency aid now waiting approval.With all of that extra government spending on top of the fuel provided by front-loaded tax cuts that will cost the Treasury about $250 billion in the first full year, the U.S. economy is set to get a fiscal boost of a scale that's rarely been seen — particularly with 4.1% unemployment.IBD'S TAKE: After Thursday's market action — and before Friday's market drubbing — IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when it makes sense to be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Even before a deal to boost spending on defense and domestic programs, Treasury said it expects to issue nearly $1 trillion in debt this year, nearly double last year's total.The backup in Treasury yields is hardly surprising amid a combination of rising deficits and a Federal Reserve that's gradually shrinking its balance sheet, reversing government bond purchases made to aid recovery from the financial crisis.What seems to be driving the market action is a sudden realization that it's time to hedge against the risk that the economy will overheat. Even with tax cuts, that risk has appeared modest enough for investors to mostly discount, as consumers have grown to expect internet price transparency and the ever-expanding reach of Amazon.com (AMZN) to keep inflation in check.Those competitive dynamics help explain why Walmart, even as it hiked its minimum wage to $11 an hour in January, also shut dozens of Sam's Clubs employing about 10,000 workers, cut 3,500 store co-manager positions and thinned the ranks at its headquarters.Yet now the risk of investors being caught flat-footed by a rise in inflation is growing as Washington prepares to unleash a second dose of fiscal firepower.Of course, those fears may prove wrong as well, particularly if immigration politics blocks a budget deal and provokes a prolonged government shutdown. While the government is set to run out of funds on Feb. 9, Congress is expected to pass another short-term extension. The near-term trajectory of federal budget policy won't be clear until March, when lawmakers are likely to face three big hurdles in short order: a new government funding deadline, a potential debt-ceiling crisis, and the expiration of protections for Dreamers who came to live in the U.S. without authorization when they were kids.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Despite Weak Market, This Top IPO Stock Is Breaking Out TodayHere Comes A $1 Trillion — Scratch That — $2 Trillion U.S. Federal DeficitHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

53,SBUX,"Business and Politics: Costco Wholesale Corp. announced late last week that it's giving raises to 130,000 employees, thanks to the Trump tax cuts. This is the company, mind you, whose founders openly backed tax-hiking Hillary Clinton for president. Why not admit that they picked the wrong horse?Costco (COST) boosted its minimum wage $1 an hour — to $14 — and gave its other hourly employee wages raises of up to 50 cents an hour. That's an annual increase of up to $2,000. Crumbs to Nancy Pelosi, but real money to a middle-class family on a budget.The company said it was funding the $100+ million in raises with savings from the sharp cut in the corporate tax rate. That rate cut was part of the Trump tax reform plan — which not a single Democratic lawmaker supported. Since then, hundreds of companies announced bonuses, raises, increased benefits because of the money they're saving on taxes.Costco's employees aren't the only ones benefiting. Since the November election, Costco stock has rocketed up by 32%. In the two years before the election, it climbed 8%.The irony here is that, had many of Costco's leaders got their wish, their workers wouldn't be getting those raises next week.In 2016, Costco board members, executives and employees gave $44,178 to Clinton's campaign and almost $92,000 to the DNC. The company's co-founders both endorsed Hillary Clinton and gave tens of thousands to her and other Democrats. Overall, Costco donors overwhelmingly favored Democrats that year.Costco isn't alone in this regard. Plenty of corporate leaders harshly attacked Trump before the election, and now their companies and employees are benefiting immensely from his tax cuts and deregulation.Shortly before the election, for example, then Starbucks (SBUX) CEO Howard Schultz told CNN Money that ""I think it's obvious Hillary Clinton needs to be the next president.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut as a direct result of Trump's tax cuts, Starbucks employees got stock grants of between $500 and $2,000 — totaling more than $100 million — as well as $120,000 million in raises.IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC) Chairman Barry Diller promised in 2015 that if Trump were elected, ""I'll either move out of the country or join the resistance."" Last July, he said that Trump's presidency is ""just a joke (and) hopefully it will be over relatively soon.""IAC shareholders probably don't agree. In the months since Trump won the election, IAC stock shot up by almost 140%. In the two years before the 2016 elections, IAC's stock eked out a meager 1.5% gain. (Diller never did leave the country.)Meanwhile, Netflix (NFLX) CEO Reed Hastings — another prominent Clinton backer — said in June 2016 that ""Hillary Clinton is the strong leader we need, and it's important that Trump lose by a landslide to reject what he stands for."" Trump, he said, "" would destroy much of what is great about America.""Hastings might have a difficult time explaining this statement to Netflix shareholders. His company's stock has rocketed up more than 190% since Trump failed to lose by a landslide. In fact, it's climbed almost 90% just since the Trump tax cuts went into effect in January.On and on it goes. During the campaign, Clinton made a big deal about the fact that 56 prominent business leaders endorsed her for president. Yet many of them have seen the rising economic tide lifting their boats under Trump.Do any of these CEOs honestly believe that, had Clinton won the election, their companies would be doing as well as they are now? Not only did she oppose corporate tax cuts, Clinton wanted $1.4 trillion in tax hikes, as well as countless new mandates and regulations on businesses.For obvious reasons, Democratic politicians will never admit that they were wrong about Trumponomics, no matter how well the economy performs. But what about all those corporate leaders who put their names and reputations behind Hillary Clinton?Shouldn't they admit that, even if they can't stand Trump, their companies and their workers are better off as a result of the pro-growth economic policies that their chosen candidate never would have approved?YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Was May's Job Report The Best Ever?Some Inconvenient Truths About RecyclingTrump Plays Dangerous Game Of Chicken With Trade Tariffs

55,SBUX,"The U.S. economy added 313,000 jobs in February, while the unemployment rate held at 4.1%, the Labor Department said on Friday.X Average hourly wages rose 4 cents to $26.75 an hour, up a tame 2.6% from a year earlier. That missed consensus expectations of 2.9% rise. January's wage gain, originally reported as a 2.9% rise, was revised down to 2.8%.Wall Street expected a gain of 205,000 jobs and 4.0% jobless rate.December and January payrolls were revised up by a combined 54,000.After the jobs report, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 futures moved significantly higher on the stock market today. The S&P 500 index, which closed a point below its 50-day moving average on Thursday, reclaimed that key level at Friday's open.The 10-year Treasury yield rose a few basis points to 2.9% but the jobs and wage data didn't substantially bolster the case for the Federal Reserve to add an extra interest-rate hike in 2018.Despite the blowout jobs number, the data may give stocks a tad more running room before Fed hike expectations begin to bite, but investors shouldn't take too much comfort.While the data don't show that Goldilocks-type wage gains are history, bigger pay gains are likely coming this spring, reflecting recently announced wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS) and Starbucks (SBUX), which don't show up yet in the February jobs report.And as those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same. This week, Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all said they're raising wages for employees, and their stocks sold off amid worries about profit margins.The retail sector added 50,000 jobs, while construction employment surged 61,000 and manufacturers hired a net 31,000.The likely combination of low and falling unemployment with accelerating wage gains would fit perfectly with the Phillips curve theory that has long guided Federal Reserve policy. As far as investors are concerned, the key point is that most Fed policymakers still seem pretty confident that inflation pressures won't follow too far behind wage pressures, as businesses pass along a portion of their higher wage bills.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

56,SBUX,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowThat's why an interest-rate scare is looking possible, even if a legitimate inflation scare doesn't materialize.The competitive environment facing Kroger from Walmart and Amazon.com (AMZN) via its Whole Foods division, among others, offers at least some reason to doubt whether wage pressure will feed through to higher prices. Kroger said on Thursday that it will use one-third of its tax cut to boost shareholder returns, but the other two-thirds will go to higher wages and lower prices.Kroger gave weak profit guidance as it forecast smaller profit margins, sending shares crashing 12% on Thursday.Walmart's minimum-wage hike to $11 an hour was its first for new, entry-level workers since 2015, when it raised its minimum wage to $9 an hour. Then, in early 2016, Walmart hiked pay for all current associates to a minimum of $10 an hour, leading Target, Costco (COST) and others to raise their own wages. The point is that wage hikes can come in bunches. It didn't really happen last year, when wage growth hit a bit of a lull. But it does appear to be happening in 2018.If it does, Wall Street will continue to bump up odds for a fourth rate hike in 2018. Already those odds are about 1 in 3, up from about 20% a month ago, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:These Three Dow Jones Stocks Are Near Buy Points As 2 FANGs Make Bullish MoveThe Big Picture: This Is The Real News For InvestorsHere Are 10 Chip Stocks Breaking Out, Hitting New Highs Or Setting UpWhat Do Facebook, Grubhub, Salesforce And Epam Have In Common?

57,SBUX,"Wall Street was caught off guard on Friday as the Labor Department reported average hourly wage growth of 2.9%, the fastest since 2009 and a pretty sharp break from the kind of Goldilocks readings markets enjoyed throughout 2017.X The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off on the stock market today, despite a 6% surge in Amazon.com (AMZN) after its fourth-quarter earnings beat. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped to a 4-year high of 2.84%, as markets continue to ratchet up the odds of three Federal Reserve rate hikes in 2018.But the market reaction to the jobs report may be overdone. While faster wage growth may be on the way, helped by the combination of a tight labor market and corporate tax cuts that companies like Walmart (WMT), Starbucks (SBUX) and Wells Fargo (WFC) have credited for new wage hikes, Friday's report offers plenty of reasons to doubt whether wages really accelerated last month. Here are three:Big industries that pay low wages saw some of the biggest drops in hours worked. The retail workweek, for example, shrank by a half-hour, or 1.6%, to 30.6 hours per week, the shortest since BLS began tracking it for all employees in 2006. Retail pays its nearly 16 million workers $18.41 an hour, on average, far below the $26.74 average earned by private-sector workers last month.Meanwhile, the average workweek dropped 0.8% in the leisure and hospitality sector, which pays its 16.25 million workers $15.73 an hour, on average.Those two industries, which account for 1 in 4 private-sector workers, saw disproportionately large declines in their workweek. Average hourly wages reflect total weekly wages divided by total hours worked in all industry groups, so when low-wage workers put in fewer hours, the average wage rises.Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Bank, notes that the overall 0.5% decline in working hours was the biggest since April 2013. In addition to the tendency of lower-paid hourly wage workers to have their workweek cut, Bandholz notes that workers with a fixed salary appear to get a pay raise when they work fewer hours. He figures the shorter workweek artificially inflated earnings by nearly 0.2 percentage point.Production and supervisory workers, about 80% of total private-sector employment, saw steady hourly wage growth of 2.4% in January. If their wages aren't breaking out to the upside, then chances are it's not a real economywide trend.Likewise, goods-producing industries saw wage growth tick down to 2.3% from 2.4% in December.Taken together, that means the wage acceleration, if there is one, is focused on service-sector managers.""Some of that (wage) increase may have been influenced by one-time bonuses paid by some corporations after the passage of the tax reform bill,"" wrote Jefferies economist Thomas Simons. In other words, the spike in bonuses paid just after the start of the year may have skewed the average hourly wage calculation.IBD'S TAKE: After Thursday's market action, IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when it makes sense to be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Although January's wage acceleration was likely overstated, the report generally appears to indicate continued labor market strength. The U.S. economy added a better-than-expected 200,000 jobs in January, while the unemployment rate held at 4.1%, as expected.There is reason to expect stronger wage gains in coming months. Walmart hiked its base wage to $11 an hour, but that won't show up in paychecks for another month or so. The retail giant also reportedly cut 3,500 store co-manager positions, while adding about 1,700 somewhat lower paid assistant manager positions. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo boosted its minimum wage to $15 an hour, as did a host of other banks.November and December job gains were revised down by a combined 24,000, leaving the average monthly job gain at 192,000 over the past three months, the government said.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Amazon Fourth-Quarter Earnings Smash Estimates; Sales Growth StrongHere Comes A $1 Trillion — Scratch That — $2 Trillion U.S. Federal DeficitHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

58,SBUX,"The Fed hiked its key interest rate on Wednesday, surprising no one, while signaling no rush to step up its gradual pace of monetary tightening this year. The S&P 500 index and other major averages, after initially extending modest pre-announcement gains, then weakened as Jerome Powell held his first post-meeting news conference as Federal Reserve chairman.The initial market focus was on the Fed's near-term policy trajectory, but the takeaway may not be quite so positive once investors digest the more hawkish long-term outlook which hints at concern that there's greater risk of the economy overheating.As in December, the quarterly economic projections reflecting the individual views of each Federal Reserve policymaker pointed to a likelihood of three quarter-point rate hikes in 2018, not four, as Goldman Sachs and some other Wall Street firms anticipate. But the Fed did step up its rate-hike outlook for 2019.Fed policymakers now expect three quarter-point rate hikes in 2019, up from two in December, as the jobless rate falls to 3.6% in 2019 and core inflation rises to 2.1%, just above the Fed's target.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Fed's patience could give stocks a bit of running room as policymakers await evidence that faster economic growth, fueled by the big Trump tax cut and spending increases that have yet to hit, will boost wage growth and inflation.Powell said that if the Fed hikes too fast, ""inflation doesn't get up to 2%.""The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite initially extended moderate gains following the 2 p.m. ET policy statement. But after Powell began speaking at 2:30 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq  led the averages into negative territory in the stock market today. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 fell 0.2% while the Nasdaq lost 0.3%. However, the small-cap Russell 2000 managed to climb 0.6%.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones remain below their 50-day moving averages, while the Nasdaq recently found support at that key level. Bank stocks were among the gainers after the Fed meeting, thanks to signals that policymakers are willing to let the economy run at least a little hotter.The 10-year Treasury yield initially slipped after the announcement, then turned higher to about 2.92%, before backtracking as stocks weakened. The yield is not too far off the key 3% threshold that hasn't been breached in more than four years.If there's one reason why stocks turned lower as Powell spoke, it could be because of his discussion of the significance of the Fed, for the first time, expecting above-target core inflation of 2.1%. The forecast raises the question of whether the Fed may really think of the 2% inflation target as symmetric — meaning that the current undershoot should be balanced out by a future overshoot.Yet Powell, in his press conference, said policymakers will aim to avoid any ""sustained or persistent deviations.""""We're always going to be seeking 2%.""Investors probably shouldn't be too reassured by a largely status-quo announcement on 2018 policy from the Fed. There's good reason to expect policymakers to step up their expectations to four 2018 Fed rate hikes by June — even if inflation remains tame.Once a pickup in wage growth materializes — and it's very likely to this spring after wage hikes by Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX), FedEx (FDX), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and others — Fed members will likely adjust rate-hike expectations upward.The Fed's most influential dove, Lael Brainard, in 2017 explained earlier this month why low inflation won't prevent a more hawkish policy turn: Policymakers need to stay ""vigilant"" to contain any financial-system excesses.Unemployment appears on course to fall to rarely seen levels that tend to come with ""elevated risks of imbalances, whether in the form of high inflation in earlier decades or of financial imbalances in recent decades,"" Fed Governor Brainard said, alluding to the dot-com and housing bubbles.Brainard echoed new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's congressional testimony last month that economic headwinds have turned to tailwinds.

That's the recipe for a big economic slowdown late next year or in the first half of 2020.Bank of America, Wells Fargo and other bank stocks, which can benefit from higher short-term rates, especially when long-term interest rates rise even more, were only slightly higher before the Fed meeting statement on Wednesday, though JPMorgan Chase saw healthier gains. Bank of America and JPMorgan rose a little more after the announcement.Even though the 10-year yield was slightly lower, the 2-year yield fell a little more. A wider yield spread is good for bank profits.E-brokers are among financial stocks that benefit from a higher Fed interest rate, in part because  floating-rate margin loans for trading accounts are based on short-term rates that move in tandem with Fed policy. TD Ameritrade (AMTD) CFO Stephen Boyle said on the Jan. 23 earnings call that the next 25-basis-point increase to the Fed's target rate could yield an estimated $60 million to $110 million in pretax income. Shares of Ameritrade were up slightly ahead of the Fed announcement and rose a little more later.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Inflation And The Fed Rate-Hike Outlook: What You Need To KnowTrump's China Trade War Could Start To Get Real ThursdayForget Facebook: Why These 5 Chip Stocks Are Stock Market Bullish'China's Amazon' JD.com Has These Futuristic Projects In The Works

59,SBUX,"Donald Trump's presidency has been pretty great for stock investors, but it carries three big risks that all are in focus this week: The Fed, a trade war and the investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 election.XThe Trump wall of worry helped get stocks off to a poor start on Monday, as Facebook (FB) led markets lower over how the social network permitted a third party to access user data that helped the Trump campaign. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index fell 1.3% and 1.4%, respectively, on the stock market today. The Nasdaq slid 1.8%, but off intraday lows of more than 2%.All the fiscal stimulation from tax cuts and a big spending increase raises the risk of a more hawkish Fed. Federal Reserve policymakers are virtually certain to announce a 25-basis-point hike in the key overnight lending rate to banks on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. The risk this week is that they'll pencil in a tighter path for future policy than markets currently expect.Meanwhile, President Trump's 15-day grace period for trading partners to negotiate their way out of tariffs comes to an end on Friday, when levies of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports go into effect.The White House said last week that it's negotiating with a number of countries, but provided no detail. The European Union said last week that it's not negotiating, but making a case that the tariffs are a poor way to treat a security partner, even as it detailed a list of $3.4 billion worth of American products that could face retaliatory tariffs, including Harley-Davidson (HOG) motorcycles, Jack Daniels whiskey and Florida orange juice.The third risk hanging over stocks as the week starts comes from the broadening Russia probe, which has now expanded to cover Trump Organization business deals before the election. Trump amped up his Twitter attacks on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe over the weekend, calling it a witch hunt, while his attorney John Dowd called for an end to the investigation that he said was ""manufactured"" by ex-FBI Director James Comey based on ""a fraudulent and corrupt dossier.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNone of these three risk hanging over stocks will come to a head this week, but all three risks are growing and are likely to occupy investors for months to come.The Mueller investigation ""appears to be on the verge of a major inflection point,"" wrote Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments. Mueller reportedly has submitted some of the questions he would like Trump to answer under oath. There's speculation that more indictments could be coming soon and major uncertainty over how Congress would react if Trump engineers Mueller's firing as GOP lawmakers have shown a tepid response to proposed legislation that would protect Mueller.At the Fed, inflation concerns haven't gone away, even with some favorable recent data. Despite expectations of faster economic growth this year, the tame consumer price index reading for February makes it an even bet whether Fed policymakers will pencil in a fourth rate hike in 2018, up from three, in their economic projections that are released at the same time as the policy statement.Yet as wage growth accelerates in coming months — and there's every reason to expect it will after wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX), Bank of America (BAC) and dozens of other big employers — a more hawkish Fed is likely.On trade, Trump's indefinite exemptions for Canada and Mexico from tariffs have contained the potential fallout from his duties on steel and aluminum, and the White House may be open to other approaches to reducing global steel overcapacity that comes mainly from China, even though China accounts for just 2% of U.S. steel imports.Still, the risk of a trade war is rising. If steel and aluminum tariffs don't spark one, it may come from a U.S. crackdown on China's intellectual property practices. On Monday, Reuters reported that Walmart, Target, Best Buy (BBY) and other retailers sent a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider an emerging plan to hit Beijing with $60 billion in tariffs on American imports of apparel, electronics and other goods.

64,SBUX,"Core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, rose 0.2% in February, but the annual inflation rate held steady at 1.8%, undershooting expectations, the Labor Department reported on Tuesday.X The soft inflation reading could slightly lower odds of a fourth Fed interest-rate hike in 2018. After the report, Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures extended gains, with the major averages opening modestly higher on the stock market today. The 10-year Treasury yield pointed lower.The overall consumer price index rose 0.2% on the month and 2.2% from a year ago, matching expectations.The Fed is expected to hike rates three times this year, with quarter-point moves, as the economy looks headed for relatively strong growth and the jobless rate could sink to a multidecade low. Fed policymakers expect that wage pressures will rise as unemployment falls, leading companies to pass on some of their higher wage bills in the form of price increases.So far, official measures haven't detected a pickup in wages. The Labor Department reported weaker-than-expected 2.6% annual average hourly wage inflation in February. But faster wage growth should begin to show up this spring, reflecting recently announced wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS) and Starbucks (SBUX) that didn't happen soon enough for the latest jobs report.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

66,SBUX,"Goldilocks has left the building. For proof, just look at interest rates. The 10-year Treasury yield eclipsed 3% in late April for the first time in four years, hitting the S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq. Clearly, the not-too-hot/not- too-cold economy that supported the nine-year bull market for stocks has fundamentally changed. On Wednesday, the 10-year yield again hit 3%.To some extent, that's good: Higher interest rates largely reflect faster economic growth, unemployment headed to a multidecade low and wage gains that are slowly picking up.Yet financial markets are sending the message that this good news comes with a growing risk of a squeeze on the economy from several directions. First, higher goods and wage costs will squeeze corporate profits. Caterpillar (CAT) warned recently that the first quarter was the ""high-water mark"" for operating margins, and profit pressures already are hitting other companies ranging from airlines to packaged food. Second, higher interest rates will squeeze corporate and household borrowers. Rising rates also could squeeze stock prices as investors opt for higher returns from risk-free short-term government bonds.Yet by far the biggest risk is that policymakers will go overboard. Fed rate hikes to counteract a temporary growth spurt from new tax cuts and government spending could push the economy into a recession if they go too far.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFor the stock market, the most obvious sign of peril is the hit to the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average since late January. But worrisome signs lurk in the details. Both homebuilders, which thrive on low interest rates, and banks, which can benefit from rising rates, are among the market's biggest laggards.IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial industry group has sunk to 176 out of 197 industries based on stock performance. Shares of Lennar (LEN), the largest U.S. homebuilder, have tumbled from their January high. Meanwhile, the Banks-Money Center group, which includes JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and more, has slid to No. 158.While the latest data point to a robust housing market, there's no mystery about why housing stocks have tumbled as the 10-year Treasury yield pushes up mortgage rates. But what about the recent underperformance vs. the S&P 500 from banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America? While higher interest rates have grabbed the headlines, the more ominous signal is the flattening Treasury yield curve. Over the past year, the gap between the 2-year Treasury yield and 10-year Treasury yield has been cut by more than half. The yield curve is at its flattest levels since the lead-up to the 2007 recession.Higher interest rates boost profits for Bank of America, Citigroup and others when the longer-term rates at which they lend increase more than the short-term rates at which they borrow. But the opposite has been happening, so even bank profits are getting squeezed. Two-year yields have climbed with the Fed's overnight rate and expectations of future hikes. But the 10-year yield's rise has lagged. Investors aren't demanding a big long-term premium, which suggests mild growth expectations beyond two years. The 2-year yield has hit its highest rates since August 2008, squeezing the spread between the 2- and 10-year yields.By the second half of 2019, an economy that the Fed worries is at risk of overheating could hit a soft patch as stimulus levels off. Overly tight Fed policy that raises borrowing costs could turn that soft patch into a ditch.Fed policymakers today are focused on overheating risks, while overlooking the likely slowdown. The Fed's latest projections, issued when the Fed hiked rates in March for the first time this year, penciled in two more rate hikes in 2018, three in 2019 and still two more in 2020. That would lift the Fed's benchmark rate from 1.62% now all the way to 3.375%. If that happens, the 10-year yield could head for 4% and the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage might near 6%.The bond market's reaction to the more hawkish Fed outlook was swift. Within a week, the spread between the 2- and 10-year Treasury yield narrowed to less than 50 basis points, then fell to as little as 40 basis points in mid-April. The spread is around 47 basis points in the stock market today, with the 2-year yield at 2.53% and the 10-year at 3%.Neel Kashkari, the dovish president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, called the flatter yield curve a ""yellow light flashing"" a heightened risk of a recession. His take-away: The Fed ""may not be that far away from neutral,"" a rate that neither boosts nor restrains economic growth.""We are clearly more concerned than the Fed"" about the economic outlook for 2019, wrote Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Bank. ""As the impact of the (tax cut and spending) stimuli fades, growth rates should begin to slow perceptibly around the middle of the year, before slowing further into 2020.""Dec Mullarkey, managing director of investment research at Sun Life Investment Management, told IBD that he expects the 10-year Treasury yield to rise to 3.5% within a year as the Fed follows a path of accelerated tightening. He predicts one rate hike per quarter through 2019, ""which ultimately will lead to recession"" in 2020.To be fair, new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell faces an unprecedented policy challenge. Fiscal stimulus has always been ordered up during a recession or at the start of a recovery. This time, President Trump and Congress are delivering a double dose deep into the expansion, when growth is firm and labor markets tight. To top it off, the deficit financing used to pay for stimulus, which will exacerbate what most economists see as an unsustainable fiscal path, has added to upward pressure on interest rates.Now the Fed's challenge just got even harder. Core consumer price inflation ticked up to 2.1% in March. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption price index, rose to 1.9% in March. That's just below the central bank's 2% target.Average hourly wage growth ticked up to 2.7% in March and will likely head higher in the next few months. CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX) and Target (TGT) all announced pay hikes effective this spring. CVS raised its minimum wage to $11 an hour and Target to $12. They are among dozens of major companies that announced wage increases in the wake of corporate tax cuts passed in December.As core inflation edges past the Fed's target and the jobless rate falls below 4%, standing pat would go against policymakers' deepest instincts.Bandholz expects cooler heads to prevail, with the Fed hiking rates just once in 2019 as data point to a slowdown. But Mullarkey notes that the data ""feedback loop is not instantaneous."" By the time the Fed recognizes that a soft patch has arrived, a recession may be a fait accompli.Even if the Fed does shift gears a year from now, false expectations come at a cost today. If policymakers are determined to stick to a path of steady Fed rate hikes, they could dampen the dynamic impact of lower taxes by adding to the growing and unsustainable federal debt burden.The more future Fed rate hikes that markets price in, the more federal borrowing costs will rise. As the government borrows more to service debt with higher interest rates, borrowing costs for businesses and individuals will face more upward pressure.Deutsche Bank estimates that U.S. Treasury issuance will soar from $1 trillion in 2017 to $1.5 trillion this year and $2.3 trillion next. The surging federal deficit is the main culprit. The Fed will add to the debt pileup as it offloads about $180 billion in government bonds this fiscal year.The Fed set its plan last fall for quantitative tightening, reversing bond buys made to aid the tepid recovery from the financial crisis. Newly passed tax cuts and spending hikes make those balance sheet reductions look like ""bad timing,"" Mullarkey says.Corporations carry a record $8.8 trillion in debt that will be more costly to refinance, working at cross-purposes with the tax-cut stimulus.Meanwhile, higher U.S. interest rates have begun to push up the dollar. That acts to tighten financial conditions not only at home but in developing economies where companies often borrow in dollars.""The risk in all this is a scenario where economic growth doesn't pick up as the supply-siders expect it to but interest rates move higher as a result of the larger federal deficits and the perception that Trump's fiscal stimulus might boost inflation,"" wrote Ed Yardeni, the veteran Wall Street economist who now runs Yardeni Research.That may not happen, but Yardeni sees little evidence that corporations are putting their tax windfalls to work in the real economy: ""We are waiting to see some signs that the supply-siders are on the right track. We aren't seeing any yet, though it has been only four months into the Trump tax cuts.""Stock market history suggests investors shouldn't worry right away about a flatter yield curve, LPL Financial strategists John Lynch and Ryan Detrick write. ""When looking back at the previous five recessions, once the yield curve hit 0.50%, it took a median of nearly a year before the curve inverted,"" they note.An inverted yield curve, meaning long-term bond yields fall below short-term yields, is a reliable predictor of recession. Yet recessions typically haven't begun until 20 months after the yield curve inverts.Also, Lynch and Detrick note, the S&P 500 has enjoyed a median 21.5% gain after the Treasury yield spread narrows to 50 basis points.The problem with counting on that history is that the Fed faces unusual late-cycle stimulus at a time that federal debt has begun an unprecedented spiral upward.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:What Is Inflation, And Why Does It Matter To The Fed — And You?Amazon, These 5 IBD 50 Stocks Share This Winning Growth TraitHere's Why Anyone Can Time The Stock Market BottomLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

67,SBUX,"If the February jobs report out Friday morning comes in as strong as Wall Street expects, it will set financial markets up for another Fed interest-rate scare later this spring.X Here's the reason: Economists expect the new jobs data to match January's 2.9% hourly annual wage gain — the best since 2009. That's even though that surprising data point appeared inflated by a dive in the work week that disproportionately reduced hours for low-wage workers. But even bigger pay gains are likely coming this spring, reflecting recently announced wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS) and Starbucks (SBUX), which won't show up yet in the February jobs report.And as those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same. This week, Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all said they're raising wages for employees, and their stocks sold off amid worries about profit margins.Wall Street also expects that the jobless rate dipped to 4.0% in February for the first time since 2000, as the economy added a robust 205,000 jobs.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

68,SBUX,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowThe combination of low and falling unemployment with accelerating wage gains fits perfectly with the Phillips curve theory that has long guided Federal Reserve policy. As far as investors are concerned, the key point is that most Fed policymakers still seem pretty confident that inflation pressures won't follow too far behind wage pressures, as businesses pass along a portion of their higher wage bills.That's why an interest-rate scare is looking increasingly likely, even if a legitimate inflation scare doesn't materialize.Yet the competitive environment facing Kroger from Walmart and Amazon.com (AMZN) via its Whole Foods division, among others, offers at least some reason to doubt whether wage pressure will feed through to higher prices. Kroger said on Thursday that it will use one-third of its tax cut to boost shareholder returns, but the other two-thirds will go to higher wages and lower prices.Kroger gave weak profit guidance as it forecast smaller profit margins, sending shares crashing 12% on Thursday.Walmart's minimum-wage hike to $11 an hour was its first for new, entry-level workers since 2015, when it raised its minimum wage to $9 an hour. Then, in early 2016, Walmart hiked pay for all current associates to a minimum of $10 an hour, leading Target, Costco (COST) and others to raise their own wages. The point is that wage hikes can come in bunches. It didn't really happen last year, when wage growth hit a bit of a lull. But it does appear to be happening in 2018.If it does, Wall Street will continue to bump up odds for a fourth rate hike in 2018. Already those odds are about 1 in 3, up from about 20% a month ago, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:These Three Dow Jones Stocks Are Near Buy Points As 2 FANGs Make Bullish MoveThe Big Picture: This Is The Real News For InvestorsHere Are 10 Chip Stocks Breaking Out, Hitting New Highs Or Setting UpWhat Do Facebook, Grubhub, Salesforce And Epam Have In Common?

69,SBUX,"Chips and China names led stocks to a strong start Friday, as earnings reports stirred early trade and investors weighed fourth-quarter GDP data from the U.S. Commerce Department.XThe Dow Jones industrial average opened up 0.2%, aiming to press into new highs as Intel (INTC) and Nike (NKE) handled the early heavy lifting.The Nasdaq popped 0.4%, trading below Wednesday's high, as Intel and Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) tripped a chip rally and JD.com (JD) headed up an advance among leading China-based stocks.The S&P 500 added 0.3% and the Russell 2000 was up 0.1% in early trade.In economic news, fourth quarter GDP rose by 2.6%, according to an initial estimate from the Commerce Department. That was down from a 3.2% gain in the third quarter and below economist consensus views for a 2.9% advance. Consumer spending surged 3.8%, a big jump above the third quarter's 2.2% estimate, and beating forecasts for a 3.6% gain.December durable goods orders were better than expected, up 2.9%, nearly doubling November's 1.7% increase and clobbering expectations for a 0.6% rise. Transportation was the primary factor in the beat — minus transport goods, orders rose 0.6% for the month, well above November's 0.3% rise and in line with expectations.Intel powered ahead almost 7% — leading the Dow and the Nasdaq 100 — on the heels of its fourth-quarter report, a clean beat that included a dividend increase and an upgraded outlook. The stock has been struggling since news of security lapses affected nearly all of its products made over the past five years. That news killed a breakout attempt and sent the stock lower in early January. The stock has been fighting to hold support at its 10-week moving average.Leading chip developer Maxim Integrated jumped almost 2% after a late-Thursday report showing in line earnings and revenue for its fiscal second quarter, but third quarter guidance that topped consensus views. The stock had pulled back to just below a 55.53 buy point in a flat base.Other chipmakers saw some buying spillover, with Xilinx (XLNX) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) both rising more than 2%.Apple (AAPL) opened 0.2% lower, while Amazon.com (AMZN) led the FANG stock tech leaders with a 0.6% gain.Many China names moved higher after the Hong Kong market ended a strong week. Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA) and Weibo (WB) traded up 2% each. Both stocks had ended Thursday in buy zones.Online retail giant JD.com vaulted 4%, breaking out above a 47.50 buy point. Bloomberg reported JD.com planned to enter the U.S. market in 2018, and was seeking to finance the expansion, in part, through a deal in which shareholder Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) would buy 15% of its logistics unit. Tencent rose 2.2% in opening trade, after posting a strong advance in China's markets Friday.Drugmaker Abbvie (ABBV) punched up nearly 6% after clearing analysts' revenue and earnings targets by wide margins in its fourth-quarter results. Shares are extended 15% above a flat base buy point of 98.36.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) dropped 4% in early action, despite fourth-quarter revenue and earnings well above analyst forecasts. But the late Thursday report also showed a $318 million charge related to reformed U.S. tax rules. Intuitive ended Thursday 11% above a 405.15 buy point in a flat base.Starbucks (SBUX) dived 5%. The coffee-house chain's late Thursday report beat on earnings, missed on revenue and guided 2018 earnings above consensus views.

70,SBUX,"Citing the expected benefits from the GOP's tax cuts, McDonald's (MCD) said the company and franchisees would invest some $6 billion over the next few years to accelerate the overhaul of its U.S. business and the digitization of its restaurants.X Those plans came on top of fourth-quarter results that mostly topped forecasts. But U.S. same-store sales growth merely met what were high expectations for the burger chain.McDonald's said it will invest about $2.4 billion this year and a similar amount next year, with the balance of the $6 billion coming in 2020.The company plans to bring touchscreen self-ordering kiosks and table service — part of a restaurant makeover the company calls ""Experience of the Future"" – to more than 4,000 of its U.S. restaurants this year and open roughly 1,000 new locations. The company also plans more spending on technology. The ""Experience of the Future"" layout is already in about one-third of McDonald's restaurants.Meanwhile, the company's mobile app has grown to some 20 million registered users. McDonald's said it would continue to expand delivery service, but not at the rate seen last year.CEO Steve Easterbrook, during a conference call with analysts, said the company had made a transition from ""turnaround"" to growth last year. But as McDonald's tries to keep apace in a world habitually reaching for its smartphone, questions in the future could become more pointed over whether its spending — on technology and training staff to use it — is paying off.McDonald's said it would launch a marketing campaign in the coming months to promote delivery and mobile ordering. While Easterbrook said that delivery was a ""meaningful contributor"" to sales in big markets, he also said the U.S. was ""a little behind"" other established markets in guest counts.McDonald's shares closed down 3% at 172.48 in the stock market today, dipping below their 50-day line for the first time in four months. Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) eased 0.5%, Jack in the Box (JACK) fell 2.2%, and Wendy's (WEN) lost 2.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.But McDonald's new restaurant overhaul and the $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu introduced this month have irked some franchisees, according to a Nomura-Instinet survey released last week.Some in the survey said the discount menu would make it more difficult to be profitable. One franchisee said the $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu ""may not last the entire year."" In another remark from the survey, a franchisee lamented the absence of a ""biscuit product on the lineup"" of the dollar menu.On the conference call Tuesday, one analyst also questioned whether franchisees were chafing at the enlarged menu and McDonald's plans to expand. Easterbrook said franchisees were optimistic but also had their share of ""anxiety"" over the workload.Management during the call said it was too early to tell specifically how the new discount offering was doing, and that it could take three to six months for consumers to recognize and get used to it.For the fourth quarter, McDonald's EPS rose 19% to $1.71, above expectations for $1.59. Revenue fell 11% to $5.34 billion amid efforts to franchise more locations, but came in better than forecasts for $5.26 billion.Global same-store sales rose 5.5%, beating views for a 5% move higher, while U.S. comps advanced 4.5%, in line with Consensus Metrix estimates.The results follow another disappointing quarterly showing from Starbucks (SBUX), whose iced-coffee and espresso shots have faced stiffer competition from McDonald's own coffee promotions and McCafe drinks, along with competition from Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) and convenience stores.And as fast-food chains compete with independent restaurants and try to entice customers with cheap deals, McDonald's in October warned that its investments could pinch margins.Separately, Chili's parent Brinker (EAT) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings early Tuesday but revenue and same-store sales below views.

71,SBUX,"Starbucks (SBUX) disappointed Wall Street for a second consecutive quarter after reporting a fiscal first-quarter sales miss after the close.X Estimates: Profit growth of 10% to 57 cents a share on a 7% sales increase to $6.14 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Consensus Metrix expects 3% in global same-store sales growth, including 3.3% in the Americas and 2.2% in the China and Asia Pacific region.Results: EPS of 65 cents on revenue of $6.07 billion. Global comps grew 2%, including 2% Americas same-store sales growth and 1% China and Asia Pacific comps, all below estimates. Starbucks Rewards' active loyalty membership rose 11% to 14.2 million.Outlook: Starbucks now sees non-GAAP EPS of $2.48-$2.53, up from prior targets $2.30-$2.33 in fiscal 2018, citing tax-reform impacts.Stock: Shares are sliding late after dipping a half percent to 60.55 in the stock market today.The company said earlier in the week that it will spend $250 million on improving benefits and wages for over 150,000 employees.Coffee is an increasingly competitive space, what with McDonald's (MCD) and Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) cheaper-java efforts.Look for additional commentary on the conference call about the high-growth China and Asia Pacific region; Starbucks CFO Scott Maw said in November that the segment ""will drive roughly half of our global new store growth in fiscal 2018 — with 1,100 net new stores — nearly 600 in China.""IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report.

72,SBUX,"Starbucks (SBUX) says it's getting a $350 million tax cut this year from a 7-percentage-point reduction in its effective tax rate to 26%.""The majority of the savings will go to the bottom line,"" CFO Scott Maw told analysts on Thursday. The other 40%-plus will go to investments in workers, via wage and benefit enhancements, as well as digital investments.X Starbucks joined companies like Wal-Mart (WMT), FedEx (FDX) and Wells Fargo (WFC) in tying wage increases to the Trump tax cuts. Meanwhile, dozens of other companies including AT&T (T), Disney (DIS) and Verizon (VZ) have awarded bonuses to well more than 1 million workers, crediting tax cuts for their generosity.With the U.S. economy seemingly ready to finally shift into high gear and wage growth overdue for a pickup amid 4.1% unemployment, the flurry of wage-hike and bonus announcements has raised hopes that the GOP tax reform will provide rocket fuel for a late-1990s-style growth spurt. In a sign that economic growth is breaking out to the upside, the 10-year Treasury yield rose as high as 2.67% on Friday, a level not seen since early 2014.Yet there are reasons to be skeptical that a major economic and wage acceleration is at hand. Take Verizon, which on Tuesday said that tax reform would shrink its 2018 tax bill by $3.5 billion-$4 billion. Yet the company hasn't settled on any plans for deploying that cash windfall, other than sending about 10% of it, or $380 million, to employees via a bonus grant of 50 shares of stock per full-time worker. While those Verizon shares are worth about $2,700 at Friday's close on the stock market today, economists generally believe that consumers are much more likely to spend ongoing income gains than gains in paper wealth.IBD'S TAKE: Starbucks is ranked No. 11 by IBD in the Retail-Restaurants industry group based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see the leaders in each category. Restaurants have turned in a middling performance as a group, ranked No. 84 out of 197 groups. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks in leading groups that break above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.On a static basis, leaving out growth effects, tax cuts are supposed to provide roughly $200 billion in 2018 to the corporate and household sectors, equal to about 1% of GDP. While lower federal tax withholdings are set to take effect in February, raising household take-home pay, tax cuts are initially geared more to the business sector. That's in part because the new withholding will reflect the elimination of personal exemptions, but not the doubling of the child tax credit, which won't get paid until tax season in 2019.That means this year's boost from tax cuts will depend a whole lot on what companies do with their windfalls, though it's also looking like Congress will reach a spending deal that further boosts deficits and gives the economy a lift — assuming the government doesn't shut down again.Yet company after company seems to be signaling that they have fairly modest plans for putting their extra cash to work. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) told analysts last week that corporate tax reform would boost earnings and cash flow by $1.7 billion in 2018 after an additional investment and added operating expenses of $200 million to $300 million in artificial intelligence, data analytics, digital health and other initiatives.Iron-ore miner Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) said it's getting a $250 million cash infusion over the next several years and will owe no tax for years to come. It's still figuring out how to put the cash to work but said it ""will be primarily deployed towards debt reduction, as well as future CapEx needs associated with our core business, and last but not least, potential capital returns to shareholders,"" according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.Railroad operator Union Pacific expects tax cuts to add $1 billion to free cash flow this year but doesn't have any extra investment plans for now. ""The lower tax rate and increased cash flow resulting from it does not change the calculus that we used for the returns that are attractive to our shareholders and for reinvesting in the railroad,"" CEO Lance Fritz told analysts. ""Just because we have increased cash, it doesn't increase the pool of either projects or markets that are effective to us.""It's still very possible that the economy finally breaks the 3% GDP growth barrier this year. The economy may not need all that much extra fuel right now with labor markets already quite tight.Although income gains outweigh stock market gains, a long, powerful bull market will surely loosen purse strings. Wal-Mart's minimum-wage hike to $11 an hour may lead other employers to follow suit, if the experience from their last big wage hike in 2016 is any guide.The upfront bonuses, while surely appreciated by those who get them, are mostly meant to buy goodwill — probably both for the employers and the Republican Party, whose control of both the House and Senate are at risk in the coming elections.Still, the effectiveness of corporate tax cuts and their power to trickle down to employees can't really be judged in the short term.The whole idea is that improving the relative attractiveness of the U.S. as a place of business will, over time, lead to more productivity-enhancing investment, faster growth, more demand for labor and higher wages. Yet the real legacy of the tax cuts over the longer term will depend in part on just how bad budget deficits get, which may determine whether the tax cuts can be sustained over time.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Trump Tax Cuts Will Fuel Economic Growth At Just The Right TimeHere Comes A $1 Trillion — Scratch That — $2 Trillion U.S. Federal DeficitFacebook, Apple, Amazon To Grab Earnings Spotlight: Investing Action PlanHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

75,SBUX,"McDonald's (MCD) ambitions over the past year have been an intimidating force in the fast-food industry. The Dow Jones component has rolled out delivery and mobile order and pay, plans to spend a bunch of money on creating more digitized restaurants, and tried to muscle in on Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) and Starbucks (SBUX) through cheap coffee promotions.X But a key part of its value game — its $1-$2-$3 Dollar Menu, which launched in January — might not be connecting with customers.RBC, in a research note dated Friday, says the $1-$2-$3 Dollar Menu is off to a ""tough start."" And analysts there slashed their first-quarter U.S. same-store sales estimates for McDonald's to a 1% gain, down from expectations for 3.5% growth, citing ""a disappointing early sales impact from the $1, $2, $3 menu"" and broader disappointment in the fast-food industry overall.RBC also cut its price target on McDonald's stock to 170 from 190 and cut its earnings-per-share estimates for this year to $7.43 from $7.60. The firm also lowered its EPS forecast for next year to $8.17 from $8.46.RBC analyst David Palmer wrote that he believed the new value menu took attention away from local marketing, particularly at breakfast, ""which likely slowed as a consequence.""Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD Newsletters""In addition, we believe $1, $2, $3 menu's positioning as a variety play protected franchisee profitability but lacked the 'hero' item necessary to resonate with value-conscious consumers,"" he said.""Lastly, we believe McDonalds' early signaling of this initiative may have invited a flurry of competitor responses and diminished its overall impact.""Shares tumbled 4.8% to 148.27 in the stock market today, stabbing further below their 200-day line and reaching their lowest point since May. McDonald's was easily the worst-performing component on the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday. It's the second-worst Dow Jones stock in 2018 so far, behind only General Electric (GE).The U.S. fast-food landscape is replete with value deals from the likes of Wendy's (WEN) and Jack in the Box (JACK).However, Palmer said there's time for McDonald's to turn things around, and still outperform rivals over the next year, with better marketing and a continued push in delivery and other digital efforts. New products, including the addition of  fresh-cooked hamburger patties to more restaurants, could also help.""We believe fiscal stimulus from tax reform, improving wage growth, low unemployment, and food-at-home inflation should drive more traffic to discretionary occasions in the remaining three quarters of 2018,"" he said, adding that McDonald's business internationally should also remain strong.Wendy's rose 1%, while Jack in the Box edged up 0.9%.

76,SBUX,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday that he still sees evidence of modest slack in the labor market, meaning the economy still has room to grow without rising inflation pressures.X ""Nothing (in the data) suggests to me that wage inflation is at a point of acceleration,"" Powell said.Powell's remarks were at least somewhat soothing to Wall Street, coming after the main takeaway from his Tuesday appearance before a House panel was that the economy will grow at a faster pace this year than Fed policymakers had anticipated when they penciled in three rate hikes by the end of 2018.Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported early Thursday that the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, rose a tame 1.5% from a year ago in January, as expected.Although the Institute of Supply Management reported that national factory activity in February grew at its fastest pace since 2004 and jobless claims hit a 48-year low, Powell's less-hawkish testimony left Treasury yields little changed in early afternoon trading. Treasury yields dipped by the close as the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off on the stock market today as President Trump vowed to impose a 25% steel tariff, raising trade war fears.Inflation has been undershooting expectations for years, so it may seem odd that markets are so focused on the threat now. Yet there's good reason to think that 2018 will be the year when price pressures begin to surface, at least to a moderate extent.That's not to say inflation is about to spike. The war for retail dominance between Amazon.com (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT), the transparency in pricing afforded by the internet and disruptive business models like Airbnb are a legitimate game-changer. A push by the FDA to expedite generic drug approvals is likely to continue to help keep a lid on prescription prices.While such disinflationary fundamentals aren't going away, a host of forces are lining up this year that have potential to finally push inflation up to the Fed's 2% goal.The combination of the $1.5 trillion tax cut and $300 billion spending package is expected to shift an economy that had already picked up speed into still-higher gear.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersStepping on the fiscal accelerator in the ninth year of an economic expansion amid solid growth is an experiment that's never been tried, and it's likely to add to upward cyclical pressure to inflation that tends to emerge when demand for labor and resources rises.With economic optimism on the rise and more dollars in their pocket, consumers may be, on the margins, more receptive to price hikes. Companies that have recently announced price increases include Amazon, which hiked fees for monthly Prime members; Disney (DIS), which raised theme park ticket prices for single-day guests; and Wendy's (WEN), which said on its latest earnings call that it raised prices by 1% in January to offset higher wages and commodity costs.Whether or not the tax cuts really deserve the credit, companies such as Walmart, CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX) and Wells Fargo (WFC) gave a nod to the tax legislation when they subsequently announced pay hikes.Wage growth looks like it will take another step up from the Goldilocks-like 2.5% gain in average hourly wages that prevailed for most of 2017.IBD'S TAKE: Stock market volatility has returned, so it's more important than ever to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. Fed policymakers often talk about full employment, the lowest that unemployment can go before inflation starts to accelerate. No one knows exactly where it is and some economists, citing the experience of Japan, have doubts about the theory. Still, some economists expect unemployment to get as low as 3.5% this year, and new Fed chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that 3.5%, in his view, is the lowest imaginable rate of full employment, though he think it might be quite a bit higher.Some industries, such as trucking, are seeing above-average wage gains because the job market for hiring and retaining drivers is especially competitive. Those extra wages tend to get passed along. While transportation makes up a relatively small fraction of a retailer's costs, those extra costs, along with higher retail wages, could affect the end consumer — even if it only results in less discounting.Most inflation tends to be services inflation, so even flat prices for goods would be inflationary.Fed policymakers have said for much of the past year that transitory factors may have only temporarily lowered inflation. One such factor was Verizon (VZ) changing its cell-phone service pricing to provide unlimited data. Because that change began to lower inflation data in March 2017, that temporary factor will drop out of the picture this coming March,Crude oil prices, at about $61.50 per barrel, are about $7 higher than a year ago, boosting the price of gasoline. While the Fed's core gauge of inflation excludes energy prices, higher energy prices can get passed along to consumers. Delta Air Lines (DAL) is among a number of airlines that have tried to pass along higher fuel costs to customers through price hikes recently. So far, those hikes haven't taken hold, but stayed tuned.The U.S. dollar is more than 10% cheaper than it was a year ago, relative to a basket of other currencies from advanced economies. That raises the price of industrial commodities and a range of imported goods. At the least, a rising dollar is no longer working to hold down inflation in the U.S. by making foreign goods cheaper in dollar terms. A weakening dollar, at least at the margins, adds to inflation pressures. Import prices rose for German cars, French cheese and Italian wine, though it's not clear the extent to which end consumers will face higher prices, since consumers have the option of buying nonimports.President Trump has until mid-April to make up his mind over whether to impose tariffs on steel imports, as recommended the Commerce Department. Investors in U.S. Steel (X) appear to be betting that Trump will pull the trigger. Higher steel prices would add costs to cars made in the U.S., though it's not clear how automakers will respond when it comes to auto prices.Another question is how foreign governments will retaliate if the U.S. enacts punitive trade measures that they believe are unwarranted under World Trade Organization rules.The possibility of a trade war that then forfeits some of the disinflationary effects of globalization is among the biggest wild cards in the inflation outlook.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED INInflation And The Fed Rate-Hike Outlook: What You Need To KnowWhat Is Inflation, And Why Does It Matter To The Fed — And You?Amazon Vs.

77,SBUX,"New Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress that he sees ""at most modest risk"" from high asset prices, despite the generally buoyant stock market. But investors sold shares on concerns that Powell and fellow policymakers will raise interest rates more than three times in 2018 due to stepped-up economic growth forecasts.Asked whether low interest rates have fueled ""dangerous risk-taking,"" Powell noted no real build-up of leverage among households or the emergence of other significant risks to financial stability.Wall Street reacted somewhat negatively to Powell's first monetary policy testimony to Congress since taking the helm of the U.S. central bank, focusing on his outlook for stronger economic growth and what that might mean for the number of Fed rate hikes in 2018.Yet the overall tenor of his testimony probably should be taken as positive, because it suggests a lack of urgency to raise interest rates. The Fed, in other words, remains data-dependent and won't move to tighten policy more quickly due to tax cuts and fiscal stimulus unless inflation gathers momentum. On the stock market today, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed at session lows, down more than 1%.Bank stocks fell somewhat amid the broad sell-off. Shares of Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) lost a fraction, though JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial Services (PNC) were down 1% or more. Banks can reap higher net interest margins as interest rates rise, especially when the long-term yields rise more than short-term yields.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!The 10-year Treasury yield rose 3 basis points to 2.90%, off session peaks but not far off last week's four-year high of 2.95%.""At the December meeting, the median participant called for three rate increases in 2018,"" Powell said in response to a question over what it would take for the Fed to hike rates more than three times this year. ""Now since then — we will submit another projection, all of us, in three weeks  — but since then, what we've seen is incoming data that suggests that strengthening in the economy. We've seen continuing strength in the labor market. We've seen some data that will, in my case, add some confidence to my view that inflation is moving up to target. We've also seen continued strength around the globe, and we've seen fiscal policy become more stimulative. So I think each of us is going to be taking the developments since the December meeting into account and writing down our new rate paths as we go into the March meeting.""Powell added that it was his ""personal outlook"" as well as the overall committee that ""the economy has strengthened since December,"" when Fed policymakers last offered their economic and policy projections for 2018.Powell's upgrading of the outlook is hardly a surprise, coming after Congress backed a $300-billion-plus increase in federal spending earlier in February. Even before that, some Fed policymakers had been marking up their economic projections, as noted in the minutes from their Jan. 30-31 meeting.Asked about whether ""profligate fiscal policy"" might require higher interest rates than otherwise by a Democratic committee member, Powell said that the Fed will keep its on eye on the economy, not on the actions of Congress, but he allowed that ""all things equal,"" the appropriate interest rate would be higher when fiscal policy becomes more stimulative.The Q&A seemed to cancel out the seemingly positive reaction to his published testimony. In prepared remarks released before the market open, Powell said that the Fed policymaking committee sees the risks to the economy as balanced between upside and downside risks, even as ""some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds,"" especially fiscal policy.The takeaway from the Q&A is that the assessment of balanced risks might date back to the January meeting, before the latest fiscal stimulus.Yet in discussing a possibility that the Fed might discuss adopting an inflation range, instead of its specific 2% target, as a guide for policy, Powell underscored that there's not much reason to worry about an upsurge in inflation.""Generally speaking inflation has been low or stable for 15 years now,"" Powell said.IBD'S TAKE: Stock market volatility has returned, so it's more important than ever to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. Indeed, core inflation, as measured by the Fed's favored personal consumption expenditures price index, hasn't touched 2.5% since 1995. The past two economic expansions weren't tripped up by the Fed having to tamp down an inflation outbreak, but by the bursting of the dot-com and housing bubbles.So when Powell expresses confidence that few troubling signs of excess have emerged, as well as confidence about a stable inflation outlook, investors should see the potential for this economic expansion running for several more years.In prepared testimony, Powell said, ""In gauging the appropriate path for monetary policy over the next few years, the FOMC will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing PCE price inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis.""Powell's testimony comes as firms including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are predicting one more rate hike this year than the Fed's own policymakers projected in December. Passage of a $310 billion budget deal in early February, after the Fed's last meeting, also has led economists to mark up their GDP growth estimates and added to concerns that inflation could make a comeback.Inflation and the risk of a hawkish Fed has come back on the radar of investors after the January jobs report showed average hourly wages growing 2.9% from a year ago, up from the Goldilocks readings near 2.5% that persisted in 2017.Walmart (WMT) announced in January that it was hiking base pay to $11 an hour, three years after it last announced a boost in starting pay to $9 an hour. On Thursday, CVS Health (CVS) said it will adopt an $11 minimum wage in April. Both companies tied their wage hikes to their tax cuts, saying they would spend part of their tax windfall on higher compensation, but that's only part of the story. Competition for quality workers led Target (TGT) to boost its wage to $11 starting last October, when tax reform was still up in the air. At the time, Target made a commitment to raise its base wage to $15 an hour by the end of 2020. Starbucks (SBUX), JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo also are among the dozens of big employers who have hiked wages in the wake of tax cuts.While details of the January employment report suggested that the reported acceleration in wage gains was misleading, it does appear that faster wage growth is on the way.Although a faster pace of rate hikes can't be ruled out if wage gains and inflation exhibit momentum, Powell's remarks suggest that the Fed isn't predisposed to a faster pace of rate hikes and will continue to give the economy some running room.Arguably, financial markets are leading the Fed and not the other way around. The 10-year Treasury yield touched a four-year high last week after the Fed minutes from the January meeting noted that ""a stronger outlook for economic growth raised the likelihood that further gradual policy firming would be appropriate.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:What Is Inflation, And Why Does It Matter To The Fed — And You?LGI Homes, Toll Bros.

78,SBUX,"The Phillips curve theory at the heart of the Federal Reserve's approach to raising interest rates as the economic expansion marches ahead is that lower unemployment gives rise to faster wage growth.X Fed policymakers figure that inflation pressures won't follow too far behind wage pressures, as businesses pass along a portion of their higher wage bills.Yet those assumptions central to proactive monetary policy — the steady diet of Fed rate hikes even when inflation remains below the Fed's 2% target — have taken some knocks lately.With the jobless rate expected to sink below 4% this year and fall to 3.5% or lower in 2019, one of the biggest questions for financial markets is how much the link between unemployment, wages and inflation will finally assert itself?Soon after tax reform passed in December, dozens of major companies — including Walmart (WMT), CVS Health (CVS), Bank of America (BAC) and Starbucks (SBUX) — announced wage hikes, a reflection of a tightening labor market. It's a good bet that wage growth is heading higher, but how much pricing power will companies really have?Here are five keys to understanding the outlook for inflation and Fed rate-hike policy:To understand why the link between wages and inflation isn't as clear as it once was, Target (TGT) is a good place to start. In September 2017, the discount retailer announced a big wage hike and broad-based price cuts just three weeks apart.The price cuts on thousands of items came shortly after Amazon.com (AMZN) celebrated the close of its Whole Foods acquisition by cutting the upscale natural foods grocer's prices as much as 43% on select items like avocados and kale.Then, in a bid to limit employee turnover and attract 100,000 seasonal workers in a tight labor market, Target hiked its minimum wage from $10 to $11 an hour and committed to a $15 hourly wage by the end of 2020.Higher wages may not feed through to higher prices in the near term when a few huge companies have significant market power and incentives to put market share over profit. Amazon has been rewarded with a massive valuation because of sales growth and the growing reach of its Prime membership, even when its profits disappointed.Internet-enabled transparency also keeps a lid on prices, and that's not just true of retail. Marriott International (MAR) CEO Arne Sorenson has explained that the hotel group doesn't have as much ability to raise prices as it had in past cycles. While home-sharing via Airbnb has some impact on leisure travelers, he sees the bigger issue as ""radical transparency in pricing.""IBD'S TAKE: Stock market volatility has returned, so it's more important than ever to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. With just a few relatively modest trend reversals, inflation has been moving in only one direction since 1980: lower.After sinking from more than 10% in 1980, core consumer price inflation, which excludes the sometimes-volatile food and energy categories, hasn't touched 3% since 1995. Aggressive Fed rate hikes under Paul Volcker pushed back inflation in the early 1980s, while pre-emptive Fed rate increases in the mid-1990s under Alan Greenspan ushered in the current low-inflation environment.Amid technological advances that empower the consumer and the globalization of manufacturing supply chains, in part to capitalize on lower-wage labor, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index hasn't even touched 2.5% in decades and sat at 1.5% at the end of 2017.Even if tight labor markets and near-3% GDP growth foster a bit more inflation, perspective is in order: Neither investors nor Fed policymakers are likely to get overly concerned.You might guess that the Apple (AAPL) iPhone X, which raised eyebrows with its near-$1,000 starting price when it was released in November 2017, sent the price index for phone equipment surging after its release, and you'd be right — to a point. The Labor Department, which adjusts price changes to account for technological advances, said that phone equipment costs fell 2.6% in January 2018 vs. a year earlier, which was the smallest decline since 2011.The combination of quality improvements, productivity gains in manufacturing and global competition goes a long way to explaining why most inflation is in services. In the year through January, services inflation was running at 2.6%, while goods inflation was just 1.2%. Excluding food and energy, goods inflation was -0.7%.An exception in the goods category is prescription drugs, whose prices always rise, bringing political scrutiny. But prescription-drug prices rose just 2.4% in January vs. a year earlier, roughly half the increase seen in the prior three years. Prescription benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) said average per-member prescription costs of the employer plans it serves rose 1.5%, the lowest since 1993. One key: Generic fill rates rose 86% over the prior year. That likely reflects, in part, the FDA's new expedited generics approval approach, so the gains may be sustained.Likewise, health care services prices rose a historically tame 2% in January. In regulated industries like health care, where prices are rarely transparent and government plays an especially large role, the power to raise prices is limited by the regulator.The Fed's favored PCE price index, unlike the CPI, reflects prices that individuals pay, both directly and indirectly, such as for health care that is subsidized by government and employers. Health care accounts for just over 20% of the PCE index vs. about 9% of the CPI's weight. Meanwhile, housing accounts for a similar 20% of the PCE index, but more than 30% of the CPI. With shelter costs rising 3.2% from a year ago in January, that difference goes a long way to explaining why core CPI inflation typically exceeds core PCE inflation.As labor markets tighten and workers have more opportunity to quit and find greener pastures, companies pressured to raise wages have three possibilities for dealing with their higher compensation costs: increase prices, accept lower profits or offset the higher wage bill by increasing worker output or finding other efficiencies.To some extent, the earnings boost from the Trump tax cuts, which slashed the corporate tax rate to 21%, could make companies more willing to swallow higher wages without passing those costs on to customers. Incentives in the tax bill allowing for immediate expensing of equipment purchases could increase investment to make workers more productive.A key question will be whether heightened wage pressures and bigger investment incentives can combine to get the U.S. out of the productivity rut it's been in for much of the past decade. If so, that could raise the growth ceiling on the economy without stoking inflation.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:This Shock Economic Outlook May Keep Stock Market On EdgeChart-Reading Basics: How To Find The Correct Buy Point For Leading StocksBitcoin, Blockchain And Private Industry: You Ain't Seen Nothing YetWhy A Bull Market Rally Is The Time To Review Your Stock-Selling SmartsAI News: Artificial Intelligence Trends And Leading Stocks

Monster has begun working with the English Premier Soccer League and tried to have more of a presence in esports — both of which are popular in the nation, Cowen analysts have noted.And as McDonald's (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX) and convenience stores battle over customers' caffeine dependency, Monster has also bulked up on its own coffee drinks: Caffe Monster — which the company is in the process of launching in the U.S. — Java Monster, Espresso Monster and others.Shares of McDonald's rose 0.2% after-hours, while Starbucks edged up .01%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Here's How McDonald's Will Invest $6 Billion In The U.S. Through 2020Cashless Stores And Cryptocurrency: What Is Starbucks Up To?Monster Beverage Tumbles Below Buy Point On Low-Energy Earnings

The trend suggests a pickup in national average hourly wage gains in coming months, which is likely to raise concerns about a faster pace of Fed rate hikes.CEO Brian Cornell on Tuesday also reiterated Target's  commitment to raise its minimum wage all the way to $15 an hour by the end of 2020, which ""establishes Target as an employer of choice.""Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

At a minimum, Amazon would surely face enormous pressure to embrace Target's $15 minimum wage commitment.In perhaps a reflection of Wall Street's concern about the earnings impact of Target's investments, the company said the wage hike will apply to current associates, suggesting the minimum wage for new workers will remain $11 an hour for now.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stocks Skid, But Nasdaq Rises On Three Pieces Of Good NewsThese 5 Top Financial Stocks Just Carved This 'Super-Growth' PatternWhy Air Force Is Rushing To Fly A Sixth-Generation Fighter JetFed Inflation Gauge Stays Tame, But Here's 6 Reasons Why Investors Are NervousAmazon Vs.

84,SBUX,"The Fed meeting ended with no rate hike, as expected. The no news briefly boosted stocks, but they quickly reversed lower. Higher interest rates, inflation and the dollar won't let the Dow Jones and the broader stock market snap out of their recent funk.Wall Street expected the Fed statement to recognize that the pickup in core inflation has suddenly brought it close to the 2% inflation target. The Commerce Department reported Monday that the core personal consumption expenditures price index, which excludes food and energy, rose 1.9% from a year ago in March.""On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have moved close to 2%,"" the Fed statement said. The Fed also signaled it was willing to let inflation rise above 2%, stating that it's a ""symmetric"" target.With no press conference or update of policymakers' economic projections, any hawkish or dovish shift won't be known until Fed meeting minutes come out on May 23.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseDespite healthy earnings from Apple (AAPL), the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index were both close to the flat line just before the Fed meeting announcement, while the Nasdaq composite was barely higher. Apple is the largest component of the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq.After the 2 p.m. ET announcement, the Nasdaq expanded modest gains, but only briefly. Heading into the close, the Nasdaq fell 0.4%. The Dow Jones and S&P 500, after briefly turning positive, fell 0.7%. All finished near session lows.Investors won't get much of a reprieve from Fed rate-hike concerns. The Labor Department's April employment report out on Friday is expected to show that the jobless rate fell to 4.0% last month. Average hourly wage growth above the 2.7% expected also is a threat, with major employers like CVS Health (CVS), Target (TGT) and Starbucks (SBUX) announcing that wage hikes would take effect this spring.The latest culprit for the sluggish stock market is the dollar. The U.S. dollar index hit a new high for the year on Wednesday, continuing its recent resurgence against other major currencies. The greenback's roughly 3% rise since the end of March will have a dampening effect on earnings for U.S. multinationals with broad international exposure like Dow Jones stocks Caterpillar (CAT), Boeing (BA) and Merck (MRK). Earnings in foreign currencies are worth less in dollar terms when the dollar strengthens.The dollar's strength stems from the pickup in inflation and growing expectations that the Fed will hike rates four times this year. Meanwhile, central banks in Europe and Japan are in no rush to tighten. The widening gap between interest rates in the U.S. and overseas has made the dollar more of a draw.Higher interest rates and inflation also could squeeze earnings in coming quarters. Higher interest rates also raise borrowing costs for consumers and businesses and can crimp the affordability of major purchases like autos and housing. Further, two-year Treasury yields have climbed more than 10-year yields, and the flatter yield curve pinches net interest margins for the likes of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC).After the Fed meeting, the 10-year yield was at 2.972%, while the two-year was at 2.496%. Those were little changed, but the yield spread is near its lowest level in years.Meanwhile, more companies are beginning to note profit-margin pressure from rising input costs, higher fuel and transportation costs, and rising wages.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Squeeze: Why The Stock Market's Bull Run Faces Its Biggest Threat In YearsIf You Like Apple, You'll Love These 6 Market-Beating Stock PlaysHere's One Way To Play Netflix And Other Hot Internet StocksAmazon, These 5 IBD 50 Stocks Share This Winning Growth TraitHere's Why Anyone Can Time The Stock Market BottomLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

87,SBUX,"That $320 billion, two-year budget deal signed by President Trump on Friday will speed up economic growth and push the jobless rate to 3.2% by the end of 2019, an updated forecast from JPMorgan estimates. That's the kind of fiscal jolt that could keep stock markets jittery for an extended period.X By the end of next year, JPMorgan Chase economists expect the Federal Reserve to hike its key interest rate a whopping eight times — three more than Fed policymakers projected in December. As far as unemployment, Fed projections see it stabilizing at 3.9% next year vs. the current 4.1%JPMorgan's Fed forecast is an outlier, at least for now, but it highlights why stock markets have entered a new phase that may not quickly be left in the rearview mirror.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off sharply on Thursday as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped all the way back to 2.88%, within a whisker of last week's four-year high. That triggered a move to a stock market correction. On Friday, the major averages tumbled on the stock market today until the S&P 500 briefly undercut its 200-day moving average. That trigger a sharp rebound, with the Dow, S&P and Nasdaq closing up 1.4%-1.5%.Bond and stock markets are suddenly concerned that interest rates will vault higher as the Fed gradually reverses government bond purchases it made to aid recovery from the financial crisis, Treasury issuance balloons to fund the return of trillion-dollar deficits, and the economy shifts into overdrive. It's no help that the deficit outlook will continue to worsen, with $2 trillion annual deficits on their way within a decade.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market is now in a correction. Read our weekly cover story on why stocks sold off and what you should do now.On Friday, Moody's said that the ""pre-eminent"" financial and economic position of the U.S. will preserve its triple-A credit. But Moody hinted that its deteriorating fiscal position could jeopardize the U.S. rating amid evidence of ""declining growth potential, coupled with emerging aversion to open trade and foreign labor.""One interesting aspect of JPMorgan's forecast is that even after the bank's economists boosted their forecast of GDP growth by 0.4 percentage point this year to reflect the budget deal, they're still expecting less-than-stellar 2.6% growth this year. In 2019, they see the budget deal lifting growth by 0.3 percentage point above their earlier forecast, but still only to 2.2%.In other words, they suspect that the economy may not have to grow all that fast to generate the kind of wage and inflationary pressures which haven't been seen since before the last recession and which most financial market participants seemed to think were history.It's possible that JPMorgan will be proved wrong by faster productivity growth and labor force growth than it expects. Yet the bank's forecast highlights why Wall Street may no longer be comfortable counting on benign economic outcomes.After Friday's jobs report showed that average hourly wage growth accelerated to 2.9% in January from a year ago, markets suddenly started to price in a risk that dormant wage and price inflation may shift into higher gear, fueled by the Trump tax cuts.Now, after the latest budget deal, the balance of economic risks has pretty clearly shifted to the upside, meaning the risk is that growth will come in too hot.While details of the January employment report suggested that the reported acceleration in wage gains was misleading, it does appear that faster wage growth is on the way.Walmart (WMT) announced in January that it was hiking base pay to $11 an hour, three years after it last announced a boost in starting pay to $9 an hour. On Thursday, CVS Health (CVS) said it also will adopt an $11 minimum wage in April. Both companies tied their wage hikes to their tax cuts, but that's only part of the story. Competition for quality workers led Target (TGT) to boost its wage to $11 starting last October, when tax reform was still up in the air. At the time, Target made a commitment to raise its base wage to $15 an hour by the end of 2020. Starbucks (SBUX), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) also are among the dozens of big employers who have hiked wages in the wake of tax cuts.Even with tax cuts, the risk that wage growth will feed through to higher inflation had appeared modest enough for investors to mostly discount, as consumers have grown to expect internet price transparency and the ever-expanding reach of Amazon.com (AMZN) to keep inflation in check.Those competitive dynamics help explain why Walmart, even as it hiked its minimum wage in January, also shut dozens of Sam's Clubs employing about 10,000 workers, cut 3,500 store co-manager positions and thinned the ranks at its headquarters.Yet now the risk of investors being caught flat-footed by a rise in inflation is growing as Washington prepares to unleash a second dose of fiscal firepower.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Did Congress, Trump Just Crush The Stock Market Rebound?Market Outlook Changes AgainAmazon Ready To Move On UPS And FedEx
"
88,SBUX,"Just about the last thing the stock market needed as it tries to recover from the Dow Jones industrial average's 4.6% plunge to start the week was a $300 billion deficit-boosting budget deal.X The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off sharply as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped all the way back to 2.88%, within a whisker of last week's four-year high. By the close on the stock market today, the Dow sank 4.15%, the S&P 500 3.75% and the Nasdaq 3.9%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq undercut Tuesday's intraday lows. Yet the renewed weakness in the stock market only dragged the 10-year Treasury yield moderately lower to 2.83%.The S&P 500 and other major averages had already reversed lower Wednesday in part as the increased spending agreement took hold, lifting yields.The trading action makes it look as if the stock market isn't just climbing a wall of worry, it's climbing a wall of debt, and that wall just got steeper. Already, Wall Street had been expecting $1 trillion in Treasury issuance in 2018, nearly double last year's total. Now, the deal to boost spending on defense and domestic programs, while sending more money to hurricane-hit regions, could raise that total by $150 billion or more, with no letup in years to come.IBD'S TAKE: After the Thursday, Feb. 1, market action — and before Friday's and Monday's market drubbings — IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when it makes sense to be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The heavier load of Treasury debt that needs to be issued to fund widening deficits comes as the Federal Reserve has begun gradually reversing government bond purchases it made to aid recovery from the financial crisis. The rise in Treasury yields needed to clear all of the new supply is generally seen as a negative for stocks, because higher interest rates can curb borrowing appetites and make stocks look like less of a bargain.After Friday's jobs report showed that average hourly wage growth accelerated to 2.9% in January from a year ago, markets suddenly started to price in a risk that dormant wage and price inflation may shift into higher gear, fueled by the Trump tax cuts.Now, after the Senate budget deal that got a stamp of approval from House Speaker Paul Ryan, markets have reason to double down on those concerns. Whether or not Fed policymakers come right out and say it when they next meet in March, and New York Fed President William Dudley's comments on Thursday suggest they probably will,  the balance of economic risks has now clearly shifted to the upside, meaning the risk is that growth will come in too hot.While details of the monthly employment report suggested the concern about accelerating wage gains was premature, it does appear that faster wage growth is coming. Walmart (WMT) announced in January that it was hiking base pay to $11 an hour, three years after it last announced a boost in starting pay to $9 an hour. On Thursday, CVS Health (CVS) said it also will adopt an $11 minimum wage in April. Both companies credited the tax cuts for their decision, though the competition for quality workers led Target (TGT) to boost its wage to $11 starting last October, when tax reform was still up in the air. At the time, Target made a commitment to raise its base wage to $15 an hour by the end of 2020.

89,SBUX,"U.S. stock indexes sagged midday Tuesday despite strong housing data and a looming House vote on the Republican tax-cut bill. The bill is expected to pass with no help from the Democrats.X The Nasdaq retreated more than 0.4%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average dipped 0.2% each. The small-cap Russell 2000 was off nearly 0.2%.Volume in the stock market today was below the previous session's pace.Among stock groups, the day's strongest performers were in retail and oil. The laggards were toy, meat and solar stocks.The retail sector has been showing strength recently. In the past two weeks, retail has provided a fair amount of daily new highs. For example, in Monday's session, the retail sector had 21 new highs, trailing only the bank sector's 26 new highs and the finance sector's 30.The restaurant group was up about 1.5% midday Tuesday.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) popped 1.31 to 53.99 Tuesday in volume running at a pace more than 30% above average.The stock is in the 5% buy zone from a 52.65 early buy point in a six-week flat base. The standard entry is 53.71. The Street expects Texas Roadhouse's Q4 earnings to jump 28%. This would be the best quarterly growth in five quarters.Texas Roadhouse is No. 2 in the restaurant group in Stock Checkup at Investors.com. The No. 1 restaurant stock is Shake Shack (SHAK), but Shake Shack is too extended to buy safely.Starbucks (SBUX) inched up 0.06 to 58.09 in average volume, but the stock could be setting up for a breakout. Starbucks has sketched a saucer-with-handle pattern. The potential buy point is 59.93, which is easiest to spot on the daily chart. One drawback is that Starbucks' chart doesn't show a prior uptrend of at least 30%. IBD research shows that for a base to be productive, a prior uptrend of at least 30% is needed.Starbucks has been in a choppy, sideways pattern for about two years. The most recent breakout was in April and led to a 9% gain before the stock began its current consolidation.November housing starts came in at 1.297 million on an annualized rate, almost 5% more than expected. Permits rolled in at 1.298 million, or 2% better than expected.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.5%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average moved up 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.X Early Friday, U.S. GDP for the fourth quarter of 2017 came in at 2.6%, below the 2.9% consensus estimate. Still, it was the best underlying growth since 2014.Meanwhile, the price of Bitcoin declined over 3% to about $10,800 on CoinDesk. Coincheck — a popular Japanese Bitcoin exchange — suspended all withdrawals, while halting trading in all cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin.Among the Dow Jones industrials, Intel exceeded its Q4 earnings and sales targets, raised its dividend and boosted its 2018 estimates. Shares surged 8% into new highs. A recent breakout on Dec. 20 above a 47.40 cup-shaped base entry ended poorly when the stock triggered the 7%-8% loss-cutting rule amid security flaws in its chips.Among companies reporting earnings, Western Digital (WDC) fell less than 1% after reporting mixed earnings results. The stock has been a laggard since mid-July as it continues to consolidate sideways, but made a move in 2018 to reclaim its 50- and 200-day moving average lines. Shares are still about 8% away from a new high.Chip-gear maker KLA-Tencor (KLAC) turned nearly 2% higher, reversing from early losses after reporting strong results late Thursday. The stock is looking to find support at its recent flat-base entry at 110.11, following Thursday's nasty downside reversal that saw the gain briefly reach over 10% at its intraday peak.Coffee purveyor Starbucks (SBUX) dropped about 5% after its fiscal-Q1 revenue missed the Street's targets.

91,SBUX,"Taxes: The Republican tax reforms are growing increasingly popular as people start to realize the benefits. For Democrats who unanimously opposed these tax cuts, this can't be good news.X This week, Home Depot  (HD), Starbucks (SBUX) and Walt Disney (DIS) announced that they were handing out bonuses or raises — or both — as a direct result of the GOP's tax cut.Home Depot is giving hundreds of thousands of hourly employees what it calls ""tax reform bonuses"" of up to $1,000. Starbucks is lavishing $250 million in pay raises and stock grants on 150,000 workers, also crediting the tax cuts. At Disney, 125,000 workers are getting a $1,000 bonus, and the company is investing another $50 million in employee education programs.These companies join more than 240 others — many of them household names like Apple  (AAPL), Wal-Mart  (WMT), AT&T  (T), Auto Nation  (AN), Boeing  (BA), Comcast  (CMCSA), Southwest Airlines  (LUV) and Verizon  (VZ) — that have already done so, putting more money in the pockets of at least 3 million workers.This string of tax-cut-related good news is just beginning. In February, millions of workers will suddenly see their paychecks get bigger, as the law's new, lower withholding schedules take effect. And this is to say nothing of the indirect effects of the tax cuts — more investment, faster economic growth, more jobs.Even before all this, the GOP's tax bill was growing increasingly popular, according to the New York Times, which found that support jumped from 37% to 46% in one month, with disapproval dropping from 58% to 49%.Complete Coverage Of The GOP's Tax Cut PlanWhat's more, the share of people who think they will get a tax cut climbed from 33% in December to 41% in January.This must come as a shock to Democrats — not a single one of whom voted for the tax cuts — who thought the public would continue to see the tax cuts the way they did.Nancy Pelosi called the GOP tax plan a ""brazen con job"" and ""tax scam"" that would ""bleed the American people dry.""Chuck Schumer said the bill was unpopular with the public because ""they know what this bill is all about. They know they are getting crumbs, if that, while the wealthy are getting big pieces of cake – that's why it's so unpopular.""It's true that the tax bill was unpopular when President Trump signed it into law — not because people knew what was in it, but because Democrats and their media lapdogs successfully hid the details and deceived the public.That's made abundantly clear in the latest Harvard-Harris poll, which found that just 47% supported the tax bill when they were asked about it at the start of the survey.But then the pollsters described 15 key provisions that are actually in the plan, and found substantial majority support for all but three. Eighty-four percent back the lower income tax brackets, for example, 82% doubling the child tax credit, 77% the cut in the tax rate for ""pass-through"" companies. Even the limits on mortgage and state tax deductions get majority support.The poll then asked a follow up question: ""Given this information about what is in the new tax code, do you favor or oppose it?"" — fully 57% said they supported it.In other words, once people learned about the details of the GOP tax reforms, support jumped 10 percentage points.Even Democrats surveyed by Harvard-Harris found themselves changing their minds — with support going from 18% at the outset to 34% after learning about the details.If this trend continues, Democratic lawmakers will have a lot of explaining to do when they face voters in nine months.RELATED:Great Again: Disabled Rejoin Workforce In Droves As Economy Gains SteamHigh Tariffs And Weak Dollar Are No Way To Make America Great AgainThe Trump Economy, One Year In: A Success By All MeasuresClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

93,SBUX,"In the wake of a solid month for the broad market and U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, some fund managers are tilting toward value-oriented stocks.X Having lagged growth stocks, value stock valuations are increasingly attractive, says Tom Galvin, lead manager of $4.1 billion Columbia Select Large Cap Growth (ELGAX). Yet their prospects are bright as the U.S. and key foreign economies continue to grow, Galvin added.In November, the broad market got a lift from such Dow Jones Industrial stocks as Boeing (BA), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Walt Disney (DIS) and Home Depot (HD).With the S&P 500 climbing 3.07% last month, the broad stock market made it 13 straight month of gains, according to Lipper Inc. U.S. diversified stock mutual funds rode along, advancing 2.62% on average, their 15th monthly gain in the past 16 months and third positive month in a row. That lifted their year-to-date gain to 17.40%.Both the S&P 500 and Dow hit all-time highs to that point on Nov. 30.List Of Mutual Fund Six Month LeadersBest Performing Mutual Fund CategoriesWhy Fidelity Gave This Mutual Fund Manager More Money To InvestWhich Stocks Are The Top Fund Managers Buying?Bond Fund Decline In November: Turning Of The Tide?The November gain by U.S. diversified stock funds was due largely to ongoing global economic growth, generally better-than-expected corporate profits, benign inflation and heightened prospects for U.S. tax reform with a lowering of the corporate tax rate, said Galvin, whose fund finished among the top 16% in large-cap growth fund performance last month.Wall Street's approval of reforms that lighten corporate regulatory burdens also boosted the stock market last month, said John Rogers, chairman, CEO and chief investment officer of Ariel Investments and lead manager of flagship $2.2 billion Ariel Fund (ARGFX).But market leadership is poised to shift to value-oriented categories of stocks and mutual funds in the coming months, away from growth-oriented ones, added Rogers, whose fund's 7.01% return last month topped 98% of its midcap value rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct.That tilt toward value already seemed underway in November. With a 3.27% gain on average, midcap value funds led all U.S. diversified stock fund categories. Small- to midsize companies tend to derive a larger portion of their revenue and earnings from the U.S., so they're likely to benefit more than large-cap companies from tax reform. ""There was a rotation into smaller stocks and value stocks as the prospect for successful passage of tax reform grew,"" Galvin said.That tax-reform tilt was also why U.S. diversified stock funds outpaced world stock funds, which averaged just a 1.03% gain last month. Japanese funds, averaging a 2.95% advance, led foreign stock funds.Industrials funds averaged a 3.10% gain in November, leading all major sector categories. They were driven by the rotation into value-oriented stocks.U.S. taxable bond funds were slightly above break even on average in November. U.S. Treasury funds led other categories, averaging a 0.08% gain. World income funds averaged a 0.54% gain. Muni bond funds lost ground overall last month.While GDP growth, corporate profits, tax reform and regulatory reform should benefit all corporations, longtime outperformance by growth stocks has left value stocks more attractively valued, Rogers said.The Russell 2500 Value index was trading at 18 times next year's earnings as of the first week of December. In contrast, the Russell 2500 Growth index was trading at a lofty 32 times. ""It's one of the biggest gaps I've seen in my career between value and growth,"" Rogers said. ""And there will be an inevitable reversion to the mean when things go too far.""In addition, the Federal Reserve's widely expected tax hikes should boost margins for banks, which generally are categorized as value stocks, Rogers said.Already, his firm's researchers are getting bullish input from industrial companies. ""A lot are describing recoveries and business momentum building,"" Rogers said.Further, Amazon's (AMZN) widespread competitive influence is helping to keep retail prices low, which is preventing inflationary pressure from growing, he said.In at least the near term, one area in which he expects to see many investment opportunities is among industrials, what he calls light cyclicals and manufacturers. In that group, he holds Kennametal (KMT). ""It's a favorite,"" he said. ""They make cutting tools and cutting blades that are used for everything from coal mines to rebuilding highways and infrastructure. They should be a prime beneficiary whenever we get an infrastructure (spending) bill through Congress.""Going forward, financial services should also outperform, ""especially money managers and private equity funds that are public,"" he said, adding, ""They're cheap because they're not in popular indexes.""Among those, he cites KKR (KKR). ""They are a large private equity firm run by Henry Kravis,"" he said. ""They're cheap and private equity is one of the best performing asset classes.""Rogers also owns Lazard (LAZ). ""They're an investment banking franchise,"" he said. ""They have money management and mutual fund subsidiaries that focus on emerging markets and international investing.""He also likes the beleaguered media space. Many investors are afraid that cable companies are suffering subscriber attrition, which creates downward pressure on fees to content providers. Rogers nevertheless like MSG Networks (MSGN). The New York City-area sports network broadcasts games for nine sports teams including the professional basketball Knicks. ""The fear has been overdone,"" Rogers said. ""Live sports, whether seen on smartphones, computers or TV, one way or another that content will be viewed and monetized.""Health care is his fourth-largest sector. He prefers systems and instruments maker Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO) and clinical testing services provider Laboratory Corp. of America (LH). ""We're not involved in the riskier, more complicated parts of health care,"" he said.Growth-oriented fund managers still see opportunities on their side of the market ledger.""In the consumer space, where we're overweighted, Costco (COST) continues to demonstrate very strong traffic gains and sales growth,"" Galvin said. ""Roughly one-third of their customers are small-to-medium size businesses, which could benefit from tax reform.""Galvin also likes apparel maker Nike (NKE) and coffee-shop chain Starbucks (SBUX). After lagging in 2017, both ""could be potential winners in 2018,"" Galvin said. ""Each has issues, but each could benefit from accelerating GDP growth, helped by fiscal stimulus, stronger consumer confidence fueled by lower consumer tax rates and better jobs growth.""In health care, the CVS Health (CVS) takeover of Aetna (AET) could signal that ""more consolidation is forthcoming,"" Galvin said. Also, a looser regulatory environment and tax reform that motivates companies to repatriate profits held outside the U.S. could increase the attractiveness of more health care companies.And new opportunities could emerge in the tech sector if tax reform and corporate profit escalation encourage more companies to spend on technology. ""For example, Salesforce.com (CRM): it was the fastest company to get to $10 billion in revenues, and it's likely to be the fastest to double revenues within five years as they continue to go broader and deeper in (finding customers among) Fortune 1000 companies at home and abroad,"" Galvin said. ""Salesforce is already by far the market leader in cloud dominance.""The firm's cloud software helps businesses organize and handle sales operations and customer relationships.And take $1.5 billion Champlain Small Company Fund (CIPSX) — an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner in the growth, small-cap and diversified equities categories. The growth-oriented fund owned Innospec (IOSP) as of July 31, a specialty chemicals firm that has a 92 Composite Rating from IBD and an A SMR Rating. Earnings per share rose 8%, 13% and 28% the past three quarters.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Composite Rating is scored on a scale of 1 to 99. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher. Innospec's SMR Rating means it's in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.RELATED:Looking For Winning Stocks?

95,SBUX,"Wall Street wasn't surprised by Starbucks' (SBUX) decision to trim its long-term financial targets, given what a tough space retail has become, but at least one expert is wondering aloud if the plan to open more Starbucks locations is the answer.XAttributing the cut in the earnings growth target to ""persistent traffic declines,"" menu price hikes and increased competition, Quo Vadis Capital's John Zolidis wrote in a Friday report that ""we're not so sure"" that cannibalization isn't an issue, given Starbucks' plan to open thousands more stores.Starbucks executives are ""clearly spending a lot of time considering which markets to own, which to refranchise, what concepts to shut down, which to sell off,"" he said. ""These may all be the right strategic moves (although we confess our disappointment with the value destruction from the Teavana transaction), but none of them are driving more customers into the stores. In a way, slower unit growth might be preferable to all this action.""Same-store sales both globally and in the Americas disappointed slightly when Starbucks reported late Thursday, although it wasn't necessarily uncharacteristic for the restaurant industry, domestically speaking.""While the +2% same-store sales number for the U.S. in fiscal Q4 (calendar Q3) is below Street expectations, it is helpful to remember that this particular quarter was by some measures the second-worst same-store sales quarter for U.S. chain restaurants as a whole in the last five years,"" wrote Nomura's Mark Kalinowski. ""Starbucks is not as immune to this type of issue as it was years ago, as Starbucks is the second-largest restaurant chain in the country.""As competition has increased, Starbucks faces not just other coffee shop chains like Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) but also fast-food heavyweights such as McDonald's (MCD), which recently called McCafe a ""significant growth platform.""IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.A point of curiosity, then, is where the coffee giant's digital efforts will lead, now that it is flinging the doors open for non-loyalty program members to use its order-ahead mobile payment system. The service, which allows customers to order their drinks via the Starbucks mobile app and pick them up in-store, was initially so popular that it created congestion issues at pickup counters. Management quickly vowed to smooth out its problems. As of the end of the quarter, Mobile Order & Pay accounted for a tenth of all Starbucks' U.S. transactions, said executives on the call.While Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson called the Mobile Order & Pay expansion ""another powerful driver of confidence"" toward positive same-store sales growth, Kalinowski believes that Starbucks still has some kinks to work out.The company ""may be struggling with in-store customer flow more than the Street believes, as mobile-order-and-pay functionality continues to ramp up in popularity,"" he wrote, trimming his price target to 63 from 67 but keeping his buy rating.Regardless, as growth in China remains a bright spot, consensus largely seems to be that Starbucks is still a solid brand, and the stock continues to be adorned with a number of outperform, overweight and buy ratings from analysts, despite recent performance.Starbucks shares, which had fallen sharply overnight, rose 2.1% to 56.02 in the stock market today, hitting their best level  in three months.Dunkin' Brands climbed 1.1% to 58.96, close to a 59.80 buy point.

The 10-year Treasury hit 3% for the first time in four years, hitting 3.02% during the week before pulling back to 2.96%. Short-term yields continued to rise faster than long-term rates, squeezing the yield spread. Alphabet (GOOGL) expenses and ongoing chip weakness also hit stocks. But Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Boeing (BA) and Visa (V) rallied on strong results. Intel (INTC) and Microsoft (MSFT) initially hit buy points Friday, but pulled back.Amazon's first-quarter earnings skyrocketed, more doubling the EPS estimate.

Fellow Dow Jones stock United Technologies (UTX) reported stronger-than-expected Q1 earnings and sales. The industrial giant also raised its full-year adjusted EPS and sales forecast.Lockheed Martin (LMT) topped first-quarter estimates and the defense contractor raised EPS and revenue targets. But the F-35 maker didn't raise its cash-flow expectation. Northrop Grumman (NOC) also reported Q1 earnings above estimates, but Northrop said it didn't submit a bid for the Air Force's GPS III contract, leaving Lockheed as the likely lone bidder. Raytheon (RTN) raised its full-year earnings forecast above consensus as its Q1 earnings and revenue topped estimates. General Dynamics (GD) beat on earnings and met revenue views. Shares of all four defense contractors sold off sharply for the week.The software kingpin earned 95 cents a share, up 36% year over year, on sales of $26.8 billion, up 16%, in its fiscal third quarter. Analysts expected 85 cents and $25.71 billion. Microsoft (MSFT) has been shifting its business from desktop PC software to cloud-computing infrastructure and applications, such as Office 365 and Azure. Microsoft's commercial cloud revenue rose 58% in fiscal Q3. The software giant initially reclaimed a recent buy point on Friday, but pared gains.Intel (INTC) earnings rose 32% as sales grew 9% to $16.1 billion, both well above analyst views. The chip giant guided higher for current quarter sales, indicating a third-straight quarter of top-line growth. Shares initially jumped to a 17-year high Friday but reversed to close slightly lower. Texas Instruments (TXN), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), STMicroelectronics (STM) and Xilinx (XLNX) got boosts from upbeat earnings reports. But chip-gear maker Teradyne (TER) tumbled after warning of weak demand for equipment to test mobile devices. Western Digital (WDC), which makes disk drives and memory chips, tumbled Friday despite beating fiscal Q3 views. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fought for support at its 200-day moving average.Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported Q1 earnings and revenue that topped views but a sharp rise in capital spending, margin pressure and higher traffic acquisition costs sparked a sell-off in the internet search giant. Capex jumped to $7.3 billion from $2.5 billion in the year-ago period, including $2.4 billion for a real estate purchase in Manhattan. Traffic costs — or what Google pays partner websites to generate advertising revenue — jumped 36% to $6.288 billion. Google has hiked spending on YouTube and video content, cloud computing, smart home consumer appliances and artificial intelligence projects.PayPal (PYPL) topped earnings and revenue expectations as total payment volume rose 27% to $132 billion year over year, vs. estimates of $128 billion.

Ford will not invest in traditional sedans for North America going forward, and will almost phase out passenger cars by 2020, as consumers migrate to SUVs and light trucks. GM still sees small cars as an opportunity at home and abroad, even as it too shifts focus to larger and more profitable vehicles.Casino operator Las Vegas Sands (LVS) topped first-quarter results estimates, helped by strong demand in global gaming hub Macau and in Singapore. Macau also helped Q1 results for Wynn Resorts (WYNN), but its overall and Macau sales disappointed some analysts. Wynn Resorts also approved a dividend increase. The earnings report from Wynn was the first since Steve Wynn resigned as CEO and sold his stake following allegations of sexual misconduct. MGM Resorts (MGM) narrowly beat, but the stock tumbled on declining traffic at its U.S. locations. MGM is more U.S.-focused than Sands or Wynn.Amgen (AMGN) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) broadly topped Q1 views, though Amgen's sales and adjusted profit outlook for 2018 were a bit soft at the midpoints. Sales of Alexion's blockbuster Soliris missed some estimates, but shares popped on a promising study for new drug ALXN1210. Biogen (BIIB) sales lagged on sluggish Spinraza and multiple sclerosis drug revenue. Prothena (PRTA) tanked 69% on Monday after it scrapped a rare disease drug on a failed Phase 2 study.

AbbVie (ABBV) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) both topped profit views and raised full-year guidance, though Bristol's sales missed some estimates. Shire (SHPG) said it's considering a raised $64 billion takeover bid by Japan's Takeda. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) topped views, though sales declined vs. last year. Vertex said it'll move another triple-pill regimen into Phase 3 studies.Domino's (DPZ) delivered a 59% EPS gain while revenue leapt 26% to $785 million, blowing out views. Shares rose 7.3% on Thursday. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) stock vaulted 24% to a 10-month high after EPS unexpectedly jumped 33%. Same-store sales also topped. Starbucks (SBUX) was on par on earnings with an 18% EPS rise to 53 cents, though a 14% rise on sales to $6.03 billion outdid analyst predictions.New Oriental Education (EDU) earned 67 cents per share as revenue grew to $618 million. Total student enrollments rose 7.7% year over year to about 861,400. IBD 50 stock TAL Education's (TAL) EPS jumped to 14 cents a share as revenue soared 59% to $504 million. Student enrollments ballooned 96% vs. a year earlier to 2.62 million.

Homebuilder stocks were generally muted due to rising interest rates. But D.R. Horton (DHI), the biggest U.S. builder, on Thursday bested views with a 52% EPS surge as revenue swelled 17% to $3.795 billion. Homebuilder stocks rallied for solid gains, helped by cooling Treasury yields. New-home sales rose in March to an annualized sales pace of 694,000 units, a four-month high. Meanwhile existing-home prices rose 6.8% in February vs. a year earlier.China search-engine leader Baidu (BIDU) reported a Q1 profit that blew past estimates, lifting shares. Baidu still owns a majority of iQiyi (IQ), which held its IPO in March. Video streaming website iQiyi accounts for roughly 20% of the parent's revenue. Shares in iQiyi fell after it released earnings in tandem with Baidu.Visa (V) reported a 29% EPS gain on a 13% revenue rise, both beating fiscal Q2 views. The credit- and debit-card giant raised its full-year revenue outlook. Shares leapt 4.8% on Thursday.3M (MMM) met EPS views as revenue rose 8% to $8.278 billion, just above consensus.

Adjusted profit rose 127% per share as sales swelled 31% to $782 million.Align Technology (ALGN) reported adjusted earnings of $1.17 per share and $436.9 million in revenue, handily beating views for 98 cents and $408 million, respectively.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) delivered impressive Q1 EPS and revenue growth, but fell short of some lofty expectations. Shares fell 4.7% for the week. E-Trade Financial (ETFC) continues to rise after last week's strong results.First Solar (FSLR) hit a six-year high after Q1 earnings topped expectations due to the sale of several solar projects, as it expanded U.S. production.Proofpoint (PFPT), a cybersecurity firm, topped adjusted first-quarter earnings and revenue views, but guided low on Q2 profit. Shares fell 5.2% Friday. In Q1, advanced protection solutions nearly doubled to make up 20% of new and add-on bookings, up from 15% in the prior quarter.

101,SBUX,"Starbucks (SBUX) announced late Thursday that it is selling off its Tazo tea brand — including all of Tazo's recipes, intellectual property and inventory — to consumer goods giant Unilever (UL) for $384 million, as it focuses on its Teavana property.Separately, the coffee-shop giant cut its long-term financial goals and missed revenue and same-store sales forecasts for the quarter, sending shares lower after hours.X Estimates: A near-2% EPS drop to 55 cents a share — in what would be the first such decline since 2009 — on a 0.4% revenue uptick to $5.73 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Consensus Metrix expects same-store sales to rise 3.2% globally, and 3.3% in the key Americas segment.Results: EPS of 55 cents, meeting views, but falling short of sales expectations with a surprise 0.2% revenue slip to $5.698 billion. Global comps rose 2%, including an Americas comp gain of 3%, also missing. U.S. same-store sales grew 2%.The company also lowered long-term financial targets, cutting annual earnings growth to 12%, vs. prior guidance for 15%-20%. Global comps of 3%-5% and high-single-digit net revenue growth is expected.Cold drinks are performing well for Starbucks, and management also sounded bullish on its non-drink menu items, reiterating its hopes that food sales will account for 25% of revenue by 2021.Well over a third — 36% — of tender now comes from Starbucks Rewards, its loyalty program, said CEO Kevin Johnson on the call. And as the java titan continues to push its mobile order-ahead service, the company is throwing open the doors to everyone to use Mobile Order & Pay, regardless of whether they are loyalty members.""In quarters ahead, all customers will be able to download our app, set up a digital relationship with Starbucks, select the payment vehicle of their choice – and use Mobile Order and Pay,"" he said. ""This is the first of many initiatives that will combine direct, digital relationships with new value propositions in order to expand the total universe of customers with whom we engage and communicate.""And as more Starbucks locations pop up all over Asia and its China Asia-Pacific segment continues to lead growth, execs said they'll focus more on the China segment in future earnings calls.""Our China/Asia Pacific segment will drive roughly half of our global new store growth in fiscal 2018 - with 1,100 net new stores - nearly 600 in China,"" said CFO Scott Maw.Stock: Starbucks shares fell 3.4% to 53 in late trading, which would be below their 50-day line and right around a 52-week low. Starbucks closed down 0.5% on the stock market today.While Starbucks has been targeting food sales recently with some success, fast-food giant McDonald's (MCD) has been eyeing coffee as a source of growth and may be drawing some customers from Starbucks with its new McCafe promotions.Elsewhere in the coffee space, rumors floated earlier in the week that Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins parent Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) might be an acquisition target for JAB Holding, the mega-coffee corporation that already owns Caribou Coffee, Peet's Coffee & Tea, Intelligentsia and Keurig Green Mountain.Dunkin' shares closed down 0.7% to 58.33 Thursday after surging nearly 8% on news of the potential JAB deal. Dunkin' is near a 59.80 cup-base buy point.McDonald's rose 1% to 168.10, hitting an all-time high. The stock is just out of range from a buy point.RELATED:Starbucks' Run In 2014-2015 Shows Why Weekly, Daily Stock Charts Each Have RoleStarbucks Earnings Expected To Drop For First Time In 8 YearsApple, Apple, Apple ...

102,SBUX,"When Starbucks (SBUX) reports fourth-quarter results after the close Thursday, Wall Street will be looking for solid same-store sales growth, improved mobile-order-and-pay usage and continued expansion in China.XAnalysts expect a near-2% drop in earnings to 55 cents a share, in what would be the first such decline since 2009, on a 0.4% revenue uptick to $5.73 billion.Shares closed up 0.5% at 55.13 on the stock market today. Starbucks is in a sluggish spot, trading choppily around its 50-day moving average and breaching its longer-term 200-day line in late July.But as Howard Schultz's successor, Kevin Johnson, continues to get settled into the role of chief executive, Piper Jaffray analysts believe there's upside to Starbucks' current share price as the coffee giant continues to develop its digital efforts, expand its menu offerings, roll out premium locations and open more stores in China, among other things.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy expects a 3% same-store gain for the key Americas segment, which she notes is below consensus for 3.5% growth, amid concerns of market saturation.Either way, that would represent a deceleration. In fiscal Q3, comps rose 5% in the Americas and 4% globally.""Our domestic checks (including conversations with a relatively balanced geographic group of operators representing (about) 10% of the domestic system) suggest sales and traffic trends were positive in July, August and September, (with increasing momentum) driven in part by ongoing food (protein boxes) and beverage innovation (cold brew and tea infusions),"" she wrote on Oct. 8.The firm has an overweight rating and 70 price target on the stock.IBD'S TAKE: To prep for the week's major earnings reports, take a look at this week's Investing Action Plan for everything you need to know. Streamlining the process by which customers place their orders online and pick them up in the store hasn't been entirely smooth, but management has promised to work out the kinks, and coffee drinkers appear to like the system. As of July, mobile-order-and-pay made up 9% of all U.S. transactions, and payments from the Starbucks smartphone app accounted for 30% of all domestic orders.But Starbucks noted in its most recent earnings call in July that a ""challenging"" retail landscape had given it cause for caution headed into Q4.""While the chain did deliver a superior 5% (same-store sales) growth result in (the third quarter), the outperformance was short-lived and trends soon returned to the low- to mid-single-digit range,"" noted RBC Capital analyst David Palmer in mid-September, holding an outperform rating and 63 price target on Starbucks shares.""This 'new normal' for the company's growth rate seems to be a function of both a new reality in retail and diminishing incrementality of Starbucks' growth enablers of food/beverage innovation, digital initiatives (mobile order & pay), and rewards membership growth.""Dunkin' Brands (DNKN), which owns Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins, shot up 7.8% to 59.090 Monday, rebounding from its 200-day moving average, on takeover buzz from JAB Holding, which owns Keurig, Panera Bread, Peet's Coffee, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts and Caribou Coffee.Dunkin' Brands turned in mixed results last week that fell short of earnings forecasts.McDonald's (MCD) reported better-than-expected Q3 earnings last week. McDonald's pointed to menu changes and drinks promotions, including for its McCafe line of coffee beverages. Shares of the fast-food giant rose 0.5%, still in buy range from a breakout earlier this month.RELATED:Dunkin' Brands Buzzes On Talk Of Buyout By Krispy Kreme, Peet's ParentEven Starbucks Is Seeing The Amazon Effect; Here's What Top Execs SaidMcDonald's Sees Thinner Margins, But Here's Why No One Is ComplainingStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksEarnings Calendar, Analyst Estimates And Stocks To WatchNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

104,SBUX,"Core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, rose 0.2% in March, while the core CPI annual rate accelerated to 2.1%, the Labor Department reported on Wednesday.Wall Street expected the core CPI to rise 0.2% on the month and 2.1% from a year ago. The annual rate rose partly because a weak year-earlier reading, when Verizon (VZ) shifted to unlimited data plans, was dropped from the calculation.Overall CPI dipped 0.1% on the month, while the annual increase accelerated to 2.4%. The monthly rate was expected to be flat, but gasoline prices fell sharply.The Federal Reserve has a 2% inflation target, but favors the core PCE deflator over the core CPI. The core PCE deflator has shown slightly lower inflation.After the report, Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures remained solidly in the red on the stock market today. That followed Tuesday's market trend-shifting follow-through day thanks to big gains on the S&P 500 index and other major averages.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe 10-year Treasury yield fell before the report and remained lower.The Fed is expected to hike rates three times this year, as the economy looks headed for relatively strong growth and the jobless rate could sink to a multidecade low. Fed policymakers expect that wage pressures will rise as unemployment falls, with companies on passing some of their higher labor costs via price increases.Last week, the Labor Department reported that average hourly wage inflation ticked up to 2.7% in March after February's surprisingly soft reading. Faster wage growth is just beginning to show up after recent wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS) and Starbucks (SBUX), Bank of America (BAC) and dozens of others.Kroger (KR) from Walmart and Amazon (AMZN) via its Whole Foods face fierce competition. That offers some reason to doubt whether wage pressure lead to higher prices. Kroger said on Thursday that it will use one-third of its tax cut to boost shareholder returns, but the other two-thirds will go to higher wages and lower prices.Yet even doves on the Fed are beginning to sound more hawkish. ""Although last year we faced a disconnect between the continued strengthening in the labor market and the step-down in inflation, mounting tailwinds at a time of full employment and above-trend growth tip the balance of considerations in my view,"" Fed Governor Lael Brainard said last week.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Why You Should Buy On The Stock Market Follow-Through DayThanks, For Nothing: China's Xi Jinping Offers Nothing New, But Trump ThrilledHow To Handle The Stock Market Correction With Swing Trading StrategyQ1 Earnings: Netflix, 3 Top IPOs Join Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus GrowthLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

105,SBUX,"At Taco Bell, Brian Niccol was seen as a turnaround artist of sorts. He was an early believer in mobile ordering. Nacho fries, Doritos Locos Tacos, Quesalupas and breakfast? All of them appeared on Taco Bell's menu on his watch.X But as he prepares to take the helm at Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) in March, leaving the Yum Brands (YUM) unit, a similar approach — possibly resulting in a more mobile Chipotle with more food choices and a better loyalty program — would raise new questions about the assembly-line format, pared-down menu and higher ingredient standards that once won it praise from Wall Street.Niccol's appointment, announced late Tuesday, has generally made analysts happy and taken a massive weight off its stock. Shares sprinted 15.4% higher to close at 289.91 in the stock market today. Chipotle stock has fallen for more than two years, hitting a five-year closing low Tuesday, following food-safety concerns and continuing disappointing sales.But restaurants' efforts to allow people to order via smartphone have occasionally chafed with the actual locations themselves. Starbucks (SBUX) has been trying to untie the knots of customer traffic that have formed at its locations due to the popularity of its mobile order and pay service. As delivery proliferates, others, like McDonald's (MCD), have had to tweak how they manage the flow of cars through their parking lots as they roll out mobile ordering and delivery.Ivan Feinseth, research director at Tigress Financial, said moving food-prep duties like cutting vegetables off-site could help Chipotle move customers through lines more quickly as digital orders grow. A new loyalty program, paired with a mobile app, could mean fewer cash payments — which slows down lines — from consumers willing to pay more, he said.""They don't reward their loyal customer base,"" he said. ""Taco Bell has a very robust loyalty and mobile ordering app.""Chipotle Mexican Grill has already introduced second-make lines, or lines that sit behind the main ordering stations, to handle digital orders. During its Q4 call, Chipotle said wait times have fallen on those lines. It plans to have second-make lines in at least 30% of its restaurants by the end of this year.Feinseth also called for the company to expand delivery and open for breakfast — something McDonald's doubled down on in 2015 to turn its sales around. He said Chipotle could easily do a breakfast burritos and bowls menu. Mexican-blend coffee, he said, along with plain coffee, wouldn't hurt either.Those changes would be possible, he said, without deviating from Chipotle's core menu. And he remains upbeat that people will respond to new additions.""While people do like simplicity and consistency, the quick-casual industry also drives traffic by change,"" he said.The fast-casual Mexican chain's new products, so far, have had mixed reception. People said the queso was too gritty. Others said its brand of chorizo, a combination of pork and chicken, was not chorizo-y enough.What's more, Chipotle is not Taco Bell. Cowen analyst Andrew Charles, in a research note, said that Chipotle's sales trends are in far worse shape than Taco Bell's were when Niccol joined that chain in 2011.""The guys at Chipotle tried a lot of things,"" said John Zolidis, president at Quo Vadis Capital. ""They didn't just sit there waiting for the customer to come back.""Zolidis said Chipotle's higher food standards — ""Food with Integrity"" and the like — may have also made it more difficult to bring in new menu items.""I don't think Taco Bell was holding itself to that same standard,"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Here's How McDonald's Will Invest $6 Billion In The U.S. Through 2020Restaurant Brands Doubles Payout: Dividend Yield Now Tops McDonald's, Wendy's

106,SBUX,"Don't be fooled by the weak job growth or higher-than-expected unemployment in March. Better wage growth and less labor-market slack mean the stock market won't get much of a reprieve from Fed rate-hike fears.The good news: The surprisingly weak 103,000 job gain throws a bit of cold water on the notion that the economy is overheating. Yet a hawkish shift by the data-dependent Federal Reserve will continue to remain a risk for investors with every wage and inflation report. The consumer price index coming out on Wednesday is the next one to watch. UniCredit Research expects the core CPI, excluding food and energy, to rise 2% from a year ago vs. 1.8% in February.Following the report, Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite initially moved higher, then relapsed in late morning trade on the stock market today. The Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite were all down 1% or more.Before the report, stock market futures were deep in the red in reaction to President Trump's threat to strike back at China even harder, with tariffs on an additional $100 billion in imports.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe 10-year Treasury yield slipped about 5 basis points to 2.78% as stocks fell and the jobs and unemployment data surprised on the soft side. Odds of four Federal Reserve rate hikes this year, one more than expected, eased to about 26% after the report, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.Average hourly wages rose 8 cents to $26.82 an hour, lifting the annual gain to 2.7%, in line with expectations.Wall Street economists expected a 175,000 job gain, 4.0% unemployment and 2.7% average wage growth.Still, job growth has averaged a solid 202,000 the past three months, including revisions. A balmy February likely shifted some seasonal job employment forward, depressing March job creation.Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit, pointed out that jobless rate actually did decline in March — if you don't round to the tenths — from 4.14% to 4.07%. Over the past 12 months, the labor force has increased by 125,000 per month, on average, well below the pace of job creation. ""Looking forward, we continue to expect the jobless rate to fall towards 3.5% by the end of the year.""Employers also have been increasing work hours, further evidence of less slack. On a weekly basis, the average wage rose 3.3% from a year ago in March, the best gain in seven years.Investors should expect the improvement in hourly wage growth to be the start of a trend for two reasons.First, dozens of major employers announced wage hikes over the past few months, but few came early enough to show up in February's jobs report. Walmart (WMT) and CVS Health (CVS) hiked their minimum wages to $11 an hour. Six months after raising its minimum wage to $11, Target (TGT) said last month that it will pay all current associates at least $12 an hour starting this spring.Second, wage growth receded in the spring of 2017, rising just 2.2% at an annual rate from March through June. As those months that saw depressed pay gains drop off, replaced by months with firmer growth this year, the annual rate will trend higher.Take a closer look at Walmart's wage changes. Before its pay hike announced in January 2018, Walmart hadn't raised its base wage in nearly three years. That's a big deal. When Walmart hiked its minimum wage for all current associates to $10 an hour in February 2016, that wage hike was contagious.Walmart is big enough to put upward pressure on wages for other employers. Target and Costco (COST) were among those who quickly hiked pay shortly after that 2016 move. Average hourly earnings growth rose to 2.8% that July before momentum flagged.Walmart's 2016 wage hike came when the jobless rate was nearly 5%. Now it's around 4%, so competition for workers has intensified. At least for workers on the lower end of the wage spectrum, pay hikes appear to be broad-based. Starbucks (SBUX), Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all have said they're raising pay. Meanwhile, dozens of banks, including Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) hiked their minimum wage to $15 an hour for tellers.As wage gains accelerate and the jobless rate moves below 4% in coming months, Fed policymakers may lean toward four interest-rate hikes in 2018, not just three. Fed models assume that inflation will follow wage growth higher. There's reason to be skeptical. For example, Kroger said last month that it will use the bulk of its tax cut to offset the cost of higher wages and lower prices. The competitive environment facing Kroger from Walmart and Amazon (AMZN) via its Whole Foods division offers at least some reason to doubt whether wage pressure will feed through to higher prices.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: The Big Picture: Here's The Problem With The Stock Market RallyThis Defense Giant Breaks Out As 4 Peers Target Buy Points: Investing Action PlanHow To Invest In A Late-Stage Bull Market As FANG Stocks SlumpStocks To Watch: These Stocks Just Got Added To IBD 50, IPO LeadersTop Stock LGI Homes Breaks Out To Buy Zone On Strong Growth

JPMorgan economists are now expecting the jobless rate to fall to 3.2% by the end of 2019, and they think the Fed could raise rates eight times by then.After January's jobs report showed that average hourly wage growth accelerated to 2.9% in January from a year ago, after being stuck around 2.5% for most of 2017, markets suddenly started to price in a risk that dormant wage and price inflation may shift into higher gear.Wage growth is seen a prelude to higher inflation, and there is reason to expect better wage gains, even if the wage acceleration that showed up in January's employment report was a misleading product of a shorter workweek.Walmart (WMT) announced in January that it was hiking base pay to $11 an hour, three years after it last announced a boost in starting pay to $9 an hour. Last week, CVS Health (CVS) said it also will adopt an $11 minimum wage in April. Both companies tied their wage hikes at least loosely to their tax cuts, but that's only part of the story. Competition for quality workers led Target (TGT) to boost its wage to $11 starting last October, when tax reform was still up in the air. At the time, Target made a commitment to raise its base wage to $15 an hour by the end of 2020. Starbucks (SBUX), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) also are among the dozens of big employers who have hiked wages in the wake of tax cuts.Even with tax cuts, the risk that wage growth will feed through to higher inflation had appeared modest enough for investors to mostly discount, as consumers have grown to expect internet price transparency and the ever-expanding reach of Amazon to keep inflation in check.Those competitive dynamics and the need to boost productivity help explain why Walmart, even as it hiked its minimum wage in January, also shut dozens of Sam's Clubs employing about 10,000 workers, cut 3,500 store co-manager positions and thinned the ranks at its headquarters.If companies don't have the luxury of raising prices to offset higher wages, pay hikes stand to cut into profits, which is among the reasons that CVS shares traded lower after announcing wage increases.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Why The Stock Market Sold Off, And What You Should Do NowThis Shock Economic Outlook May Keep Stock Market On EdgeHow Do You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

115,SBUX,"Daily or weekly stock chart? That sounds like asking for window or aisle seat, smoking or nonsmoking, fries or no fries with that.XInvestors naturally gravitate to either the weekly or the daily chart in their stock routine. The risk in using only one is that an investor could miss something important. What are some advantages of each chart?Among the weekly chart's strengths:** It covers a longer period than the daily chart, giving a broader perspective. One big psychological benefit: It's easier for shareholders to stay calm when looking at the weekly chart.** Weekly action can smooth out minor noise. If an investor is looking only at daily charts, it's easy to get too focused on moves in the latest 6-1/2-hour session. Worse yet, if an investor gets too focused on daily charts, many are tempted to ""graduate"" to intraday charts.If an investor is looking for a way to mess with his or her own mind, intraday charts are it. Short of electric-shock treatments, few things jar the psyche more intensely than intraday charts.But weekly charts don't carry every advantage. Among the daily chart's strengths:In late October to early November of 2014, Starbucks (SBUX) sketched a handle that was visible only on the daily chart (1).At first glance, the handle might've looked too low for the base, which rested within a larger consolidation. But the math checked out; it passed the midpoint test. The buy point was 77.77, 10 cents above the handle's highest intraday price of 77.67.When the stock cleared the buy point, volume was missing. Disciplined investors would not have bought because of the low volume. But big volume kicked in on Nov. 21 (2), giving investors a chance to buy from 1% to just under 3% above the ideal entry.From the highest price on Nov. 21 to an intraday high of 99.20 on March 19, the stock gained nearly 28% in four months.(A version of this article first appeared in the April 9, 2015, edition of IBD.)IBD's TAKE: Scroll through Investor's Corner archives to beef up your knowledge of the most important sell rules.

It also has improved heart-rate tracking, GPS tracking, water proofing, on-device workout coaching, and automatic activity and sleep tracking.Other features include contactless payments, onboard music from Pandora Media (P), smart notifications, customizable watch faces and other apps.Fitbit Ionic boasts four-day-plus battery life on a single charge. Battery life is 10 hours when using GPS or playing music.In March 2016, Fitbit launched a ""smart fitness watch"" called Blaze, but it wasn't a true smartwatch because it didn't offer access to third-party apps. The company's new Fitbit App Gallery will launch with apps from Starbucks (SBUX), Strava and AccuWeather.Like the Apple Watch, Fitbit Ionic needs to be paired with a smartphone with full functionality.However, subscribers to Pandora's premium services will be able to listen to up to 300 downloaded songs phone-free. Fitbit Ionic users can listen to the music with any Bluetooth headset, including the company's new Fitbit Flyer wireless headphones. Fitbit Flyer headphones will be available in October and cost $129.95.Fitbit needs a hit product after posting losses in the last three quarters. It pivoted to smartwatches as sales of basic activity trackers and fitness bands started to decline.IBD'S TAKE: Fitbit stock has a lowly IBD Composite Rating of 3 out of a possible 99. Apple has an IBD Composite Rating of 94, meaning it has outperformed 94% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months.

Plus, the Fitbit Flyer wireless headphones ""expands Fitbit into a high-growth adjacent market.""Zino reiterated his strong buy rating on Fitbit stock.Apple sells two main types of smartwatches: the Apple Watch Series 1 starting at $269 and Series 2 starting at $369. It is widely expected to release a Series 3 smartwatch this fall that will include at least one model with LTE cellular connectivity, so it won't require a smartphone for full functionality.Fitbit on Monday also introduced a new version of its Wi-Fi-connected smart bathroom scale, the Aria 2, which will be available this fall for $129.95.In the second quarter, China's Xiaomi was the world's top maker of wearable devices thanks to the popularity of its low-cost Mi Band fitness tracker, research firm Strategy Analytics said.Xiaomi captured 17.1% market share in wearable unit shipments in the June quarter.

125,SBUX,"With continued congestion at mobile-order pickup lines and slowing growth stateside, is Starbucks (SBUX) a lumbering giant with little room to run?XThese are the main worries ahead of the coffee shop behemoth's third-quarter earnings report, due after the close Thursday.Analysts are expecting 12% profit growth to 55 cents a share, on 10% sales gains to $5.74 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Whether Starbucks can revive its same-store sales growth in the U.S. is key because the domestic segment accounts for about two-thirds of revenue. U.S. comps grew 3%-4% in the prior four quarters, down from 7% in fiscal Q2 2016 and 9% in Q1 2016.Management signaled during its last earnings call that comps had been accelerating, and current consensus is for 5.3% Americas comps, according to Piper Jaffray, which rates Starbucks overweight with a 70 price target.""Growth is more difficult due to weak retail trends, relatively high wage growth (especially in Starbucks' highest density states), and slowing growth in breakfast food,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer on July 12.He sees same-store sales growth returning to mid-single digits, led by digital efforts, customer engagement, better throughput execution and premium drink offerings, like the Nitro Cold Brew and its signature Frappuccinos.A wild card affecting comp sales is how much Starbucks has alleviated its too-much-of-a-good-thing issue — i.e. its mobile-order-and-pay feature is so popular that the pickup lines were bottlenecking in store.In New York City, mobile orders made up almost a quarter of rush-hour transactions at Mizuho's recent morning channel checks. While there are measures in place to soothe pain points, analyst Jeremy Scott noted on July 6 that ""congestion at the hand-off plane is still an issue and turnaway rates have picked up.""""We are encouraged by the pace of conversion in 2017, however we anticipate core beverage comps will remain challenged in the short run as we expect incremental friction during the transition period,"" he wrote.Translation: Expect to be a little annoyed at the coffee pickup station at your local Starbucks, but probably only for a little while.Stifel's Mark Astrachan, who estimates that mobile orders make up closer to 30% of transactions, said Starbucks management sees ""three waves of measures continuing through at least (fiscal) 2018 to more fully remedy issues.""Shares fell 1% to 57.94 on the stock market today, at the low end of a flat base with a 64.97 buy point, and have been trading below their 50-day line since mid-June.Rival Dunkin' Brands (DNKN), which reports early Thursday, slid 1.3% to 52.52. EPS is seen growing 9% to 62 cents on 2% sales growth to $220 million.Shares of McDonald's (MCD), which has ramped up competition in coffee, slipped 1.6% after surging 4.8% to a record high Tuesday on strong quarterly results.RELATED:Where Does Starbucks Go From Here?

126,SBUX,"Amazon.com (AMZN) appears to be on just about every retailer's mind.While Starbucks (SBUX) is considered to be far ahead of its restaurant peers in the digital game, even the coffee-shop titan — which missed revenue and same-store sales estimates in Q3 — is perhaps feeling the heat from modern retail conditions.""The evidence is clear that the pace of retail transformation is accelerating with a common theme: extending the in-store experiences to include relevant digital scenarios,"" said Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson on a conference call with analysts late Thursday.X""It is the driving force behind combinations including Wal-Mart's (WMT) acquisition of Jet.com, the combination of PetSmart and Chewy.com, and last month's announcement of Amazon's intent to acquire Whole Foods (WFM).""And former CEO and current Executive Chairman Howard Schultz later added that be believes we are in the ""nascent stage of these kinds of commercial relationships that are going to elevate the experience of a brick-and-mortar retail company.""The ""challenging"" retail environment, cited commonly in other retailers' earnings calls, was given a call-out in Starbucks' chat with analysts. And CFO Scott Maw said in the company's earnings release that ""the combination of trends in the quarter and ongoing macro pressures impacting the retail and restaurant sectors has us a bit more cautious going into Q4.""But Global Chief Strategy Officer Matt Ryan spent some time on the call emphasizing the importance of digital relationships to its growth. Those efforts have already begun to bear fruit.Membership in Starbucks' rewards program in the U.S. grew 8% to 13.3 million active customers in Q3, with per-member spending rising 8% to ""record"" levels. Over a third — 36% — of U.S. revenue now comes from Starbucks Rewards members.For Starbucks, its digital efforts have been a double-edged sword. Its mobile order-ahead system, which now makes up 9% of all U.S. transactions, has been so popular that it has created bottlenecks at in-store pickup lines. Management vowed to smooth it out, and Ryan said Thursday that mobile ordering remains"" highly incremental, resulting in many more occasions per customer than would be the case otherwise, because the convenience encourages more on-the-go visits."" Mobile payments now represent 30% of all U.S. transactions.Its current wave of initiatives includes increased new features to its rewards program and ordering process, in addition to further personalization. Personalized marketing is increasingly popular as stores try to reach consumers beyond brick-and-mortar stores.But analysts have noted that membership growth in the U.S. is slowing. RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer, who rates Starbucks an outperform, trimmed his price target to 63 from 66 on ""slowing near-term sales momentum and moderating rewards membership growth.""And Stifel's Mark Astrachan says the slowdown is ""notable"" because Starbucks believes accelerating same-store sales growth will come largely from growth in rewards-program members.He cut his rating to hold from buy on ""disappointing"" Q4 guidance, which he said implies a further slowdown in global and U.S. same-store sales.Starbucks cut guidance to $2.05 to $2.06 in adjusted earnings for the year, down from prior guidance for $2.08 to $2.12. Fourth-quarter earnings are now expected to be 54-55 cents a share vs. previously announced guidance for 57 to 60 cents. That falls short of current analyst views for $2.10 and 58 cents EPS, respectively.Shares of Starbucks sank 9.2% to 54 on the stock market today, hitting their lowest level in eights months and stumbling out of a flat base.In fiscal Q3, revenue of $5.66 billion fell short of forecasts for $5.74 billion. Adjusted earnings met expectations, rising 12% to 55 cents a share. Global same-store sales rose 4%, including a 5% bump in Americas comps — slightly lower than Consensus Metrix estimates for 4.8% and 5.2% same-store sales growth, respectively. Within that, key U.S. comps grew 5%.As concerns simmer over slowing growth in the U.S., Starbucks is pushing its developments in China under the spotlight.For the third quarter, China same-store sales rose 7%, and CEO Johnson said on the call that he now sees the opportunity for the company in China being even greater than thought. Earlier Thursday, Starbucks said it was acquiring the remaining 50% of its East China unit from joint-venture partners Uni-President Enterprises and President Chain Store for around $1.3 billion in cash. Johnson told analysts that the decision was a reflection of the company's long-term commitment to the country and its ""unwavering optimism"" about its future in that market.The deal gives the coffee-shop giant full ownership of about 1,300 Starbucks locations in Shanghai as well as Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. China is Starbucks' fastest-growing market outside of the U.S., and plans to double its store count in the country to 5,000 by 2021.But Schultz told analysts that ""while you're beating us up a bit"" over the company's same-store sales, those figures should be taken into perspective.""We have not seen any other retailer or (quick-service restaurant) this quarter report a 5% comp."" he said.RELATED:Starbucks Earnings Preview: Can U.S. Sales Growth Rebound?Where Does Starbucks Go From Here?

129,SBUX,"Gripping a Starbucks (SBUX) to-go cup on the train to work may not be ingrained in Chinese culture the way it is for many Americans, but one analyst is willing to bet that the coffee giant can instead make the sit-down cafe experience a popular one in China.""With almost no scaled competitors, we believe Starbucks can do for cafe culture in China what Yum (Brands) did for fast food,"" wrote Mizuho analyst Jeremy Scott in an initiation note on the company. ""Create it.""Starbucks has made no secret about its aggressive growth plans in China, which include doubling its store count there to 5,000 by 2021.For now, tea remains the hot drink of choice for 99% of Chinese consumers at home.But Scott said Starbucks' positioning as a ""third place"" outside of home and work ""has spawned a growing cafe culture in higher tier cities,"" one that has made going out for coffee one of ""cultured indulgence.""And that's already prompting a shift in how Chinese consumers get their caffeine fix. Outside of the house, coffee and tea consumption are now about equal, wrote analysts, citing Euromonitor and MSUSA estimates.Shares of Starbucks dipped 0.1% to 62.19 on the stock market today, their fifth straight decline. Starbucks is near the top end of buy territory after overextending for a few weeks. The stock broke out of a flat base with 59.64 entry point in late April.Calling Starbucks the ""most promising growth model in the industry,"" Mizuho's Scott initiated coverage on the stock with a buy rating and 75 price target. He also highlighted the promise of mobile-order-and-pay once the company overcomes its workflow issues (read: recent issues of in-store congestion from the popularity of the order-ahead feature).If all goes according to plan, maybe someday China's coffee drinkers will be just like Americans: hogging the good tables for hours as they work on their screenplays at Starbucks.Meanwhile, Scott — who initiated coverage on a number of restaurant names including McDonald's (MCD), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Yum Brands (YUM) — looked less favorably upon Starbucks' main U.S. competitor, Dunkin' Brands (DNKN), starting it off with a neutral rating and 56 price target.""As the take-away coffee market grows increasingly divided between value and premium, Dunkin's positioning becomes increasingly challenged as it straddles value-orientation and upmarket beverages,"" he wrote, adding that increasing competition in the form of promotional activity from McDonald's and others ""should continue to drive menu deflation in our view.""Shares of Dunkin' Brands, which owns Baskin Robbins and Dunkin' Donuts, sank 2.7% to 56.93, falling out of buy range after clearing a 57.90 entry point from a cup-with-handle base in late May.Yum Brands, which spun off Yum China (YUMC) last year, fell 1.2%.

130,SBUX,"To the ever-expanding list of Things Uber Is Disrupting, add malls and their parking lots.At Macy's (M) investor day on Tuesday, Doug Sesler, executive vice president for real estate, suggested that the increased use of Uber had led to a decrease in the need for the vast stretches of land reserved for mall-customer parking.""We're all talking about driverless cars, we're talking about the increased use of Uber,"" he said. ""The fact of the matter is we don't need the massive parking lots that we needed in the 1970s.""Macy's has been bruised by retail's woes in the era of Amazon.com (AMZN) and a reinvigorated Wal-Mart (WMT). It's thrown a variety of ideas at the wall to make use of its stripped-out floor space and 130-plus million square feet of real estate, and half-filled parking lots could offer a new option.Sesler said that when Macy's owns store space, they also typically own parking space with it. He said those swaths of pavement can be used for other retail space – a Starbucks (SBUX) at the corner of a parking lot, he suggested – or residential, office or hotel space.The company has formed an alliance with Brookfield Asset Management (BAM), a real estate company, to look at different ways to use its stretches of real estate.Macy's has also considered bolting restaurants onto the outside of its big-box locations to generate traffic and add atmosphere and rental income. The company has put office space above its stores in Seattle and is marketing the upper portion of its State Street flagship store in Chicago, where it hopes to make similar conversions to office space.The company is overhauling its large Union Square location in San Francisco to create 10,000 square feet for small shops across the front – space the company has just started to market for rent, Sesler said. In New York, the company said it is looking at ways to jumpstart shopper traffic in its Herald Square flagship – possibly with an indoor-and-outdoor rooftop area featuring restaurants and after-work hangouts.IBD'S TAKE: As Amazon and off-price retailers wear down department stores, retailers like Ulta Beauty have gotten by relatively unscathed. Here are five takeaways from Ulta's most recent quarterly earnings. What's more, Sesler said, Macy's department stores are in 72% of the nation's high-end 'A' malls — those most likely to weather the ongoing storm of store bankruptcies and closures.Still, nothing at the 2-1/2 hour presentation could distract Wall Street from the company's gross-margin forecast.Shares finished 8% lower on Tuesday after CFO Karen Hoguet during the presentation warned that gross margins for the year were on track to be 60 to 80 basis points lower than last year. Among the factors she cited were excess inventory following the holidays and heavy promotions in the beauty business. She said she expected inventory levels to even out by the fall season.Macy's fell 0.4% to 21.81 on the stock market Wednesday, sinking intraday to their lowest level since September 2010.Macy's initially rebounded Thursday morning after Nordstrom (JWN) announced that it is mulling a ""going private"" move, but Macy's closed down 0.2%. Nordstrom shares skyrocketed 10.3%, though that was well off their intraday highs.J.C. Penney (JCP) and Kohl's (KSS), which tumbled Tuesday on Macy's warning, reversed lower Thursday to end down 4.8% and 2.3%, respectively. Sears (SHLD) closed off 1.7%.Still, management on Tuesday said that beauty and home products were doing well within its off-price ""Backstage"" concept. Within apparel, where Amazon has become a big threat, Macy's is trying to rid its inventory of duplicate items and bring more exclusive items and faster fashion to store racks.CEO Jeff Gennette also emphasized the changes in the way people shop – the way physical stores and websites can play off one another when a consumer weighs what they want to buy – and Macy's opportunities in that evolution.""There's a place for both Amazon and Macy's to succeed with our customer,"" he said.Management said that it was ""open to all options"" in developing its e-commerce, and said that Wal-Mart's approach to its online business – including buying outlets like Jet.com – was ""quite interesting.""Cowen analyst Oliver Chen, in a research note Wednesday, said Macy's had done a ""good job articulating its challenges"" and that if its turnaround succeeded, ""America's love for shopping will be reengaged."" But he said an epic battle with Amazon would continue.""We think customers are 'familiar' with Macy's but don't really 'love' it,"" he wrote.Wal-Mart edged higher Thursday after rising slightly Wednesday following a retreat Tuesday. Amazon on Tuesday offered discounted Prime subscriptions to people on government aid, going after key Wal-Mart customers.RELATED:This Is Keeping TJX Bullish Amid The Broader Retail MeltdownSears Stock Tanks As CEO Accuses Suppliers Of Exploiting It

The S&P 500 also was rose about 0.1%, but the Nasdaq popped more 0.4% higher.Volume in the stock market today was running sharply lower than Friday's pace.Gains in the fiber optics stocks and chip equipment makers were mostly related to recovery attempts.

134,SBUX,"When an UberEats driver heads to Paul Tulaphorn's McDonald's (MCD) on Lakewood Boulevard in Bellflower, Calif., a loudspeaker pings sharply, loud enough to be heard over the frappe machine, to let the staff know.Behind the counter, employees manage those orders via an iPad next to a dedicated register. A designated tech worker helps install that technology, and stands ready to fix a register when it goes down, change over the store's data-processing systems, or upgrade the ""smart clock"" that changes the restaurant's digital menu displays.Restaurants often lag other industries in adopting new technology, lacking the time or budget for massive digital overhauls. But as industry sales have slowed recently, smartphone conveniences have found their way into the world of burgers and fries. Many in the industry are betting that its future lies in that technology — in large part through mobile orders, payments and delivery.""We have to be ready,"" Tulaphorn, a four-decade McDonald's veteran who owns nine McDonald's locations in Southern California, said of the coming technological wave. ""And I think we'll be ready.""Mobile ordering and delivery from the likes of McDonald's, Jack in the Box (JACK), Wendy's (WEN) and Burger King mark the biggest change in the way people order fast food since the drive-thru. As that change ripples through the industry, restaurants are facing down questions like how to preserve margins, avoid parking-lot traffic jams, and keep French fries crispy once they enter the balmy ecosphere of the delivery bag.IBD'S TAKE: McDonald's is one of the best performers on the Dow Jones industrial average this year. But it's only the 8th in IBD's Retail-Restaurant group. To see which eateries are the true leaders, and how they stack up vs. rivals, go to IBD Stock Checkup.Just as the drive-thru accommodated generations shaped by mass-market car culture, the new digital efforts cater to a new cohort of fast-food customers shaped by e-commerce, social media, smartphones, streaming video and, in one way or another, a lack of time.Restaurants' trial runs and partnerships with delivery services could give chains a head start in capturing today's tech-savvy diners. Cowen & Co. estimated last year that U.S. restaurant delivery alone could become a $35 billion market by 2025.""We're currently very optimistic that we're tapping into a new customer base and serving them in a new way,"" Bill Garrett, corporate vice president of delivery at McDonald's, said in an interview. ""It's a customer that otherwise would likely have not gone out to eat.""The company is still trying to glean precise details about core delivery customers, Garrett says. He sees ""a lot of research"" ahead.Some restaurants have been on the delivery and digital path for a while. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) are old pros. Starbucks (SBUX) began offering mobile order and pay in 2014.The Golden Arches already offered delivery internationally and has dabbled with it in the U.S. This year it has expanded its partnership with UberEats, the ride-hailing service's food-delivery segment, to major cities like Los Angeles and Chicago. McDonald's said that as of the end of June at least 3,500 of its 14,000 U.S. restaurants offered UberEats delivery. The burger chain also plans to offer mobile ordering via an app in thousands more locations this year.Restaurant Brands International's (QSR) Burger King is also testing mobile order and payments. Wendy's, Jack in the Box, Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) Dunkin' Donuts and Yum Brands' (YUM) Taco Bell and KFC have partnered with the delivery service DoorDash. Panera Bread (PNRA), which is being taken private, also has jumped into delivery and plans to hire 10,000 drivers.So far, McDonald's delivery customers tend to skew younger, Garrett says. Delivery demand has been spread evenly across the day, though the end-of-dinner, late-night period appears to draw a slightly higher share of business compared to the company's traditional business. Dunkin' Donuts, in an email, said its delivery service is popular with millennials and ""a younger generation who live in an on-demand world.""As fast-food chains figure out who these new consumers are, they also have to solve the logistical puzzle that digital ordering can bring to restaurants, which face space limitations in their kitchens and parking lots.No massive problems have been reported by the delivery newcomers. McDonald's says its kitchens, drive-thrus and parking lots are able to handle more orders. At the same time, McDonald's shares are reaching new highs, rising to a record intraday peak of 156.56 on Friday.But digital orders can come with a learning curve.Starbucks has said the customer flow at some locations slowed as customers who ordered ahead on its popular mobile order and pay app crowded into restaurants. Management said in April that Starbucks would add staff to its busiest stores at peak times and consider new equipment and layouts to speed throughput. The company was introducing a digital order management system to help baristas track orders with a tablet and notify customers via mobile app when drinks were ready.Even a few seconds can make a big difference in processing orders and deliveries. The fast-food business, Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said, is ""maniacal about drive-thru speeds."" Years ago, then-McDonald's CEO Jack Greenberg said unit sales got a 1% bump for every six seconds shaved off the drive-thru time.Tulaphorn says French fries take three minutes to cook and have a seven-minute holding time. When an UberEats driver arrives, the restaurant aims to have orders in the car and on the road within five minutes.DoorDash aims to deliver within around 20 minutes. That means different things in different areas.""Manhattan, on a bike, could be 20 blocks or 30 blocks,"" said Eitan Bencuya, DoorDash's head of communications. ""In Dallas, Texas, 20 minutes could be five miles away.""Early on, UberEats drivers sometimes got address numbers wrong, Tulaphorn says. And as with any other change, the new technology requires training for employees and older customers.McDonald's initially thought sending drivers through the drive-thru would be best, Garrett says. The company later found it was better to let drivers choose whether to take the drive-thru or go inside the restaurant. In Southern California, McDonald's restaurant operators can decide whether they want to allocate parking spaces just for UberEats drivers.DoorDash, meanwhile, found that the drive-thru wasn't the way to go. ""Just by looking at the number of deliveries that we bring to a restaurant, we found that it would actually overload the drive-thru to have Dashers lining up through their cars,"" Bencuya said.Some foods hold up better than others inside a delivery container. Pizza works, and ideally is still cooking when it's being delivered, Normura-Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski says. Chinese food, tacos, soups, sandwiches, pasta and salads also hold up fine. French fries, however, are a delicate situation.At Tulaphorn's McDonald's, fries go into a sleeve, then into their own separate bag, then into a bigger delivery bag that's sticker-sealed to verify that it hasn't been opened on its way. The UberEats driver also has a thermal bag to carry this delivery bag.Garrett says the company is looking at packaging changes that might help keep drinks and desserts from spilling, but wouldn't get into specifics.Restaurants that work with DoorDash get access to the deliverer's own packaging. DoorDash drivers can wrap the takeout container in a thin, metallic ""space blanket"" and put that inside an insulated bag.Similarly, some companies are more naturally suited to delivery, analysts say.In general, digital ordering benefits bigger brands with deep pockets for technology, Kalinowski says.McDonald's cites its massive geographic reach as an advantage. By its own estimates, nearly three-quarters of the population in its top five markets — the U.S., France, U.K., Germany and Canada — lives within three miles of one of its restaurants.Charles says a place like Wingstop (WING), which has limited seating and already does a lot of to-go business via digital, could be well-positioned for delivery.Canaccord Genuity analyst Lynne Collier says Panera's food — soup, sandwiches, salads — travels well. She notes that Darden Restaurants' (DRI) Olive Garden has been strong in to-go orders; Italian food also tends to withstand delivery better than French fries.""I think that's McDonald's biggest challenge,"" she said.Wall Street likely will focus more on the profit impact when the novelty of digital ordering wears off and restaurants gain more sense of who their digital customers are. Commissions paid to third-party delivery services risk degrading margins, so restaurants need to watch their delivery sales trends to justify the hit, Charles says.Delivery fees also raise costs for consumers. A McDonald's Quarter Pounder with cheese meal, with a medium Coke and fries, delivered via UberEats to IBD's Los Angeles office from the Marina del Rey area takes an estimated 20 to 30 minutes. A $4.99 ""booking fee"" is tacked on to the food charge of $6.89 and 60 cents in taxes, bringing the total cost to $12.48.Independent restaurants' sales growth has outpaced that of restaurant chains, a pattern that could continue for the rest of the decade, food-industry consulting firm Pentallect estimated in April. Customers, it said, felt independent restaurants were more community oriented, with better quality, value and service. The trend comes on top of the day-to-day difficulties of competition, discounting and higher labor costs.""I think that simply put, you've got a pretty mature industry out there that's experiencing periods of weakness,"" Charles said. ""So essentially operators are looking for: 'What's the shiny object out there? What's the lever I can pull to really get my sales going?' It increasingly seems like it's delivery.""RELATED:These Are The Dow's Top 5 Stocks In 2017 — And Apple Isn't No. 1McDonald's Delivers Beefy Earnings; Execs Talk Deliveries, Digital StoresDomino's Pizza Eyes Delivery Wars As McDonald's Expands ServiceJack In The Box Beats Views, Eyes 'Potential Alternatives' For Qdob

135,SBUX,"The retail outlier continues its run: Ulta Beauty (ULTA) solidly topped consensus views and raised its full-year guidance, bucking the narrative that all of brick-and-mortar retail looks awful in the age of Amazon (AMZN).Shares rose 3.2% to 302.40 in the stock market today, taking the stock solidly above the 300 level. Shares shot up to a record 310 intraday.Here are four takeaways from the specialty beauty retailer's first quarter earnings call:The Ultamate Rewards program now has 24.5 million active members, up 26% from the prior year. Starbucks (SBUX) has 13.3 million active Starbucks Rewards members in the U.S., up 11%, said the coffeehouse giant last month.Ulta Beauty CEO Mary Dillon said on Thursday night's earnings call that the program's growth rate is starting to moderate slightly, but ""we still expect to see rapid growth in loyalty membership well above square footage growth.""And brands are probably interested in the customer insights that Ulta can glean from its fast-growing loyalty program, said Oliver Chen, an analyst at Cowen.Ulta's same-store sales growth of 14.3% in Q1 comes on top of the prior-year period's 15.2%, and includes 10.9% in comparable sales in physical retail locations. That's highly unusual, to say the least, given the pummeling that department stores and many other mall-based chains have gotten.Dillon said she was ""particularly proud of these results in light of the challenging environment many retailers are experiencing.""And that isn't expected to stop anytime soon.""We believe the momentum has legs to continue through FY17 and beyond,"" wrote Cowen's Chen of Ulta's same-store sales.E-commerce sales jumped 70.9% during the quarter, which Piper Jaffray says is Ulta's highest level since 2014. And unlike other retailers, the effort to drive digital growth isn't weighing on brick-and-mortar stores.""ULTA e-commerce growth has not cannibalized physical store sales,"" wrote Piper Jaffray's Erinn Murphy. ""The number of online-only shoppers is very low, but omnichannel shoppers continue to increase, up 140 bps y/y to 8.6%.""Total traffic growth during the quarter rose 77% as mobile traffic popped 107%.IT Cosmetics, Tarte, Too Faced, Mario Badescu, Becca, Anastasia, Clinique, Lancome, Benefit, Tonymoly, Yes Too, and the Ulta Beauty collection were among the quarter's top performing brands, said Dillon.Clinique is owned by Estee Lauder (EL), and the cosmetics giant recently acquired Becca and Too Faced as well. Last year, Estee Lauder debuted the millennial-focused Estee Edit at Sephora. J.C. Penney (JCP) has a number of Sephora store-within-a-store operations.""Growth in Ulta and Sephora is positive for Estee as it diversifies sales from weaker channels like midtier department stores"" said Stifel's Mark Astrachan.RELATED:Why Ulta Beauty Shares Fell Out Of Buy Range Ahead Of Earnings

Northrop Grumman (NOC), General Dynamics (GD) and Raytheon (RTN) also raised their full-year earnings outlooks after reporting Q2 earnings results above estimates. Northrop said its aerospace-system sales climbed on higher manned-aircraft demand, including work on its E-2D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft. Raytheon saw higher air-defense missile and smart bomb sales and General Dynamics' revenue got support from strong Gulfstream and defense-product demand.Boeing shares soared 14% for the week.

Cigarettes, But One Tobacco Giant Is Holding UpThe Federal Reserve kept to Wall Street's preferred script on Wednesday, leaving its key interest rate unchanged and putting off an announcement that it will begin unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet.The Fed's patience comes as the economy is performing pretty well, with real GDP growing at a 2.6% pace in the second quarter, but inflation and wage gains have been more muted than expected. The combination has been good for the stock market, partly because the prospect of low interest rates has weighed on the dollar, which could be a boon to the earnings of U.S. multinationals in the second half of this year.The decision by the Fed to wait until September to announce a shift in its reinvestment policy — a gradual pullback from its current stance of reinvesting all principal from its maturing mortgage and Treasury bond portfolio — also sent a signal that policymakers aren't overly concerned that financial markets are too exuberant.The next interest-rate hike is expected in December. The real uncertainty, hinging on the inflation outlook, is what Fed policy will look like in 2018.A flurry of chip-industry players posted beat-and-raise June-quarter results including chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Cypress Semiconductor (CY), Intel (INTC) and Texas Instruments (TXN), as well as chip-gear suppliers Lam Research (LRCX) and Teradyne (TER).AMD earned an adjusted 2 cents a share on sales of $1.22 billion in Q2, when analysts expected it to break even on sales $1.16 billion. In the current quarter, AMD forecasts sales to rise 15%, vs. Wall Street's target of 6%.Cypress earned 21 cents a share ex items on sales of $594 million in Q2, vs. estimates of 16 cents and $547 million.

Nigeria said it'll eventually join the rest of OPEC in curbing production. Saudi Arabia agreed to cut oil exports. U.S. crude inventories tumbled by 7.2 million barrels and domestic production dipped. Some energy companies trimmed capital-spending plans after months of sub-$50 oil. Halliburton (HAL) warned that it sees U.S. exploration and production companies ""tapping the brakes"" and U.S. rig counts plateauing. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) earnings missed.General Motors (GM) reported that adjusted profits grew 1.6% to $1.89, beating views for $1.72, while revenue dropped 12.7% to $37 billion, below views for $40.2 billion. GM reaffirmed full-year EPS guidance but will cut second-half production amid swelling inventories and falling U.S. industry sales. Ford Motor (F) topped views and raised guidance, but largely on lower tax rates. GM fell further below a buy point while Ford fell back toward multiyear lows. But Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) held above a buy point after adjusted EPS swelled 49% though sales fell short. Its Maserati luxury brand did well.Biogen (BIIB) obliterated sales expectations for spinal muscular atrophy drug Spinraza with $203 million. Amgen (AMGN), though, fell late Tuesday after its boosted 2017 EPS ex items guide lagged some views. Gilead Sciences (GILD) reported that its hepatitis C drug franchise declined 27.5% but was partially offset by 16.1% growth in HIV and hepatitis B drug sales.

Celgene (CELG) and Alexion (ALXN) also beat views with the latter busting EPS expectations by 30 cents.AstraZeneca (AZN) crashed 15% Thursday after reporting that its Mystic lung cancer trial of an immuno-therapy combination failed. The U.K. drugmaker also announced a deal with Merck (MRK) to gain access to the latter's I-O blockbuster Keytruda. Merck rose 3% on Thursday. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), which has had several setbacks for its I-O drug Opdivo, slid 3% on concerns that the Mystic failure bodes ill for a similar Opdivo-combo study.Wall Street soured on casino players like MGM Resorts International (MGM), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO) as the sector overall put up mixed results and guidance. Concerns about mass-market gaming in Macau weighed on Wynn, whose Q2 results nonetheless beat estimates. MGM offered a weak revenue-per-available-room outlook. It also cited ""higher-than-anticipated disruption"" at the Monte Carlo, which is being revamped into Park MGM, and a ""challenging comparison"" on the Las Vegas Strip in Q3. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) topped; results from Melco and U.S.-focused Boyd Gaming (BYD) and Penn National Gaming (PENN) were mixed.Shares in AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) soared after the telecoms reported better-than-expected wireless results amid stiff competition. AT&T narrowed its losses of high-spending postpaid phone subscribers while Verizon added more than forecast. AT&T says its strategy of packaging video and wireless services is jelling. Verizon says consumers are willing to pay a premium for its unlimited data services because of its high-performing network.Comcast (CMCSA) reported second-quarter profit and revenue that topped estimates, as NBCUniversal's filmed-entertainment business delivered strong box office results, but video subscriber losses were higher than expected. Citigroup speculated that Comcast could acquire Verizon. Charter Communications (CHTR) missed on earnings and sales, but shares soared amid speculation that it could be acquired as well.McDonald's (MCD) Q2 earnings and same-store sales topped estimates, helped by cheap drink offerings and ""premium"" menu items. Chipotle (CMG) is testing queso but faced concerns that its sales recovery had stumbled following a food-borne illness scare that began in 2015; the sales impact from reports of customers who fell ill in July remained unclear. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) crashed in part on disappointing Q2 international comps, lower margins, an EPS helped by the tax rate and an already-high stock valuation. Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled after fiscal-Q3 same-store sales and revenue missed; EPS matched views. The coffee chain said it would close all 379 Teavana retail stores.Several industrial Dow giants rolled past Q2 estimates Tuesday thanks in part to improved global growth. Caterpillar (CAT) surged to a 52-week high after the company saw EPS of $1.49, up 36.7%, on revenue of $11.33 billion, up 9.6%. United Technologies (UTX) saw earnings climb 1.6% to $1.85 per share on a 2.7% revenue rise to $15.28 billion. Shares tumbled to their lowest level since May despite raised full-year EPS and revenue guidance. DuPont (DD) also beat on the top and bottom lines. Their Dow peer 3M (MMM) was an outlier with an overall miss, and shares tanked.Proofpoint (PFPT) reported Q2 profit and revenue that topped expectations and forecast current quarter sales and earnings just above consensus estimates. Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Proofpoint specializes in email and data-loss protection for corporate networks and cloud-computing infrastructure. Proofpoint rose modestly Friday morning. Fortinet (FTNT) posted mixed Q2 results that beat on EPS and revenue, but billings growth disappointed. The outlook for providers of computer-security software has yet to improve despite recent  ransomware attacks. Fortinet shares tumbled.TAL Education (TAL) topped earnings and sales estimates, as per-share profit of 43 cents and revenue of $321.9 million came out ahead of forecasts for 28 cents and $307.8 million. For the current quarter, the China-based education company sees revenue of $428.4 million to $433.8 million, above views for $424.8 million, per Yahoo Finance estimates. Meanwhile, peer New Oriental Education (EDU) also pulled ahead of forecasts with 41 cents EPS and $486.4 million, in addition to a 36.9% bump in total student enrollments; the midpoint of Q1 revenue guidance pulled just ahead of current views. TAL and New Oriental shares rose 4.8% and 0.9%, respectively,  but the latter's breakout failed Thursday.Mastercard (MA) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and revenue. Shares reversed modestly lower from a record high but remained in buy range.Baidu (BIDU) earnings rose 143%, well over views, while revenue climbed 14% to an in-line $3.08 billion. Shares of the Chinese search giant rose 9.45% on Friday.Electronic Arts (EA) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, but the video game publisher gave cautious revenue guidance.

143,SBUX,"X Futures for the Dow industrials, S&P 500 index and other major averages fell significantly on fresh negative headlines on President Trump. That followed a mixed session Tuesday in which the Nasdaq rallied, hitting fresh record highs, while the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 closed slightly lower.While the secular bull market is now 8 years old, quality stocks continue to break out of bullish patterns. Four that are in buy range right now: Apple chip supplier Qorvo (QRVO), Citigroup (C), Chinese search giant Baidu (BIDU) and Starbucks (SBUX).S&P 500 index futures fell nearly 0.5% vs. fair value. Futures for the Nasdaq 100 slid 0.35%. Dow Jones industrial average futures retreated 0.4% below fair value, or about 85 points. Dow futures signaled triple-digit losses for much of the night.Late Tuesday, the New York Times, followed by several other big publications, reported that Trump had asked then-FBI Director James Comey to drop an investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. The White House denied the reports.Trump, who abruptly fired Comey last week, is also under pressure over a Washington Post article claiming that he gave highly classified information to Russian officials the day after ousting the FBI chief. The political furor makes it harder for Trump and the GOP Congress to focus on pro-growth agenda items, notably tax cuts.Keep in mind that the major market averages have largely shrugged off various setbacks and negative media coverage for the Trump administration. But with key GOP lawmakers saying they plan to call Comey to testify and subpoena the memo that includes his account of Trump's alleged Flynn request, the political headache for the White House is intensifying.In Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei fell 0.5% as the safe-haven yen continued to climb. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 1.1%. The Shanghai composite dipped 0.3%.In European trading intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE edged lower while Germany's Dax slid 0.4% and France's Cac-40 0.5%.IBD'S TAKE: Hours earlier, the odds of a big Trump tax cut were cut after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell set a high hurdle for tax reform.Let's take a look at four stocks that closed in buy range on Tuesday. Investors should be cautious with futures pointing to a lower open. Some of these stocks are only slightly above buy points, and could easily undercut those levels.Qorvo popped 4.6% to 74.84 in Tuesday stock market trading, clearing a shallow consolidation just above a prior consolidation. That followed the Apple iPhone chipmaker's 5.5% gain on Monday. This base-on-base action is bullish, especially when the overall market is moving sideways.Qorvo pulled back below its 50-day moving average in late April, then continued to slide modestly following earnings reports from Apple and then Qorvo itself. But the stock has risen for the last six sessions, capped by Monday's 5.5% surge and Tuesday's breakout.Apple shares closed fractionally lower for a second straight session after hitting a new all-time high intraday Monday.RELATED:Why This Recurring Pattern In The Stock Market Is A Bullish SignCitigroup cleared an aggressive buy point of 60.89 on Friday. The banking giant advanced 1.7% to 62.49 on Tuesday, its highest close since July 2015, still in range of that early entry. But it's also near a conventional 62.63 flat-base buy point, 10 cents above the 22-month intraday peak set March 8.Citigroup is among a handful of financials in or approaching buy points, while many others are in consolidation around or below their 50-day lines. Lower expectations for tax cuts and Treasury yields off their postelection peaks have cooled enthusiasm for bank stocks. But financial regulatory relief is still expected. That would boost bank profit and lending, analysts say, fueling dividend hikes and new buybacks.Baidu was part of the big China internet stock rally Tuesday, fueled by strong earnings and skyrocketing shares of Weibo (WB) and parent Sina (SINA).Baidu rallied 2.4% to 190.64, clearing a 118.70 buy point from a cup-with-handle pattern (starting in late February), as part of a larger consolidation (stretching back to late April 2016).Baidu is part of the China's ""BAT"" internet trio that also includes e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) and messaging giant Tencent (TCEHY). But while Baidu's growth and stock has stalled, Alibaba and Tencent (which have virtually identical market caps), have soared. Tencent reported 55% revenue growth Wednesday morning with Alibaba on tap Thursday.RELATED:Internet Giant To Join China Parade; Cisco Near Entry: Investing Action PlanStarbucks cleared a buy point of 59.64 on April 20, and moved up to 61.94 a week later. But weaker-than-expected Starbucks revenue sent shares tumbling on April 28, falling as low as 58.99, but closing above the entry point. Starbucks moved higher over the next couple of weeks but has pulled back again in light volume, slipping 0.8% to 59.98.Starbucks' action shows the importance of buying a stock as close to the entry point as possible. Anyone buying at the recent peak of 61.94 would have had a hard time holding on when the stock fell nearly 5% below that purchase price the following morning.RELATED:The Big Picture: Signs Institutions Are Still Buying StocksThese Airline Stocks Close In On Buy Points As Buffett Boosts Stakes

The expansion now means that delivery is offered at some 1,000 U.S. McDonald's restaurants, including 300 in LA.""We are bringing a new level of convenience to more of our customers as we continue to transform the McDonald's experience,"" CEO Steve Easterbrook said in a statement.McDonald's, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, last month said it would expand deliveries from its trial run in Florida, which began this year, to other cities in the U.S. during this quarter. Jack in the Box (JACK) has also expanded delivery to Los Angeles and Phoenix via its delivery partner DoorDash.McDonald's has also said it would launch a mobile order and pay platform in 20,000 restaurants in the U.S. and other areas by the end of the year. The burger chain is also rolling out its new restaurant format, called ""Experience of the Future,"" which will have digital ordering kiosks and table service.Wendy's (WEN), which also has self-order kiosks at some restaurants, is also rolling out a mobile order and pay system. Restaurant Brands International's (QSR) Burger King wants to expand a mobile platform of its own.The digital expansion has the potential to make ordering food easier than ever, and analysts have said smartphone ordering marks the biggest change to the way people buy fast food since the drive-thru.But the technology raises questions about how restaurants will manage margins as they spend on technology and how they handle traffic-flow through their restaurants.IBD'S TAKE: Even as restaurants race to expand delivery, Restaurant Brands International has been growing by acquisitions.Starbucks (SBUX), which has its own mobile order and pay platform, had reported some knots in in-store customer traffic after launching the system.McDonald's, which is already testing fresh, cooked-to-order hamburger patties at some restaurants, reported minor slowdowns at the drive-thru that were later corrected.McDonald's edged down 0.6% to 146.41 in the stock market today after hitting a record high Tuesday.Wendy's fell 3.4% after setting a fresh decade high on Tuesday. Restaurant Brands retreated 1.1% from an all-time best. Starbucks dipped 0.4% to 59.73, holding just above a 59.64 buy point. Jack in the Box, which late Tuesday topped earnings views and said it would explore ""alternatives"" for its Qdoba Mexican Eats chain, rose 5.6%.The industry's delivery expansion also raises questions about competition for driver's. Domino's Pizza (DPZ), whose mobile-ordering technology has fit in well with its decades-old delivery service, is currently testing GPS technology. CEO Patrick Doyle, during the Domino's earnings call last month, also said his company was a better place for drivers to work."" ... for those drivers who are listening to this call,"" he said, ""my pitch is you're going to be more consistently busy and receiving tips at Domino's than working somewhere else, and that is ultimately what keeps drivers happy is that they're busy.""RELATED:Jack In The Box Finds A 'Forgiving' Late-Night-Delivery CustomerJack In The Box Beats Views, Eyes 'Potential Alternatives' For Qdoba

146,SBUX,"Yum China (YUMC) — the restaurant operator spun off late last year from Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell owner Yum Brands (YUM) — reported second-quarter earnings on Wednesday that topped some estimates, but sales fell short.X Estimates: Earnings per share of 24 cents on revenue of $1.632 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Yum China began trading publicly in November.Results: EPS rose 29% to 27 cents. Revenue was $1.594 billion. Same-store sales climbed 0.3%.Mobile payments surpassed 40% of sales during the quarter, with delivery comprising 13% of sales. Yum China also said it had acquired a controlling interest in the holding company for the online delivery service Daojia, which operates in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai.Shares: Yum China shares fell 4.8% to 38.22 in after-hours action after initially plunging nearly 10%. The stock closed down 0.2% to 40.19 on the stock market today after falling to 39.40 intraday. The stock has been consolidating for the past three weeks after hitting a record 42.12 on June 8.Yum Brands spun off Yum China in November following the influence of an activist investor and food-safety issues at the China segment. In announcing the spinoff, Yum Brands said the separation would create two more focused companies that could better reward shareholders.In a research note last month, RBC analyst David Palmer said Yum China was on solid ground with CEO Micky Pant at the helm. The company, Palmer noted, believes it could eventually increase its store count to at least 20,000 in the nation, up from around 7,600 today.That expansion, Palmer said, would come from ""entering new markets with established or planned infrastructure investments that include high-speed railways, roads, schools and hospitals.""Palmer also said KFC China had ""turned the corner,"" citing in part the launch of a loyalty program, the introduction of mobile payments and the simplification of its menu. But he said Pizza Hut China's sales could be uneven this year and that Taco Bell's prospects, while good, might take several years to pay off as it grows in the country. Taco Bell opened its first restaurant in China at the end of last year.Yum Brands closed down 0.3% to 73.12. McDonald's (MCD), one of the Dow Jones industrial average's leaders so far this year, rose 0.4%. McDonald's has a significant China presence. So does Starbucks (SBUX), which is rapidly expanding on the mainland. Starbucks shares retreated 0.5% on Wednesday, continuing a monthlong slide.Domino's Pizza (DPZ), another top-performing fast-food chain, lost 0.9%.RELATED:These Are The Dow's Top 5 Stocks In 2017 — And Apple Isn't No. 1Cheesecake Factory Misses, Habit Profit Tops After Yum, Papa John's BeatMcDonald's Delivers Beefy Earnings; Execs Talk Deliveries, Digital Stores

147,SBUX,"PayPal (PYPL) and JPMorgan (JPM) will join forces in an effort to boost their online payment services, easing the way for Chase credit card customers to link to PayPal accounts.XThe deal aligns with PayPal's strategy to give consumers more payment options at checkout, such as using credit cards. Last year PayPal announced online check-out deals with Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA).As part of the deal, PayPal now process payments on the ChaseNet payment network. JPMorgan will offer customers the option of paying with Chase rewards points when linked through Chase Pay at PayPal's millions of online merchants, the companies said in a press release. The agreement should help JPMorgan advance Chase Pay, a payment method accepted by some large merchants such as Starbucks (SBUX) but has relatively few agreement with e-commerce and technology firms.""This partnership is about deepening our relationship and leveraging each other's core assets to deliver simple, secure and truly transformative payment experiences for our joint customers,"" Dan Schulman, PayPal's chief executive, said in prepared remarks.PayPal stock climbed 1.3% to close at 59.09 on the stock market today, hitting a record high.

148,SBUX,"X Starbucks (SBUX) shares retreated Friday after the java giant trimmed full-year profit guidance and missed on second-quarter revenue and same-store sales late Thursday.Management, however, didn't seem particularly fazed as it revealed accelerating U.S. same-store sales during the quarter that are ""further accelerating into April,"" according to CEO Kevin Johnson. The company also pointed to improvements in its mobile order-and-pay system that are easing some of its woes from the previous quarter.""I have never been more confident that the comp growth that we have seen in the first half of the year, over time, beginning in the second half of the year and beyond, will be a distant memory,"" said Howard Schultz, who is now focusing on Starbucks' premium format concepts after stepping down as chief executive and handing the role to Johnson.And Starbucks might be cooking up more social-media-friendly drinks amid concerns over slowing growth in its key U.S. market. Comments pointed to a build on the ""incredible Instagrammable success"" of the Unicorn Frappuccino.Schultz called the Unicorn Frappuccino ""the most stunning example of our understanding of digital and social media and Instagram"" that fueled ""significant traffic, incrementality, awareness, brand affinity.""""We're going to bring at least one new entirely new drink into Happy Hour this year that is going to be as good as Unicorn or better,"" said Johnson.Starbucks fell 2% to 60.06 on the stock market today, closing above a 59.64 buy point from a flat base cleared last week. Starbucks fell as low as 58.99 intraday.Retailers of all stripes are engaging in some soul searching amid a highly competitive landscape. Schultz sounded bullish even as he talked about the ""many, many losers"" that the retail industry is likely to see, highlighting Starbucks' store-count growth and reiterating its digital and mobile payment efforts.China is expected to be the next growth gem for the company. Management said China comps accelerated to 7% during the quarter. Starbucks has a partnership with Tencent (TCEHY) in the country that includes use of its WeChat Pay as a digital payment feature.For Q3, management projected 55-56 cents earnings per share vs. views for 55 cents EPS.For the year, Starbucks now expects $2.08 to $2.12 in per-share earnings, down from prior guidance for $2.12-$2.14 a share, which Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan called ""realistic."" He reiterated an outperform rating with 65 price target.Analysts are currently looking for $2.11 in EPS for the year.But Buckingham Research analyst John Zolidis, who holds a neutral rating on the stock, says that he sees risk to the revised guidance, citing slowing growth and increased competition.""Unlike the company, we also believe that incremental competition is a factor although we don't have hard data to support this view.""McDonald's (MCD), which has been promoting its cheaper McCafe drinks, is rolling out a mobile order-and-pay system by the end of the year. The fast-food titan also said it is expanding its delivery partnership with Uber.And JAB, the parent of Peet's Coffee and Caribou Coffee, recently announced the acquisition of Panera Bread (PNRA), fueling speculation that Panera could provide a stronger challenge to Starbucks in the future.McDonald's shares dipped 0.7% in the stock market today, near record highs after its strong earnings earlier this week.

149,SBUX,"Amid the blue-and-pink haze that is the aftermath of the Unicorn Frappuccino, let's not forget that Starbucks (SBUX) reports second-quarter earnings and sales late Thursday.For the quarter, the java giant is expected to record 15% profit growth to 45 cents a share on revenue gains of 8% to $5.41 billion.Shares rose 1 cent to 61.12 in afternoon trade in the stock market today after falling as low as 59.92 intraday. The stock dipped fractionally Monday, breaking a six-session win streak that helped it clear a 59.64 buy point from a flat base on Thursday.The stock hit a one-year high that day following an upgrade to buy from hold with a 67 price target from Stifel, in which analyst Mark Astrachan sees U.S. same-store sales — a key metric — to accelerate ""at least 5%-6%"" over the next four quarters starting in June. He projects mid-single digit global comps. U.S. comps growth has been sluggish in recent quarters.Street analysts largely sound positive on Starbucks' rewards program, mobile order-and-pay technology and food and beverage offerings.""Recently, the shares have found life as optimism has increased that comps will reaccelerate in the second half against easier comparisons and as the company introduces new beverage and upgraded food items and takes incremental price,"" wrote Buckingham Research analyst John Zolidis on Monday. But he expressed concern over the ""soft start"" to the year, among other factors, impacting guidance.RBC analyst David Palmer estimates that the U.S. segment should pull in 3% comps for Q2, which would be the same from the prior quarter. Wedbush is projecting the same, noting that consensus is currently for 3.5% in U.S. comps.The American market is increasingly saturated, and competition lurks not just from other coffee shops but from fast-food heavyweights such as McDonald's (MCD), which came out ahead of forecasts Tuesday morning with positive U.S. same-store sales. The chain's $1 coffee promotion in Q1 helped to cushion results; in the current quarter, McCafe is offering certain drinks for $2.Palmer sees a few sales trends to spur growth this year, including Starbucks' launch of ""suggestive selling and increased personalized marketing,"" easy comparisons, new cold drink and fresh-food offerings and the launch of a Chase Visa debit card that has My Starbucks Rewards. He maintains an outperform rating and 66 price target on the stock.Thursday's call will be the first under new Chief Executive Kevin Johnson. He succeeds Howard Schultz, who will focus on Starbucks' premium offerings as chairman.Expect to hear more about Starbucks' expansion in China — the market with the greatest opportunity for growth — the company's mobile technology advancements, and presumably, the success of the Unicorn Frappuccino.McDonald's shares rose 5.4% to 141.47, hitting an all-time high intraday as they work on their seventh straight gain. McDonald's is now extended from a 130.10 buy point.Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) fell nearly 1% to 55, trying to hold above its 50-day moving average.

153,SBUX,"The big fry among Western brands know where to turn to burnish their appeal with China's growing middle-class consumer.They go to Baozun (BZUN), a relative minnow among giant fish in the Chinese internet market. Baozun helps them tailor e-commerce strategies for the world's most populous nation, from website design and hosting to logistics and digital marketing.With a mere $1.12 billion in market capitalization, Baozun helps heavyweights such as Coach (COH), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), Nike (NKE) and Starbucks (SBUX) establish a strong China presence through branded, localized and customized online stores.Its service differs in that key respect from those offered by China internet giants JD.com (JD) and Alibaba (BABA), in whose ""virtual malls"" companies must vie with one another for attention, said Brendan Ahern, chief executive of KraneShare Advisors.""As a Western brand entering China, you might say, 'We have such a big brand, we want to have our own online store,' "" Ahern said. ""Baozun offers a plug-and-play solution. From click to delivery, they are going to help with that.""China is the world's largest e-commerce market as well as one of its fastest-growing, with online sales growing 26.2% to $749 billion in 2016. By comparison, U.S. e-commerce sales totaled $394.9 billion last year.Baozun stock made little headway at first, after its U.S. initial public offering in May 2015, but it has rocketed 256% over the past year. That's 15 times the S&P 500's 17% gain; more than six times the 40% for Amazon.com (AMZN); quintuple the 53% for Alibaba; and nearly quadruple the 68% for JD.com.Baozun's surge came as the company reported annual earnings of 23 cents a share in 2016 vs. an eight-cent loss the previous year, and total net revenue exploded by 30.5%, to $488.3 million. Analysts foresee bullish growth, with annual earnings accelerating to 69 cents a share and $1.17 over the next two years, according to Thomson Reuters.Baozun's custom-tailored, China-specific solutions have not, it should be noted, kept Wal-Mart (WMT) from launching its flagship online store on JD.com, or Costco (COST) from making an online-first thrust into China with Alibaba's Tmall.For Western companies, now is a very good time to be doing business in upwardly mobile China and the greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, Baozun CEO Vincent Qiu recently told Bloomberg.""Consumers are more and more turning to these branded products and services,"" Qiu said. ""Today, the international brands, including Nike and Converse, are very competitive in this Chinese market. Although they have a very big scale already, they are growing very fast, like double each year, in the China online market.""As it works to acquire those label-conscious customers for its top-brand clients in China, Baozun describes Alibaba and JD as partners. It helps clients to have a presence on other e-commerce platforms, including JD.com and Tmall, besides building branded sites for them. Alibaba is, in fact, Baozun's biggest investor.That does not entirely cut out the risk that JD.com or Tmall could launch similar services, undercutting Baozun. And while China Internet companies are on a hot streak, investors should remember that volatility goes both ways with these high-beta names, said KraneShares' Ahern.For the same reason, he thinks most investors would be better off investing in an exchange-traded fund such as his own CSI China Internet (KWEB), rather than trying to pick individual best stocks. KWEB has vaulted 45% in the past year, with Baozun ranking as the No. 1 performer among the 30-odd stocks in its portfolio over that period.On another cautionary note, China's latest growth scare is reviving memories of tumult in that key emerging market in the past two years. Yet Baozun has flourished of late, as it tailors sales and marketing for Western brands to China's unique social landscape.IBD'S TAKE: Learn why Alibaba ranks among the market-leading growth stocks on IBD Leaderboard and how it stacks up against rivals including JD.com and Amazon.com.One aspect of that is the ubiquitous smartphone, which Ahern said has become a primary mode by which the Chinese shop for consumer goods, pay their bills, bank and invest — far more so than in the West.Baozun understands that the internet-connected mobile device has transformed how people in China spend and use money. It works with Tencent's (TCEHY) WeChat messaging app, the microblogging service Weibo (WB) and key opinion leaders in Chinese social media to drive online retail traffic to its clients' stores.Those efforts matter in a country where online shopping accounted for 15.5% of retail sales in 2016 vs. 8.2% in the U.S. Yet Chinese online shopping has lots more room to grow. China's internet population reached 721 million people in 2016, a penetration of only 52.2%, according to Internetlivestats.com. The U.S. internet population reached 287 million people, a penetration rate of 88.5%.Baozun mostly helps international brands to bring their business to the greater China region. Local brands are not ""strategically"" ready for the kind of partnership Baozun offers, chief Qiu said, though he expects to work more with local brands in the next stage of growth.As it brings Western brands to China, Baozun faces challenges too. Fakes are always a problem, and especially so in the world of online sales, according to Qiu.""That is why we are here,"" he added. ""We have a lot of technical ways to prevent counterfeit products, and we are helping the brands to market their products so people know where they can buy authentic goods online.""Baozun has been called a Chinese Shopify and compared to a GoDaddy, but those easy labels may diminish its robust products and services. Website hosting and e-commerce software are merely one aspect of what it does, Ahern said.At its core, Baozun helps Western brands understand how Chinese consumers shop online and helps them to deliver the features and functionality that those customers expect. For example, it uses chat-focused customer service as a key brand-building channel in a country where the vast majority of pre-sale inquiries come through chat.It also operates warehouse and fulfillment centers for these companies at two sites in the city of Wujiang, which process 80,000 orders daily, on average. During special promotions, including Singles Day, Baozun sees significant spikes in sales volume — up to 100 times that of a normal day.Baozun shares have been hovering above buy range since early May. Shares were up nearly 2% in early trades Friday, hitting 21 a share.RELATED:This Top Software Firm Has Flipped From Losses: 220% EPS Gain Seen ThursdayMomo Is On Fire, Thanks To The Kindness Of StrangersWatch Out, Amazon: This Other E-Commerce Name Is Growing

155,SBUX,"If you're looking for investment ideas — and who isn't? — why not check out top-performing stocks held by top-performing stock mutual funds?The top performing stock mutual funds, among those with more than $100 million in assets year to date through July 10, were those with portfolios in India, China, Asia and technology.XIt just so happens all were actively managed funds. And actively managed stock mutual funds outperformed their passively managed counterparts. Who says active stock mutual fund management is dead? More on that lower in this report.Let's go back to the best of the best among top-performing stocks.The $207 million Wasatch Emerging India Fund (WAINX) was the top performing stock mutual fund, jumping 37% year to date through July 10. It is actively managed. Among its best performing stocks were the ADRs of HDFC Bank (HDB), whose price rose 46%.The bank has more than 4,500 branches in nearly 2,600 Indian cities.HDFC sports a sterling 98 Composite Rating from IBD on a scale of 1 to 99. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.The stock is in IBD's 85-85 index. The index tracks stocks whose EPS and Relative Strength Ratings are 85 or greater, and whose prices are above $15, are within 15% of their 52-week high and whose average daily trading volume is 10,000 shares or more.The bank is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Banks-Foreign industry group. Earnings per share rose 12% and 23% the past two quarters. It has racked up four straight years of EPS growth. Its pretax margin was 27.8% last year, the highest in at least nine years.IBD'S TAKE: You can check out more of HDFC's fundamental and technical strengths in IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.The $107.9 million Neuberger Berman Greater China Equity Fund (NCEIX) was the second-best performing stock mutual fund — also an actively managed portfolio — with a 32.99% year-to-date gain through July 10. ADRs for Baozun (BZUN) were its top-performing security, notching a 121% surge this year.The company is an online provider of retail services. It helps Western companies like Coach (COH), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), Nike (NKE) and Starbucks (SBUX) sell in China by creating their own branded, localized and customized online stores. As IBD recently reported, Baozun does not merely set up websites for corporate clients. It also helps Western brands decide what goes on sites by helping them understand Chinese consumers.Baozun's EPS jumped 167%, 200% and 75% the past three quarters. The stock is in IBD's New America index. The New America Index tracks companies profiled in The New America, an IBD feature that identifies entrepreneurial companies changing the way we live or do business.Priceline Group (PCLN) was one of the top performers for $5 billion T. Rowe Price Global Technology Fund (PRGTX) with a 31% share-price gain year to date through July 10. Global Technology was the best-performing tech sector fund year to date, up 29.65%. And it is actively run.On July 10, the stock, which is a big Nasdaq component, edged past its 1,927.23 buy point of a flat base. But the stock closed below the entry on weak volume. Shares succeeded in breaking out the next day, although it was again on below-average volume.Despite headlines that insist that passively run stock mutual funds are trouncing actively run portfolios at every turn, actively managed stock mutual funds outperformed their passively run counterparts so far this year through July 10. Active stock mutual funds averaged a 10% gain vs. 9.60% for the S&P 500 and 8.94% for index funds.One reason for the outperformance by active managers is that far fewer index funds than actively managed funds beat the broad market.One thousand seven hundred and sixty-three actively managed stock mutual funds topped the S&P 500's year-to-date gain. Just 83 passively run stock mutual funds outperformed.That was outperformance by 51% of actively run stock mutual funds vs. just 33% of passively run stock mutual funds.Similarly, no index funds beat the broad market by as much as the best-performing actively run funds did.Among passively managed stock mutual funds with more than $100 million in assets, the top performer this year through July 10 was $106 million iShares MSCI Asia ex Japan Index (BAJIX), which gained 22.40%. One smaller fund, $11.42 million Leland Thomson Reuters Venture Capital Index (LDVIX), did better, notching a 28.89% gain.Twelve actively run stock mutual funds did better than the Leland portfolio. One hundred and thirty-three actively run stock mutual funds with more than $100 million in assets topped the iShares portfolio.Despite the strong showings by those two stock mutual funds, outperformance among index funds was mainly by emerging markets funds.After iShares MSCI Asia ex Japan, the next best performing index funds with at least $100 million in assets were seven emerging markets stock mutual funds, led by $2.1 billion TIAA-CREF Emerging Markets Equity Index (TEQLX).ADRs of China-based TAL Education Group (TAL) are one of the TIAA-CREF fund's top performers, up 85% this year through July 10. After declining for two quarters, EPS grew 37% and 104% the past two quarters.The stock is in a buy range after breaking out from a late-stage base with a 134.10 buy point on Wednesday. The company is a fast-growing provider of K-12 after-school tutoring services in China.RELATED:How Millennials Are Building Better 401(k) Accounts Than Older WorkersYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

Williams-Sonoma (WSM) advanced 2%. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) added 2%. Kohl's (KSS) rose 3%. All were rising in above-average volume.Starbucks (SBUX), though, was headed for a sixth consecutive loss. The stock broke out in April and advanced 9% before pulling about 5% off the high. Midday Monday the stock was finding support at its 50-day line. The restaurant group began the week No. 33 among 197 industry groups.Chip stocks, the No. 1 sector going into Monday's action, were suffering. Chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) flopped 4.7%, the day's worst loss in the Nasdaq 100. Chip equipment provider Lam Research (LRCX), another member of the Nasdaq 100, trimmed 2%.Blue chips were narrowly up. General Electric (GE), a Dow Jones industrial average component, gained 3%. CEO Jeffrey Immelt announced his retirement. Immelt's reign as CEO, which began in September 2001, never came close to matching his predecessor Jack Welch in terms of the stock's price performance.RELATED:Analyst Tells Apple Investors To Step To Sidelines5 Dow Stocks To Watch This Week

159,SBUX,"Being in the American restaurant business is tough, as cheaper groceries, heightened competition and never-ending searches for growth abound.Growth by novelty is one way to prosper. Take two recent limited-offer efforts from a couple of industry giants: Starbucks' (SBUX) recent unleashing of the rainbow-colored Unicorn Frappuccino and Yum Brands' (YUM) debut of the Taco Bell Naked Chicken Chalupa — featuring a shell made out of fried chicken.""(In a) saturated market, you've got to make your brand stand out,"" Morningstar's restaurant analyst, R.J. Hottovy, told Investor's Business Daily. ""You maybe have to push the envelope a little bit more in terms of menu innovation, and get people talking about your brand. I think that that's what you're seeing more and more of.""Another way to grow is to simply swallow another company whole, as in the case of Restaurant Brands International (QSR).The parent of Burger King and Canada's Tim Hortons outlets, Restaurant Brands is growing by acquisition, recently closing the buyout of Popeye's Chicken and adding the fried-chicken chain to its portfolio of burgers, coffee and doughnuts. The decision was broadly well-received.""I think it gives (Restaurant Brands) an interesting growth vehicle down the road,"" said Hottovy, adding that demand for fried chicken could be particularly appealing to the company's franchising partners abroad.Following a quarter of weaker-than-expected same-store sales growth in North America, Restaurant Brands' management sounded bullish on expanding Popeye's abroad.""One of the reasons we get really excited is the ability to accelerate the pace of growth, both in the U.S. and Canada, and all around the world,"" said Restaurant Brands Chief Executive Daniel Schwartz about the deal, on the April 26 call to discuss first-quarter earnings.For the quarter, profit of 36 cents a share marked 20% year-over-year growth and topped consensus by 2 cents. Revenue rose 9% to $1 billion, exceeding estimates for $990.3 million. But weak year-ago sales comparisons, including a 2.2% decline at Burger King's U.S. restaurants and a 0.2% dip at Tim Hortons' Canadian locations, marred the consensus beat.A certain Big Mac maker might have been to blame for the same-store-sales slips. In a world filled with artisanal burgers and trendy Shake Shack (SHAK)-type eateries, McDonald's (MCD) ubiquity still provides enormous power.""The comps were a little bit softer than what people were expecting, and I think probably you can trace a good portion of that back to McDonald's success,"" said Hottovy. ""A comp point for McDonald's has a much more disproportionate impact on the rest of the industry, just given its size and scale.""But it's worth keeping in mind that for Restaurant Brands, same-store sales growth isn't necessarily the most significant metric.""In a virtually 100% highly franchised business model like (Restaurant Brands), unit openings drive more operating leverage than comps,"" Cowen analyst Andrew Charles noted the day after earnings were released. He has a market-perform rating on the restaurateur with a 54 price target. And Piper Jaffray's Nicole Miller Regan reiterated her overweight rating and 66 price target.""Continued execution against the company's strategic blueprint as well as cash flows being returned to shareholders at an increasing rate (i.e., recently raised dividend now yielding 1.3%) remains the key catalyst,"" she wrote in late April.To be a fast-food giant in 2017 almost seems quaint, given the trends toward customized meals, natural and organic fare, and millennial-friendly experiences. But Burger King, the Pepsi to McDonald's Coca-Cola, remains engaged in a heated rivalry with the Golden Arches as both attempt to align their technology with modern customers.Burger King is reportedly debuting mobile payments soon. That feature is currently in test mode in the Miami area, according to Bloomberg, citing Burger King head Jose Cil on Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: Restaurant Brands tried to break out of a two-month-long flat base on April 25, immediately retreated the next day and then mounted another breakout on May 5 and hasn't looked back since. Shares continue to reach new highs. The company is currently ranked fourth in IBD's Retail-Restaurants Group, behind Dave & Buster's (PLAY).There's no national release date yet, but no doubt the Whopper maker is eyeing McDonald's plans to debut a mobile-order-and-pay platform in 20,000 locations by the end of 2017. Both lag behind Starbucks' robust mobile-order-and-pay system, an app feature that has become so popular, so quickly, that it actually wound up creating congestion in many locations a couple of quarters ago.Hottovy considers all three big foodie names winners, despite the macro pressures.""Some of the efforts McDonald's has done has put them in the winners' camp, and I think that's had a halo effect over probably Restaurant Brands as well as Dunkin' (DNKN) at this point,"" said Hottovy, adding that Starbucks would still be considered a winner despite not being at the top of its game.Both the BK parent and McDonald's have performed well in recent months. After struggling to break out of a flat base with 58.08 entry point, Restaurant Brands shares rose decisively into buy range on May 5. Its Relative Strength rating, which pits its performance against the S&P 500, is a solid 87.McDonald's recent ascent has been even sharper, gapping up 5.6% on its April 25 earnings report.As far as growth is concerned, McDonald's might have to contend with an ever-larger rival. After all, Restaurant Brands was born of a 2014 merger between 3G Capital-backed Burger King and Tim Hortons.The company will ""probably continue to look for more acquisitions in the future,"" said Hottovy.  ""Tough to say exactly where, but I think it gives them nice new growth and cost-cutting opportunities at the same time.""And Restaurant Brands is not totally immune to the charms of novelty items. Burger King took the time Tuesday to remind its Twitter followers of its newest treat: a milkshake based on Froot Loops cereal.We have a Froot Loops Shake in case you were wondering if childhood dreams come true.— Burger King (@BurgerKing) May 9, 2017RELATED:Shake Shack Shakes Off Same-Store Shock As Starbucks Hunts More UnicornsWhere Does Starbucks Go From Here?

160,SBUX,"President Trump has reportedly decided to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. There was still no official word from the White House as of Wednesday afternoon, but such a move would be a big symbolic stiff-arm to global trading partners that may have negative implications for U.S. businesses.The potential intermediate-term consequences of an outright withdrawal from the Paris agreement are far from clear, although diplomats from a number of countries have raised the possibility of imposing a carbon tax on imports from the U.S. Still, any such economic measures seem unlikely in the near term, because few countries will want to rush a trade war and U.S. trading partners may want to coordinate their response, if any.Initial reports that Trump would scrap the agreement didn't dent the positive mood on Wall Street initially on the stock market today. But stocks lost ground as Bank of America (BAC) and Dow component JPMorgan Chase (JPM) said that low stock-market volatility would cut into second-quarter results and economic data pointed to slowing Chicago-area manufacturing activity. (Weaker oil prices also didn't help.)Trump previously made up his mind to notify Mexico and Canada of his intent to withdraw from Nafta, before reversing course. While another such reversal might be possible, Trump was set to meet with Paris pact supporter Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, a pullout from Nafta would have had destabilizing consequences for businesses and their supply chains. By comparison, the decision to exit the Paris deal may be no more than a public relations black eye.Still, many U.S. businesses, not least those in the alternative energy business like Tesla (TSLA), were hoping that Trump would backpedal from his campaign pledge to rip up the deal signed by President Obama.Tesla CEO Elon Musk warned Wednesday on Twitter that if Trump does withdraw from the Paris accord, he will leave two presidential business advisory councils.Even Exxon Mobil (XOM), Tillerson's former employer, had encouraged Trump to remain a party to the agreement, calling it an ""effective framework for addressing the risks of climate change."" Increased use of natural gas helped the U.S. slash carbon emissions and ""this success can be replicated globally,"" Exxon said.Exxon shareholders voted Wednesday to require disclosures of possible climate change risks for the company.Trump tweeted early on Wednesday that his decision would come over the next few days, adding in all-capital letters: ""MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!""Obama committed the U.S. to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at least 26% from 2005 levels by 2025, and contribute $3 billion to the United Nations-based Green Climate Fund to help poorer countries adopt green technologies. Only $1 billion has so far been delivered.If the U.S. backtracks on that contribution commitment, analysts have said that might curb sales opportunities for U.S. green technology companies in emerging markets. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) CEO Ben van Beurden has suggested that U.S. companies could pay a price if Trump's action spurs an international public-relations backlash. ""The U.S. has a major crop of companies that deliver technologies that are going to be relevant in the energy transition, and one way or another they will also find themselves probably more disadvantaged than advantaged by the U.S. pulling out,"" Van Beurden told the Financial Times.Shell's Van Beurden also said that a withdrawal by the U.S. could make it a less attractive place for foreign direct investment, though he said that most long-term investments may come to fruition when Trump is no longer in the White House.Yet the nonbinding nature of the agreement and individual country commitments means that there's no negative direct economic consequence in staying involved. Measuring U.S. progress toward its goal will take years and the agreement doesn't have an enforcement mechanism for countries that backslide. There's also nothing prohibiting members from scaling back their greenhouse gas commitments.U.S. carbon dioxide emissions have fallen to their lowest levels in decades thanks to a fracking-fueled shift to natural gas from coal. Germany is struggling to cut its emissions as it eliminates nuclear power.Trump could also decide to stay a party to the agreement but re-examine the U.S. commitment, which the White House has suggested is unfair. Supporters of the framework say the idea is to establish trust and, over time, ramp up what initially appear to be fairly modest goals for major emerging market countries such as China. Critics of the agreement argue that it is unbalanced and that U.S. participation will drive up domestic energy costs and harm job creation. Trump has been a longtime critic of climate science's global warming consensus and has pledged to bring back coal mining jobs.Soon after Trump was elected, more than 350 companies signed a letter urging him not to abandon the Paris climate change agreement. ""Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk,"" the letter said.Among those companies signing it were household names like General Mills (GIS), Kellogg (K), DuPont (DD), eBay (EBAY), Starbucks (SBUX), Staples (SPLS), Nike (NKE) and Intel (INTC). DuPont, Nike and Intel are all Dow components, like Exxon Mobil.Still, Trump expressed an open mind toward the Paris agreement after entering the White House. Last week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that he had spoken to Trump about the climate pact three weeks earlier and was ""cautiously optimistic of a positive decision.""Some advocates of the Paris agreement have questioned openly whether Trump leaving the agreement would be better than remaining a reluctant participant seeking to undermine the deal from within.RELATED:Trump To Cancel Obama Policies Aimed At Paris Climate PledgeSolar Stocks Plunge On Coal-Champion Trump's Surprise WinHere's Why Bank Stocks Are Breaking Key Support, Sinking Dow

163,SBUX,"XStarbucks' (SBUX) new Unicorn Frappuccino may be a ""candy-colored nightmare"" (Yahoo Finance) that ""tastes like sour birthday cake and shame"" (Washington Post), but it's new drinks like that that are — partly — expected to help the coffee-store chain ramp-up its same-store sales growth over the next year.Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan expects the java giant's U.S. same-store sales growth to ""accelerate to at least 5%-6% for the next four quarters"" starting in June, with global same-store sales growth also in the mid-single digits but ""modestly below"" U.S. levels. He upgraded Starbucks to buy from hold with a 67 price target.That comp growth is primarily expected to be driven by ""increasingly favorable comparisons,"" but also, to a smaller degree, ""beverage innovations,"" more food choices and technology such as Starbucks' mobile app and its personalized offers. (The Unicorn Frappuccino is presumably one such beverage innovation.)The My Starbucks Rewards loyalty program and the app's mobile order-and-pay function are also seen contributing to ongoing same-store sales growth, said Astrachan.Starbucks shares rose 1.8% to 60.08 in above-average volume on the stock market today, clearing a 59.64 buy point and hitting a one-year high.The company reports second-quarter results in one week on April 27.In recent coffee news, JAB — the parent of Peet's Coffee, Caribou Coffee and Keurig Green Mountain — announced two weeks ago the acquisition of cafe chain Panera Bread (PNRA) in a deal worth $7.5 billion.

After diving in late trade Thursday on a same-store sales decline, shares of Shake Shack (SHAK) are heating up early Friday after getting an upgrade to buy from Buckingham Research Group.

He also pointed out that the company's comp base is only 32 stores big, though the optics of same-store sales remains important.In the first quarter, Shake Shack profit grew 25% to 10 cents a share as revenue climbed 42% to $76.7 million, topping consensus for 8 cents EPS and $74.7 million in sales. (The company joined Wingstop (WING), Del Taco (TACO) and El Pollo Loco (LOCO) in beating forecasts late Thursday.)But same-store sales tumbled 2.5% as the premium burger-and-fries chain faced tough comparisons from a balmier Q1 last year that included the allure of Chick'n Shack sandwiches.Management upped its full-year revenue guidance but took comp outlook down to flat from previous guidance for 2%-3% growth.""We believe SHAK is now set up to start exceeding estimates and to resume the beat-raise pattern that existed prior to 4Q16 results,"" wrote Zolidis on Friday. ""We see this putting a floor in the shares and providing justification for valuation expansion even as shares remain expensive on near-term results.""Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan, however, reiterated his neutral rating with a 33 price target, and called the lowered same-store growth outlook ""realistic.""Shares of Shake Shack shot up 9.2% to 36.18 in the stock market today.

168,SBUX,"In a very busy week for news, stocks rallied solidly. Markets worldwide cheered the results of the first round of France's presidential election. Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Dow stock McDonald's (MCD) hit record highs on earnings, while Intel (INTC) and Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled, with hundreds of other companies reporting. President Trump's big tax-cut plan, which had lifted markets in anticipation, didn't move the needle when its outline was finally released.The major market averages jumped Monday and Tuesday after Emmanuel Macron led the first round of voting in the French presidential election, with polls suggesting he will easily defeat nationalist Marine Le Pen in the early May runoff. Stocks largely consolidated gains the rest of the week, though individual stocks and sectors were active amid a flurry of earnings. Internet, chips, restaurants and casinos were leaders, while Baidu (BIDU), Intel and Starbucks showed that even leading groups had losers. But the Nasdaq composite hit record highs during the week, climbing 2.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.9%, while the S&P 500 index was up 1.5%, just below all-time bests.The e-commerce giant said adjusted income rose 38% year over year to $1.48 a share, beating the consensus Q1 estimate of $1.12. Revenue rose 23% to $35.7 billion, topping views of $35.3 billion. That maintained a steady streak of double-digit revenue gains going back more than four years.Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud computing unit, continued to deliver huge, if gradually slowing, growth.Amazon shares rose to a record high Friday, clearing a new buy point, but closing well off intraday peaks.The earnings of Google-parent Alphabet rose 28% as revenue rose 22%, to $24.75 billion. Analysts expected the company to report earnings of $7.40 a share on sales of $24.22 billion. Revenue at Google's ""other"" non-advertising business — which includes its cloud computing unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store — rose 49%, to $3.01 billion. Mobile advertising growth was a bright spot, although Google's rising traffic-acquisition costs are a concern. TAC refers to what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, or what it pays partners like Apple (AAPL) that generate search traffic. Alphabet shares gapped up 3.8% to a fresh record high Friday.McDonald's first-quarter results beat views, and the burger giant talked up its tech efforts, including expanding delivery, trying out mobile order and pay and its new digitized restaurant layout. Shares jumped to record highs. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) also beat and said it was testing GPS-tracking technology. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) beat as well, and analysts debated its progress following a food-borne illness scare. Starbucks matched profit expectations, but missed on sales amid worries about stalling growth. Starbucks shares undercut a recent buy point intraday Friday, but closed above that level.Software leader Microsoft (MSFT) delivered earnings per share above views for its fiscal third quarter, but sales came in a tad short. Its sales guidance for the June quarter also was below analyst estimates. Microsoft earned 73 cents a share excluding items, up 18% year over year, on adjusted revenue of $23.56 billion, up 6%, in the March quarter. Analysts expected 70 cents and $23.62 billion. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to sales of $24.15 billion, up 7%, but Wall Street had been modeling for $24.51 billion.Intel earnings topped, but the chip giant's sales fell shy amid weakness in its data center market, sending shares gapping down 3.5% Friday. Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), Mellanox Technologies (MLNX), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) were chip plays that retreated.

Sands advanced within a consolidation.Exxon Mobil (XOM) reported mixed first-quarter results but said it had no plans to adjust its capital expenditure guidance as the oil major has identified and captured capital efficiencies.

But AT&T shares fell to 2017 low.Separately, cable giant Comcast (CMCSA) rose to a new high on strength in its movie business and broadband-customer gains.Recall costs and slowing U.S. sales hurt Ford (F) earnings, which fell but still beat Q1 views.

The catalyst was an especially strong earnings report from Anthem (ANTM), though investors may have judged that TrumpCare remains doomed. Humana (HUM) previewed its earnings and raised guidance. Centene (CNC) topped estimates and CEO Michael Neidorff said he expects the Medicaid-heavy insurer to thrive on any reform that can be passed by Congress, noting that ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid.""PulteGroup (PHM) topped earnings estimates, but revenue fell short. Meanwhile, President Trump imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood imports, which could raise construction costs by $1,200 per home. New-home sales rose in March to the second-fastest rate of the current business cycle. Pulte tumbled, but did not outright close below a prior buy point. D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) fell below their 50-day lines as well.

169,SBUX,"XNasdaq 100 futures were indicated higher early Friday, fueled by strong earnings late Thursday from Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). But Intel (INTC) and Microsoft (MSFT) were weighing on Dow Jones industrials futures. The S&P 500 index, which includes all four of those big-cap techs as well as late-night loser Starbucks (SBUX), was little changed.During Thursday's regular session, the Nasdaq composite continued to lead, hitting a record high for a second straight session. The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average rose less than 0.1%. Both are within 1% of all-time levels.Dow Jones industrial average futures fell 0.1% while Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.4% vs. fair value.

Revenue rose 23% to $35.7 billion, narrowly beating views. Investors looked past cautious Q2 revenue guidance, sending shares up 4% in late trading.Amazon finished Thursday's regular session at 918.38, a record close. It has a three-weeks-tight buy point at 923.82, just above the all-time high. A 4% gain at the open would mean the stock is in buy range, but if it moves more than 5% beyond the 923.82 entry, don't chase the stock. Buying an extended stock leaves you vulnerable to shakeouts and big losses.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock heading into earnings offers the chance for big gain — or pain. Here's an earnings options strategy that limits risk but lets you cash in on the upside.Alphabet also rallied 4% in late trade. The Google parent hailed its strong start to 2017, with earnings sprinting past views while revenue growth modestly topped. Alphabet closed Thursday at 891.44, hitting all-time highs but still in range from an 867.10 entry. But if the after-hours action holds true at the open, the stock is likely to be extended.Nasdaq futures would be even higher were it not for Dow components Microsoft and Intel. The one-time Wintel duo topped earnings views, but sales were a little light. Microsoft pared losses late to a fractional decline. But Intel sold off 4%.Semiconductor stocks have been hot, especially chip-equipment makers. But in addition to Intel, Skyworks (SWKS) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) sold off late following their earnings reports.Meanwhile, Starbucks reported in-line earnings, but sales were light, with comparable sales in the Americas weak once again. Starbucks had been in buy range, hitting a 16-month high intraday Thursday. But the stock was trading down 5% following its disappointing results.Looking ahead to Friday, Dow energy components Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) report, along with General Motors (GM).

170,SBUX,"XDomino's Pizza (DPZ) is testing GPS-tracking technology and expects to retain drivers as a broad swath of restaurant chains — from fast-food icon McDonald's (MCD) to fast-casual favorite Panera Bread (PNRA) — explore or ramp up delivery.Just this week, McDonald's said it is expanding its delivery partnership with Uber and will launch home delivery in the U.K. in June. Panera, which is being bought by JAB Holding, said it will hire 10,000 new employees, with about three-quarters of them being delivery drivers.Addressing the growing demand for drivers, Domino's CEO Patrick Doyle said during a conference call with analysts that the company's drivers will be ""more consistently busy and receiving tips at Domino's than working somewhere else.""Shares of Domino's were up 2.5% to 185.55 on the stock market today, retaking their 50-day average on strong quarterly results, but off session highs of 188.85.Rival Papa John's (PZZA), which reports Tuesday, edged up 0.45%, and McDonald's added 3 cents.Domino's Q1 EPS jumped 42% to $1.26, beating Wall Street forecasts by 10 cents, as sales climbed 16% to $624.2 million, above views for $615.85 million. Same-store sales leapt 10.2%.The results come after Domino's stock lost 5.8% on April 7 on a report from M Science that forecast that U.S. first-quarter sales gains would come in ""well below the rough consensus estimate,"" according to CNBC.Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski, in a research note before Domino's earnings, had also expressed caution about Domino's sales. He cited what he said appeared to be ""rather robust"" discounting at Yum Brands' (YUM) Pizza Hut last month, when the NCAA basketball tournament took place. Slower sales in the U.K. and Australia were also concerns.As other fast-food restaurants fought each other on discounts and cheaper groceries discourage eating out, Domino's last year largely remained above the fray, putting up solid sales and EPS figures.Customers are already used to ordering pizza over the phone, so Domino's mobile ordering platform has worked particularly well as other restaurants try to digitize ordering and the experience inside their locations.RELATED:McDonald's Delivers Beefy Earnings; Execs Talk Deliveries, Digital StoresDomino's CEO Doyle On Netflix, Trump And Pizza's 'Jetsons' Future

Revenue was slightly softer than expected.Credit-card stocks have held up well despite the weakness in retail. Mastercard (MA) has moved sideways in soft trade in recent sessions, and Visa (V) has shown similar action. Both stocks are near 52-week highs and reported weeks ago.

175,SBUX,"XMcDonald's (MCD) on Tuesday said it would expand its delivery service with UberEats from Florida into a number of U.S. cities this quarter, and the burger giant said its new digitized store setup prompted some restaurants to shift employees toward more ""hospitality""-focused roles to help consumers navigate self-order kiosks and other departures from fast-food traditions.That comment, made during McDonald's conference call, followed first-quarter financials that Wall Street cheered. Earnings per share rose 18% to $1.47, beating analyst estimates for $1.33. Revenue fell 4% to $5.676 billion, above forecasts for $5.53 billion.

Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) rose 1.5% to 58.48, peeking out past a flat base with a 58.08 buy point.Management admitted there was some degree of ""nervousness"" among franchisees to plow money into adopting the new store layout, which the company calls Experience of the Future. Those restaurants will have digital ordering kiosks and table service.But the restaurant and retail sectors are trying to meet more sophisticated consumer tastes and adapt to the mobile devices that have reshaped the way people shop and get around.IBD'S TAKE: Despite McDonald's efforts at reform, many people still believe they're serving straight-up garbage. However, the company has remained in good standing among teenagers, according to a recent Piper Jaffray survey. For more about what companies resonate with teenagers, read this story.CEO Steve Easterbrook said the company had a detailed training plan for the shift to that new format, and said ""I think the excitement exceeds the nervousness by quite some way.""As more people turn to the internet for takeout, McDonald's said it would launch a mobile order and pay platform in thousands of restaurants by the end of this year. And by the middle of next year, the company will also serve fresh-beef, cooked-when-ordered Quarter Pounders in most of its restaurants, an attempt to keep up with the growing popularity of fresher ingredients.Along those lines, McDonald's on Tuesday said it would also bring Signature Crafted Sandwiches to U.S. restaurants next week.McDonald's noted that in early trials of fresh Quarter Pounders, drive-thru service slowed slightly. But Easterbrook said the company had found ways around that issue, along with ways to simplify the handling, packaging and storing of the food. He said he anticipates minimal cost increases from the rollout.""We have worked through a lot of the kinks in this,"" Easterbrook said.Management credited the Q1 U.S. sales boost to expanded All-Day Breakfast offerings as well as Big Mac and beverage promotions, and attributed international strength to the start of All-Day Breakfast in Canada.""Our efforts to build a better McDonald's are yielding meaningful results with continued positive momentum and a strong start to 2017 that includes positive comparable sales across all segments, higher global guest counts and enhanced profitability,"" said Easterbrook in a statement earlier.The results arrive as the restaurant industry's sales have suffered from discount battles, harsh or erratic weather, and cheaper groceries, which have given diners more of a reason to eat in.But McDonald's nationwide $1 coffee promotion and new Big Mac sizes — the Grand Mac and the Mac Jr. — cushioned results during Q1. And the management during the call said the price gap between food at home and food away from home was narrowing.Year-over-year comparisons for the fast-food giant could also become more favorable in the second half, analysts say, after the breakfast expansion's boost leveled off in late 2016. McDonald's $1 soda promotion and a $2 promotion for some McCafe drinks could also help in the current quarter.""We attribute the top-line success to high-impact, traffic-driving product news (Mac Jr., dollar coffee) and expect MCD to continue focusing on the value guest to recapture lost traffic to ... peers,"" Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh said in a research note.Wendy's (WEN) and Starbucks (SBUX) could be at some risk as McDonald's tries to balance better quality with value.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) reports quarterly results after the close Tuesday. Starbucks reports Thursday with its stock in a buy zone.Internationally, McDonald's said that the U.K. ""has not missed a beat since Brexit,"" but said diners in France had become more cautious following a string of terrorist attacks and an election characterized by rising populism on the left and right.The company's decision to sell much of its China and Hong Kong assets could contribute to ""choppiness"" in operating margins over the next few quarters, management said.RELATED:Chipotle Leads 5 Big Earnings Reports Tonight: What To ExpectStarbucks Reports Q2 Earnings Thursday: Watch This Key MetricStarbucks Breaks Out To 1-Year High As 'Unicorn' Tastes Like Victory

But Intel (INTC) tumbled on its Q1 sales while Qualcomm (QCOM) slashed profit views on its growing feud with key customer Apple (AAPL).Meanwhile, first-quarter GDP growth was an annualized 0.7%, a sharper slowdown from Q4's 2.1% pace than the 1.1% expected. It was the weakest growth in three years, as consumer spending barely rose. But the 8:30 a.m. ET release didn't move stock futures much.The Nasdaq rose 0.1% in morning action, paring gains after hitting a fresh all-time high. The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 0.1% while the S&P 500 edged lower.An earnings blitz late Thursday drove market action, but in a push-pull fashion.Alphabet jumped 4% at the opening bell on the stock market today, while Amazon advanced nearly 3%.

181,SBUX,"XFutures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite signaled modest gains early Tuesday as the major market averages look set to hold and extend Monday's big gains.Dow components McDonald's (MCD) and Caterpillar (CAT) report earnings before the open, along with Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Pulte Group (PHM). All are in buy range as of Monday's close except for Caterpillar, which took a big step Monday toward its own entry point.Meanwhile, look for Express Scripts (ESRX) to sell off at Tuesday's open on bad news. Express Scripts announced that it was likely to lose its top customer, Anthem (ANTM), sending shares of the pharmacy benefit manager down 15% late Monday. (CVS Health (CVS), which is a major PBM in addition to its drugstore operations, was up 3% late, perhaps on hopes that it will win the Anthem business.)On Monday, the Nasdaq composite soared 1.2%, hitting an all-time high.

How about the four leading stocks at or near buy range that are reporting earnings Tuesday morning?The burger giant is currently in buy range from a 130.10 entry, rising for the past six sessions to 134.23 as of Monday. Analysts expect a 6% sales decline, to $5.53 billion, with earnings per share up 8%, to $1.33. U.S. same-store sales will be watched closely.Beyond Q1 results and guidance, analysts will look for McDonald's clues about when it will roll out its mobile order-and-pay system, as well as any further talk of deliveries. Investors also will want to know how McDonald's big McCafe promotions are working, which could impact Starbucks (SBUX). Starbucks has broken out of its own consolidation ahead of earnings on Thursday.Analysts expect the maker of heavy construction and mining equipment to report a 7.5% EPS decline, to 62 cents, with sales off 2%, to $9.27 billion. On Monday, Caterpillar reported that equipment sales by retailers rose 1% in the three months to March vs. a year earlier, the first such gain since November 2012.Caterpillar shares rose 2.6%, to 96.81, on Monday, retaking their 50-day line and approaching a 99.56 flat-base buy point.The defense contractor should report an 8% revenue rise to $1.24 billion with EPS also up 8%, to $2.79. Lockheed Martin rose 1.1%, to 276.21, on Monday, still in range from a 270 buy point retaken last week.Defense stocks have rallied on hopes for higher U.S. military spending and increased geopolitical tensions with Syria and North Korea.

All of those stocks are in or near buy points as well.The homebuilder is expected to report a 21% EPS rise to 29 cents on a 22% revenue rise.

182,SBUX,"The Pokemon Go craze may have died down, but it's about to get a big jolt of caffeine — and a new Frappuccino drink — from Starbucks (SBUX).Multiple sites dedicated to the game have posted promotional materials for a nationwide partnership set to launch on Thursday, Dec. 8. A Starbucks spokesperson responded to a press inquiry saying that ""Starbucks has nothing to share at this time."" Still, the timing and nature of the marketing blitz leave little doubt that it is for real.The promotional materials marked ""Barista Need-To-Know"" offer some tasty details, hinting that Pokemon Go creator Niantic will be releasing new specimens of Pokemon into the wild to lure customers into Starbucks. Niantic developed the game in collaboration with the Pokemon Company, of which Nintendo (NTDOY) owns about a one-third stake.Shares of Starbucks ticked down 6 cents to close at 57.44 on the stock market today, while Nintendo shares rose 2.4% to 30.65.IBD'S TAKE: Starbucks, like the broad Retail-Restaurants industry group, has lagged the market during the Trump rally. But Jack In The Box, IBD's No. 1 stock in the sector, broke out to a record high on Nov. 22. Keep an eye on Dave & Busters, the No. 2 ranked stock, which is set to report earnings after the close on Tuesday.The vast majority of U.S. company-operated Starbucks will host either a PokeStop, where players of the app can collect items needed in the game, or a Gym, where players battle to win bragging rights and PokeCoins, according to the leaked materials.Starbucks explained to its baristas that it expects participation in the game to ""encourage more customers to visit your store and increase number of transactions.""Team members also are instructed: ""When players come to visit, encourage them to purchase the new Pokemon Go Frappuccino.""The new Frap, flavored with vanilla, blackberry and raspberry, will be available as long as supplies last.Websites devoted to Pokemon Go speculate that the launch of the Starbucks promotion may be accompanied by the release of as many as 100 long-awaited Pokemon into the wild, with the goal being to catch them all.Niantic recently transformed the tracker that players use to find Pokemon in a way that will contribute to the success of the marketing promotion. Previously, players would see Pikachu and any other nearby Pokemon in their tracker, but now players can only see what Pokemon are hanging out at PokeStops. In other words, game players looking for new creatures will be led directly to a Starbucks, and a hot drink may seem like a good idea on a cold December day.Pokemon Go already has a partnership with McDonald's (MCD) Japan.Starbucks is set to hold its investor day on Wednesday, so expect to hear more about its Pokemon partnership then.RELATED:'Pokemon Go' Still Raking In $2 Million A DayWhat To Expect From Starbucks' CEO Shuffle — Shaky Or Seamless?Pokemon Go Explains Why Economic Growth Is So Sluggish

183,SBUX,"The stock market took off thanks to President-elect Donald Trump's agenda of corporate tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation, but the latest headlines signal a likelihood of turbulence ahead as investors examine what JPMorgan analysts call ""radical changes.""CNN on late Wednesday reported that top players in the incoming administration have been kicking around the idea of imposing an across-the-board 5% tariff on imports. Alternatively, team Trump has been weighing support for a House Republican corporate tax change that would indirectly apply a 20% tax on imports, even though it might not pass muster with the World Trade Organization.Trump aides Thursday responded to the CNN report, stressing that no decisions have been made.""The CNN story got a little bit too far out over its skis,"" Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller told reporters. ""The incoming administration is obviously discussing numerous trade deals and tax reform packages with members of our own team as well as members of Congress. But it's too early to go into specific speculation on issues of tariffs or border adjustability.""The report followed the announcement that economist Peter Navarro, who has defended Trump's campaign threat to slap a 45% punitive tariff on Chinese imports, will head a soon-to-be-established White House National Trade Council.On Thursday, shares of major retailers were taking it on the chin. Wal-Mart (WMT) was off 2.3% on the stock market today. Macy's (M) slid 3.6%, Target (TGT) 4.4%, Gap (GPS) 5.4% and Dollar Tree (DLTR) 5.65%. E-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN) fell 0.55%. (Retailers also fell on reports of weak holiday sales and traffic).One of the big questions since the election is how Trump will merge his populist campaign themes with a traditional Republican agenda of tax cuts and deregulation. A boost to infrastructure spending and use of the bully pulpit to keep companies like Ford (F) and Carrier, a unit of United Technologies (UTX), from shutting down U.S. production are two clear ways that Trump aims to stay faithful to his working-class supporters who put him over the top in the Rust Belt. Demanding that Mexico and Canada open up North American Free Trade Agreement for renegotiation is another likely tack. Yet the latest reports offer the clearest indication that Trump may go further than investors have been expecting.It's easy to see why investors are excited about the prospect of a big corporate tax cut. Trump's campaign plan to cut the corporate rate to 15% from the 35% statutory rate could boost S&P 500 earnings by $180 billion, or 16%, figures Jonathan Glionna, head of U.S. equity strategy research at Barclays.IBD'S TAKE: Stocks that stand to benefit from both corporate tax cuts and an infrastructure boost have been among the big winners of the Trump rally. Two of those stocks, Freeport McMoRan and Martin Marietta Materials, are near a buy point. Check out Leaderboard, where IBD's market writers help you find buying opportunities in these and other stocks as they emerge, as well as sell signals to lock in profits.But some companies and sectors could stand to benefit much more than others. Domestic-focused industries like retail and homebuilders, many of which derive 100% of income from the U.S., could see an earnings boost of 30% or more, Glionna wrote, and could get a further boost from a consumer tax cut. Dollar General (DG), for example, could see its 37% effective tax rate (including state taxes) fall to 17% under the Trump plan.Among industry groups, only telecom would get a bigger lift than retail, with AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) seeing a 29% boost in earnings.Yet, retailers could, all of a sudden, become big losers if Trump adopts the House Republican plan. While cutting the statutory corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%, the House plan would no longer allow businesses to deduct the cost of imports from taxes. That means retailers such as Dollar General, Wal-Mart, Amazon, Costco (COST) and Starbucks (SBUX) would have to pay a tax equal to 20% of the cost of the clothing, televisions, toys and coffee they import.Because retail profit margins are generally in the low single digits, one concern is that retailers that sell a lot of imported goods might have to pass much of those taxes on to customers to maintain their profitability.""Clearly a 20% tax on the wide range of consumer goods that are imported into the United States would put increased economic pressure on families who can least afford it,"" the National Retail Federation said after the House unveiled its ""Better Way"" tax plan in June.Actually, the economic impact of the House plan is far from clear. While imports could be 20% more expensive and exports 12% cheaper, the dollar could appreciate by 15% or more, largely offsetting the tax changes, Deutsche Bank wrote in an analysis this week.Trump and the GOP could be in for a big battle if they build corporate tax reform around this border-adjustment plan. Yet, reform may not be much easier if they choose another path. The conservative Tax Foundation estimates that this border adjustment of corporate taxes would raise $1.1 trillion over 10 years, a huge sum that helps offset the cost of lowering the corporate tax rate to 20% in the House plan. Unless the GOP can get eight Senate Democrats on board, which is doubtful, a tax package passed via reconciliation will have to be deficit-neutral beyond 10 years, so offsets are needed to make the U.S. tax code more competitive.On top of that, there are real worries that other countries will punish American companies if the Trump administration applies tariffs or Congress adopts what looks like a border tax.It's probably safe to say that the stock market rally has downplayed some of these nagging problems in implementing the Trump agenda and that the ride may get bumpy because the range of possible outcomes is wide.As JPMorgan analysts wrote this week, ""While a lot of the early corporate tax reform enthusiasm was predicated on a cursory examination of the headline rate cuts, markets are now examining the radical changes being proposed to the intricacies of the code. (Last) Thursday and Friday saw notable weakness in apparel/retail-linked stocks and a big factor behind the selling was concern around the border adjustment concept that sits at the heart of the GOP corporate tax reform plan.""RELATED:Here's How Much Trump Tax Cuts Could Boost The Stock Market Tax Reform May Pit GOP Vs.

185,SBUX,"Stock indexes kept to a narrow trading range midday Wednesday as they inched to modest gains and losses.The Nasdaq rose 0.1%, while the S&P 500 retreated 0.1%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.3%. Volume slipped on the NYSE and edged up on the Nasdaq in the stock market today vs. this time Tuesday.Within industry groups, retail stocks were doing well. Of 197 groups, six of the day's top seven groups were from the retail sector. On Tuesday, the retail sector scored nine new highs, the most for any sector.Select restaurant stocks continue to show strength. Fast-food chain Sonic (SONC) gapped up as much as 11% before giving back about half the gain. Volume was red hot. The stock fell in after-hours trade Tuesday after the company missed on revenue but beat the consensus estimate on earnings. On the upbeat side, Sonic CEO J. Clifford Hudson said at Tuesday's earnings call that the company completed its refranchising program ahead of schedule.Starbucks (SBUX) is a restaurant stock that is starting to look more attractive. The stock has been consolidating since October 2015. However, the stock has sketched a flat base within the larger pattern. The flat base, which began forming in mid-December, has shown tighter action than the larger pattern. Starbucks' pretax margin was 19.3% in fiscal 2016 ended in September. That was the best reading on pretax margin in at least nine years.The beaten-down department-store group rang up the day's best gain despite ranking last among the 197 groups. The group rose about 3.5%.The homebuilder group was up only slightly despite a report on pending home sales in February. The reading came in at 5.5%, topping the consensus view for 2.4% and also beating the highest estimate in the range. The highest estimate was 3.5%.This was not too surprising because the pending gauge is considered a leading indicator of existing-home sales rather than new-home sales.Before Thursday's open, the third report on fourth-quarter GDP will be released.

186,SBUX,"The stock market was at session lows in afternoon trading Friday unti President Trump pledged a ""massive tax cut"" package will be released next week. Meanwhile, some major stocks such as Microsoft (MSFT) and General Electric (GE) made significant moves.The Dow Jones industrial average was back to break-even, as Microsoft led with a 1.4% jump, hitting a new high in heavy trading, retaking a 66.01 flat base entry. The software giant reports earnings Thursday, and some analysts are expecting a big quarter. But GE remained a drag, down 2% after its earnings report in unusually heavy volume.The S&P 500 was off 0.2% and the Nasdaq down 0.1%. Volume was higher on the NYSE but lower on the Nasdaq. A sharp drop at 1 p.m. ET sent indexes to deeper lows. With today's losses, the S&P 500 has been frustrated in a new attempt to establish itself above the important 50-day moving average.Meat products, trucking, fiber optics and utilities were the top-performing industry groups. Pilgrim's Pride (PPC) soared nearly 9% in big volume after an analyst upgrade. The Dow utilities, often a defensive choice for investors, was up 0.7%. Energy, generic drugs and some computer groups were down.Bojangles (BOJA) just topped the 20.95 buy point of a cup-with-handle base, but volume was a bit below average. Still, the restaurants industry group has been trending higher and has provided a few opportunities. Starbucks (SBUX) broke out Thursday. Dow component McDonald's (MCD) is in buy range from its 130.10 buy point.Restaurant Brands (QSR) and Wendy's (WEN) are forming bases and have decent IBD Composite Ratings. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) also is basing and Guggenheim started covering the stock with a buy rating Friday.Still, it's a tough market for restaurants in general, with many weak charts. This is what Nomura had to say about the industry on Monday: ""U.S. chain restaurant same-store sales appear to have been fairly lackluster overall, with tough comparisons being lapped year over year and a skittish consumer being among some of the factors behind this trend. On a month-by-month basis, January 2017 same-store sales were likely better than those of February and March. Comparisons for the industry ease somewhat starting with April.""RELATED:These 2 Industrial Bellwethers Topped Earnings, 1 Hit A Buy Point

He added, ""We believe Snap has all the ingredients to build a robust advertising business.""Goldman Sachs set a price target of 27, while Morgan Stanley's price target on Snap is 28.Snap stock jumped 4.8% to close at 23.83 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: While Snap has now received several buy ratings and is said to have replaced Twitter as the No. 2 social networking platform among advertisers, it faces a formidable rival in Facebook and the low Accumulation/Distribution rating on Snap's stock indicates selling by institutional investors. JPMorgan added Apple to its ""Focus List"" and raised its price target to 165 from 142, saying there is high pent-up replacement demand at the same time Apple is gearing up to launch its new iPhone.But shares edged up 0.2% to finish at 140.88.Special Report: IBD Best Mutual Fund AwardsCoverage was initiated on Starbucks with an outperform rating and a price target of 66 at Telsey Advisory Group, which cited the coffee giant's growth plans.China is the next big frontier for Starbucks as it plans to rapidly expand its store count there.

He wrote that recent checks indicate continued momentum during the first quarter but with a limited view on profitability.""We believe current valuation appropriately reflects an improving top-line trajectory, offset by limited visibility into Chipotle's near-term margin trajectory,"" Setyan wrote.Chipotle stock ticked 0.2% higher to 414.96.

189,SBUX,"Starbucks' (SBUX) top bean, Howard Schultz, is relinquishing the position of chief exec come April and will focus on the coffee giant's premium retail efforts as executive chairman. In his stead will be current COO Kevin Johnson, a former Juniper Networks (JNPR) CEO and Microsoft (MSFT) vet who has been with the company since 2009.So what can coffee lovers and investors expect from the changes at the top?Some Wall Street pros mourned the loss of Schultz, who spent most of the last three decades at a company that is now a household name. Synonymous with coffee and often skewered as a yuppie staple, Starbucks has, under his tenure, become a pop cultural icon of middle-class aspiration.""In our coverage, we may not ever again follow a CEO with his combination of merchandising genius, energy, strategic thinking, and inspirational leadership,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer.Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog called Schultz ""without question one of the strongest and most visionary leaders in the consumer/retail world."" She has an outperform rating on the stock.IBD'S TAKE: Starbucks has been a market laggard over the past year. But if you have an appetite for restaurant stocks, here are several eateries that are in or near buy range. Starbucks' advances on the tech front have put it far ahead of restaurant peers. The restaurant has cultivated a solid loyalty program and a mobile payment function that as of the most recently reported quarter accounted for 25% of all transactions.Shares fell 2.2 to 57.21 on the stock market today in response to the CEO shuffle. Starbucks stock has retaken its 200-day moving average recently, but has been lagging the overall market for more than a year.But the leadership transition is not wholly unexpected, and not unwelcome. Herzog says it's been in the works for years.""Importantly Johnson has an exceptionally good relationship with Schultz, which should keep Schultz sufficiently removed to allow Johnson to lead effectively given his trust in Johnson, while also remaining sufficiently nearby to ensure the ship remains on course,"" she wrote.RBC's Palmer says the shift is occurring ""during a period of strength.""Broadly, analysts don't appear to expect a huge shake-up from the change.And stockwise, the move presents ""more of a buying opportunity than reason to run away,"" headlined a report from Buckingham Research Group analyst John Zolidis, who believes that Schultz will still be very involved in the business and that Johnson is ""well qualified to step into the CEO role.""Other issues, in Zolidis' view, weigh on the stock. He sees a slowdown in U.S. same-store sales and ""modest downside risk to earnings.""Last month, Starbucks reported slightly better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, but issued somewhat cautious profit guidance for 2017. The company now seems to be looking to China as an area with the greatest growth opportunities.The stock has been on an upswing since then, however, going into management's investor day coming up on Wednesday.Starbucks in recent years has outpaced competitors at home, including McDonald's (MCD) and Dunkin' Brands (DNKN).But Dunkin' Brands earnings growth has picked up in recent quarters, with its Dunkin' Donuts chain expanding in California.

190,SBUX,"The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index failed to close higher Friday, but Dow and S&P 500 component McDonald's (MCD) advanced, nearly breaking out on a report of stronger same-store sales. Darden Restaurants (DRI) also is approaching a buy point too as Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) retakes an entry area.Shares of McDonald's rolled higher on Friday after Credit Suisse boosted its first-quarter U.S. same-store sales forecast for the burger chain on signs its coffee and McCafe promo, extra Big Mac offerings and McPick value deals could be paying off.Following conversations with franchisees, Credit Suisse raised its U.S. same-store sales forecast for McDonald's to a 0.5% gain, up from a 2% drop. Wall Street expects same-store sales to fall 1.3%, according to Consensus Metrix.""Key sales drivers cited by franchisees incl.: (1) expansion of Big Mac platform (launched nationwide in ~late Jan.), (2) $1 drip coffee/$2 McCafe promo and (3) local McPick 2 deals,"" Credit Suisse analyst Jason West wrote in a research note on Friday.He said he believed that McDonald's U.S. same-store sales were ""flattish"" in January, but picked up in February and the first half of this month prior to Winter Storm Stella.That storm, which this week disrupted air travelers' plans, forced some store closures and likely hurt McDonald's sales in parts of the Northeast, West wrote. But its impact on the chain's U.S. same-store sales overall might be only around 15 to 20 basis points for the first quarter.The apparent gains from McDonald's cheaper coffee and drinks deals would come as Starbucks (SBUX) showed signs of losing foot-traffic share in the U.S. in January.McDonald's has said it is testing out food delivery and will launch a mobile order and pay system by the end of the year. It's reported begun testing mobile order and pay  in some markets. That technology is among the biggest breakthroughs for convenience in generations for the restaurant industry. But it has also resulted in problems managing the flow of people in and out of restaurants, as Starbucks has found.McDonald's rose as high as 129.98 in the stock market today, just below a 130.10 cup-with-handle buy point. Shares closed up 0.5% at 128.64.Starbucks (SBUX) rose 1.8% to 55.78, closing just below its 200-day moving average and topping that key level intraday.

192,SBUX,"If medical scientists are right, people are going to live much longer and healthier lives. So what does this mean for your financial future? For one thing, you will need enough money to enjoy your life. On the bright side, you've got more time to figure out how to do it.Ric Edelman, author of  ""The Truth About Your Future: The Money Guide You Need Now, Later, and Much Later,"" says even if you're in your 50s and 60s, you have plenty of time to change course. Retirement at 65 is a concept that belongs in the 20th century, he says.""One reason people retire is because they become unable to do their job physically or it's become too dangerous; for example, airline pilots and law enforcement have mandatory retirement ages,"" he said.But as medical advances improve health and longevity, Edelman says people can expect a more cyclical life trajectory.""People will go back to school to retrain, take a break and then return to the workforce, and that cycle will repeat itself more than once,"" he said.There are four areas where this paradigm shift will have the most impact.Career planning. The type of work and how long you will be in the workforce are two of the biggest changes people will face as they live longer, healthier lives, Edelman says.""For a great many people, the career you're currently in is not the one you're going to stay in, because automation and robotics will eliminate half the current occupations in 10 to 15 years,"" he told IBD. ""Other jobs will be created, and that means you have to engage in lifelong learning to remain viable in the workplace.""You're going to have to continually retrain yourself,"" Edelman said, ""and that's true for 20-year-olds and 50-year-olds.""Financial goals. If you're going to live longer, you're going to need more money.  The constant retraining comes at a cost.""You will need to figure out how to maintain your lifestyle while you interrupt your earning to learn new skills,"" Edelman said.Fortunately, continuous learning doesn't have to be expensive or inconvenient. There are plenty of reasonably priced online courses that offer the opportunity for self-paced learning, for example. And some companies, like Starbucks (SBUX) and Chrysler (FCAU), even offer education reimbursement to their workers and families.Nevertheless, your money strategy should be broad and far-reaching. Edelman says you should diversify your investments, since simply putting your life savings into bank CDs won't be enough to maintain your lifestyle on a long-term basis.Another key strategy Edelman suggests: Invest in exponential technology, or technologies that double in power or processing speed every year, while their cost halves. With the help of a certified financial advisor you trust, learn about and invest in companies in the field of robotics, nanotechnology, medicine, neuroscience, 3D printing, energy and environmental systems, and education technology.Health care budgeting. While Edelman believes that researchers will soon find inexpensive cures to chronic diseases like diabetes, people will still need to keep themselves healthy enough to take advantage of those breakthroughs when they arrive. That means health care budgeting is still going to take a chunk out of your savings for the time being.A growing trend in stashing away money for medical expenses are health savings accounts. Americans with a high-deductible health plan can contribute pretax dollars to HSAs to pay for medical expenses and invest a part of the balance.""A lot more folks are starting to capitalize on HSAs as a retirement vehicle,"" said Jon Robb, executive vice president of Devenir, a health care research company.If you live longer, Edelman says you should also count on spending lots of money on travel and recreation, which will add to your health costs.Think you'll play tennis into your 90s? Great. But even the fittest athlete can sprain an ankle. You'll need to make sure you are adequately covered with insurance, which will likely include accumulating ample assets by saving and investing, Edelman says.MORE SECRETS TO SUCCESS:Add Meaning To Your Job By Discovering Your Core ValuesTurn A Vision Into Action By Showing The Way To Achieve ItEnergize Your Organization By Letting The Power FlowSimple Ways To Cut Through Today's Tangle Of Complexity

193,SBUX,"The major indexes hit a little turbulence on Friday, but that doesn't mean compelling chart action is lacking. Your stocks to watch this week are Apple (AAPL), Starbucks (SBUX), Tesla (TSLA), Mobileye (MBLY) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA).Apple is extended about 16% from its cup-with-handle buy point of 118.12, with gains fueled by a strong quarterly report on Feb. 1. When a stock gains 20% past an entry, that's usually a good place to take at least partial profits. And when the market uptrend is under pressure, it can be sensible to sell part of your position at a 15% increase to protect your gains.Starbucks dropped hard after its last earnings report, which included its slowest profit growth in at least five years, but the stock is now looking to form a base. Shares have been able to retake the 50-day moving average and are nearing a shallow double-bottom entry at 59.10. But keep in mind that Starbucks has a weak Relative Strength Rating of 28 out of 99.Tesla sold off in the wake of its quarterly results late Wednesday. That has caused the stock to go on a ""round trip"" after breaking out past an entry at 258.56, which can be deemed as a sell signal. But shares were able to find support at the 250 price level on Friday.Mobileye was hit with bearish comments from short-seller Citron research on Friday. The loss put the stock back in the upper bound of the 5% buy range after clearing a 45.03 handle buy point in strong volume on Feb. 13, but it's still holding up relatively well. When Citron targeted Mobileye back in September 2015, the stock lost 10% for that week.Ulta Beauty has sneaked into buy range past a 274.09 buy point from a flat base, inching up in low volume over the past few weeks. Though the stock is trading near all-time highs, you want to see heavy volume when a stock enters a buy zone — that indicates institutional support.

194,SBUX,"Once the cool new kid, Under Armour (UAA) is now sitting solo at the proverbial high-school cafeteria table after being perceived as getting chummy with the school bully.Following high-profile backlash to seemingly pro-Trump remarks in a recent CNBC interview, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank has since clarified his statement, even taking out a full-page ad in the Baltimore Sun on Wednesday to highlight the company's values, which include equal rights, job creation, and a pro-immigration stance.""We are publicly opposing the travel ban,"" detailed the letter. ""With an anticipated new executive order on immigration set to come out, we will join a coalition of companies in opposition to any new actions that negatively impact our team, their families or our community.""Last week, Plank told CNBC that having a pro-business president was ""a real asset to this country,"" sparking headlines that the Under Armour chief was in favor of Trump, while leaders from Netflix (NFLX), Starbucks (SBUX) and elsewhere have been vocal in criticizing the president's actions, particularly on immigration.Nevertheless, the damage seems to have been done, and according to one analyst, it's going to take a while for the Nike (NKE) rival to shake off its newly acquired bad rap.""Commentary by the CEO in a CNBC interview in a polarized political climate, and pointed response by Stephen Curry, The Rock, and Misty Copeland make it nearly impossible to effectively build a cool urban lifestyle brand in the foreseeable future,"" wrote Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser, referring to the brand's endorsers who have spoken out against Plank's comments.Poser, a longtime bull on Under Armour, has downgraded his rating twice in less than three weeks.Disappointing Q4 results last month spurred Susquehanna's initial cut from positive to neutral, but the latest slash to negative (read: sell) is mostly driven by the ""reputational risk"" that the athletic apparel brand now faces in the wake of those comments.In a report that was written and published prior to seeing Plank's Baltimore Sun letter, Poser also highlighted the high anti-Trump political sentiment at the Grammy Awards on Sunday, noting that Nike and Adidas both ran commercials ""celebrating each brand's relationship to the community.""""It is clear to us and UAA management that Under Armour needs to build its casual and lifestyle business in order to return to historical growth rates,"" said Poser. ""Unfortunately, the brand's cool factor is generally dictated by the style influencers who were likely insulted by CEO Plank's comments, or at least the media's characterization of his comments.""Poser also called for Plank to get ""on air, in person, and fully address the issues facing Under Armour,"" adding that corporate releases lack perceived sincerity.Shares of Under Armour edged up 0.6% to close at 21.89 on the stock market today. Nike shares rose 0.3% to 56.64.IBD's TAKE: Shoppers threatened to boycott Under Armour for Plank's comments. The brand isn't the only retailer finding itself at the center of a Trump-related controversy. Nordstrom and Sears have both made headlines for dropping certain Trump-affiliated items from their product assortments.The Susquehanna analyst also cited challenges in building a lifestyle brand and said Under Armour's $55 hoodies and other items are ""too basic."" He slashed his price target on the stock to 14 from 24.Conversely, Morgan Stanley analyst Jay Sole — a longtime Under Armour bear — on Tuesday upgraded the stock to equal weight from underweight, in light of the lower valuation. He has a 20 price target on Under Armour.""The stock price suggests the market now believes (Under Armour) is a much more mature brand than it previously thought,"" wrote Sole.RELATED:Sears Dumps Some Trump-Branded Goods But Aims To 'Leave The Politics To Others'President Trump Attacks Nordstrom To Defend Daughter's Business

195,SBUX,"U.S. stock indexes refused to roll over Monday afternoon as the indexes found support at their 50-day moving average lines.The Nasdaq composite staged a positive reversal, turning a 1% loss in the first 45 minutes of trade into a nearly 0.3% gain with less than 15 minutes remaining in Monday's wild session. The S&P 500 was down less than 0.1% and the Dow Jones industrial average trimmed its loss to 0.2%.Volume in the stock market today was running sharply higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq compared to the previous session's pace.The Nasdaq, Dow and the S&P 500 each tested and then bounced up from their 50-day lines (please see a daily chart at Investors.com or IBD's premium charting service Marketsmith). The action is considered bullish because it suggests funds are moving in to scoop up apparent bargains.Stocks appeared to be reacting to Friday's failure to repeal and replace ObamaCare. The hospital stock group popped 2% as it headed toward its fourth consecutive gain. Hospitals benefit from the expanded coverage of ObamaCare because it means fewer uninsured patients will be walking away from unpaid bills.Meanwhile, HealthEquity (HQY) dived 7%, touching its 200-day line and then rebounding to erase all of the loss. HealthEquity, a provider of health savings accounts, was expected to benefit from a Republican replacement of ObamaCare. HealthEquity lost 3% Thursday and slid 5% Friday.Banks struggled Monday afternoon, though they did trim some of their losses. Chips were mostly up, but volume was soft.One group that has stayed calm amid the sell-off that began Tuesday is the restaurant group. Panera Bread (PNRA) hit a new high Monday and rallied 1.4% to 253 as it headed toward its seventh daily gain in a row. Analysts expect Panera to grow quarterly earnings 17% in Q1, which would be the best growth in 17 quarters.Other restaurant stocks showing strength: Domino's Pizza (DPZ) held up at its 50-day line; McDonald's (MCD) flirted with a 130.10 buy point; Bob Evans Farms (BOBE) stood firm in a buy zone; Dave & Buster's Entertainment (PLAY) also remains in its 5% buy zone; and Starbucks (SBUX) continued to sketch a flat base that is tighter and shallower than the larger consolidation that began forming almost a year and a half ago.Dave & Busters, a former Leaderboard stock, will report Q4 results after the close on Tuesday. Analysts see profit rising 11% to 59 cents a share, following gains of 51%, 57%, 25% and 108% in the prior four quarters.Another group little damaged in the recent sell-off was the homebuilder group. The group was on track Monday afternoon for its third gain in a row.The put call/volume ratio closed at 1.1 Friday, near the area that sometimes points to a short-term market bottom. But the put call eased to 1.01 Monday afternoon.RELATED:Stocks To Watch In A Tough MarketWhich Stocks Are Hitting New Highs Despite Market Pressure?Stock Market Today: Should Snap Get A Spot On Your Watch List?

197,SBUX,"McDonald's (MCD) plans to offer $2 McCafe drinks and $1 sodas in April, as well as a mobile ordering platform later this year, could come at an opportune time for the burger chain and Dow Jones industrial average component, as Starbucks (SBUX) may be showing signs of losing ground to rivals.Starbucks' U.S. share of foot traffic last month slipped to 11%, from 12% in January, according to restaurant-related data analyzed by marketing firm xAd.In an email, xAd said it was unclear why the slip in foot-traffic share occurred, but said that it may have been due to ""inclement weather or the overall issues with online ordering,"" among other potential factors. The trends were first reported by Bloomberg.The coffee chain has tried to find ways to unknot the longer lines and congestion that it says have resulted from its own mobile order-and-pay program, raising the possibility of logistical challenges to other restaurants that adopt a mobile platform.The McCafe and soda promotion could help McDonald's compete not just with Starbucks but with convenience stores, which account for more than half of restaurant-industry coffee service, according to an RBC Capital Markets research note last month, citing data from the NPD Group.""In our previous notes, we highlighted beverage value as one of the three reasons that we believe McDonald's US same store sales trends can accelerate as the company competes against the expansion of convenience store foodservice and fast casual,"" analyst David Palmer wrote.At a presentation last week, McDonald's said it would launch a mobile order and pay platform in 20,000 restaurants in the U.S. by the end of the year. McDonald's also sees a massive opportunity in delivery, and is exploring its prospects with companies like UberEats and GrubHub (GRUB).Shares of McDonald's rose 5 cents to 128.14 in the stock market today. The stock has recently formed a handle in a cup base, with a buy point of 130.10.Starbucks fell 1% to 55.19, its sixth straight decline. Starbucks undercut its 200-day moving average on Wednesday. Its relative strength line is the weakest in nearly two years, showing how Starbucks has lagged the S&P 500 index.Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) fell 0.8% to 53.61, drifting further away from a 56.23 entry. GrubHub rose 0.6% to 33.57 after falling intraday to its lowest level since late July. Panera Bread (PNRA) rose 0.9% to 235.86, but closed below a 236.35 buy point from a four-weeks-tight pattern after rising intraday to an all-time high.IBD'S TAKE: Domino's Pizza's online ordering platforms have worked so well for the company, and while burgers and fries don't travel as well as pizza does, Jack in the Box customers that get delivery don't seem to be too bothered. The tougher competition comes as discounting efforts appear likely to shift toward drinks. While value deals remained abundant last year amid a slump in food costs, some analysts expect those prices to rebound this year. Restaurants have also struggled with cheaper groceries at grocery stores, which have encouraged people to eat in.But it's still too early to tell if Starbucks is seeing just a blip or something more persistent. From Q3 to Q4, xAd said foot traffic at Starbucks rose 1.3%.Since then, other factors may have contributed to last month's weakness.Starbucks' plan to hire 10,000 refugees over the next five years — announced Jan. 29 after President Trump's attempts to temporarily bar the entry of refugees into the U.S. — appears to have also briefly annoyed some customers.Credit Suisse said in a note Wednesday that ""net sentiment"" data from NetBase showed the coffee chain's hiring decision ""could have upset some customers, perhaps negatively impacting sales trends."" While sentiment remained lethargic for 10 days from late January to early February, it has rebounded but ""seen significant volatility in recent weeks.""RELATED:McDonald's Stock Tests Key Support Levels Amid Turnaround DoubtsWhy It May Be Time To Sell Apple, Tesla; Starbucks Nears Buy PointToo Much Of A Good Thing?

198,SBUX,"Apple (AAPL) has set up a court battle with European Union competition watchdogs who ordered Ireland to claw back a record $13.6 billion in unpaid taxes from the iPhone maker.The U.S. tech giant said Monday it formally appealed the EU's August decision to the EU's General Court in Luxembourg, as the European Commission and Ireland separately published details of their own arguments in the case.In an order that reverberated across the Atlantic, the EU slapped Apple with the multibillion-dollar bill, saying Ireland granted unfair deals that reduced the company's effective corporate tax rate. The U.S. Treasury said the EU was making itself a ""supranational tax authority"" that could threaten global tax reform efforts.The EU ""took unilateral action and retroactively changed the rules, disregarding decades of Irish tax law, U.S. tax law, as well as global consensus on tax policy, that everyone has relied on,"" Apple said in a statement after filing its court appeal.Ireland already has asked the court to strike down the EU's decision from August. In a separate filing on Monday, the Brussels-based commission published details of its two-year probe, attacking the way Irish authorities taxed profits attributed to two of Apple's Irish units.The EU also took aim at Irish tax practices, saying they were ""too inconsistent"" to set firm rules for profit allocation.The Apple investigation and others probing arrangements for Amazon.com (AMZN) and McDonald's (MCD) in Luxembourg are the cornerstone of an EU attack on national practices it claims help multinational companies avoid taxation.EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has repeatedly argued that special tax treatment harms companies that don't get such advantages.According to Monday's EU filing, regulators shrugged off claims that they weren't fair to Ireland and Apple during the probe. They argued that they always respected their procedural rights and the subject matter of the investigation — profit allocation methods used in tax rulings — never changed.Ireland had ""ample opportunity"" to express its views and ""made use of that opportunity on multiple occasions,"" the EU said. While Apple only had the right to submit observations, it ""was given and has effectively made use of the opportunity to submit"" views to regulators on numerous occasions, according to the text of the EU decision.The EU's competition arm said it doubted that the methods used to produce taxable profit for Apple units complied with the so-called arm's-length principle for transfers between parts of a company.Ireland said the EU exceeded its powers by ruling on its tax jurisdiction, according to an Irish finance ministry statement on Monday.Ireland also challenges the EU's determination that Apple allocated almost all its European sales profits to what the EU said were ""head offices"" not subject to tax by virtue of their tax status in Ireland. Apple argues the units, Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe, were never exempt from taxation — and that under the law they are subject to deferred U.S. taxation.""These branches carried out routine functions, but all important decisions within ASI and AOE were made in the U.S., and the profits deriving from these decisions were not properly attributable to the Irish branches of ASI and AOE,"" the Irish finance ministry said.The court appeals filed by Apple and Ireland follow those already pending by Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Belgium concerning tax arrangements the nations granted to units of other multinationals, including Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)Though Apple will have to pay its tax bill within weeks, the money will be held in escrow. A final ruling from the EU courts may take several years.

201,SBUX,"With work such an integral part of people's lives; why not make it better for yourself and others?That's from Richard Moran, author of ""The Thing About Work: Showing Up and Other Important Matters."" A venture capitalist and consultant to Fortune 500 companies, Moran currently serves as president of Menlo College in Atherton, Calif.Evan Carmichael, author of ""Your One Word: The Powerful Secret to Creating a Business and Life That Matters,"" said that many people ""want to spend their time doing more meaningful work, but they can't define what that meaningful work looks like. They want to be a part of something great, but they don't actually believe that they have greatness within them.""Tips for upping your career status quo:Mine for gold. Carmichael, an acclaimed global business speaker, says start by asking yourself: What makes you happy?An exercise he suggests: Find a common theme between what your favorite movie is, who your favorite boss is, and the activities that make you feel most alive. Similarly, if need be, make a list of everything and everyone that makes you unhappy, and find what binds them together in order to articulate what the opposite is.He says finding your one word, one core value, one most important belief is ""the path to self-awareness, standing for something important, and breaking the chains of mediocrity in all areas of your life and business.""Carmichael's one word? ""Believe.""Sell yourself. People want to know what you stand for and what kind of company you are before they buy from you, Carmichael says.""Lead with the mission,"" he added. ""Lead with your why. Lead with your values. … Customers will come to you, buy more, and refer their friends because you're making them feel like they are a part of an important mission as well. That's 'core selling.' ""Follow through. Making a to-do list is not the same as getting things done, Moran points out.""Success in any organization is determined more by implementation, not planning,"" he states. ""There is no contest to win by having a long 'to-do list.' Pay attention to the 'done list.' ""Also, don't fall into the trap of getting things accomplished that don't matter as much, at the expense of what actually does.Stay relevant. Availability is not a skill, Moran says.""Just because you are available does not mean you are going to get snapped up into a new and rewarding career,"" he continued. ""Always be current in skills and be ready to change as the skills in demand change.""Be proactive. Carmichael offers this perspective for when you want to shake things up: ""Everything in your environment holds you exactly where you are."" This can mean your entire routine, including the way you think, what influences you and the people you hang out with.Make changes when need be. As futurist Alvin Toffler said, ""Change is not merely necessary to life, it is life.""Accomplish the basics. Just as losing weight is fundamentally about eating right and getting exercise, Moran says, success in business is fundamentally about ""setting a strategy, executing on the strategy and measuring results.""Make real face-time. People today, especially, can work from home, a local Starbucks (SBUX), or even out of the trunk of their car, Moran says, but the boss or your colleagues still need to know who you are.""One of the best parts of work is the relationships we develop,"" Moran said. ""Show up. Have coffee with colleagues. Go to the holiday party.""Forge ahead regardless. Moran writes that Bob Noyce was 41 when he founded Intel (INTC), John Pemberton 55 when he invented Coca-Cola (KO), Colonel Sanders 65 when he founded KFC (YUM).""So for all of you thinking of something big, of making a change, of starting something, the world has not passed you by,"" Moran wrote. ""Your ideas are still worthy. It is never too late.""As the Chinese proverb proclaims, `The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is today.'

202,SBUX,"Payments firm Square (SQ) pared its losses and saw revenue rise a better-than-expected 21% year over year despite the end of its partnership with Starbucks (SBUX), with its Q4 earnings results posted after the market close Wednesday. Shares rose late.Square said Q4 would include just nominal revenue from coffee chain Starbucks. Square in late 2015 disclosed its payments-processing agreement, which had been unprofitable, with the chain would be ending. But Square's platform is popular with small businesses. The San Francisco-based company makes credit card readers that plug into mobile phones and tablets, making it easy for even the smallest businesses to accept credit payments. And it's expanded into providing bank loans and financing to small businesses via its Square Capital unit.Late last year, Square co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey, who also is co-founder and CEO of Twitter (TWTR), said its Square Cash mobile app would be integrated with Apple's (AAPL) Apple Pay.Wall Street Q4, Q1 estimates: Analysts expect Square to post a per-share loss of 9 cents, vs. a 20-cent loss in Q4 2015.  The year-earlier loss excludes the impact of the deemed stock

204,SBUX,"The office, in lower Manhattan, has all the markings of a tech startup. There are high ceilings and a cool warehouse vibe, craft beer is on tap in the kitchen, and the place is buzzing with twentysomethings.But they aren't trying to make the next hit mobile app. The big idea here is to disrupt another ubiquitous product.""There were so many evolutions in technology, but underwear was stuck in, like, the early 1900s,'' said Tom Patterson, founder of Tommy John, which makes premium skivvies for men. ""It was a very sleepy category.""Tommy John is part of a growing drive by fledgling brands to get men to rethink underwear and pay more for it.It isn't easy. The $8 billion category has long been an afterthought. Many guys restocked only after ridicule from a significant other, or when disintegration could no longer be denied. Thanks to fellow upstarts such as Mack Weldon, guys are giving this everyday item more consideration.Skivvies ranging from $25 to $70 a pair now come with a list of features as long as those that once came with lawnmowers and television sets. They are ""game-changing products,"" with moisture control, cool zones, and stealth waistbands. They can be Swiss-made, breathable, anti-microbial, and anti-odor. Tommy John even reconfigured the front flap and developed a ""Quick Draw"" fly for easier access.All this has boosted spending. In the past three years, the average price for a pair of underwear in the U.S. has risen by a third, while prices for men's apparel overall have declined by about the same amount, according to research by Fung Global & Retail Technology and First Insight. Global sales are expected to increase from $8.4 billion in 2015 to $11 billion by 2020, according to Persistence Market Research.The disruption is a testament to the power of ""premiumization,"" a strategy that over the past decade has swept through many once-mundane categories.While many take it for granted, there was a time when grocery stores didn't have a dozen kinds of coffee. When the only consideration for buying ground beef was price, not what the cows ate. When a workout shirt was a cheap basic, far from the innovation story shoppers pay more for today. People never used to talk about how much they loved such things as water bottles and blenders.Now men's underwear, of all things, is being transformed.Premiumization is all about resetting expectations with additional choices and benefits. Under Armour (UAA) revolutionized workout gear with polyester shirts that made sweat evaporate better than cotton did. Starbucks (SBUX) became a behemoth by introducing a slew of new tastes and styles to America's coffee drinkers, whose choices had stopped at sugar, milk or cream.""Because this happened, it doesn't mean everything will be disrupted,"" said Adam Burgoon, a partner at investment fund KarpReilly, which owns a stake in Mack Weldon. The size of the market for such refashioned underwear remains to be seen, Burgoon said, because many guys are likely to balk at the price. ""But it means probably everything can be disrupted,"" he said.Men's underwear was especially ready for a change. Not only was it largely devoid of innovation, such industry leaders as Calvin Klein were mostly focused on winning over women, because they bought most of the underwear.It was primarily a fashion business with a buffet of patterns and colors. The marketing featured images like Calvin Klein's buff young Mark Walhberg up on billboards, and packaging showing expressionless youngsters with six-pack abs.Yet men were settling down later in life, and so doing more shopping on their own in the interim. Being single longer made them care more about their appearance, which has disrupted other categories, such as skin care and jeans. The underwear startups' marketing is more approachable. Some of it uses middle-aged models and pushes fun and honesty over sexy slickness.""I never really related to traditional underwear advertising,'' said Patterson, the Tommy John founder. ""It was too serious. It was weird. We just say it like it is. We're the first brand to have a no-wedgie guarantee. You're not supposed to talk about wedgies with underwear. The fact of the matter is that 100% of men get a wedgie at some point in their lives.""Patterson got the idea for Tommy John last decade, from a much different place than sexy. While wearing a suit as a medical-device salesman, he found his underwear was even more uncomfortable than usual. He set about to solve a problem, not to go wild with beefcake and polka dots.The early years were difficult. Direct selling on the web wasn't as viable, so he had to pitch department-store buyers, who were mostly women. Patterson's break came in 2009, when he won over Neiman Marcus by getting the woman who ran the underwear department to let her husband and male colleagues test his product.From there, the idea of selling men's underwear to men gained steam and has exploded in recent years. There's been a rush of startups, helped by lower barriers to entry. Sourcing from Asia has never been easier, and the internet has slashed marketing costs. That has allowed brands like Mack Weldon to sell only directly, through its website.Today, a majority of men's underwear is purchased by men, a reversal from a decade ago. Amid a dizzying number of choices, men are indulging: Tommy John and Mack Weldon each more than doubled sales last year.Young brands are also going beyond products and revamping how items are purchased. New York-based Basic Outfitters offers a ''create-a-drawer'' option that makes things really easy for guys by offering underwear, socks, undershirts, and joggers in one package for $60.""Men really are rethinking what they want,'' said Matthew Congdon, Mack Weldon's creative director and former top underwear designer for Calvin Klein. It used to be about ""an oversize logo or a slicker pattern or print,"" he said. ""Now it's about innovation, the fit, the fabric, and the waistband. Something that is for him.""

205,SBUX,"Yum Brands (YUM), the parent of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, reported fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.Estimates: EPS was expected to rise 9% to 74 cents. Revenue was seen to sinking 47% to $2.09 billion, reflecting the absence of recently spun-off Yum China (YUMC).Results: EPS excluding various items rose to 79 cents. Revenue was $2.02 billion, a 2% gain based on continuing operations. Same-store sales rose just 1% vs. forecasts for about 2%. Taco Bell and KFC comps grew 3%, but Pizza Hut comps slid 2%.Yum CEO Greg Creed said that Pizza Hut's results were ""disappointing and not acceptable,"" adding that Yum is bringing in outside experts to study the brand.Stock: Shares rose 1.2% to 67.39 on the stock market today, after inching into buy range on Tuesday in weaker-than-average volume. The entry point is 66.36.Now that Yum Brands has offloaded its China business, Taco Bell could draw more of Wall Street's attention, Cowen & Co. noted recently.Cowen recently called the taco chain ""the crown jewel of Yum's portfolio"" that balanced ""tactical value with menu innovation to navigate a challenging quick-service backdrop.""Throughout last year, restaurants' financial results got hit by competitive discounting, bad weather, election-related anxieties and lower prices at grocery stores. Some chains also saw sales slow at the end of December, possibly because fewer people went out shopping during the holidays, Cowen said.Pizza Hut, meanwhile, has struggled to compete with the likes of Domino's Pizza (DPZ).IBD'S TAKE: The fast-food and tech worlds are colliding.

207,SBUX,"The U.S. economy added 178,000 jobs in November as the unemployment rate fell to 4.6%, the lowest since 2007, the Labor Department said Friday morning.Economists had expected a gain of 170,000 jobs and an unchanged 4.9% jobless rate.Employers in professional and business services added 63,000 jobs, while health care sector employment rose by 28,000 and construction 19,000. Manufacturing shed 4,000 jobs.October payroll growth was revised down by 19,000 to 142,000, but that was largely offset by an upward revision to September's job gain of 17,000 to 208,000.The unemployment rate fell in large part because the labor force participation rate fell for a second straight month, dropping to 62.7% from 62.9% in September, based on the monthly survey of households.Meanwhile, average hourly wages rose 2.5% from a year ago, down from the 2.8% rate in October, easing concerns about upward wage pressures. Hourly wages reported by employers fell 0.1% vs. October.Treasury yields dipped after the report. The major market averages were mixed in morning trade on the stock market today, not that different from before 8:30 a.m. ET release. Still, Treasury yields have been surging since Election Day on prospects for tax cuts and infrastructure spending, which could stimulate both faster growth and inflation.A rate hike when the Fed meets on Dec. 14 is seen as a slam dunk. The real question for investors is whether the Fed, which has telegraphed two additional quarter-point rate hikes in 2017 and three in 2018 will have to step up the pace.Even with the jobless rate sinking, it's hard to draw firm conclusions based on Friday's report. The real questions are whether the drop in participation and October's drop in hourly wages are statistical noise.Over the past two months, the household survey shows the ranks of the employed have climbed by a total of 117,000, while the civilian labor force has shrunk by 421,000, meaning the ranks of the unemployed have fallen by 538,000. Still, participation was up by more than 2.1 million from a year ago.Meanwhile, there's little evidence to support a sudden drop-off in wage growth. That runs counter to what companies are saying in their earnings calls, and some economists said they suspect the weak number was a statistical quirk.The worry down the line is that increasing wage pressure will flow through to inflation and force the Fed's hand. November's jobs report shows that's not an imminent concern, but it's still one to watch.Starbucks (SBUX), which gave a wage hike of at least 5% to every barista and manager at all of its U.S. stores that took effect in October, hiked prices in July after announcing the increase.McDonald's (MCD), which announced in 2015 that it would raise its minimum wage at company-operated stores to $10 over two years, has been raising prices faster than the industry as a whole, Fitch Ratings said last month.Fiesta Restaurant Group (FRGI), whose Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana chains are in Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, told analysts on a Nov. 7 earnings call that wage growth has picked up from 3% and would likely range from 3% to 5% in 2017.IBD'S TAKE: The Trump rally could be entering a period of consolidation as markets assess what the president-elect's tax cuts and infrastructure spending will lift earnings and inflation. Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market trend and visit IBD University for a primer on how that trend should influence investing decisions.The Fed's latest anecdotal report on economic conditions released on Wednesday said that among the 12 Federal Reserve districts seven reported a tightening of labor market conditions, including Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis and Dallas.A Boston respondent to the Fed survey indicated that ""eight out of ten potential hourly hires either cannot pass a drug test or cannot pass a simple math test.""Construction firms in Atlanta noted that difficulty finding qualified workers was resulting in project delays, while others noted a nursing shortage.""In response to the challenges finding workers, a number of firms continued to engage in partnerships with community colleges and workforce development organizations to develop customized training programs and internship opportunities, or to invest in automation to replace difficult-to-fill jobs,"" the Atlanta Fed district write-up said.How all this will play out isn't yet clear. Productivity gains could alleviate some of the wage pressures and the need for price increases.

208,SBUX,"The U.S. economy likely added 175,000 jobs last month as the unemployment rate held steady at 4.9%, Wall Street economists are estimating ahead of Friday's employment report out at 8:30 a.m. ET.The economy has a bit of momentum, the Federal Reserve is set to hike rates in two weeks and nothing in Friday's jobs report can possibly change that.The real issue for markets is all about expectations. Investors are beginning to assess what the Trump fiscal package of tax cuts and infrastructure spending means for growth as well as inflation in 2017 and beyond. In other words, investors want their cake and the punch to wash it down, but there's some concern that upward pressure on prices might lead the Fed to start taking the punch away with faster-than-expected rate hikes.That potential fly in the ointment means that one question matters more than any other in every single jobs report from here on out: How tight is the market for labor?IBD'S TAKE: Here's why wage growth may be about to take off, though markets may not love it.The clearest answer will come from the pace of average hourly wage growth, which accelerated to a cycle high 2.8% from a year ago in October. Higher wages tend to feed through at least partly to higher prices.Starbucks (SBUX), which gave a wage hike of at least 5% to every barista and manager at all of its U.S. stores that took effect in October, hiked prices in July after announcing the increase.McDonald's (MCD), which announced in 2015 that it would raise its minimum wage at company-operated stores to $10 over two years, has been raising prices faster than the industry as a whole, Fitch Ratings said last month.Fiesta Restaurant Group (FRGI), whose Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana chains are in Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, told analysts on a Nov. 7 earnings call that wage growth has picked up from 3% and would likely range from 3% to 5% in 2017.The Fed's latest anecdotal report on economic conditions released on Wednesday said that among the 12 Federal Reserve districts seven reported a tightening of labor market conditions, including Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis and Dallas.A Boston respondent to the Fed survey indicated that ""eight out of ten potential hourly hires either cannot pass a drug test or cannot pass a simple math test.""Construction firms in Atlanta noted that difficulty finding qualified workers was resulting in project delays, while others noted a nursing shortage.""In response to the challenges finding workers, a number of firms continued to engage in partnerships with community colleges and workforce development organizations to develop customized training programs and internship opportunities, or to invest in automation to replace difficult-to-fill jobs,"" the Atlanta Fed district write-up said.How all this will play out isn't yet clear. Productivity gains could alleviate some of the wage pressures and the need for price increases.

209,SBUX,"After riding a wave of working-class support to the White House, Donald Trump is hanging ten in Indiana today, celebrating the neat trick he pulled off in getting Carrier, a unit of United Technologies (UTX), to keep nearly 1,000 jobs that were headed for Mexico.But the big question is what Trump and the GOP will do for an encore. In particular, how will they pull off corporate tax reform that's in tune with their populist moment?The path for tax reform put forward by House Speaker Paul Ryan and fellow House Republicans would appear — at least at first blush — to offer a clear answer: taxing imports but not exports, in a reversal of current policy that imposes corporate income taxes on exporters but not overseas producers with goods bound for the U.S.Proponents go so far as to suggest that this is a neat way for Trump to shift the tide of trade without provoking a trade war by slapping punitive tariffs on goods from China and Mexico.While the economic impact of the proposal is much more complicated, the immediate fate of the House GOP tax reform may rest on what Trump's working-class supporters find more alarming: anti-competitive U.S. tax policy or higher prices at Wal-Mart (WMT).The National Retail Federation has begun sounding the alarm about the House GOP plan released in June, when a clean sweep in the election for Republicans seemed like a distant long shot.Here's why retailers are girding for a fight: While cutting the statutory corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%, the House plan would no longer allow businesses to deduct the cost of imports from taxes. That means retailers such as Wal-Mart, Amazon (AMZN), Costco (COST), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Starbucks (SBUX) would have to pay a tax equal to 20% of the cost of the clothing, televisions, toys and coffee they import.Because retail profit margins are generally in the low single digits, retailers that sell a lot of imported goods would have to pass those taxes onto customers to maintain their profitability.IBD'S TAKE: Donald Trump made a lot of promises during the campaign. Here's what President Trump could accomplish in his first 100 days.It's not clear whether Trump is on board with the House plan. His own plan called for cutting the corporate tax rate to 15%, low enough that corporations wouldn't go out of their way to avoid U.S. taxes.Yet, it's important to understand the House proposal to grasp the direction and limits of the tax reform effort on which the GOP is about to embark.Here are six key points:The U.S. corporate tax system is a mess and definitely needs fixing. The clearest evidence is that U.S. companies such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are holding more than $2 trillion in profits overseas to avoid taxation in the U.S.The House wants to tax profits where goods and intellectual property are sold, rather than where profits are earned, which is a much fuzzier concept that's vulnerable to gaming. For example, companies have an incentive to overstate costs incurred by domestic operations to reduce their U.S. tax bills, shifting more profits to overseas subsidiaries, where they'll be taxed at a lower rate.For years, Republicans have talked about shifting the U.S. to such a territorial system, where the U.S. no longer taxes foreign earnings, but Democrats have warned that such a move could increase the incentive for offshoring. Ryan & fellow Republicans would avoid such an outcome by changing the tax code to keep companies from deducting the value of imports from their new, lower 20% income tax rate.There's another big reason, beside protecting U.S. producers, that the House GOP relied on this indirect tax on imports: the budget. The conservative Tax Foundation estimates that this border adjustment of corporate taxes would raise $1.1 trillion over 10 years, a huge sum that helps offset the cost of lowering the corporate tax rate. Unless the GOP can get eight Senate Democrats on board, which is doubtful, a tax package passed via reconciliation will have to be deficit-neutral beyond 10 years, so offsets are needed to make the U.S. tax code more competitive.Although it seems logical that hiking taxes on imports and reducing taxes on exports could shift the balance of trade, economists say that won't happen, at least not on a sustained basis. If the U.S. starts running a lower trade deficit due to tax policy, the value of the dollar would rise relative to other currencies, negating any advantage gained. Further, assuming currencies adjust as the change is phased in, the impact on retailers and their customers would be far less than feared.Still, economists generally favor a reform that taxes consumption where goods are sold and expect a payoff from less tax evasion. But there's a big question about whether the House GOP tax reform would comply with World Trade Organization rules. University of Maryland professor Peter Morici, who served as chief economist at the U.S. International Trade Commission, tells IBD that the House plan seems to violate WTO rules requiring nondiscrimination in the tax treatment of imports relative to domestic goods. While the outcome can't be known until a trade case is litigated, other analysts have also raised questions. Morici thinks Republicans would be wise to adopt a value-added tax instead, while junking the corporate income tax, but no one in the GOP is willing to go there.RELATED:Trump's Latest Twitter Win: Carrier To Keep Nearly 1,000 Jobs At Indiana PlantAs Trumpnomics Cheers Wall Street, Economists Fret

214,SBUX,"X Starbucks (SBUX) missed both fiscal first-quarter revenue and U.S. same-store sales forecasts, logged the slowest profit growth in five years, and cut revenue guidance when it reported after the close Thursday. Notably, its own mobile payment advancements weighed on U.S. performance during the holiday period.Comparable sales in the U.S., a much-watched metric, grew only 3%, less than many analyst estimates for 4%. Transactions fell 2% from the prior-year quarter, though the customers who did stop by spent 5% more per order, on average.Starbucks is generally hailed as being miles ahead of its peers technologically, but that doesn't mean the coffee shop chain doesn't occasionally encounter speed bumps along the way.Management said that the popularity of its relatively new ""Mobile Order and Pay"" function, which rolled out nationwide in the fall of 2015, created an ""operational challenge"" in stores by congesting pick-up points. The app-based tool allows customers to order online and pick up their purchases in person.There were twice as many stores in Q1 that logged more than 20% of their transactions through mobile order-and-pay during peak periods. The feature made up 7% of U.S. company-operated transactions in Q1, up from 3% a year earlier.The company said it is exploring solutions to its in-store bottleneck issues.Shares were down 4.5% in late trade after closing down 0.4% to 58.46 on the stock market today. Starbucks is forming a saucer-with-handle base with 59.64 entry point, though there are a few technical points to note about this analysis.IBD'S TAKE: Starbucks is not the only restaurant stock nearing a buy point. Here are the other four.In Q1, the company recorded 13% profit growth to 52 cents, in line with estimates, on 7% revenue growth to $5.73 billion vs. views for $5.85 billion.

215,SBUX,"Financial markets didn't skip a beat last week as reports emerged that President Trump would sign a new order on Friday blocking citizens of Iran and six other predominantly Muslim nations from traveling to the U.S.But it's not surprising that stocks woke up on the wrong side of the bed on Monday after the messy rollout of a policy that temporarily invalidated green cards, stranded hundreds of travelers at airports, sparked large protests and drew condemnation from countries around the world.American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL) led a downdraft among airline stocks after airport protests that didn't exactly present the most inviting picture to welcome travelers. Delta was itself a big part of the news coverage after Trump tweeted that the company's technological snafu that grounded flights was the real cause of weekend chaos at airports.Apple (AAPL) and Starbucks (SBUX) were among the U.S. companies that tried to distance themselves from the policy. Chief Executive Tim Cook said Apple ""would not exist without immigration,"" since Steve Jobs' father came from Syria, target of Trump's indefinite refugee ban.Starbucks committed to hiring 10,000 refugees in the next five years in the 75 countries where it does business. Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google said it's putting up $2 million for groups including the American Civil Liberties Union that work to secure legal protections for immigrants and refugees.Companies have reason to be worried about the symbolism and the real impact on some foreign-born employees. For investors, the moves may lower confidence that Trump will be able to execute his agenda of tax cuts and infrastructure spending that have fueled the market's postelection rally.IBD'S TAKE: If the WTO found the border tax to be illegal, the GOP would face three difficult choices that could throw the ruling party into crisis.Google said it recalled workers on H-1B visas from targeted countries amid concern that they wouldn't be able to return to the U.S. under Trump's order. Now tech companies, in particular, are bracing for another executive order on reform to the H-1B program that provides visas to workers in specialized occupations. Shares of computer services firms including Wipro (WIP) and Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) were under pressure on Monday.For the broad market, the bigger concern is that Trump may be alienating those who he will need to deliver on his agenda. Above all, he'll need the support of at least 49 of 52 Senate Republicans to pass corporate tax reform, which is shaping up to be a contentious battle. The White House is signaling support of House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan for a border-adjusted tax that big importers like Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) are gearing up to fight.While few GOP senators have taken a position on the House approach, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., tweeted that anything that slaps a border tax on Corona would be ""mucho sad."" After Graham and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., criticized Trump's immigration order for making America less safe, Trump lashed out with his own tweet, calling the two ""sadly weak on immigration.""Bloomberg News reported over the weekend that the White House now views the House border-tax plan favorably, calling it the ""most nationalist"" way to reform the corporate tax code. Yet, assuming Trump can find the votes to pass it, the big corporate tax cut could end up backfiring if the World Trade Organization rules that it is illegal, as many experts expect it to do. With Trump praising Brexit, dissing the European Union, sparring with Mexico and bellowing ""America First,"" the chances that the WTO will give America the benefit of any doubt are looking increasingly unlikely.It's not yet clear if Trump's infrastructure package will need Democratic votes to pass, but the wildly anti-Trump sentiment on the left makes it harder for Democratic lawmakers to meet him halfway. At the moment the opposition party is setting a high hurdle for Trump to win their support, laying out their own $1 trillion government-funded package that bares little resemblance to the White House approach of offering $137 billion worth of tax credits as an incentive for the private sector to undertake massive infrastructure projects.All of these challenges come on top of huge uncertainty and disagreement among Republicans about their first order of business: Repealing ObamaCare on a party-line vote and then, somehow, figuring out to replace it without blowing up the individual insurance market.RELATED:Trump Tax Fears: Wal-Mart, Target, Macy's Hit New LowsTrump Wall Stocks Caterpillar, Materials Firms Breaking Out

219,SBUX,"Starbucks (SBUX) shares haven't been anything to write home about over the last year or so but have still managed to carve out a base, and fiscal first-quarter earnings late Thursday could provide enough of a jolt to send the stock into buy range.Wall Street analysts are expecting 13% profit growth — the slowest in five years — to 52 cents a share on 9% sales growth to $5.85 billion. The relatively weak profit gain comes as traffic at brick-and-mortar retailers, which are often adjacent to Starbucks locations, is losing more ground to e-commerce, pushing the company to expand its upscale offerings.""Our question is whether the company can overcome the natural erosion of traffic across retail (discussed in length at the Dec. 7 analyst day) or whether pricing efforts around premiumization are possibly too aggressive,"" wrote Buckingham Research Group analyst John Zolidis on Tuesday.While same-store sales managed to match forecasts last quarter, that metric in the U.S. has in recent quarters gotten a lukewarm reception on the Street.Wedbush's Nick Setyan said he expects ""sustained comp momentum"" in the Americas segment, while RBC Capital Markets' David Palmer said comps have been improving through the quarter. Zolidis, Setyan and Palmer are all estimating 4% in same-store sales for Q1. In Q4, Starbucks had global comp growth of 4%, and 5% in the Americas.At an investor day last month, COO Kevin Johnson said cold drinks, lunch offerings and continued digital and mobile efforts are three core comp drivers going forward.Shares ended trading up 0.4% at 58.70 on the stock market today, closing in on a 59.64 entry in a saucer-with-handle base. Investors should note a few technical points on this technical analysis. If you look at Starbucks' chart as a base going back to Oct. 30, then the midpoint of the handle is fractionally lower than the midpoint of the consolidation. But, using the 52-week high set in April, the handle — and 59.64 buy point  — are valid.McDonald's (MCD), which has tried to regain some coffee drinkers from Starbucks, was up 0.6% to 121.79, staying above its 50-day and 200-day lines. McDonald's dipped Monday after reporting Q4 results that topped views but indicated momentum from its menu revamp was fading.Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) finished up 0.5% to 52.01.IBD'S TAKE: Buying and selling stocks ahead of a company's earnings announcement can be dicey, but options plays on Swing Trader offer a way to at least cap the risk while still participating in the potential upside.Howard Schultz, who is handing over the CEO reins to Johnson in April, will be focusing on the rollout of the more premium Starbucks Roastery and Starbucks Reserve locations amid what he calls as ""over-retailed"" American consumer environment. Schultz envisions 20 to 30 ""really grand"" Roastery hot spots and a big fleet of smaller premium Reserve locations.The company's current five-year plan includes 10% revenue growth, 15%-20% profit growth, mid-single-digit annual same-store sales gains and 12,000 more locations globally.Aggressive growth plans in China mean that we can expect to see twice as many Starbucks in the country — around 5,000 — by 2021, which the company expects will nearly triple the segment's revenue and operating income.But some initiatives have proved short-lived. The Seattle Times reported earlier in the month that Starbucks planned to close its ""Evenings"" offerings on Jan. 10 amid the buildout of the new premium locations. The program attempted to turn nearly 440 U.S. coffee shops into more after-work-friendly destinations with wine, beer and small plates. (The new premium locations will offer spirits.)RELATED:Starbucks CEO Says U.S. 'Over-Retailed,' Plans To Add 12,000 StoresWhat To Expect From Starbucks' CEO Shuffle — Shaky Or Seamless?Starbucks' Schultz To Step Down As CEO; No Other Leadership Change Seen

Starbucks shares fell 4% on Friday. Meanwhile, McDonald's (MCD) topped EPS and sales targets but U.S. comps fell as investors questioned if the momentum from the all-day breakfast menu has run out.

229,SBUX,"The broadest, most timely indicator of the health of the job market just started flashing yellow.Over the past four weeks, total federal income and employment taxes withheld from workers' paychecks grew just 2.4% from a year ago, according to the Treasury Department, a rate signaling that job market and income gains may have just hit an air pocket.Generally, tax withholdings should grow at least as fast as payroll jobs (1.7% over the past year) plus wage gains (2.4% in the latest employment report), meaning more than 4% at present.Tax receipts can come in a bit lumpy, so it's too soon to panic. But the Treasury data reinforce concerning details in the Labor Department's August jobs report that were largely overlooked by markets.The problem wasn't so much that job growth decelerated or that wage gains also slowed, but that both of those things happened even as the average workweek shrank to its shortest length since the economy was still getting back on its feet in 2011 (unless you count two blizzard-hit months in the winter of 2013-14 when the workweek was equally short).The Labor Department showed aggregate weekly payrolls, essentially the sum total of private-sector pay earned in a week, grew just 3.5% from a year ago in August, the weakest gain since September 2010. (The 3.5% gain matched the level seen in an unusually stormy December of 2013.)During the first half of 2015, withheld taxes were rising at a 5%-6% rate from a year ago, but growth gradually slowed in the second half of the year, then took a dive early in 2016 amid financial market tumult set off by concerns over China's economy and Federal Reserve tightening.Yet income trends were looking solid just a month ago, helped along by wage hikes for JPMorgan Chase (JPM) tellers, Starbucks (SBUX) baristas and Wal-Mart (WMT) cashiers.To get a sense of just how weak the latest data are, consider this: During the heart of the last economic expansion, from 2005 to 2007, withheld taxes steadily grew more than 7% from a year ago. But withheld taxes over the past month were up just 6.8% from the same month two years ago, in 2014.IBD'S TAKE: The Federal Reserve doesn't seem to know what to make of the economy, and markets don't know what to make of the Fed. The best way to make sense of what Fed policy means for markets and for timing stock purchases is to understand the market's prevailing trend. Visit IBD University for a primer and read IBD's The Big Picture each day to stay up to date.So if the data are sending a reasonably accurate picture, what might explain the softening income trend? Again, the weaker income gains seem to be connected to a shorter workweek. It's possible that the failure of the economy to get much momentum means that companies hired too much and are now curtailing schedules.The Obama administration's overtime rule, set to take effect in December, also may be leading companies to cut hours. Right now there aren't any clear answers, but when both the jobs report and tax data signal weakness, it's worth paying close attention.RELATED:The Fed's Real Dilemma Wednesday And How It May Disappoint MarketsBank Of Japan Keeps -0.1% Rate, Sets Bond Yield Target

230,SBUX,"Stocks opened higher Wednesday, but faded to return to narrowly mixed following three straight sessions of sizable moves.The Dow industrials and S&P 500 rose 0.1% after briefly turning negative. The Nasdaq climbed 0.4%.Overseas markets largely resisted Tuesday's sell-off in the U.S., which dragged the Nasdaq back to finish just above its 50-day moving average and turned the S&P 500's 50-day line into a level of resistance. Markets in China and Japan ended down less than 1%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slipped only 0.1%.  Europe's markets turned mixed moving into afternoon trade. London's FTSE 100 and Frankfurt's DAX were up 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively. The CAC 40 in Paris dipped 0.2%.Oil futures reversed early gains and slipped nearly 1% lower, pressing West Texas Intermediate back below $45 a barrel. The benchmark traded 6% below Friday's high, and 14% above its low from early August. Gold prices were a fraction higher, near $1,326 an ounce.  The dollar was narrowly mixed.  Bonds edged up, trimming 2 basis points from the 10-year-Treasury yield, at 1.71%.Apple (AAPL) rose nearly 3% to 110.93. That's a five-month high as the tech titan consolidates in a cup-with-handle base.Acacia Communications (ACIA), an IBD 50 stock, climbed more than 1%. The maker of fiber optic networking gear slumped more than 5% Tuesday.IBD 50 peer Nvidia (NVDA) pared early gains. On Tuesday, Nvidia introduced an artificial intelligence computer designed for use in self-driving cars being developed by China's Baidu (BIDU).  Nvidia is in a buy range following a rebound from support at its 50-day moving average.Monsanto (MON) edged up 0.7% after announcing it had agreed to a $57 billion takeover offer from Germany's Bayer (BAYRY). The Monsanto-Bayer merger, valued at $66 billion including debt, still faces scrutiny from U.S. and European regulators, which may explain Monsanto's muted response. Bayer's stock rose 4% in early trading.Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) soared 23%.

231,SBUX,"October's 2.8% annual rise in average hourly wages was the best since 2009, but it's a safe bet that the pace of wage gains will keep rising in coming months, likely by a good amount.That may dent the market's confidence that the Federal Reserve, after hiking rates next month, will stay on hold until the very end of 2017.There are three reasons why a further pickup is pretty much baked in the cake:First, labor markets are getting tighter and the competition for good workers is heating up.Starbucks (SBUX) on Oct. 3 gave a wage hike of at least 5% to every barista and manager at all of its U.S. stores. In July, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon announced that the company would boost the minimum wage for 18,000 tellers and customer-service workers from $10.15 to $12 over two years.On an Oct. 26 conference call, Panera Bread (PNRA) said average associate wages rose 5% in the third quarter, both to ""effectively compete for talent"" and keep up with higher minimum wages. Panera CFO Michael Bufano went so far as to call the level of wage inflation ""unprecedented"" and noted that the company raised bakery prices 2.4% during the quarter to offset cost increases, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.Second, average hourly wages have been rising at a 3.1% annual rate over the past six months and even faster over the past three months, 3.3%. In other words, monthly wage growth would have to slow to keep the annual rate of increase from rising significantly.Third, wage growth went through a slump in late 2015 and early 2016, so the weak comparison is likely to make the wage acceleration look even stronger than the underlying trend. In particularly, the three-month pace of wage growth fell to 1.9% in December 2015 and again in February 2016.Then, at the end of February, Wal-Mart (WMT) boosted wages by $1.5 billion, and Target (TGT) and Costco (COST) quickly followed with wage hikes of their own.IBD'S TAKE: The best stocks tend to have margins that are high relative to those of rivals and that are steady or growing, so look for companies that have the pricing power to withstand rising wages.

Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see how your stocks rate.Markets took the news in stride on Friday that average hourly wages accelerated, with the 10-year Treasury yield and U.S. dollar index both losing ground. Yet it's hard to tell what's driving markets at the moment, in particular whether Donald Trump's revived presidential hopes are trumping other market-moving news.On Friday, Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Dennis Lockhart said he was ""open to running the economy hot"" to heal the labor market, but that's not yet a consensus view.Lockhart also said that ""turmoil around the election"" could interfere with December rate-hike plans.In September, when the Fed signaled that a December rate hike was coming, the median projection of policymakers was for two hikes in 2017. For now, markets aren't taking the Fed at its word. On Friday, the CME Group FedWatch tool showed markets pricing in a 71.5% chance of a December hike but just a 30.6% chance of a second hike through November 2017.RELATED:U.S. Added 161,000 Jobs, But Best Wage Gain Since 2009 Puts Pressure On Fed This Is The Best News About Wage Growth In A Year (But Markets Won't Love It)

The Nasdaq headed into Friday's session down 2.5% so far this week, after eight straight days of declines. The S&P 500, which has also posted an eight-day losing streak, enters Friday down 1.8% this week and in a test of support at its 200-day moving average.Global markets traded unanimously lower: China's markets notched mild declines and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 dived 1.3%.

Starbucks (SBUX) added more than 1% early Friday after a late-Thursday report beat expectations on fiscal fourth-quarter sales and earnings, while its 2017 profit outlook was less robust than investors had hoped. Starbucks shares have been in a gradual downtrend since October.Monster Beverage (MNST) dropped nearly 8% at the open after scoring a broad third-quarter sales and earnings miss. The stock has been consolidating since August.Security software developer FireEye (FEYE) shot up 14% at the open. The Milpitas, Calif., company reported third-quarter revenue well above analyst estimates and earnings slipped much less than expected.On the IBD 50 list, Stamps.com (STMP) surged 8% at the start of trading. The electronic postage and postal services provider reported late Thursday its third-quarter sales and revenue cleared analysts' hurdles by wide margins. The stock broke out above a 100.42 buy point in a flat base.Another IBD 50 stock, Carbonite (CARB) slid 7% at the starting bell. After Thursday's close, the cloud data-storage provider squarely beat analysts' third-quarter earnings and revenue views, and offered guidance that was in line with expectations. Carbonite slid below its 50-day moving average.U.S. non-farm employers added 161,000 new workers in October, the Labor Department said. That was above initial estimates of 156,000 new jobs in September, but below the department's upwardly revised September estimate of 191,000 new hires. October's number was well short of the consensus estimate of 178,000 added workers. Private payroll expansion slowed to 142,000 added workers, down from 167,000 hirings in September and undercutting projections for an increase to 170,000 new jobs.The labor participation rate was effectively steady at 62.9%, but average hourly earnings increased 0.4%, vs. a 0.2% advance in September and expectations for a 0.3% increase.The trade deficit narrowed considerably in September, to $36.4 billion, down from $40.5 billion in August, according to the Commerce Department.A jump in exports helped drive the trade gap to a 10-monrth low, and well below consensus views for a slight decrease to $38.9 billion.Baker Hughes (BHI) releases its weekly rig count report at 1 p.m. ET.

Domino's has not yet given a date for its fourth-quarter report, but should report in the next few weeks.Domino's rose 0.6% to 170.57 on the stock market today. The stock has a 172.10 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.RELATED:Domino's CEO Doyle On Netflix, Trump And Pizza's 'Jetsons' FutureStarbucks reports earnings on Thursday, with analysts expecting its slowest earnings growth — 13% — in five years. Shares have rallied since early November as investors bet on better days ahead.Starbucks rose 0.4% to 58.70. It's closing in on a 59.64 entry in a saucer-with-handle base. A saucer base is like a cup base, but less deep.But there are caveats to this analysis. If you look at Starbucks' chart as a base going back to Oct. 30, then the midpoint of the handle is fractionally lower than the midpoint of the consolidation. (Handles below the base midpoint are invalid because breakouts are more likely to fail). But, using the 52-week high set in April, the handle is above the base midpoint — and so the 59.64 buy point is valid.RELATED:Starbucks Stock Near Buy Zone Ahead Of EarningsYum Brands has been in a consolidation since Oct. 4. But shares rose 0.4% to 65.60 on Wednesday, just below a buy point of 66.36.On Monday, shares tumbled, but found support at the 200-day line and closed above their 50-day line. On Tuesday, Yum rose 1.4% to 65.33, clearing support just above 65. Investors might see this as an aggressive entry point, but the volume was 28% below average.

Investors interested in Yum Brands should probably wait for the 66.36 trigger.Yum Brands will report earnings on Feb. 9, its first quarterly report since spinning off Yum China (YUMC).Jack in the Box has gained recent notoriety for its tacos, which have been incredibly popular despite all culinary odds.

236,SBUX,"The new Trump administration has already lined up the first shots in a clash of trade titans.Calling China ""the most protectionist country"" among major U.S. trading partners, Wilbur Ross, Donald Trump's choice to run the Commerce Department, on Wednesday signaled new tariffs for Chinese steel and aluminum industries dumping their products in the U.S. at artificially low prices.That gave U.S. steel stocks a one-day boost. But if the protectionist rhetoric and actions continue to ratchet higher, U.S. companies with a big China presence, such as Apple (AAPL), General Motors (GM) and Boeing (BA), could get caught in the crossfire.China, via the state-run Global Times, has already warned that it could target Apple, Boeing and Starbucks (SBUX) if Trump followed through on his campaign rhetoric by slapping a 45% tariff on U.S. imports from China.China accounts for about 4.8% of S&P 500 revenue, according to FactSet. But many big U.S. companies rely on China for at least 10% of revenue — some more than 50%. They could take a disproportionate hit if the conflict intensifies. Some other companies with broad exposure to China include Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM), Nike (NKE) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS), according to an IBD review of company filings.Deteriorating trade relations with China wouldn't only risk near-term revenue but also future growth plans. Starbucks, for example, now has about 2,400 stores in China but envisions having 5,000 by 2021. China needs 6,840 airplanes valued at $1 trillion through 2035, Boeing says.Markets still see a full-fledged trade war as unlikely and Trump's harshest threats as part of his negotiating strategy. The Eurasia Group, which analyzes political risk for investors, wrote that it expects the Trump administration to ""aggressively accelerate the pace of anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and other unilateral actions against specific Chinese imports, but they will not adopt across-the-board tariffs in order to maintain room for a negotiated solution.""In the near term, that wouldn't necessarily be a major departure. President Obama imposed a 35% tariff on Chinese tires in 2009, citing a surge in imports, and anti-dumping duties on imports of Chinese solar panels and cold-rolled flat steel.IBD'S TAKE: Donald Trump has made a number of threats on trade, from targeting specific companies to sweeping tariffs. Here's what Trump has the power to do on Nafta, China and taxes.Yet Eurasia Group analysts Evan Medeiros and Michael Hirson write that China is likely to ""retaliate immediately and proportionally"" with the goal of inflicting ""substantial but not overwhelming pain on U.S. firms"" to persuade Trump not to take broader, more destabilizing steps. Among the likely targets are ""iconic American consumer goods"" and companies in agriculture, aviation, financial services, tourism and technology.They note that China has myriad ways to create trouble for American companies, from regulatory actions, to delaying or denying approval for licenses, to blocking an M&A deal.American companies already feel that Beijing is making their lives more difficult. A survey by American Chamber of Commerce in China out this week found that 81% of members felt less welcome than before vs. 77% a year ago, while 24% said the investment environment was improving and 31% said it was getting worse.If Trump used his trade leverage to push China to ensure a more level playing field for American companies in China, that could help their growth prospects. Yet he appears more interested in using his leverage to convince Apple to shift much of its production to the U.S., even if that substantially raises the cost of an iPhone.No company has more at stake in China than Apple, which accounted for $46.4 billion in sales in its latest fiscal year, or 22% of total revenue. And China is where most of its iPhones are pieced together.Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry is a rare analyst who thinks Trump will prevail upon Apple to significantly ramp up iPhone production in the U.S. for the domestic market. ""Companies who are America First — Made in the USA by the USA workers — will outperform the rest,"" Chowdhry wrote.Yet Chowdhry, recognizing that domestic production would hike costs and likely lower margins, concludes: ""Days of share buybacks and dividends are over.""UBS analyst Steve Milunovich considered a far different trade outcome in which Trump signs onto the House GOP's plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 20% and apply a 20% tax on the value of imports. Under this scenario, tax reform would be a net negative for Apple, with an outright earnings decline coming from a tax on the value of iPhones it imports to sell in the U.S. and lower foreign earnings due to an associated rise in the dollar.Yet for all the hand-wringing, Apple shares are up about 8% since the November election.GM's joint ventures with China totaled $45 billion, or 30% of total revenue, in the latest fiscal year. In December, China hit GM with a $29 million fine for price-fixing, leading to speculation that the fine carried a political message for the incoming president.Yet Eurasia Group figures that GM and Ford (F) may be less vulnerable to retaliation from China because their Chinese joint-venture partners would also suffer.More than half the wireless chipmaker's $23.6 billion in revenue came from China in the latest year, though that reflects China's lead in mobile phone production, not just its large base of end customers. The San Diego-based company has been on a roll lately — especially in China — making inroads with Chinese phone makers after it agreed to pay Beijing $975 million in 2015 to settle an antitrust probe of its licensing practices.If China wants to send a message to Trump, it could stall Qualcomm's acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), a Dutch maker of chips for the automotive market as well as mobile devices. NXP CEO Rick Clemmer told Barron's that China could delay the deal if trade frictions rise, but he sees almost no chance it will be blocked.Sales of Boeing aircraft to China, which amounted to $12.6 billion in the latest fiscal year, support 150,000 jobs for American workers, the company boasted in December to underscore the risk of a deepening trade rift.Few companies represent a bigger or simpler target than Boeing. Morningstar and Eurasia Group analysts have warned that China could shift its business to Airbus, rewarding Europe as it penalizes the U.S.Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Las Vegas Sands both get close to 60% of their revenue from their China properties in the autonomous Macau coastal region of China. Both have just opened new casino resorts in the world's biggest gambling market, increasing their exposure. Trump, a onetime casino mogul himself, has a long association with their bosses. Steve Wynn is a finance chair of Trump's inaugural committee, while Sands CEO Sheldon Adelson is a GOP megadonor. Trump's infrastructure spending agenda and his pledge to use Caterpillar (CAT) and Deere (DE) equipment to build a wall on the southern border helped boost shares of the long-suffering construction vehicle maker. But Caterpillar, which gets about 8% of its revenue directly from China, is wary about the implications of a trade war.Caterpillar's outgoing CEO Doug Oberhelman expressed concern about ""being held out of a lot of the markets"" like China as retaliation for Trump's saber-rattling.Macquarie Research analyst Sameer Rathod downgraded the shares after their run-up last month, noting that Trump ""being aggressive on anti-dumping duties would be detrimental to global growth and trade and is likely going to be a negative for aggregate commodity demand.""RELATED:Amazon, Alibaba, Ford, Wal-Mart May Offer Trump-Proofing PlaybookWhy Trump Tax Reform Could Hurt Alibaba, Other ADRs

238,SBUX,"The average weekly U.S. wage fell 0.5% from a year ago in the first quarter, the Labor Department said on Wednesday. The $5 drop to $1,043 was just the seventh annual decline in quarterly records dating back to 1978.The reported drop in weekly wages, which reflects both stagnant wages and a shorter workweek, confirms that the economy was much weaker than widely understood in early 2016. That weakness, which was evident in the sharp slowdown in federal income and employment tax withholdings, was likely exacerbated by a sharp stock-market sell-off triggered by concerns over China's slowing economy and the Federal Reserve's plans for a series of rate hikes.The new data come from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, which provides the only detailed quarterly and annual universe count of establishments, employment and wages at the county, state and national levels by detailed industry.Among the 344 largest counties, 167 had over-the-year decreases in average weekly wages, with three seeing double-digit declines: McClean, Ill., 13.3%; Washington, Pa., 12.0%; and Lafayette, La., 10.3%.Such general and localized wage stagnation and declines help explain the appeal of political populism from the likes of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.The Bureau of Labor Statistics had reported that private-sector weekly wages rose 2.0% from a year ago in March. Concerns about weekly wages aren't over, after the August jobs report showed the average workweek shrinking to 34.3 hours, tied for the shortest since 2011. But there's good reason to take the new data with a grain of salt: Companies have been announcing wage hikes, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Starbucks (SBUX) and Wal-Mart (WMT), and federal taxes withheld from paychecks are growing at the fastest rate since last fall.IBD'S TAKE: Most economic data are subject to seasonal adjustment, come with a margin of error and are later revised. Federal tax withholdings, which provide the broadest, most timely indicator of the labor market's health, are worth paying attention to. But the most important signal for stock investors comes from daily market action. For a primer on knowing whether it's time to buy, sell or hold, visit IBD University.Based on the new quarterly census data, BLS also revised down the number of jobs created in the private sector in the year through March by 150,000, including a drop of 224,000 in private-sector job additions, offset by an upward revision of 74,000 to government job gains. BLS originally reported that the private sector added 2.6 million nonfarm jobs in the year through March, part of an overall gain of nearly 2.8 million jobs.The biggest downward revision came in the retail sector, whose addition of 357,300 jobs in the year through March will be cut by more than a third: 119,500. The preliminary revisions will be finalized in February 2017.RELATED:Job Openings Rose To A Record 5.87 Million In July

239,SBUX,"Wall Street economists expect Friday's jobs report to show that the economy added 180,000 jobs in August as the jobless rate dipped to 4.8%.That would be a solid gain, but not likely strong enough to prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its September meeting, especially after Thursday's surprisingly weak ISM manufacturing index.Other details also will be key: What happened to the workweek, which averaged 34.5 hours in the latest report? Did wage growth rise from July's 2.6% annual rate?If anything, wage growth is likely to surprise on the upside. Since the start of July, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) tellers and Starbucks (SBUX) baristas got a significant bump in pay, while Wendy's (WEN), Ross Stores (ROST), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and others have said in corporate earnings calls that they're paying more as they compete for top talent, incentivize performance and keep up with minimum-wage laws. While these are anecdotal reports, federal taxes withheld from paychecks, the broadest gauge of the health of the job market, are growing at the fastest rate in nine months.So what would it take to prompt the Fed to action later this month, instead of waiting until December for the next hike, as markets currently expect?""It will have to be a real blockbuster to trip a September move,"" says Dan North, chief economist at trade credit insurer Euler Hermes North America.What qualifies as a blockbuster? In North's view, that might mean 250,000 new jobs, ""plus strong wage growth, increased hours, increased participation.""Wages, hours and participation all provide a signal as to how much slack remains in the labor market. If those elements of the report signal weakness, North figures an addition of 290,000 jobs in August would be needed to provoke the Fed to act at its next meeting.IBD'S TAKE: With wage growth picking up, investors may want to focus on companies with a strong enough position in their markets to withstand labor inflation without suffering a hit to profit margins. Read this Investor's Corner on studying profit margins and check out IBD Stock Checkup to see how your stocks rate.Some Fed policymakers have said that the economy is close to full employment. At that point, the theory suggests, employment growth that exceeds growth in the labor force will increase upward pressure on wages.In a report this week, Wells Fargo Chief Economist John Silvia and colleagues estimated that any job growth above 95,000 per month now reduces labor market slack. That's lower than it's been because of the slower growth of the potential labor force as baby boomers retire.""A slowdown (in job creation) may very well be needed to avoid overheating and cause the Fed to tighten policy faster than expected,"" the Wells Fargo team wrote.

Loyalty program membership rose 25% to 19.4 million.Guidance: Ulta sees current third-quarter EPS of $1.25-$1.30, the midpoint of which is shy of consensus for $1.29. The midpoint of its Q3 revenue outlook for $1.072 billion $1.09 billion beats estimates for $1.075 billion. The company raised full-year EPS to low- to mid- 20% range vs. prior target of low 20% range, and now sees 11%-13% in comps vs. prior guidance for 10%-12%.Stock: Ulta Beauty shares fell 1.8% to 266.50 in after-hours trading. Shares closed down 0.9% to 271.45 on the stock market today.The stock hit a record intraday high on Wednesday. Ulta has been in a strong rally since early May.IBD'S TAKE: Ulta Beauty shares are extended above buy range. But several quality stocks are near buy points, including two retailers. To find that list, as well as stocks actually breaking out, take a trial of IBD's Marketsmith.What It Means: Ulta's light Q3 profit outlook is one of the few blemishes on an otherwise regular-looking — for Ulta, anyway — Q2 report, but it's possible investors believe the stock was already priced for perfection going into earnings results.On the earnings call, management said Ulta's loyalty program membership had crossed the 20-million mark, growing 27% year over year to 20.6 million members. (By contrast, Starbucks (SBUX) -- whose rewards program is generally well-regarded -- only has 12.3 million active members in the U.S. and Canada.)The company said it sees strength across all ages and demographics, but is excited about its growing millennial and teen customer base. Ulta also recently rolled out a private-label credit card as it hopes to convert some of its membership base to Ulta card users.What's Next? In the regular trading sessions following the prior three quarters' after-the-close results, Ulta shares have gapped up in big volume.RELATED:What To Expect From Ulta Beauty Earnings On ThursdayUlta Beauty Shines Amazon Armor As It Crushes Views, Ups Outlook

241,SBUX,"American Century Ultra (TWCUX), a marquee name in the mutual fund industry, had a dynamite third quarter. Its 6.49% gain popped past the 5.59% average surge of its large-cap growth rivals as tracked by Morningstar. And the fund soared above the S&P 500, which tacked on a relatively modest 3.85% advance.So far in Q4 the $8.2 billion mutual fund is down 1.93%, going into Thursday. A lot of that is due to a slide by technology and tech-related names that dominate the fund's top holdings. They have been out of investors' favor in recent weeks. Until this past week, that is.A sustained rebound by those names could give a nice boost to the fund — Tuesday and Wednesday those names showed signs of doing that.Four tech or tech-related names are top-10 holdings that have IBD Composite Ratings of 80 or higher. So does top new buy Xilinx (XLNX).IBD'S TAKE: The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher, which means that they've outperformed 95% of all other stocks in terms of their Composite Rating.Apple (AAPL), the top holding as of Aug. 31, was down 7% since Oct. 24. Alphabet (GOOGL) was down 7%. Amazon.com (AMZN) was down 11%. Facebook (FB) was down 17%. All had portfolio weightings of 8% to 4% as of Aug. 31Three gained ground Tuesday and Wednesday. Facebook and Xilinx rose on Tuesday.They had sold off amid investors' worries that multinational companies like those are high-profile targets for retaliation by foreign governments if President-elect Donald Trump sparks a trade war.One big change for the fund since IBD last profiled it in May: While information technology remains its largest sector, now with a weighting of 33%, consumer discretionary has replaced health care in the second slot with a 22% weighting. Health care still has a 17% weighting but has fallen to the sixth position.Amazon — which combines online retailing with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-services platform — is the biggest consumer discretionary name. Starbucks (SBUX) is another. The coffee-shop chain has a modest 70 Comp Rating. Shares recently retook their 10-week moving average, a sign its recent downtrend may be ending.Meanwhile, some health care holdings have already provided lift for American Century Ultra, with runs that began in the days before the election.Managed care provider UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and biotech Celgene (CELG) are among the fund's top 10 holdings and have Comp Ratings of 88 and 97 respectively. They benefited as investors rotated into health care stocks amid expectations that a Republican Congress and White House will ease pressure for new pricing rules for drugs. Investors also expect ObamaCare to be reformed.In addition, the market reacted favorably to UnitedHealth's profitable third quarter reported last month — earnings per share rose 23% — and to its raised guidance for 2016.Celgene's Q3 revenue jumped 28% as EPS grew 28%. In addition to productive products Revlimid, Pomalyst, Otezla and Abraxane, Celgene got multiple sclerosis treatment ozanimod in its 2015 acquisition of Receptos. It's also being tested for treating ulcerative colitis. And mongersen is being studied for treatment of Crohn's disease.Wall Street analysts are forecasting 22% earnings growth over the next five years.Donaldson (DCI) also got a postelection boost. The maker of air and liquid filtration systems is up on expectations that a Trump administration will seek infrastructure improvements. EPS grew 16% and 2% the past two quarters after four stanzas of slowing growth.Scripps Networks (SNI), which runs six national media networks and has an 86 Comp Rating, broke out above a flat-base buy point of 68.54 Monday. AT&T's (T) pursuit of Time Warner (TWX) — whether a Trump administration would green-light the deal or not — shows the value of media content.IBD's TAKE: Take a look at IBD's Stock Checkup to learn how four consecutive years of EPS growth and annual return on equity of 44.3% help make Scripps the No. 1 stock in IBD's diversified-media industry group.Xilinx in October pulled back 12% after setting a 52-week high, but has since regained most of the loss. The chip designer, which has a 90 Comp Rating, had EPS growth of 8%, 11% and 27% the past three quarters. Those steps up followed five frames of declining EPS growth. The most recent results, for Q2, beat many analysts expectations. The stock also has a 2.5% dividend yield.The California-based chipmaker's industrial-defense division — whose sales rose 11% in Q2 — could benefit from a boost in defense spending under Trump.RELATED:How A Top Mutual Fund Plays This Volatile MarketAmerican Century Ultra Stays Focused On Leaders

243,SBUX,"When it comes to the direction of interest rates, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's words may be more important than Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen's.While Yellen's testimony to Congress on Thursday morning will be closely scrutinized, the big news on Wednesday was that GOP leaders in the Senate have ruled out the idea of killing the filibuster, which generally means that 60 votes will be required to move legislation.Republicans do have another trick — actually two tricks — up their sleeves to move legislation to cut taxes and replace ObamaCare. They can use the same reconciliation technique used by President Obama to pass ObamaCare in 2010, and the GOP has signaled that it intends to do so twice. Yet that legislative vehicle will require changes in taxes and spending to be budget neutral, at worst.The upshot is that there's a limit to the amount of fiscal stimulus that President-elect Trump will be able to deliver, and the need for budget neutrality may draw out the legislative process, since that means there will be winners and losers. On top of that, the spike in Treasury yields since Trump's surprise win could have a dampening effect on the housing market and auto sales, which may have already peaked.IBD'S TAKE: Janet Yellen signaled Thursday that Fed rate hikes are coming soon, but not fast and furious.Even so, shares of General Motors (GM) and Ford (F), a Trump campaign punching bag for its plans to shift small-vehicle production to Mexico, have moved slightly higher since the election. Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America (BAC) and other bank stocks, especially regional banks, have flown on both the prospect of widening yield spreads lifting net interest margins, as well as on expectations of a lighter regulatory touch in a Trump administration.Still, the lack of near-term catalysts suggests the sell-off in Treasuries, with the 10-year yield rising nearly a full percentage point from the historic low seen in July, may have run its course for now. That's not to say there will necessarily be a substantial pull-back. Average hourly wage growth has accelerated and is now up an annualized 3.1% over the past six months, as companies like Starbucks (SBUX) and Panera Bread (PNRA) have been hiking pay as they compete for the best talent. The labor market is getting tight and wage pressures are beginning to feed through to higher inflation.On the other hand, the rise in the dollar also is a negative for U.S. growth. Meanwhile, there is enough uncertainty overseas, including a big constitutional referendum in Italy next month, that Treasuries may continue to see safe-haven buying.While an infrastructure package could deliver a boost, the plan to emphasize public-private partnerships may slow the funding of shovel-ready projects. Nucor (NUE), Steel Dynamics (STLD) and U.S. Steel (X) have been among the biggest stock-market winners since Trump's election. Steel makers would benefit from a big boost in infrastructure spending, as well as from Trump protectionist moves.RELATED:3 Reasons Why Wage Growth Is About To Take OffSteel Stocks Soar As Trump Seen Fueling 20% Annual Demand GrowthBofA, JPMorgan, Other Bank Stock Charts Look Great Despite Pullback

244,SBUX,"As soon as President Trump signed his executive order calling for two regulations to be eliminated for every new one enacted, the usual suspects started to complain.Union of Concerned Scientists President Ken Kimmell called it ""absurd, imposing a Sophie's Choice on federal agencies.""William Gale of the left-of-center Brookings Institution complained that ""there's no logic to this.""Public Citizen head Robert Weissman called Trump's order ""unworkable,"" ""harmful,"" ""unprecedented and untested,"" and ""horrifying.""""Americans will once again have to pay the price for the consequences of corporate recklessness, greed and lawbreaking,"" Weissman added for good measure.Trump's executive order, signed on Monday, doesn't deregulate anything. It simply is an attempt to cap the current costs of regulations this year by requiring agencies to offset the costs of any new rule by eliminating regulations that impose equal costs.""The heads of all agencies are directed that the total incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed regulations, to be finalized this year shall be no greater than zero,"" the order said.It's a tiny first step toward cutting the enormous cost of federal regulations — which by some estimates adds up to almost $1.9 trillion a year.What critics of deregulation fail to mention, however, is that it is greedy corporations that are likely to be one of Trump's biggest opponents when it comes to dismantling, or even taming, the federal government's massively complex and enormously expensive regulatory state.Soon after Trump was elected, for example, more than 350 companies signed a letter urging him not to abandon the Paris climate change agreement that President Obama had signed onto. ""Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk,"" the letter said.Among those companies signing it were household names like General Mills (GIS), Kellogg (K), DuPont (DD), eBay (EBAY), Starbucks (SBUX), Staples (SPLS), Nike (NKE) and Intel (INTC).Trump's effort to fix Dodd-Frank won't get much support from the banking industry, either.Business Insider reports that ""bankers are concerned the Trump administration, joined by like-minded Congress, will scrape or significantly change the rules.""Dodd-Frank required banks to invest in staff and technology and make other changes to comply with that law's vast web of regulations. But ""now that Dodd-Frank is largely in effect, the industry sees a total elimination as more of a threat than a blessing.""Brokerage firms worry that the Labor Department's ""fiduciary rule"" could be in jeopardy. BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink said on a January earnings call that the rule ""has some very great components in it.""Why would companies be pushing to keep costly regulations in place?This is the dirty secret that so-called public-interest groups never share. Big corporations are often the biggest beneficiaries, and at times the strongest advocates, of federal regulations.Daniel Hannan, a member of the European Parliament, put it best during the Brexit debate last year. Big business vigorously supported the Remain campaign, he noted, despite the fact that EU regulations were suffocating the British economy.""Ask yourself why it is that the megabanks and the multinationals are pouring money into the Remain campaign,"" Hannan said. ""I'll tell you why. The biggest surprise for me when I was a newly elected MEP was the extent to which these giant corporations wanted more regulation. They love regulation because they can afford the compliance costs more easily than their smaller rivals.""See? Regulations can give big companies a competitive advantage — not only can they more easily afford the cost of regulatory compliance than their smaller competitors, they can finance an army of lobbyists to make sure the rules are written to their benefit.The most noteworthy effect of Dodd-Frank, for example, hasn't been that it's made the financial sector less vulnerable — as IBD noted recently, it hasn't. It is, instead, the destruction of smaller community banks, which in turn has let large banks further consolidate their grip on the industry.""The number of community banks (those with less than $10 billion in assets) shrank 14% between Dodd-Frank's passage in 2010 and late 2014,"" noted Harvard Business School's Marshall Lux and Robert Greene. ""When regulations — not consumers — drive consolidation, banking system risk increases,"" they wrote.Some other examples, courtesy of the Cato Institute:Airline deregulation is another prime example of how big business fights deregulation more fiercely that it fights regulation.Before 1978, the federal Civil Aeronautics Board controlled airline routes and fares. Airlines routinely complained about CAB rules, but when President Carter and liberal Sen. Ted Kennedy teamed up to deregulate the airline industry, it was the airlines themselves that mounted a determined fight against it, and encouraged their employees to do likewise.The chairman of Delta Airlines (DAL) at the time called deregulation a ""wolf in sheep's clothing,"" saying it would somehow lead to more regulation and ""perhaps eventual nationalization"" of the airline industry.Carter ignored these warnings and disbanded the CAB. The result made life tougher for airline executives, but it was a consumer bonanza of increased competition and far lower rates.Yet despite countless such examples over the decades, this dynamic goes almost entirely unrecognized when the subject of federal regulations comes up. Regulations are always portrayed as helping the little guy at the expense of big business — when the reality is often the opposite.This isn't to say that big business will always fight against deregulation. But when it comes to free-market policies, corporate executives can be fickle friends. And if Donald Trump wants to live up to his promise to deregulate the economy, he's likely going to have to take on not just the liberal left, but some of the biggest businesses in the world.RELATED:Now They Tell Us: Trump's Economic Plan Will Boost GrowthTrump Day One To-Do List: Repeal $1.7 Billion Of Dodd-Frank RulesIs Ford's Move A Cave-In To Trump Protectionist Talk, Or A Savvy Bet On Future?

245,SBUX,"Silicon Valley, Motown and Wall Street all clashed with Pennsylvania Avenue as President Donald Trump's executive order banning refugees and travelers from seven Muslim nations reverberated throughout the U.S. business world Monday.Trump's Friday signing of the executive order also alarmed executives from big employers including General Electric (GE) and Goldman Sachs Group (GS). A chaotic weekend of protests, emergency court hearings and White House rebuttals left executives with a tricky choice: speak out and risk drawing fire from an outspoken president, or stay silent and face criticism from employees and activists.GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt's response underscored the delicate balance business will have to strike.""We have many employees from the named countries and we do business all over the region,"" he said in an internal email. While he called those staff ""critical to our success,"" he avoided direct criticism of Trump's policy. GE ""will continue to make our voice heard with the new administration and congress and reiterate the importance of this issue,"" he said.""We would never think this would become any kind of an issue,"" Ludwig Willisch, chief executive officer of North American operations at BMW, said at an automotive conference on Saturday. ""This country is a melting pot, freedom of speech, everybody gets together and creates this great country. So, we were not prepared for this kind of thing.""Trump's order shut the door to nationals of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — including refugees, visiting scholars and, at least temporarily, even permanent American residents who happened to be abroad for work or holidays. Confusion reigned in the first 48 hours of its implementation, with border agents and airlines unsure how to interpret the rules.Criticism from pockets of corporate America, which was matched by statements from the leaders of Germany, France, and Canada, stood in stark contrast to the warm words toward Trump just a week ago.Executives at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Switzerland, including AT&T's (T) Randall Stephenson and JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) Jamie Dimon, praised Trump's promises to overhaul corporate taxes and invest in infrastructure. Optimists suggested he would quietly drop pledges to tear up trade deals and reconsider defense commitments to allies.Trump has ""had this extraordinary honeymoon where Wall Street has kind of discounted all the negative aspects,"" Richard Fenning, the CEO of consultancy Control Risks, told Bloomberg Television. As companies react to the migrant ban, ""perhaps that honeymoon is starting to be over,"" he said.The about-face was epitomized by Tesla Motors (TSLA) founder Elon Musk; last week he praised Trump's nominee for secretary of state, former Exxon Mobil (XOM) CEO Rex Tillerson, as a potentially ""excellent"" pick. On Sunday, Musk tweeted that migrants ""don't deserve to be rejected"" and asked his 6.9 million Twitter followers to read the immigration order and suggest changes.Wall Street stayed out of the fray initially. Late Sunday, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein told employees that ""this is not a policy we support,"" criticizing an administration stocked with the firm's alumni, including Steven Mnuchin, Trump's pick to head the Treasury.It creates ""potential for disruption to the firm"" and staff, whom Goldman will seek to assist, Blankfein said in a companywide voice mail. JPMorgan also said it was working to help affected employees.Starbucks (SBUX) CEO Howard Schultz said Trump's move left him with ""deep concern, a heavy heart and a resolute promise."" The coffee chain will redouble efforts to hire as many as 10,000 refugees over five years in 75 countries, he wrote in a note to employees Sunday.Reaction was sharpest from the technology industry, with Twitter awash in reminders that Apple's (AAPL) late co-founder, Steve Jobs, was the son of a Syrian immigrant. Among the first to speak out was Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and himself an immigrant from India, who called the policy ""painful."" Another India-born CEO, Microsoft's (MSFT) Satya Nadella, took to LinkedIn to highlight ""the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, for the world.""Trump should expect sustained challenges from the tech industry in particular, said Ian Bremmer, CEO of political consultancy Eurasia Group, because it differs significantly with him on issues from net neutrality to immigration. ""While most every CEO wants to just 'get back to business' after Trump's election, that's going to prove much harder"" for technology leaders, he said. ""There's going to be a fight.""Compounding business leaders' unease was the order's confused implementation, which included unclear directives on how border agents should treat lawful permanent residents, and contradictory statements about how it would affect those who hold passports from two countries — for example, a dual citizen of Iran and the U.K.Others railing against the ban included Facebook (FB) and Salesforce (CRM), saying it violated the country's principles and risked disrupting its engine of innovation. But Trump's next steps could strike even closer to home: His administration has drafted an executive order aimed at overhauling the work-visa programs technology companies depend on to hire tens of thousands of employees each year.If implemented, the reforms could shift the way American companies like Microsoft, Amazon.com (AMZN) and Apple recruit talent and force wholesale changes at Indian companies such as Infosys (INFY) and Wipro (WIT). Businesses would have to try to hire American first and if they recruit foreign workers, priority would be given to the most highly paid.""Our country's immigration policies should be designed and implemented to serve, first and foremost, the U.S. national interest,"" the draft proposal reads, according to a copy reviewed by Bloomberg. ""Visa programs for foreign workers … should be administered in a manner that protects the civil rights of American workers and current lawful residents, and that prioritizes the protection of American workers — our forgotten working people — and the jobs they hold.""The foreign work visas were originally established to help U.S. companies recruit from abroad when they couldn't find qualified local workers. In many cases, the companies are hiring for highly technical positions in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM.But in recent years, there have been allegations the programs have been abused to bring in cheaper workers from overseas to fill jobs that otherwise may go to Americans. The top recipients of the H-1B visas are outsourcers, primarily from India, who run the technology departments of large corporations with largely imported staff.""Immigrant STEM workers have contributed an outsize share to founding new companies, getting patents, and helping build up American companies, which in turn because of their success have created tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of jobs,"" said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who does research in labor markets. ""Discouraging such people to apply for visas to enter the United States to work — I can't imagine how that can be considered to be in the American national interest.""The Trump administration did not respond to a request for comment on the draft. The proposal is consistent with the president's public comments on pushing companies to add more jobs to the U.S., from technology to auto manufacturing.And in Detroit, automakers are walking a tightrope as they court Trump, whose policies on clean-air standards, corporate taxes and trade will affect their fortunes.They have to balance that against other considerations closer to home: The traditional three U.S. automakers are based in Michigan, which backed Trump's surprise victory but also has a substantial Middle Eastern population troubled by his immigration order.Ford Motor's (F) hometown of Dearborn has been referred to as America's Muslim Capital, with more than 30% of the population of Arab descent. From 2005 to 2015, the state accepted 19,545 refugees from Iraq and Syria — two of the seven countries affected by Trump's ban.""People would say that if you landed here at 9 p.m., you can have a job at 9 the next morning,"" Ibrahim Kazerooni, the imam at Dearborn's Islamic Center of America, said in an interview. ""We have many people in our community who work at Ford. We're a part of this community.""Plans for 26 refugees to immigrate to the Detroit area from Iraq and Syria in the next week have been canceled, said Lynne Golodner, spokeswoman for Samaritas, formerly known as Lutheran Social Services of Michigan, which has a contract with the state to help asylum seekers settle and find employment.Trump took special aim at Ford during the campaign and the automaker has worked to get back in his good graces. Executive Chairman Bill Ford, a great-grandson of the founder Henry, has said he can always get a hold of Trump, or the president calls him. CEO Mark Fields visited the White House on back-to-back days last week to discuss jobs, fuel-economy standards and even Oval Office decor.Still, Ford and its auto-industry peers in the Detroit area have been largely silent on the immigration order. Christin Baker, a Ford spokeswoman, declined to comment. Representatives for General Motors (GM), Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU), Toyota Motor (TM), Nissan Motor (NSANY), Hyundai Motor and Honda Motor (HMC) also passed.""They should be proactive and stand up for the Muslim community,"" Mohammad All, a 26-year-old Ford engineer, said during a protest Sunday at Detroit Metropolitan Airport. He entered the U.S. from Iraq in 1997 after years in a Rafha, Saudi Arabia, refugee camp. ""The stand Mark Fields took was more about helping Ford and the bottom line than about human rights.""

247,SBUX,"U.S. stock indexes showed stalling-like action in afternoon trading Wednesday, but Starbucks gapped up as it tried to retake its 200-day line and Apple battled near a short-term support level.The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1% each. Volume in the stock market today was once again running below average and down vs. the previous session.The low volume this week could be tied to two news items expected Friday. The second take on second-quarter GDP will be released before Friday's open. (The Street is expecting a downward revision from the first take's 1.2% growth to 1.1% for the second take. The range of estimates runs from 0.8% to 1.5%, according to Econoday)The Federal Reserve is expected to deliver Friday's other piece of potentially big news. Fed chief Janet Yellen is scheduled to speak at the economic summit in Jackson Hole, Wyo.Meanwhile, two big name stocks were battling around key lines Wednesday. Starbucks (SBUX) thrust almost 2%, padding its cushion above its 50-day moving average line. Starbucks retook its 50-day line Tuesday and was bumping up against its 200-day line Wednesday, though it's pulled back from intraday highs.Starbucks hasn't closed above its 200-day line in more than four months. The stock has been consolidating since late October.Apple (AAPL), the second big name, is battling to retake its short-term, 10-day line. The 10-day line is an area that swing traders and other short-term investors focus on. Apple had been running above its 10-day line since a late July gap up, but on Monday began struggling to stay above the line.Apple is down fractionally.Blue chips were mostly down, and top-rated stocks were taking some hard hits. Two fairly recent initial public offering were among the victims.China-based online consumer loans provider Yirendai (YRD) skidded 13% in huge volume, dropping for a fourth consecutive session. The December IPO had been rocketing in recent weeks.Tech stock Acacia Communications (ACIA) lost nearly 4% in heavy volume. The stock debuted on the Nasdaq in May.

248,SBUX,"August's 151,000 job gain missed expectations and slowed from July. But the headline figure still looks decent, or even better for Wall Street because it means the Federal Reserve can take its time before raising interest rates.Yet a look below the surface reveals something entirely different: This was the worst jobs report since 2010.If the data are accurate, the economy is in much worse shape than commonly believed. Yet before going into the ugly details, consider some contrary signals:Since the start of July, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) tellers and Starbucks (SBUX) baristas got a significant bump in pay, while Wendy's (WEN), Ross Stores (ROST), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and others have said in earnings calls that they're paying more as they compete for top talent, incentivize performance and keep up with minimum-wage laws. While these are anecdotal reports, federal taxes withheld from paychecks, the broadest gauge of the health of the job market, are growing at the fastest rate in nine months.Now here's what's wrong with the latest jobs report. The problem isn't primarily that job growth has decelerated, it's that wage gains also slowed and the average workweek is now shorter than at any time since the economy was still getting back on its feet in 2011 (unless you count two blizzard-hit months in the winter of 2013-14 when the workweek was equally short).IBD'S TAKE: Despite what the jobs report says, wages have been trending higher, and that's likely to continue as the economy nears full employment. Investors may want to focus on companies with a strong enough position in their markets to withstand labor inflation without suffering a hit to profit margins. Read this Investor's Corner on profit margins and check out IBD Stock Checkup to see how your investments rate.The most important number in each report isn't the net number of new jobs. It's a number that combines the total number of jobs in the economy, the length of the workweek and the average hourly wage. Here's the shock: Aggregate weekly payrolls, essentially the sum total of private-sector pay earned in a week, grew just 3.5% from a year ago in August, the weakest gain since September 2010. (The 3.5% gain matched the level seen in that unusually stormy December of 2013.)The biggest culprit was the length of the average workweek, which was revised down in July from 34.5 hours to 34.4 hours, then fell to 34.3 hours in August. Here's what that means when combined with the modest deceleration in job creation: The total number of hours worked in the economy rose just 1.1% from a year ago, the smallest increase since July 2010. By comparison, total hours worked have grown at least 2.3% vs. a year ago in each of the past five years' August jobs reports.Meanwhile, after average hourly wages grew just 0.1% in August, the annual rate of increase slowed from an upwardly revised 2.7% in July to just 2.4% last month.Despite the added jobs, the paltry wage growth last month and the drop in hours meant that aggregate pay fell 0.2% in August from July.The bottom line is that, if these details reflect reality, the purchasing power of American consumers has gotten pinched. That could help explain why fast-food chains like McDonald's (MCD) have seen sales growth slow, while retailers like Target (TGT) saw a decline in same-store sales. It's also possible that companies facing margin pressures amid tough competition and higher wages have curtailed work hours.Still, the Labor Department data are subject to revision, unlike the tax data that are signaling a faster rise in aggregate pay, so it doesn't make sense to jump to negative conclusions.RELATED:Slower August Job Growth Will Keep The Fed On Hold In SeptemberAs Companies Step Up Wage Hikes, Tax Receipts Get A Lift

249,SBUX,"The European Union's executive arm on Tuesday ordered Apple (AAPL) to repay 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in back taxes plus interest to Ireland, part of a broader crackdown into EU member nations' special tax treatments for big multinationals.The European Commission ruled that Ireland's tax benefits to Apple amounted to illegal state aid under EU rules.The executive arm of the European Union Tuesday concluded that Ireland granted undue tax benefits to the U.S. tech giant - which is illegal under EU state aid rules.""The Commission's investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years,"" said EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager in a statement.Vestager said this let Apple pay ""an effective corporate tax rate of 1% on its European profits in 2003 down to 0.005% in 2014.""The adverse ruling was widely expected. Apple shares fell 0.8% to 106 at the close on the stock market today, its fifth straight loss.Both Apple and Dublin have said they'll fight the ruling, with the U.S. Treasury Department also objecting. Apple said the ruling will affect investment in Europe.The case, stemming back to initial EU charges vs. Ireland in 2014, will likely send a chill through boardrooms of multinational corporations. Vestager said the EU is still investigating Amazon (AMZN) and McDonald's (MCD).Last year, Starbucks (SBUX) was ordered to pay 30 million euros in taxes back to the Netherlands. Belgium in January was ordered to recover back 700 million euros in taxes from 35 companies, including from BP (BP), Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) and others.RELATED:Apple CEO Tim Cook Slams 'Unprecedented' EU Tax RulingApple Schedules Sept. 7 Event For iPhone 7 Reveal

250,SBUX,"The U.S. economy added 161,000 jobs in October, the Labor Department reported Friday, slightly below views, while wage gains ramped up.Economists had expected an increase of 173,000 jobs, though the prior two months were revised up by a combined 44,000.The unemployment rate dipped to 4.9%, as expected.But average hourly wages rose 0.4%, slightly stronger than expected. Hourly pay climbed 2.8% vs. a year earlier, the best since 2009, sending the 10-year Treasury yield higher.Odds of a December interest-rate hike, which had come down in recent days as markets fell and Donald Trump's odds of winning the White House rose, stood at 71.5% on Friday morning, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.This is the last employment report before Election Day on Nov. 8. The latest IBD/TIPP Presidential Election Tracking Poll has Trump and Hillary Clinton tied for a third straight day at 44%. There will be one more jobs report before the Fed's year-end meeting.The pace of job gains has moderated and is now running at 181,000 per month this year, a significant step down from monthly gains of 229,000 last year and 251,000 in 2014.Yet Federal Reserve policymakers have been expecting and even hoping for a moderation in job growth, so slower growth is unlikely to alter rate-hike plans. That's because they think the U.S. is close to full employment and don't want the labor market to overheat, forcing them to pick up the pace of rate hikes.That's why the pace of average hourly wage gains, which offers the clearest signal about how much labor market slack remains, is even more important than job growth in determining the Fed's rate-hike trajectory.Some anecdotal evidence has been pointing to a possible acceleration in wage gains from the muted pace that has defined the recovery.Starbucks (SBUX) on Oct. 3 gave a wage hike of at least 5% to every barista and manager at all of its U.S. stores.On an Oct. 26 conference call, Panera Bread (PNRA) said average associate wages rose 5% in the third quarter, both to ""effectively compete for talent"" and keep up with higher minimum wages. Panera CFO Michael Bufano went so far as to call the level of wage inflation ""unprecedented"" and noted that the company raised bakery prices 2.4% during the quarter to offset cost increases, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.David Ownby, CFO of the Regal Entertainment (RGC) movie theater chain, said wages pressures were ""at the high end of the range maybe of what we have experienced historically.""Keith Cline, CEO of the La Quinta Holdings (LQ) hotel chain, spoke of ""competitive wage inflation"" to get the best people, noting that ""labor in our industry is tight.""IBD'S TAKE: The best stocks tend to have margins that are high relative to those of rivals and that are steady or growing, so look for companies that have the pricing power to withstand rising wages.

Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see how your stocks rate.Peter Dameris, CEO of the On Assignment (ASGN) staffing firm, said there were ""supply/demand imbalances in IT candidates,"" pointing to higher wages for the firm's consultants along with higher bill rates for the firm going forward, though outsourcing and offshoring offer alternative routes.Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) noted that franchisees had slowed down on the opening of Dunkin' Donuts stores, with minimum-wage increases and general election uncertainty among the reasons.Meanwhile, the National Federation of Independent Business said on Thursday that its survey of members showed a decline in small-business employment last month. ""The combination of record uncertainty, rising labor costs and a shortage of qualified workers is depressing small-business job creation,"" said NFIB President and CEO Juanita Duggan.Job gains in October were focused on health care (31,000), professional and business services (43,000), finance (14,000) and insurance (8,000). The construction sector added 11,000 jobs, while manufacturing lost 9,000 and mining lost 2,000.RELATED:Minimum-Wage Hikes Slow Dunkin' Donuts Franchise GrowthThis Is The Best News About Wage Growth In A Year (But Markets Won't Love It)
"
251,SBUX,"As Walt Disney (DIS) Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger's scheduled retirement date looms closer, the entertainment giant's search for his replacement remains low-profile, a departure from the open process it previously employed.It's been seven months since heir apparent Tom Staggs' abrupt departure left Iger without a clear-cut successor. The top executive recruiting firms say they haven't been hired by Disney, and Iger hasn't moved members of his executive team into newer or more prominent roles to audition them for the top spot. The company has said only that there is a process in place that the board is following, which will include evaluating internal and external candidates.While there's still time to conduct a search before Iger's contract ends in June 2018, the quiet nature of the current succession planning stands in sharp contrast to the widely watched, five-year bake-off from which Staggs emerged as the leading contender for the job. That's fueling speculation that the board could request that Iger, 65, stay on longer than his scheduled retirement date, something it has already asked of him twice before.""I don't think anyone — employee, investor or director — would be hesitant in granting him a new contract,"" said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Nomura Securities in New York. ""That could happen quickly and easily. Why hasn't it happened already? That's a fair question.""Iger said on a May conference call with investors that he didn't have any plans to stick around past the current date.""The board is very actively engaged in a succession process, as it has been actually for some time,"" he said. ""It believes that it has ample time to identify a successor under timing circumstances that will be just fine for the company.""A spokeswoman for Disney declined to comment further. Disney board members on the governance and nominating committee, including former Starbucks (SBUX) CEO Orin Smith, Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey, Facebook (FB) Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and former Clorox (CLX) Chairman Robert Matschullat, didn't respond or declined to comment.Typically it takes a big public company six to seven months to complete a search once the board begins to contact and interview prospective candidates, though additional time is required before that, said Peter Crist, chairman of Crist Kolder Associates, a boutique search firm outside Chicago. ""We do lots of mapping projects with the company that take months"" about the qualities it wants and needs in a new CEO, Crist said.At Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) executive recruiter Spencer Stuart began consulting with directors about what the company needed in a new leader and who they should consider about a year before Doug McMillon was named the retailer's CEO in November 2013, according to people familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified because they aren't authorized to talk publicly. The board narrowed its search to two internal candidates, McMillon and former head of U.S. operations Bill Simon, about six months before making its final decision.At Procter & Gamble (PG), directors first started talking about replacing then-CEO Bob MacDonald in July 2012 and then asked A.G. Lafley to return as CEO and chairman in May 2013. Lafley, who'd already served as CEO at P&G from 2000 until 2009, immediately reorganized the company into four businesses, each headed by a president who was considered a contender for the CEO post. One of the four, David Taylor, was named global president of home care and subsequently also took charge of P&G's beauty business.In July 2015, Lafley and P&G's other directors named Taylor the consumer giant's new CEO, concluding the two-year process.Iger himself was promoted in 2005 after a six-month search by the board. The executive, who had led Disney's TV operations and international business and had served as president for five years, was evaluated against external candidates with help from Heidrick & Struggles, directors said at the time. He got the top job only after a high-profile campaign by some shareholders to oust then-CEO Michael Eisner. Former directors in a long-running feud with the company still criticized Iger's selection as hasty, but the board said it had been thorough and careful.Until this year, it looked as if Disney's choice for Iger's successor would be more orderly, with a seasoned executive waiting in the wings in the COO position. Staggs had risen to the No. 2 spot at the company after a five-year period in which he and another senior manager, Jay Rasulo, competed with each other to become Iger's successor. The two even switched jobs to give Staggs more experience operating a business and Rasulo exposure to the executive suite. Rasulo, then serving as chief financial officer, left the company last year after Staggs' promotion to COO.Staggs' exit, after failing to gain the full backing of Iger and the board, left no other internal candidate with both operational experience and a corporate role.Of the six CEOs since Disney's founding in 1923, only Eisner came from the outside. Eisner, who served from 1984 to 2005, joined the company from Paramount Pictures, where he was president.While the board contemplates who will lead the company after June 2018, Iger remains active in planning how to shape Disney's future. In recent weeks, he considered buying Twitter, but decided to pass, partly because of price and partly because of concern about bullying on the social-media site, people familiar with the matter said last month.At an October event in Boston, Iger said it wasn't enough for the company to own key brands like ABC, ESPN and Pixar. Disney needs to have a direct connection to consumers through mobile devices, he said.""What we're thinking about a lot is what role does technology have in distributing from us to the consumer?"" he said. ""How must we invest in that?""In its search for Iger's replacement, Disney's board should be casting a wide net, looking for candidates inside and outside the company, particularly ones with high-tech chops, said Paul Winum, a senior partner at the management consulting firm RHR International and co-author of ""Inside CEO Succession.""""The landscape is changing so rapidly, technology is opening up new distribution platforms, overseas markets will be  huge opportunities,"" he said. ""The leadership skills have changed dramatically just in the last two years.""When a CEO succession plan unravels, as it did at Disney, the company usually starts thinking about the next, younger generation of executives inside, giving them bigger and different kinds of experience to prepare them for the top job, said Joseph L. Bower, a Harvard Business School professor who has studied succession planning. Disney hasn't made any major changes recently to suggest it's grooming anyone internally, however.""Disney isn't in trouble and currently has a strong CEO in place,"" Bower said. ""But you don't want someone to come in at the last minute to take over.""

252,SBUX,"Stocks showed mixed action in afternoon trading Tuesday, as the Dow took a well-needed breather following tremendous gains since the aftermath of the Donald Trump election shocker.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) gained 0.7% to 106.45, taking back a large chunk of Monday's sharp losses and presenting a case to shareholders that, for now, its slow uptrend is not over.The Nasdaq, boosted by not only Apple but also fellow megacap tech and internets, rose 1% and remained near session highs. The Nasdaq 100 jumped nearly 1.3% at around 2:25 p.m. ET.The S&P 500 edged up 0.3% and is also trading near session highs, following a 3.8% lift last week and flat action in the prior two sessions.Small caps are cooling off in a positive way as well. The S&P SmallCap 600 fell 0.1%.On Nov. 9, a day after the U.S. presidential elections, the IBD Big Picture Column noted a change in the market's current outlook to ""Uptrend resumes"" from ""Uptrend under pressure"" as the major indexes hoisted themselves back above key 50-day moving averages and more breakouts took place in the industrial, financial, banking and commodity sectors.IBD'S TAKE: The market is showing strong signs of rotation into new sectors that could keep the long-in-the-tooth rally in equities still going. Read this special report on the market action, which also was the A1 top story in the latest IBD Weekly print edition.The Dow Jones industrials slipped less than 0.1%, and at least six of the Dow 30 components were up 1% or more. The Dow 30 is a price-weighted gauge; hence, a 2.32-point gain by oil major Chevron (CVX) and a 94-cent rise by Microsoft (MSFT) are helping keeping the blue chip index's losses small.In the stock market today, oil stocks are leading the upside on the back of a healthy rebound in crude oil.WTI near-term oil futures jumped more than 4.5% to $45.31 a barrel. Clearly, oil has been trapped in a trading range of $40 and $50 as steady demand from the U.S. and Asia offset increasing production among OPEC nations.Apple is still below a recent Sept. 14 breakout point at 110.33, yet did not trigger a sell rule because the iPhone giant has not fallen 7%-8% below that proper entry. Understandably, one should not expect rocket-like gains today in Apple, given its large size ($567 billion market cap, $215.6 billion in FY 2016 revenue) vs. its younger years in the mid 2000s.However, the company continues to innovate in the area of computers, smartphones and related services. Some observers openly wonder whether Apple will become the de facto standard of phone-based payments at stores. Already, Apple Pay dominates at Starbucks (SBUX) coffee stores, for instance.The Street sees Apple's revenue rising 2% to $77.4 billion in the current fiscal first quarter ending in December, then accelerating to an 8.5% rise to $54.88 billion in the March-ending fiscal second quarter, a good sign for stockholders.Apple, hurt in part by tough competition in China, big anticipation of next year's iPhone 8, and the strong dollar, has suffered falling sales in the past three quarters. Yet it's still mightily profitable, earning $8.31 in FY 2016. Analysts see EPS rising 9% in FY 2017.Apple also pays a stout dividend of 57 cents a share, giving an annualized yield of 2.2%, better than the S&P 500.Banks cooled off, yet are still acting healthy amid a persistent rise in interest rates.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) fell 1% to 78.56 in heavy trading, yet is still nearly 21% above a 65.08 cup with handle entry. Shares broke out in decent volume Aug. 5.The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield is at 2.22%, up sharply from a low of 1.37% last seen on July 8.Elsewhere in the market today, NetEaseNTES rallied more than 5% to 229.93 in heavy trading following news of a large share buyback plan. Watch to see if the stock can rebound further and stay near its key 50-day line.On Nov. 10, the Chinese online video game leader triggered a sell signal by posting its largest single-session point drop in big volume since its late-June breakout past a 179.20 buy point.Volume also happened to be the heaviest since the run began, and NetEase fell right through its 50-day moving average.That action was a clear change in character as it and other Chinese internets came under strong selling pressure last week. NetEase's Accumulation/Distribution Rating has fallen to a neutral C, indicating that institutions are no longer unanimously accumulating shares.RELATED:The Case For A Trump Era Secular New Bull MarketWhen Did Apple Initially Break Out?Know This Sell Rule: When A Good Stock Makes Its Biggest Ever Single-Day Point Drop

254,SBUX,"Dunkin' Brands (DNKN), the parent of Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin Robbins, reported mixed third-quarter results Thursday morning, with earnings slightly topping forecasts while sales unexpectedly dipped. But Dunkin' Donuts' comparable store sales topped Street estimates.Estimates: EPS up 13% to 59 cents on a 2% rise in revenue to $214.75 million.Results: EPS rose 15% to 60 cents, the second straight quarter of slowly accelerating growth. But revenue fell 1.3% to $207.1 million, the first decline in nearly four years. The company attributed revenue decline to the sale of its remaining company-operated restaurants.Dunkin' Donuts U.S. same-store sales rose 2%, above consensus for 1.3%, according to RBC Capital. Meanwhile, Baskin Robbins comps fell 0.9%. Internationally, comps at Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin Robbins fell.Outlook: The parent company Dunkin' Brands still sees full-year domestic Dunkin' Donuts comps growth of 0%-2%, but adjusted its U.S. Baskin Robbins comps target to slightly positive vs. its prior goal of 1%-3%.Dunkin' Brands also said that it is now ""100% franchised,"" according to CFO Paul Carbone.Stock: Shares fell 3.2% to 49.38 by the closing bell on the stock market today, jeopardizing a cup-with-handle base. The stock fell as low as 47.32 intraday but is trying to close above its 50-day line.Starbucks (SBUX) edged up 0.8% to 53.59.IBD'S TAKE: Dunkin' Brands has been the rare restaurant stock that is doing reasonably well. Meanwhile, Starbucks, which had been outperforming its smaller rival, is trading near a 52-week low. But the java giant is expanding abroad: ""Starbucks To Double Its Coffee Shops In China To 5,000.""Espresso and iced coffee sales at American Dunkin' Donuts locations grew in the double digits, said the company. Plus, its rewards program, DD Perks, hit the 5-million member milestone.For contrast, Starbucks has over 12 million active members in its loyalty program.Restaurant stocks are mostly in the cold right now, with the exception seeming to be pizza stocks -- and Dunkin' Brands.The doughnut-and-coffee-shop stock has risen almost 20%, as of Wednesday's close, year to date, whereas Starbucks shares have fallen 11.5% over the same time frame.Meanwhile, Starbucks said Thursday that it will open a Starbucks Reserve Roastery in the upscale Nakameguro District in Tokyo in 2018.

258,SBUX,"Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook vowed Tuesday to appeal a European Commission ruling that would force the company to pay about $14.5 billion in back taxes plus interest to Ireland, where it has its European headquarters.The European Union's executive arm claims Apple received special tax treatment to lower its tax burden. In a letter responding to the ruling, Cook denied getting special treatment in Ireland and harshly criticized the EU's actions.Apple has been a ""responsible corporate citizen,"" working with Irish tax authorities to comply correctly with Irish tax law, Cook said.""The commission's move is unprecedented, and it has serious, wide-reaching implications,"" Cook said. ""It is effectively proposing to replace Irish tax laws with a view of what the commission thinks the law should have been. This would strike a devastating blow to the sovereignty of EU member states over their own tax matters and to the principle of certainty of law in Europe.""Apple and Ireland both plan to appeal the commission's ruling and are confident it will be reversed, Cook said.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of just 34, meaning it has been outperformed by 66% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For a deep dive into Apple, check out the IBD Stock Checkup.""Using the commission's theory, every company in Ireland and across Europe is suddenly at risk of being subjected to taxes under laws that never existed,"" Cook said.Ireland Finance Minister Michael Noonan told Reuters that he ""disagrees profoundly"" with the EU tax ruling. Ireland's finance ministry said the full amount of tax was paid by Apple, and no state aid was provided.Cook said the EU specifically targeted Apple, which ended the June quarter with $231.5 billion in cash and securities.The EU's case against Apple is part of a broader crackdown on tax treatment of multinationals by EU member nations. The EU is still investigating Amazon (AMZN) and McDonald's (MCD). And the EU has also had longtime tax battles with Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB).Last year, Starbucks (SBUX) was ordered to pay 30 million euros ($33.4 million) in taxes back to the Netherlands. In January, Belgium was ordered to recover 700 million euros in taxes from 35 companies, including from BP (BP) and Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD), among others.Apple stock ended trading down 0.8% to 106 on the stock market today.""The ruling is disappointing, and while Apple is confident in an appeal, the process may take several years and may have a near-term sentiment overhang on the stock,"" Wells Fargo analyst Maynard Um said in a research report Tuesday.

In Q2, same-store sales growth accelerated to 14.4% from 13.9% in Q1, and up from 12.5% in Q4, 12.8% in Q3, and 10.1% a year earlier. Meanwhile, Gap (GPS) and department stores like Nordstrom (JWN) have posted negative comparable sales (-2% and -1.2%, respectively, in their most recent reports).The one blemish on Ulta's Q2 was the company's earnings guidance for Q3 -- a range of $1.25-$1.30 vs. consensus for $1.29 -- which might have dampened some enthusiasm.Still, Ulta's recent track record of outperforming retail peers has started to stir some disdain, at least online. But Zacks Research Equity Strategist Tracey Ryniec tweeted that some investor-commenters on StockTwits were ""getting more hostile"" amid Ulta's success ""because they don't 'get' the biz.""When asked whether it's male investors who aren't getting it, she replied:@IBD_elow Yes. They don't understand how it can be doing that well. But don't want to learn about it either.— Tracey Ryniec (@TraceyRyniec) August 25, 2016One male commenter acknowledged not getting Ulta's business, as he regretting missing out on its stock run.$ULTA Wish I'd invested in it ages ago. I look at it as a male and I think, ""how can so much money be spent on all this nonsense?"" #stocks— Hugh J. Robbins (@HughJRobbins) August 26, 2016Ulta shares were down 6.1% to 254.85 in the stock market today, undercutting their 50-day average for the first time since March. The stock is still up around 38% so far this calendar year.IBD'S TAKE: Got in on Ulta before this year's run but not sure if you should sell? IBD University has a few tips on when to take profits.The reaction from Wall Street analysts has been more positive. Nomura upped its Ulta price target to 287 from 244, and Cowen raised its target to 286 from 265 late Thursday following earnings, days after Piper Jaffray bumped up its target to 290 from 250.Lofty expectations appear to have gotten the better of Ulta on Friday, particularly as its previous three quarterly reports have prompted big gap-ups. And analysts note that high valuation is prompting some investor pushback.""We believe Street's high expectations were likely already priced into the shares ahead of the solid print, and we would be buyers on weakness,"" wrote Cowen's Oliver Chen, who has an outperform rating on the stock.Meanwhile, other Ulta metrics continue to shine. Its loyalty program grew about 28% to 20.6 million active members during the quarter, well ahead of other strong loyalty players such as Starbucks (SBUX), which has 12.3 million active U.S. and Canadian members at last count.RELATED:Ulta Beauty EPS Guidance Is Blemish On Priced-For-Perfection Stock

260,SBUX,"Starbucks (SBUX) appointed a CEO to its China division Wednesday as it looks to more than double its store count there to 5,000 by 2021, just another sign that the java giant is serious about making its mark in the country.Current President Belinda Wong is stepping into the role of chief executive of Starbucks China, effective immediately, and will oversee the unit's long-term growth strategy, innovation pipeline and e-commerce efforts.The company's expansion plans are a slightly accelerated version of prior targets. CEO Howard Schultz previously laid out a 3,400-store target in China by 2019, and believes it is possible for China to replace the Americas as Starbucks' largest market.There are currently over 2,300 Starbucks locations in China.In September, Starbucks announced plans to introduce its Teavana brand into more than 6,200 stores in China and Asia-Pacific, a 16-market segment that includes not just China but Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Australia and Thailand, among others.The tea rollout — which includes matcha-and-espresso iced drinks and grapefruit-and-honey black tea — is likely a bid for Asian consumers whose caffeine consumption may still lean toward tea.Meanwhile, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer cut his price target on the stock to 64 from 68 on Wednesday, citing lower same-store sales growth forecasts for fiscal 2017.Restaurant stocks haven't been doing so hot — pizza stocks excepted — and Starbucks remains well below its 50-day line since breaching the key level in early September. Shares haven't peered above the 200-day since July.IBD'S TAKE: Starbucks is more iced than hot right now, but Domino's Pizza, a peer in the sector, gapped up 4.9% on Tuesday on solid earnings and revenue. Investor's Business Daily spoke to Domino's CEO Patrick Doyle about the results: ""Domino's Earnings Sends Shares Higher, As CEO Sees Industry Mergers.""Starbucks rose 1% to 53.15 in the stock market today after falling to a 52-week low on Tuesday.

For the December quarter, Activision forecast non-GAAP earnings per share of 74 cents on sales of $2.38 billion. Wall Street was modeling 80 cents and $2.48 billion.Activision on Friday released what many analysts expect to be the top-selling game of the year in ""Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare,"" the latest in the company's lucrative ""Call of Duty"" franchise.Meanwhile, EA and Take-Two both topped expectations for the September quarter and raised their guidance.Mergers and acquisitions have overshadowed earnings reports from several major chipmakers.Mobile chip maker Qualcomm (QCOM), which plans to buy NXP SemiconductorsNXPI, on Wednesday said fiscal Q4 earnings per share excluding items rose 41% to $1.28 while sales rose 13% to $6.17 billion. Analysts expected EPS of $1.13 on sales of $5.84 billion.On Thursday, shares of chipmaker Microsemi (MSCC) soared on a report that fellow mixed-signal-chip expert Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) has approached it about a potential acquisition.

262,SBUX,"Twitter (TWTR) was upgraded, Amazon's (AMZN) price target was raised and Starbucks (SBUX) price target was cut Wednesday.Twitter was upgraded to hold from sell at Loop Capital.The social networking site had been the subject of buyout talks, but its reputation as a forum for nasty comments is a key reason why Walt Disney (DIS) and Salesforce.com (CRM) reportedly backed off making bids for the company.Twitter shares rose 1.4% to close at 17.07 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Disney might have turned away from a Twitter takeover but it reportedly has its eyes on Netflix. Netflix shares were up 19% on Tuesday, well above its 111.95 buy point on better-than-expected subscriber growth.Amazon's price target was raised to 905 from 847 at Pacific Crest. On Monday, Credit Suisse raised Amazon's price target to 1050 from 920, and reiterated its outperform rating on the stock.Last week, Amazon Web Services, the cloud services business of the e-commerce giant, and VMware (VMW) announced a partnership to sell a new ""hybrid"" cloud service.Amazon shares ended essentially unchanged at 817.69.Starbucks' price target was lowered to 64 from 68 at RBC Capital but the analysts still have an outperform rating on the stock.The coffee giant also announced Wednesday that it will double its store footprint in China to 5,000 by 2021.Starbucks shares rose 1% to 53.15.Intel's (INTC) price target was lowered to 37 from 38 at RBC Capital and to 42 from 43 at Needham.Late Tuesday, the chipmaker said it earned 80 cents a share in Q3, above the 73 cents analysts were expecting.

263,SBUX,"Stocks edged higher by noon time in New York on Wednesday, bolstered by strength in the oil patch. Banking and restaurant names also gained ground. Small caps outperformed.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs (GS) advanced 1.5% to 175.20 in heavy turnover as it broke out of a long, deep double bottom with a 172.52 buy point.The Nasdaq composite erased small early-morning gains to practically break-even levels. At 5244, the tech-rich index is still around 5 points shy of retaking its critical 50-day moving average.The NYSE composite gained nearly 0.4% as oil drilling, steel, oil and gas field services, super regional bank and money center bank stocks paced the upside. The S&P 500 edged 0.2% higher. Gains in Goldman, UnitedHealth (UNH), Boeing (BA) and Chevron (CVX) helped hoist the Dow Jones industrial average up around 0.3%.The Russell 2000 was up 0.5%.Goldman, as highlighted in this Oct. 10 Stock Market Today story, had been forming its bottoming-style base since shares started a steep decline in October 2015. After two sell-offs that led to two lows of 139.05 and 138.20 in February and June, respectively, the stock made an impressive rebound during the summer as Federal Reserve officials began warming up more to the idea of raising interest rates again in a gradual manner.Goldman posted a strong third quarter on Tuesday as earnings rocketed 68% to $4.88 a share on reported revenue of $8.2 billion. The bank saw assets under supervision rising to a record $1.35 trillion, including net inflows of $14 billion in long-term assets. Investment banking net revenue was virtually flat, while securities underwriting revenue grew 18%, thanks in large part to debt deals.The permissible buy zone in Goldman shares goes up to 5% past the proper 172.52 entry, or 181.15. Buying higher than that price can subject an investor to taking a fast loss if the stock stages a normal pullback following a breakout. As many as four out of 10 great stocks will ease back to or near the proper breakout level before rebounding.Goldman rival Morgan Stanley (MS) rose 1% to 32.57, edging past a 32.47 entry in a long cup with handle after reporting strong Q3 earnings of 80 cents a share, up 135% on a 14% climb in revenue. The earnings growth was boosted partly by an easy comparison; in the third quarter a year ago, profit slumped 52%.Also in the stock market today, the energy sector still ranks in the bottom half of IBD's daily ranking of 33 broad sectors at No. 20. Yet the gigantic sector is seeing pockets of strength.Parsley Energy (PE) jumped 3% to 37.10, good for a new high in heavy turnover. The oil and gas explorer is extended following multiple tests of support at or near its 50-day moving average since May.Domino's Pizza (DPZ) stretched its gains after robust Q3 results issued on Tuesday. The Leaderboard name gained 2% to 163.33 and is now up nearly 16% past a 114.90 buy point.Starbucks (SBUX), in the same restaurants industry group, gained 1% to 53.20 in heavy trading but is still well below its 50- and 200-day moving averages.

264,SBUX,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) tellers, Starbucks (SBUX) baristas and Wal-Mart (WMT) cashiers have all received a significant bump up in pay in recent months, and the latest round of earnings calls from Corporate America shows that they have plenty of company.In recent weeks, Wendy's (WEN), Ross Stores (ROST), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and others have said they're paying more as they compete for top talent, incentivize performance and keep up with minimum wage laws.The broad upward pressure on wages is still fairly modest, but it appears to be picking up, based on the latest Treasury data on federal income and employment taxes withheld from paychecks. In the past four weeks through Aug. 19, withheld taxes rose 4.7% from a year earlier, the fastest pace since the start of November.The data, which are roughly consistent with 2% growth in aggregate hours worked and 2.7% higher wages, still don't qualify as robust. By comparison, withheld taxes rose about 5.5% from a year earlier during the first half of 2015, and growth exceeded 7% for most of 2006.Yet the upward trend is worth watching, both because it could signal stronger consumer activity and because it could shift the Federal Reserve's view of the economy and the interest-rate outlook.IBD'S TAKE: With wage growth picking up, investors may want to focus on companies with a strong enough position in their markets to withstand labor inflation without suffering a hit to profit margins. Read this Investor's Corner on profit margins.Still, a continued acceleration in income growth isn't a sure thing. After weak productivity gains in recent years, companies are doing their best to do more with less by driving efficiencies, from managing inventory better at Wal-Mart to adopting self-pay kiosks at some Wendy's franchises.Here's what companies have been saying about labor costs:RELATED:Wal-Mart CEO: Sam's Club Shoppers Can Skip CashierFast Food Prices Have Never Risen So Fast Vs.

265,SBUX,"Do you breeze by IBD's Funds section each day? If yes, not so fast. Stop and absorb the useful hints, ideas and information offered there -- even to investors who prefer to build their own portfolios, rather than pay someone else to invest for them.In the ""Funds & Personal Finance"" section of the new IBD Weekly print edition, you'll find a small yet uniquely valuable featured ""Growth Funds Leading The Market."" In this box, you'll see two funds highlighted.These will be two of the market's 40 best funds, as determined by ownership of market leaders, highest average Composite Ratings and performance relative to the S&P 500.In the week of Aug. 22, IBD showcased two funds with excellent long-term performance: American Century Growth Investors (TWCGX) and Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX). Both specialize in large cap stockpicking.So, what will you see in each of these boxes? First, these funds' 10 largest U.S. holdings. Look carefully. You know by now that stocks live or die by institutional sponsorship. This is your chance to see what the big guys are accumulating.Going back in time, MFS Mid Cap Growth Fund (OTCAX) was featured in the Feb. 9, 2012, issue of IBD. Look at their top 10 holdings. See anything interesting?You'll find Ross Stores (ROST), which has since more than tripled after a breakout in mid-October of 2011. Ametek (AME), a maker of motors, power meters and transducers, was still within buying range from its recent push from a cup with handle before going on a long, steady run through the next two years. Since late 2015, Ametek has been in base-building mode, consolidating its big gains.Cosmetics name Estee Lauder (EL) also appeared within the top 10 holdings of the Columbia Mid Cap Growth Fund, also featured on the same day. The stock went on to build a number of bases amid a slow yet steady rally.As you scan through these top funds' holdings, you might feel vindicated by seeing names you may already have identified.

266,SBUX,"McDonald's (MCD) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) showed bearish action on the stock market Friday, as investors remained somewhat squeamish about restaurant trends generally.McDonald's fell 1.8% to 115.01 on Friday, hitting the lowest level in six months. It was the weakest close since early December. McDonald's is still struggling from reporting weaker-than-expected Q2 U.S. comps, partly due to broader consumer weakness. The all-day breakfast menu introduced late last year had fueled a turnaround, but investors are worried about growth drivers as comparisons get tougher.Meanwhile, McDonald's faces rising labor costs due to minimum-wage hikes and the company's own wage increases. Rising costs and weaker comps will squeeze margins, said Argus Research last week as it downgraded McDonald's.IBD'S TAKE: Rising labor costs are a problem for fast-food chains generally. Fast-food prices have never risen so fast vs. the cost of eating at home.  Chipotle Mexican Grill retreated 1.6% to 388.50, a three-year closing low. Chipotle is still trying to recover from last year's food-borne illness outbreaks. It's introduced a new menu item -- chorizo sausage -- and introduced its first loyalty program, Chiptopia. Chipotia is generous but complicated, so it's unclear how many people will use it aggressively and whether they'll keep dining at Chipotle in October.Starbucks (SBUX) fell 1.1% to its lowest level in nearly two months. Like McDonald's, Starbucks reported weak U.S. comps for its latest quarter but said that was an anomaly, vowing improvement. Still, a few days after the earnings report Starbucks stock met resistance at the 200-day line and began retreating, falling through its 50-day average as well.On the upside, Domino's Pizza (PZZA) and Papa John's (PZZA) have delivered strong results, sending shares to highs.Jack in the Box (JACK) spiked after its earnings report earlier this month and is now trading just below its all-time high of 99.99 set in March 2015. Notably, Jack in the Box owns Qdoba Mexican Eats, a rival chain to Chipotle.RELATED:

267,SBUX,"Americans' view of the economy rebounded in early August from the worst level in several years to the best since June 2015, according to the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index.The subgauge of the six-month economic outlook jumped to a still-dreary 44.7 from July's 36.7, which had matched the worst level since October 2013. The reading below the neutral 50 level still reflects a modestly pessimistic outlook.The improved sentiment comes amid news of higher wages from companies including Starbucks (SBUX) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and follows the stock market's recovery from a brief bout of selling after the U.K. vote to exit the European Union.The overall optimism index rose to 48.4, close to the best level since the spring of 2015, when sentiment briefly crossed into positive territory. The index had registered 45.5 in July, which was the lowest level of 2016.The Economic Optimism Index combines three components: the six-month economic outlook, the personal financial outlook and a gauge of confidence in federal policies that help steer the economy. Optimism about personal finances continued to lead the way, with that gauge rising to 58.0 from 57.2. Sentiment about federal policies remained negative, dipping to 42.5 from 42.7.""Americans' economic confidence sprung back from last month's extremely gloomy view driven by concerns about the global economy in the aftermath of Brexit,"" said Raghavan Mayur, president of TechnoMetrica, IBD's polling partner.Polling was done in the first week of August, which was capped off by news that the economy added 255,000 jobs last month.Separately, the National Federation of Independent Business reported on Tuesday that its Small Business Optimism Index rose slightly in July but remained on the soft side.A gauge of expected business conditions rose 4 points but remained negative, signaling that more firms think conditions will deteriorate. The share of firms expecting to add jobs dipped one point to a net 11%. Gauges of capital spending plans and job openings rose to the best level of the recovery but still remained muted compared to prior recoveries, the NFIB said.

268,SBUX,"Stocks bled again on Thursday, and losses were weighted more heavily in technology and certain medical sectors.Meanwhile, long-term government bond prices rose on both sides of the pond, sending the yield on the U.S. 10-year bond to around 1.8%. The 10-year U.K. bond yield edged back below 1.20% to around 1.18%, according to Tradeweb, after British judges ruled that only the U.K. Parliament can formally begin the process of the country's exit from the EU.Commodities fell, led by a 1.2% slide in West Texas intermediate crude oil futures to $44.78 a barrel. Gold edged 0.4% lower on the Comex, while silver slid 1.9%.The Nasdaq 100 fell 1%, a touch worse than the 0.9% drop by the Nasdaq composite.Apple (AAPL) fell slightly more than 1% to 109.83, dipping back below its 110.33 cup-with-handle breakout point for the first time since its Sept. 14 breakout in towering volume. That's a sell signal. Watch to see if the stock can hold close to that proper entry and begin a fresh rebound.With the market still in a pressured uptrend and distribution still heavy recently on both key indexes, it's not a surprise that other growth stocks have joined Apple in stumbling back near or below their prime entry points, especially in the field of medical devices.Abiomed (ABMD), down 1.6% to 102.51, has fallen nearly 30% in just four weeks. The heart pump innovator is back below a 105.05 cup-with-handle entry.Also in the medical sector, artificial joint replacement maker Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) edged 0.5% higher to 102.54, but only after having fallen more than 20% below its 52-week high; it's now hovering near 102, roughly 3% below a 105.58 entry in a long bottoming base. Zimmer earlier this week plummeted 14% after reporting a 9% rise in Q3 earnings to $1.79 a share. That marked the second quarter in a row of decelerating profit growth.Sales rose just 4% after the Warsaw, Ind., firm notched gains of 59%, 58%, 68% and 66% in the prior four quarters, thanks to a merger with Biomet that completed in June 2015.The S&P 500 dropped 0.4% as generic drug, medical services, drug wholesale, biotech and gaming stocks paced the decline. The Dow Jones industrials lost 0.2%. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) is another market leader that has recently drifted back to prior buy point.

The stock is also trying to reclaim its 50-day moving average.Wall Street saw the video game creator's quarterly profit doubling to 42 cents a share on a 51% pickup in revenue to $1.57 billion. After the close, Activision met that consensus estimate and exceeded its prior outlook of $1.49 billion, while non-GAAP earnings vaulted to 49 cents, crushing Wall Street's view by nearly 17%.The company reported 482 million monthly active users who logged more than 10 billion hours of play during the three-month period. CEO Bobby Kotick noted in a news release that its newest futuristic battle game franchise, ""Overwatch,"" has ""incredible player engagement"" and has topped 20 million players in four months.Activision also forecast Q4 net revenue at $1.86 billion, up 38% vs.  year ago. The stock initially fell nearly 3% in extended-hours trading but later rebounded to nearly break-even.Elsewhere in the stock market today, solar firms got trampled after former huge market winner First Solar (FSLR) reported a 46% plunge in third-quarter sales to $688 million, its worst year-over-year decline in more than three years.Earnings beat Wall Street views, yet still dropped 64% to $1.22 a share. The stock tanked 15% to 34.51, notching the lowest level since April 2013.Starbucks (SBUX), down 2% to 51.77, gained more than 1% after hours following news that the coffeehouse chain posted a 16% rise in non-GAAP earnings to 56 cents a share, including 6 cents stemming from an extra week of operation in the September-ended fourth quarter. Revenue grew 16% to $5.7 billion, and the company opened 690 net new stores, raising the total to 25,085 in 75 countries.The stock has been struggling since gapping lower on April 22 and losing support at both its 50- and 200-day moving averages.

The ratio of bearish vs. bullish options…
"
272,SBUX,"Even as employment growth is moderating, wage growth is accelerating. That's the clear message from the broadest, most timely gauge of the state of the job market.Federal income and employment taxes withheld from workers' paychecks rose 5.0% from a year ago in the 10 weeks through Oct. 11, an IBD analysis of IRS data finds. That's the fastest growth in 13 months, and it's consistent with what a lot of public companies have been saying and doing.Starbucks (SBUX) on Oct. 3 gave a wage hike of at least 5% to every barista and manager at all of its U.S. stores. In July, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon announced that the company would boost the minimum wage for 18,000 tellers and customer service workers from $10.15 to $12 over two years.In February, Wal-Mart (WMT) boosted its minimum wage to $10 an hour, part of a $1.5 billion annual wage hike for 1.2 million U.S. workers. On top of that, Wal-Mart paid out $201 million in second-quarter bonuses to hourly workers at nearly all its stores for meeting performance targets based on cleanliness, service and checkout speed.Coming as the pace of job gains has slowed — the U.S. added 1 million nonfarm jobs over the past six months compared with 1.4 million in the prior six months, Labor Department data show — the faster rise in aggregate federal tax withholdings clearly points to a bigger increase in per-worker wages and salaries, supplemented by incentive pay.A pickup in wage growth runs counter to the dovish case for Federal Reserve policy. As detailed in the minutes from the Fed's September meeting, most members voted to hold rates, citing, in part, ""few signs of increased pressure on wages.""Markets have been adjusting as investors begin to believe that a series of rate hikes is on the way, albeit at a slow pace. The 10-year Treasury yield hit a four-month high of 1.78% on Wednesday and the U.S. dollar index has climbed to a seven-month high against other major currencies. Treasury yields and the dollar gave up some ground on Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: Federal Reserve hawks lost the rate-hike battle in September, but they're winning the policy war, meeting minutes show.While wage pressures can differ based on industry and region, many companies might beg to differ with the Fed's dovish perception. Management of the Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) chain of steakhouses said in an Aug. 1 earnings call that it had limited wage increases to 3.5%, but had seen employee turnover spike to 120% of hourly workers on an annual basis, down from 20% several years ago.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart also boosted minimum salaries for assistant store managers to $48,500 from $45,000, effective September, to avoid being liable for overtime pay under a new Obama administration rule set to take effect in December. Yet it's not clear that the Labor Department rule guaranteeing time-and-a-half pay for salaried workers earning up to $47,476 — twice the current level — is doing much to raise incomes.For example, Carrols Restaurant Group (TAST), whose 717 Burger King locations make it the Restaurant Brands International (QSR) chain's largest franchisee, said that it is ""putting all of our salaried managers on an hourly basis"" to avoid any cost increase.RELATED:Investors Are Finally Getting With The Fed's Program — Are You?Overtime Rule Fallout: Fast Food Managers Told To Punch Clock

273,SBUX,"After more than a year of field testing, Facebook (FB) has officially taken the wraps off the long-awaited version of its social network for businesses communications.Called Workplace, formerly known as Facebook at Work, the new site is a separate version of Facebook that can be accessed only from a company's internal technology systems and is not connected to a user's existing Facebook account.Organizations have used Workplace on an invite-only basis for the past 18 months. Facebook said more than 1,000 organizations worldwide now use Workplace, with the largest concentration in the U.S., India, Norway, U.K. and France. Current users include Starbucks (SBUX), Royal Bank of Scotland, Priceline Group's (PCLN) Booking.com and international nonprofits such as Oxfam,""We're excited by the progress we've made and the level of adoption and engagement we're seeing,"" according to an official Facebook blog post. Workplace is now available for ""any company or organization that wants to use it.""The new service is primarily set up as a business communications tool, with features that include group chats and live video, and with extra security features. Facebook expects Workplace will help companies discover new ways of working and making faster decisions.Workplace will cost $3 per user per month, with the cost declining for users above 1,000. There are no current plans to sell ads, Facebook said. It's free for nonprofits and educational institutions.In the workplace communications market, Workplace will compete with offerings from Salesforce.com (CRM), Slack Technologies and Microsoft (MSFT), which is in the process of acquiring LinkedIn (LNKD).Facebook stock rose 1% to 130.24 in the stock market today. The stock hit a record high of 131.98 on Sept. 7 and broke out the previous day at a 128.43 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: New products or services are part of the N in IBD's CAN SLIM investing system. Strong earnings growth (the C and A in the CAN SLIM System) is the No. 1 factor to look for in a stock, but new products or services ultimately generate stellar profitability. Facebook is an IBD Leaderboard stock, with a Composite Rating of 99, the highest possible, as well as an EPS Rating of 99. To help more companies get started with Workplace, Facebook announced its  Workplace Partner Program, a group of technology and professional service organizations such as Deloitte that will help Workplace businesses across the globe.RELATED:Facebook Is 'Still King' With Young Adults Despite Snapchat: CowenFacebook Earnings Beats Are Consistent But Will Get HarderFacebook Instagram Keeps Clicking As Advertisers Double In 6 Months

274,SBUX,"The U.S. economy added 156,000 jobs in September, coming in modestly below expectations of 168,000, the Labor Department said Friday. The jobless rate rose to 5.0%.The 151,000 job gain initially reported in August was revised up to 167,000, but the prior month was revised down by 23,000 (from 275,000 to 252,000).The report is unlikely to shift the Federal Reserve's December timetable for hiking its key interest rate. A hike in November — just before the election — is seen as doubtful. But markets have been on edge lately about the possibility of faster-than-expected hikes in 2017, with the 10-year Treasury yield closing at a four-month high on Thursday.Do You Use An Online Broker? Now's the chance to tell how well your needs are met. IBD's annual investor survey on brokers' performance is underway. Click to take the survey now. Stocks opened modestly higher but closed lower with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both losing 0.3%.Average hourly earnings rose 0.2% from September and 2.6% from a year ago, just off the 2.7% cycle high for hourly wage growth marked in July.In recent months, companies have been raising wages and talking about rising, if still moderate, wage pressures. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Starbucks (SBUX) and Wal-Mart (WMT) have hiked their minimum wage. Wendy's (WEN), Ross Stores (ROST), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and others have said they're paying more as they compete for top talent, incentivize performance and keep up with minimum wage laws.The workweek ticked higher to 34.4 hours after sinking over the summer, suggesting a bit less slack in the labor force than indicated by the August report. Along the same lines, the household survey showed that 444,000 people entered the workforce last month, increasing the participation rate to 62.9%. The rise in the jobless rate, up from 4.9% in recent months, came because more people joined the workforce than reported having jobs, even though the latter number grew by 354,000.IBD'S TAKE: How can you tell if a jobs report is too hot, too cold, or just right? Markets may react negatively or positively on the day of the report, but the key for investors is to stay abreast of the market's prevailing trend. Visit IBD University for a primer on how to time the stock market and read The Big Picture column every day.A weaker-than-expected report isn't likely to trouble the Fed, since most policymakers think that the U.S. is close to full employment — the point at which job gains only need to match the net additions to the workforce, or else wage and inflation pressures will intensify.John Williams, president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve, laid out that case that monthly job gains should slow back in August: ""The current pace of job gains is well above what we need, which I put to be somewhere around 80,000 a month, although estimates range from 50,000 to around 100,000.""Williams added: ""We should expect the pace of job gains to slow, and no one should be alarmed when it does.""With two more jobs reports after this one before the Fed meets Dec. 13 and 14, some economists are saying that it would take three weak reports in a row to derail a year-end hike.RELATED:The Goldilocks Economy Is Shrinking When It Comes To Jobs

275,SBUX,"Apple (AAPL) is facing a potential tax bill running into billions of euros, with the European Union poised to release a finding into its dealings in Ireland as soon as Tuesday, according to people familiar with the situation.The European Commission decision is expected to say Ireland provided the iPhone maker with illegal aid through a sweetheart deal in return for creating jobs in the nation, the people said on condition of anonymity because the details are confidential. Ireland has vowed to fight any adverse finding.In preliminary findings in 2014, European competition authorities said Apple's tax arrangements were improperly designed to give the company a financial boost. There's a range of estimates on the scale of arrears which may face Apple. In a worst-case scenario, Apple may face a $19 billion bill if the government ultimately loses and is forced to recoup tax from the company, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Rod Hall. The Irish Times reported on Monday that the figure might be not much more than 100 million euros ($112 million).The European Commission declined to comment on a decision that's still pending or on the timing of its announcement.Apple said it had nothing to add to previous statements rejecting suggestions it received selective treatment from Irish officials. The ministry declined to comment.IBD'S TAKE: Apple's tax case is about past actions, but investors are looking forward. Will Apple revive growth with the upcoming iPhone 7? We'll get our first look with an Apple event Sept. 7.""A state aid ruling against Ireland is likely to bring the country's corporation tax regime back into focus,"" said Dermot O'Leary, an economist at Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin. ""However, the commission investigation relates to two rulings given to Apple in 1991 and 2007. So a critical issue will be how the final decision relates to the current Irish tax code or to previously amended policy.""The commission in January ordered Belgium to recover about 700 million euros in illegal tax breaks to at least 35 companies, including Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) and BP (BP). And last year, for example, Starbucks (SBUX) was ordered to pay 30 million euros in back taxes to the Dutch government.

276,SBUX,"The restaurant industry did not have what you would call an amazing quarter. A muddling economy that has left many behind, ISIS-inspired violence that has become harder to anticipate, a U.S. election that finds new ways each day to insult our intelligence -- all of these factors have made spending on restaurants less enticing. Other issues, like discounting and cheaper groceries, have also dragged sales lower.But pizza chains like Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) are way up in the wake of their second-quarter results, unlike McDonald's (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), Wendy's (WEN) and others.In fact, Domino's Pizza stock is up 31% so far this year, and Papa John's is up 33%, while IBD's Retail-Restaurants group is up just 5%. Starbucks has lost 7%, and McDonald's has advanced just 1%.Domino's and McDonald's shares rose 0.1% on the stock market today, while Starbucks was flat. Papa John's slid 0.65%.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Domino's Pizza broke out of a cup-with-handle base following the company's most recent quarterly results. Learn more about the basics of how and when to buy stocks here.While pizza stocks weren't the only strong performers in the industry this quarter, Domino's was the only one of the 25 largest restaurant concepts in America to turn out at least 5% same-store sales growth in the second quarter, Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski said.What happened? Analysts cite value -- for both customers and the businesses themselves -- convenience, and a digital ordering platform that isn't just lip service to technology.KeyBanc said in a recent research note that the pizza sector stood to benefit from the uncertainty as more people opt to order in. On the value front, you can feed a few people for not that much money, and pizza's main ingredients are cheaper, helping pad margins.What's more, pizza has been delivered to household doors for decades. For Domino's and Papa John's, that facilitates the transition to digital ordering -- over a mobile device -- which for many is far more pleasant and convenient than ordering via a phone call.""When you look at the model for pizza delivery,"" Kalinowski said, ""that lends itself to digital ordering that most other parts of the restaurant industry don't.""While he said that digital ordering platforms will become more prevalent over time, some restaurants are more mobile-friendly than others. Starbucks, for instance, has a customer frequency that other restaurants don't, he said, so mobile ordering makes sense. For other restaurants, the returns on investing in mobile have been less certain.""It's almost like a keeping up with the Joneses problem,"" Kalinowski said.Pizza is also more mobile-order-friendly because of the way people eat it -- a single pie serves more people; that means less time ordering a bunch of individual items for each person in a group.""The thought process of ordering a pizza is relatively limited, other than a couple different toppings and a couple different pies,"" Tigress analyst Ivan Feinseth said. ""For the most part, the majority will agree on what to get on pizza. Ordering Chinese food (is) much more difficult. Ordering Italian food (is) much more difficult.""

CVS Pay operates on Apple iOS and Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google Android devices and is now part of the CVS Pharmacy mobile app.The app integrates mobile payments, prescription pickup and the company's ExtraCare loyalty program. After downloading the app, a customer shows a bar code, which a sales clerk will scan to ring up the purchase, sending a confirmation to the customer.CVS shares dipped 0.1% to 97 on the stock market today. Archrival Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) rose 0.5%, and Walgreens' buyout target Rite Aid (RAD) climbed 1.1%. Apple fell 0.1%, Starbucks slid 0.3% and Wal-Mart eased 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: CVS Health stock offers an entry point at 113.75 but hasn't yet formed a base. For more on signs that a stock is a good prospect, go to ""When to Buy Stocks"" in IBD University.Last week, CVS reported an 8.2% hike in diluted earnings per share, beating analyst views.

Its 16 markets in that segment are Australia, Brunei, Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.Starbucks shares, down early, finished the trading session 0.7% higher to 54.71 on the stock market today.The biggest brand launch since its 2008 VIA Ready Brew rollout, Teavana represents an ""important growth opportunity,"" said Starbucks in a release, reiterating that the tea brand is a strategic priority for the company, and that its overall tea business grew 12% domestically in 2015.The announcement comes less than two months after the company reported weak same-store sales in North America, though management described the event as an ""anomaly"" amid the integration of its overhauled, sometimes-maligned loyalty program.IBD'S TAKE: Starbucks' shares have been consolidating since the coffee retailer reached an all-time intraday high of 64 Oct. 30. Last week's market sell-off put Starbucks below all three indicators: the 50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages. The retail-restaurant sector ranks 125th out of 197 groups from IBD.

284,SBUX,"Like other restaurant chains this earnings season, Shake Shack (SHAK) said on its second-quarter earnings call that Brexit, terrorism abroad and global economic strains could remain troubling, even though the fast-casual burger chain said it remained upbeat about the future.""Internationally, we are not immune to global economic and political uncertainty,"" Shake Shack CEO Randy Garutti said on the call Wednesday.He added that ""recent terrorism in Istanbul"" would continue to hurt business at its four locations there. A shooting and suicide bombing in June at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport, Turkey's largest, killed 45 people. Then, last month, a failed coup attempt by a faction in the military resulted in a massive government purge from the nation's military, legal system, education system and media.Garutti also said that the company's Middle East business -- its website lists 26 locations in the region -- ""continues to experience headwinds, given the regional challenges, and the volatility of the oil market.""The U.K.'s vote in June to leave the European Union, he said, also ""brings new uncertainty"" that could keep the pound weak against the dollar. Garutti said Shake Shack would ""temper our near-term expectations.""McDonald's (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX) also described a less-certain consumer during their earnings calls.Shares sank 6.2% to 38.35 in the stock market today, though they are currently holding above their 50-day and 200-day moving averages.That followed weaker-than-expected Q2 same-store sales growth. However, Shake Shack's Q2 earnings per share and overall revenue beat Street estimates, and the company raised full-year revenue guidance above views.Shake Shack also said it expected to open 18 domestic company-run locations this year, up from 16.IBD'S TAKE: While people might have been more reluctant to dine out during the second quarter, stocks like Domino's Pizza, Papa John's and GrubHub -- which lean more on digital ordering, delivery and takeout -- are way up comparatively. Read more about the fast-food and burger wars here. The sight of more empty tables at restaurants ""may be the result of consumers eating more at home amid the current political/social backdrop, which we believe could last through the November election,"" according to a KeyBanc analyst report cited by MarketWatch.Stocks like Papa John's (PZZA), whose business depends more on pickup and delivery, stand to benefit as a result, the note said.Papa John's and Domino's Pizza (DPZ) are among the minority of restaurants to report strong earnings reports. Domino's is slightly extended from a breakout last month following quarterly results. Papa John's is consolidating near highs, forming a handle with a 78.19 buy point.Lower grocery-store prices and some harsh weather in some parts of the U.S. also weighed on second-quarter restaurant sales.Shake Shack's play for a higher-end fast-food consumer, however, means it doesn't have to worry as much about competing on value meals, the way traditional fast-food chains do.The company, SunTrust analyst Jake Bartlett said in a note, ""is largely immune to the current industry slowdown given its differentiation."" And Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said that the firm viewed Shake Shack's ""softness as temporary"". Others felt it was a good time to buy the stock, saying that even though its valuation has fallen its long-term potential remains strong.Newer menu items and limited-time offerings also helped, management said. The Chick'n Shack sandwich accounted for 8.4% of Q2 sales. Its Bacon Cheddar Shack ""has been the best performing LTO (limited time offering) we've run since we launched the LTO program last year."" The company has also tried out breakfast menu items in a handful of spots.Those menu adjustments come as restaurants try to draw new customers without cluttering up their menus and losing their identity. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), another fast-casual chain often praised for its concise menu, also said that the addition of chorizo to its menus had helped draw customers.Shake Shack also said it had higher labor costs during the quarter, but that the impact was cushioned by its sales growth. Management said on the call that they ""still expect labor pressure"" this year, following a recent wage increase.""But as we get to the second half of the year, we're going to continue to invest in our teams, in this competitive environment, to get the right people, in order to get the people that we need, in order to continue to execute the way that we have,"" CFO Jeff Uttz said on the call.McDonald's rose 0.5% Thursday, while Domino's Pizza gained 0.7% and Papa John's 0.9%. Starbucks fell 0.3%.

285,SBUX,"Square's (SQ) Q2 beat-and-raise won the payment processing firm five price target hikes, partly on views that its strategy of selling multiple products to small businesses is working, though one investment bank lowered its price target.San Francisco-based Square continues to target small businesses, but it's attracting bigger customers within that sector, analysts say. Square makes credit card readers that plug into mobile phones and tablets. But it also has expanded into providing financing and bank loans to small businesses, as well as into the food delivery business. Square also is reportedly revving up a person-to-person payment system using a messaging app slated for launch this year.""Square's Q2 results are a validation of the company's innovative services, strong relationships with sellers, large addressable market and opportunity to cross-sell a variety of additional services, with Square Capital serving as a shining example,"" Michael Graham, a Canaccord Genuity analyst, said in a research report. ""While we view Square's momentum quite positively, our reservations with the stock center on valuation and the likelihood that margin expansion is still likely to materialize slower than investors expect.""Graham bumped up his price target by a dollar, as did analysts at Evercore ISI, Morgan Stanley and Compass Point. SunTrust Banks raised its price target to 13 from 11, but Wedbush Securities lowered its price target to 8 from 10.Square stock finished the day up 8.4% to 11.32 on the stock market today, near 12 and  hitting a three-month high. Square's disappointing Q1 report had sent its stock tanking 22%, but late Wednesday the company reported Q2 adjusted revenue that topped views and raised its full-year revenue guidance.""Ancillary products and services are gaining traction, and Square is having success with bringing larger sellers to the platform,"" Stifel analyst Scott Devitt said in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Square went public at 9 in November and peaked at nearly 16 on March 31. It then fell 32% before Thursday's rebound. IBD provides regular updates on leading IPO stocks.Square said it lost 8 cents per share on a GAAP basis, compared with a 20 cent loss in the year-earlier period.""Going forward, we expect continued outperformance vs. expectations driven by Square Capital, cross-selling opportunities and a continued expansion into larger merchants,"" said Barclays analyst Darrin Peller in a report.Square said Q2 adjusted revenue -- sales minus transactions with Starbucks (SBUX) and other partners -- jumped to $171 million, up 54% from the year-earlier period. Analysts had modeled adjusted revenue of $158 million and net revenue of $406 million.Square said it expects Q3 adjusted revenue of $169 million, up 43% from $118 million in Q3 2015, vs. analysts estimate of $164 million. Square raised its 2016 adjusted revenue guidance to $662.5 million at the midpoint of its guidance range, where analysts had modeled $643 million.

287,SBUX,"Today's Investor's Corner kicks off a short series of articles detailing why some breakouts fail and how to handle them when they do.Failures are not at all unusual. They are generally simple to handle so long as you cut losses and keep a careful eye on your quarry.Teen retail chain rue21 staged what looked like a very solid breakout on July 7, 2011 (1) (weekly chart is shown). The five-month cup with handle was just 23% deep. The base was a first-stage pattern, and the stock had been public for less than two years, also a plus.But some red flags were waving.Institutional activity over the course of the base was skewed toward distribution. This activity rippled into the handle (2). The volume, rather than drying up along the length of the handle, was jerky, with heavier weekly volume on the downside. This isn't the kind of orderly shakeout you like to see ahead of a breakout.The handle also dipped nearly 15%, beyond the 12% limit that defines a well-behaved stock.The breakout, a powerful 8% spike in better than double its average trade, past a 34.93 buy point did not erase these elements of risk.Rue21 rose for two days, then began a rapid pullback in generally light trade. It dropped to a test of 50-week support, violating the 8% sell rule July 27 (3). Technically, this marked a failed breakout.In real terms, the breakout still had a fighting chance. A great many breakouts -- particularly in the challenging market of late -- have pulled back below the 8% loss level, then reversed to retake the buy point and move on to new highs.Recent examples include Hi-Tech Pharmacal and Starbucks (SBUX) in September and October 2011. More recently, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Nu Skin Enterprises (NUS) and W.W. Grainger (GWW) have recovered after triggering the golden sell rule to retake new highs.The lesson: Keep your eye on the ball, even if it has failed.Rue21's death knell came in the first two sessions of August (4). The stock cut its 50-day moving average with a big loss in mildly above-average trade Aug. 1 (please see a daily chart). On Aug. 2, it sliced its 200-day line with an even larger drop in heavier volume.The stock has since failed to regain its 50-day moving average. It's 42% below the July buy point.(Editor's Note: This story was originally published in the Jan. 9, 2012, edition of IBD.)

288,SBUX,"Outside of pizza joints like Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA), a broad swath of restaurant stocks haven't been too hot this year amid consumer anxieties and uncertainty from global affairs, and even one-time leader Panera (PNRA) is breaking down.The breadth of the sell-off has also been notable: Fast-food, fast-casual and casual-dining stocks have not been spared. And on Wednesday, Wedbush cut its price target on Starbucks (SBUX) to 65 from 70 and said restaurant checks point to 4% Americas same-store sales growth in the fourth quarter, below consensus for 5% comp growth.But he also noted that even with a deceleration, that lower full-year projected comp trajectory ""remains among the best in restaurants.""Starbucks shares dipped 0.4% to 53.98. IBD's restaurants industry group, which includes Starbucks, Chipotle (CMG) and others, is up 1.9% so far for the year vs. the S&P 500's 6.2% gain year to date. The group ranks 104th out of 197 tracked by IBD.Panera closed with a loss of 0.7% at 192.18, cutting through the bottom of the flat base it had been forming, and has lost about 15% since a late-July high.IBD's TAKE: Panera Bread, Dave & Buster's, Shake Shack and Buffalo Wild Wings are setting up for possible short opportunities. For more on short selling, read IBD's column The Short Side.Also Wednesday, RBC Capital Markets analysts pointed to relative at-home food deflation weighing on restaurant industry sales, adding that fast-food same-store sales growth has continued to be ""relatively slow.""""With comparisons becoming more difficult, our guess is that industry SSS (same-store sales) could turn flat to slightly negative in the fall and winter quarters,"" wrote analysts in a collective note on the state of the consumer.RBC added that McDonald's (MCD) all-day breakfast offerings could help it to lap last year's figures, however, and Wendy's (WEN) seems to have overcome its slow start to Q3. But he said Restaurant Brands' (QSR) Burger King ""has struggled to regain momentum in the current promotional environment.""Meanwhile, Sonic (SONC), which fell short of its own sales and profit expectations, blamed the miss mainly on ""lower-than-expected traffic, reflecting lower consumer spending in restaurants and continued aggressive competitive activity,"" according to Sonic CEO Cliff Hudson in a preliminary earnings release.Sonic shares plunged 7.2% Wednesday to close at 25.44.RELATED:Investors Are Losing Faith In McDonald's, Losing Hope In ChipotleWhy Domino's, Papa John's Are Hot Restaurant Stocks Now

289,SBUX,"Nonfarm payrolls rose by 255,000 in July, the Labor Department said Friday morning, much better than expected for a second straight month, and reviving sentiment about the U.S. economy. But while the Federal Reserve will take notice, markets aren't expecting Fed action for several months.The jobless rate held at 4.9%, while hourly earnings rose 0.3% and the workweek nudged higher.Economists expected nonfarm payrolls up 185,000, the jobless rate dipping to 4.8% and average hourly earnings 0.3% higher.Also, June's strong figure was revised up by 5,000 to 292,000. May's weak hiring was revised up by 13,000 to 24,000.""Maybe it's not morning in America, but the coffee is brewing and jobs are being created,"" said Joel Naroff, president and chief economist of Naroff Economic Advisors.Professional services, hospitality, retail and government sectors were key contributors. Manufacturing also rose in a broad-based gain. Mining, which includes oil drilling, showed further declines.The labor force participation rate rose 0.1 point for a second straight month to 62.8% as the labor force climbed by 407,000. The household survey, from which the unemployment rate is derived, showed an employment gain 0f 420,000.""The July jobs report was uniformly positive and strong,"" said IHS Chief Economist Nariman Behravesh in statement. He said the strong labor force gain ""signals greater confidence among US workers about job prospects.""Behravesh did note that ""as the economy approaches and reaches full employment, the pace of jobs gains is likely to slow.""Stocks soared on the jobs report, with the S&P 500 hitting a fresh high and the Nasdaq composite rising to within 1% of its all-time best.Normally, back-to-back strong jobs reports and bullish markets would raise the specter of a Federal Reserve rate hike. But with other economic reports looking less robust -- and other central banks such as the Bank of England and Bank of Japan increasing monetary stimulus --- U.S. policymakers are still seen on hold for the foreseeable future.Fed funds futures peg the odds of a September or November meeting hike below 20%, vs. below 10% before the jobs report. The odds don't top 50% until next March, though investors see a reasonable chance of a December move.""Given the unevenness of the data and still-present imbalance in the economy across sectors with a relatively solid consumer and markedly weak business investment, policy makers are likely to wait for further information regarding the longer-term trajectory of activity,"" wrote Stifel Fixed Income chief economist Lindsey Piegza.Strong hiring and solid wage gains --  holding at post-recession high of 2.6% vs. a year earlier -- should underpin consumer spending, which the economy has relied on even more in recent months. Consumer spending rose at a brisk 4.2% annual rate in the second quarter, even as the overall economy grew about 1% for a third straight quarter.But recent corporate reports have raised doubts about consumer-related stocks and perhaps the broader economy.Apple (AAPL) reported a second straight quarter of declining earnings and revenue. Apple shares have rallied as per-share earnings and iPhone sales topped weak forecasts, but they reflect weak demand.IBD'S TAKE: For a more detailed look at consumer-related stocks' recent woes, click here.Ford Motor (F) last week missed second-quarter earnings estimates, citing sluggish U.S. sales and higher incentive spending climbed. Ford predicted domestic industry sales would fall in 2016 and 2017. On Tuesday, Ford and General Motors (GM) reported declining sales vs. a year earlier. Other automakers generally reported weaker-than-expected results.Meanwhile, McDonald's (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX) also have reported weaker-than-expected U.S. comps, both citing consumer unease in part. Several analysts see restaurant stocks in trouble generally, though pizza chains are doing well.Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Tuesday reported weak July unit revenue, hitting airline stocks that day.Despite retailers' headwinds, the sector added 25,000 jobs last month.Manufacturing added 15,000, the best since January. Auto production had been a manufacturing driver for several years. If Ford, General Motors and others see flat to lower sales for the foreseeable future, that could hurt factory output and jobs. And with oil prices well off midyear highs, any hoped-for revival in energy-related jobs may also be short-lived.

290,SBUX,"Restaurant Brands International (QSR) on Thursday reported a drop in same-restaurant sales at Burger King's U.S. and Canada locations for the first time in some three years, an analyst noted, as restaurants nationwide struggle with deepening customer anxieties.But the fast-food giant said it remained confident about its direction and didn't offer much commentary about the state of the consumer.McDonald's (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX) have described uncertainties stemming from global upheaval, high-profile shootings, terrorist attacks and a chaotic election season. But Restaurant Brands wasn't as introspective, with management noting increased competition and repeating the common refrain of a challenging environment.""The industry changes from time to time,"" CEO Daniel Schwartz said on the company's earnings call. ""We try to get too focused on macroeconomic changes.""Same-restaurant sales growth at Burger King locations in the U.S. and Canada fell 0.8%. The last time comps in that region fell into negative territory was 2013, Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh said in a research note.With the exception of Burger King's Asia-Pacific regions, comps slowed across the board for Burger King and Tim Hortons, which Restaurant Brands also owns.Overall, same-restaurant sales at Burger King rose 0.6%, slowing considerably from 6.7% growth a year earlier. Comps at Tim Hortons slowed to 2.7% from 5.5% growth.Top- and bottom-line results were mixed during the second quarter. Total revenue edged down to $1.04 billion, compared to analysts' expectations for $1.043 billion. The stronger U.S. dollar weighed on revenue. Earnings per share rose 38% to 41 cents, topping estimates for 34 cents.Restaurant Brands shares closed up 3.4% at 46.31 in the stock market today, just above buy territory after breaking out last month. McDonald's edged up 0.7%, and Starbucks lost 0.9%. Jack In The Box (JACK), which reported strong quarterly results late Wednesday, jumped 10.6%. Wendy's (WEN) added 2%.IBD'S TAKE: Competitive discounting, potential overexpansion and consumer unease have hurt sales across much of the restaurant sector. However, Restaurant Brands' stock is one of the few in the sector to stay above its key 50-day line. Compare and contrast industry players at IBD's Stock Checkup.Restaurant Brands has tried to shift toward more of a franchisee-led model, which shifts more expenses from corporate onto independent restaurant operators.While fast-casual rival Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) has tried to keep its menu simple, Restaurant Brands has in recent months has tried to brighten up its offering with occasional new products. Tim Hortons has launched iced coffee drinks and steak sandwiches. Burger King, meanwhile, has introduced grilled hot dogs and and Mac n' Cheetos.

291,SBUX,"Indiana's Thomas Marshall, who was America's vice president 100 years ago, voiced — he plucked it from a Hoosier humorist — one of the few long-remembered utterances to issue from that office: ""What this country needs is a good 5-cent cigar,"" which would be $1.11 in today's currency. A century later, what the country needs is a $12 twelve-ounce cup of coffee.Or so Howard Schultz thinks. Betting against the man who built Starbucks (SBUX) to a market capitalization of $86 billion is imprudent.Today, you cannot swing a dead cat without hitting a Starbucks store. There are 25,000 in 75 countries, with another 12,000 due by 2021, so Starbucks is not an elusive or exclusive experience. This poses a problem peculiar to affluent societies, and an opportunity. Seattle, where the original Starbucks was opened in 1971, now has a Starbucks Roastery where customers can turn a cup of ""small-batch"" coffee into an experience — Starbucks sells experiences as much as coffee — of both conspicuous consumption and conspicuous connoisseurship. Bloomberg reports that for a pittance, aka $10, skinflints will be able to buy a cold-brew coffee, which presumably is an excellent thing, infused with nitrogen gas, which sounds like an acquired taste.Many existing Starbucks are located to capture foot traffic in malls and shopping centers, which have been losing customers to online shopping. The original 30 Roasteries — Reuters says they will be ""ultra-premium,"" not mere tacky premium — will be destinations where people will go to linger. So, by 2021, when there will be more normal Starbucks than McDonald's, the few Starbucks Roasteries scattered from New York to Shanghai will be Starbucks' entry into the positional economy.Very pricey coffee is just a fresh-brewed variation on the familiar phenomenon of positional goods. They are necessarily, inherently enjoyments for the few. They exist because, particularly in the upper reaches of affluent societies, it is not love that makes the world go 'round, it is a compound of envy and pretentiousness.Four decades ago, the economist Fred Hirsch distinguished between the material economy and the positional economy. Once a society has satisfied basic material needs (food, shelter, clothing), it turns yesterday's luxuries (cars, air conditioning, college educations) into necessities. Because these are mass-market commodities, such material prosperity is a leveling, egalitarian force. Positional competition is emphatically not.In the competition for an ""elite"" education or an ""exclusive"" vacation spot, one person's success is necessarily a loss for many other persons because positional goods cannot be expanded indefinitely. Of course, Starbucks Roasteries could be expanded by the thousands, but this would make the ""experience"" banal and drain the stores of their positional power.After elementary needs — food, shelter, clothing — are satisfied, consumption nevertheless continues, indeed it intensifies because desires are potentially infinite. People compare themselves to their neighbors, envy their neighbors' advantages, and strive to vault ahead in the envy-ostentation sweepstakes.The political equality of democratic societies leaves ample room for, and incites, social inequalities, which are coveted because they counter the leveling forces of mass affluence. Furthermore, as inherited privilege has been replaced by social rationality — Napoleon's ""careers open to talents,"" a meritocracy based on skills and education — there is a residual human urge for irrational distinction. Such as savoring a $12 cup not just for the — let us stipulate — divine flavor but for the sheer fun of showing that you can and that your palate is so refined that merely very good coffee would be excruciating.In any American city large enough to sustain a social ecosystem of snobbery, there is a magazine to guide fastidious consumers to ""the five best craft breweries"" or ""the five best artisanal cheese shops."" Heaven forfend that anyone should have to settle for the sixth best. For discerning tipplers, there are artisanal ice cubes. In San Francisco, The Mill, a cafe and bakery, offers artisanal toast for $4 a slice. It is to die for, say the cognoscenti.Where will the positional economy end? It won't. Stanford professor Francis Fukuyama notes that it is a peculiarity of humans that they desire some things ""not for themselves but because they are desired by other humans."" Hamsters have more sense. This characteristic of our species — the quest for recognition by distinguishing oneself from others — provides limitless marketing possibilities because for many wealthy people, ""the chief enjoyment of riches consists in the parade of riches."" So wrote Adam Smith in ""The Wealth of Nations,"" published in the resonant year of 1776.

292,SBUX,"McDonald's (MCD) agreed to sell a controlling stake in its China and Hong Kong operations to a group of investors for about $1.7 billion, a key component of the fast-food giant's reorganization in a market where it's striving to catch up with more nimble rivals.Chinese state-backed conglomerate Citic Ltd., Citic Capital Holdings and U.S. private-equity firm Carlyle Group LP will acquire an 80% holding in a deal valuing the business at as much as $2.08 billion, according to a statement Monday. Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald's will keep the remaining stake. The new owners plan to add more than 1,500 restaurants over the next five years in smaller Chinese cities.McDonald's and rival Yum China Holdings (YUMC), which operates the KFC and Pizza Hut brands in the mainland, are among retailers that are trying to fend off domestic competition and attract middle-class Chinese consumers who increasingly demand high-quality and healthier dining options. As McDonald's streamlines its sprawling global operations, the fast-food giant is also looking at further deals in markets such as South Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia.Under the agreement, Citic Ltd. and Citic Capital Partners will jointly take a 52% stake, while Carlyle will hold 28%.""Citic and Carlyle's resources will allow McDonald's to expand rapidly and refurbish old restaurants, which is expensive to do,"" said Ben Cavender, a Shanghai-based analyst at China Market Research Group. ""Given that McDonald's lags behind KFC in terms of store count in China, we can expect them to expand aggressively and invest heavily.""McDonald's currently operates or franchises more than 2,400 outlets in mainland China. Its five-year target means about 300 stores will be added annually. That compares with 600 stores for Yum China Holdings, which was spun off late last year by Yum Brands (YUM), and 500 restaurants for Starbucks (SBUX), according to the companies.While Citic and Carlyle are paying a ""substantial price"" for 20-year franchise rights, the food and beverage chains are ""cash machines,"" Cavender said. In contrast, Yum China licensed the KFC and Pizza Hut brands from Yum Brands for 50 years, with automatic renewals that could make it possibly indefinite.The McDonald's transaction is Carlyle's second-biggest deal in China, trailing only its investments in China Pacific Insurance Group Co., according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The U.S. private-equity firm invested a total of more than $700 million in China Pacific Insurance in 2005 and 2007, the person said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. A spokeswoman for Carlyle declined to comment.McDonald's CEO  Steve Easterbrook is pursuing a turnaround plan to revive the company as it faces the fourth consecutive year of traffic declines in the U.S., its largest market. The China deal combines McDonald's with partners ""who have an unmatched understanding of the local markets and bring enhanced capabilities and new partnerships,"" the CEO said in the statement.The new partnership will also focus on areas such as menu innovation, retail digital leadership and delivery, the statement said.McDonald's, which said in March it's seeking strategic partners in Asia, has committed to re-franchising 4,000 restaurants by the end of 2018, and has set a long-term target to have 95% of its outlets owned by franchisees.U.S. restaurant chains have seen their market lead in China challenged by a growing lineup of Asian competitors such as Ting Hsin International Group's Dicos eateries. The seller of Big Macs is also playing catch-up to Yum China. Since the spinoff from its U.S. parent, that company has a carte blanche opportunity to pursue growth, its Chief Executive Officer Micky Pant has said.The monthslong auction process drew interest from international private-equity funds and local companies. In October, people with knowledge of the matter said TPG Capital had exited the race, leaving its erstwhile partner, Chinese grocery operator Wumart Stores Inc., to compete against Carlyle and Citic. Bain Capital had also teamed up with Chinese hotelier GreenTree Hospitality for a bid, the people said at the time.

293,SBUX,"Starbucks (SBUX) head Howard Schultz will step down as chief executive officer next April, the coffee shop giant said Thursday.Schultz will ""focus on retail innovation and accelerating growth of Starbucks ultrapremium retail formats,"" according to the statement on Starbucks' press site.Current COO Kevin Johnson will be the new chief executive officer. He took the new COO post two years ago, with some observers at the time speculating he was the heir apparent.On a conference call later, Johnson said no other leadership changes are planned.Schultz, currently chairman, will be executive chairman after stepping down as CEO.Shares fell 3.7% in late trading. Starbucks closed up 0.9% to 58.51 on the stock market today.Presumably more details of the succession will be provided at Starbucks' investor day next Wednesday.Schultz  joined the coffee company in 1982, then bought the retail unit in 1986, renaming its Starbucks. Schultz was a long-time CEO of Starbucks, but stepped down from 2000-2008. His return coincided with a revival in Starbucks' growth.

294,SBUX,"Apple (AAPL) and Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) may face a tough battle in disputes over European Union demands for back taxes after the bloc's top court partly backed regulators' attempt to force Spanish firms to repay millions of dollars in tax breaks.In a ruling that could ultimately add impetus to the region's clampdown on special tax treatment for selected companies, judges at the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg said a lower tribunal should re-examine a Spanish system that gave tax breaks to companies, including Banco Santander (BSBR), for the acquisition of stakes in foreign firms. Those tax advantages must now be repaid, the EU said in a statement.The EU General Court was wrong to rule that the European Commission failed to show that a group of companies was singled out by the program, which granted deductions for shareholdings in foreign firms, the top judges said Wednesday. Regulators don't always have to show that only certain companies benefit from the aid, the court said.""This is a landmark decision because it clarifies the rules of the game,"" said Raymond H.C. Luja, professor of comparative tax law at Maastricht University in The Netherlands. ""That will also have its effect on a number of ongoing cases.""Europe's crusade against unfair tax treatment has led EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager to order Apple to pay a record $13.6 billion in back taxes because of arrangements with Ireland that she says weren't open to others. Belgium was also told to claw back roughly $730 million in tax advantages granted to companies, including AB InBev, the world's biggest brewer.""The judgment is important because it confirms that a measure may be selective, if it benefits only those companies that carry out certain transactions,"" the commission said in an emailed statement. ""The fact that the conditions that a company needed to fulfill were not strict and the benefits were therefore available to many companies does not call into question the selective nature.""Action has now moved to the courts with Apple filing its legal challenge this week, joining Starbucks (SBUX), a Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) unit and more than a dozen Belgian-based companies calling on judges to halt the EU in its tracks.Amazon.com (AMZN), McDonald's (MCD) and France's Engie are also being probed by regulators over tax deals with Luxembourg.The ruling ""re-establishes the comparability standards, meaning you have to look whether companies in the same legal and factual situation are treated differently, without proper justification,"" Luja said. ""That's the argument the commission is also using in many of the tax-ruling cases.""The court confirmed the principle that companies that are comparable, being in the same factual and legal situation, should be treated the same. But the ruling leaves a key question in the tax probes unanswered, Luja said.""It's not the standard that's the issue, because the court confirmed that,"" Luja said. ""The question in the ongoing tax ruling cases is whether the commission's assumption that a stand-alone company and a group company are comparable, is applicable, and there this decision tells us little.""So-called selectivity — or the notion that a tax break targets only certain companies and excludes others — is ""the key issue"" that links the Santander case with the EU's probes into the tax practices of international companies, said Edoardo Traversa, a professor who specializes in tax law at Belgium's Universite Catholique de Louvain.Apple and other companies can take solace in another ruling on Wednesday, where the EU's top court criticized regulators in a case involving tax benefits to airlines using Germany's Luebeck airport. That judgment said the EU was wrong to determine the tax breaks were unfair to others simply because they were granted only to airlines at that airport.Tax breaks are a subsidy that give some companies an unfair advantage, especially if they plow back their savings into competing against others in industries with price pressures and where margins are razor-thin, the EU's top state aid official said earlier this month. Regulators are ""very much concerned that this is going on"" with Amazon's tax arrangements, he said.Wednesday's ruling focuses on Spanish tax breaks for homegrown firms that allowed them to go on a buying spree abroad. Santander grew from being a provincial lender to become the second-biggest by market value in the euro region with the purchase of banks in the U.K. and the Americas. It built a balance sheet that's as big as Spain's gross national product.Spanish companies including Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), Telefonica and Iberdrola (IBDRY) also aggressively pursued expansion abroad.Spain must now demand the companies repay the tax advantages they received, the EU said. Regulators had agreed to avoid ""actively"" pursuing back-tax demands until the ruling was delivered.The European Commission told Spain in 2009 and 2011 to abolish the tax breaks and recoup tax advantages dating back to December 2007.But that order hit a roadblock two years ago when the EU General Court, the bloc's second-highest tribunal, ruled that the Spanish regime at issue was not selective and doesn't exclude any ""company from taking advantage of it.""Wednesday's ruling says regulators ""properly established the selectivity"" of the tax program because it was restricted to certain companies, undermining one of the key planks of the Spanish firms' arguments against the EU decision. While the case may take years to reach a conclusion, the judgment emboldens the EU in the midst of its war against tax subsidies.

295,SBUX,"Nordstrom (JWN) shares tumbled Friday after JPMorgan (JPM) downgraded the department store, another dire sign for the dying mall industry.Nordstrom was cut to underweight from neutral and had its price target cut to 48 from 55 by the investment bankAnalysts, citing discussions with management, said the upscale department store didn't have enough ""multiyear silver bullets"" to boost sales growth. Further, the increasing costs to handle online traffic and online shopping is continuing to cannibalize the company's brick-and-mortar sales.""Management cited full-line brick and mortar traffic levels as the worst since 1972 with the accelerating model shift from brick and mortar to online yet to reach equilibrium citing 'no easy answer' to re-stimulating foot traffic,"" JPMorgan analysts wrote in their note.Nordstrom shares plunged 8.7% to 50.48 on the stock market today, after closing just below its 50-day line on Thursday.On CNBC's ""Mad Dash,"" host Jim Cramer said the JPMorgan note was a ""very damning piece about the mall."" It adds to a prior warning from Starbucks' (SBUX) then-CEO Howard Schultz that the mall is dying.IBD'S TAKE: Will holiday sales get their own Trump bump and which retailers will have the brightest holiday season?Other mall-based retailers were down.Macy's (M) stock fell 6.7% to 37.47. Value department store Kohl's (KSS) was off 7.9%. J.C. Penney (JCP) fell 7.1%. And Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LB) dropped 2.9%. Macy's, J.C.

296,SBUX,"Calling the U.S. ""over-retailed"" in many categories, Starbucks (SBUX) CEO Howard Schultz pointed to ""really grand"" upscale coffee shops and a halo-providing premium Reserve brand as a way past the retail doldrums.At Starbucks' investor day on Wednesday, Schultz outlined the coffee titan's five-year strategy, which includes 10% revenue growth, 15%-20% profit growth, same-store sales gains in the mid-single-digits annually and 12,000 more stores around the world.Brick-and-mortar retailers, broadly, have had a tough go of it in recent years, and the words ""challenging retail environment"" pop up often in quarterly reports.Despite its popularity and ubiquity, even Starbucks hasn't been immune to a shift in consumer habits. The company's mobile and digital efforts are head and shoulders above its restaurant peers, but it has still missed revenue forecasts in three of the last four quarters.Writing last month that the current restaurant landscape ""continues to give us jitters,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Brett Levy noted that ""the sales slowdowns have even reached Starbucks.""But Schultz said Wednesday: ""That's where the Roastery and Reserve brand comes in.""He envisions 20-30 ""really grand"" Roastery locations around the world, a series of Reserve stores, and a larger fleet of Starbucks locations with a ""Reserve Bar."" In response to broader declining foot traffic trends and higher smartphone usage.Shares of Starbucks rose 2.3% to 58.76 in the stock market today, rising intraday to their best levels since late April. The stock is in a long consolidation going back to its October 2015 high.IBD'S TAKE: Starbucks has been a market laggard over the past year. But if you have an appetite for restaurant stocks, here are several eateries that are in or near buy range. Current Chief Operating Officer — and incoming CEO — Kevin Johnson called the strategy ""the most aspirational plan in the history of Starbucks.""Johnson highlighted three core drivers of same-store sales growth going forward: cold drinks, lunch and continued digital and mobile efforts.Cold beverages like iced espresso drinks, cold brew coffee and iced tea ""will all play a significant role,"" and cold drinks will make up 50% of all drink sales in 2021, he said.Building on the rollout of breakfast foods, he intends for lunch offerings to focus on an ""elegant culinary experience"" that includes freshly prepared and healthy food.""If we capture that lunch daypart, as we have in breakfast, food should represent roughly 25% of sales in the year 2021,"" said Johnson.The addition of 12,000 new stores will bring Starbucks' international total to 37,000. About half of the new stores will be built in the company's two largest markets, said Johnson: the U.S. and China.As part of its expansion in China, where it expects to double revenue and store count — and more than double operating income by 2021 — Starbucks also announced a partnership with Tencent (TCEHY) that will allow WeChat messaging app users in China to send a digital Starbucks gift card to anyone on their WeChat friend list, as of early next year.Part of the team-up begins almost immediately.""When Asia wakes up tomorrow, all our stores in mainland China will accept WeChat Pay at our (point-of-sale),"" said Belinda Wong, the company's chief executive in China.RELATED:Starbucks Is Brewing Up Huge Pokemon Go Promotion What To Expect From Starbucks' CEO Shuffle — Shaky Or Seamless?

297,SBUX,"Steakhouse chain Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) on Monday said same-restaurant sales so far in the third quarter had slowed from Q2, and the company missed Q2 total revenue estimates amid growing worries about the restaurant sector overall.Same-restaurant sales for company-owned locations had risen by about 3.7% over the first four weeks of Q3, which began June 29, compared to the 4.5% growth reported in Q2. Analysts had expected Q2 comp growth of 4.2%.Earnings per share in Q2 jumped 57% to 47 cents, above views for 45 cents. Revenue rose 12% to $508.8 million, missing views for $509.8 million. Comp sales rose 2.8% at franchises.Texas Roadhouse's profits were helped by falling food costs, particularly beef. Food cost deflation for 2016 is now seen at 2.5%-3% vs. prior guidance of 1%-2% deflation.Shares dived 9% in after-hours action to around 43.25, signaling a move below the 50-day line at Tuesday's open. Texas Instruments had closed up 1% at 47.70 in the stock market today, rising above buy range after first breaking out in May. But they sank 4.7% after the close.IBD'S TAKE: As the restaurant sector struggles, Texas Roadhouse touched an all-time intraday high last month. Compare and contrast industry stocks at IBD's Stock Checkup. Analysts have soured on the restaurant sector in recent weeks due to rising wages in a more limited labor market, cheaper offerings from grocery stores and growing consumer unease.Indeed, Jefferies and Stifel downgraded Texas Roadhouse last week, saying the months ahead looked grim industrywide.Jefferies analyst Andy Barish wrote in a research note that the restaurant industry could face ""at least 18 months of challenges"" due to higher labor costs and an overexpansion in the amount of available seats in restaurants, compared to diners' demand. Stifel anticipated that within nine months the U.S. would be in a recession.""In spite of job growth and wage inflation, there are a number of distracting factors that make a pick-up in restaurant sales tough to call right now such as: negative news headlines, the political rhetoric and upcoming election season and more near-term, the Summer Olympics in Rio,"" Barish said.That sentiment was echoed in earnings calls last month by management at McDonald's (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX). McDonald's got hit in the stock market last month after reporting disappointing quarterly results, while Starbucks cut its full-year sales outlook.McDonald's edged up 0.3% Monday. Starbucks dipped 0.7%.

298,SBUX,"Square (SQ) reports earnings after the close Wednesday, with analysts looking for an update on its newest offering -- loans to small business that use its payments processing system -- and an update on its food delivery business.San Francisco-based Square makes credit card readers that plug into mobile phones and tablets. Adjusted revenue growth appears to be slowing, though Square could be a takeover candidate, analysts say.Analysts estimate Square will report a wider non-GAAP loss of 11 cents per share vs. a 9 cent loss in the year-earlier period. Adjusted revenue -- sales minus transactions with Starbucks (SBUX) and other partners -- is expected to rise 43% to $157.8 million, with net revenue growing 31% to $406 million.""We are expecting Q2 adjusted revenue of $158 million, slightly above guidance, reflecting our bullish payment-processing outlook,"" said Josh Beck, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, in a research report.""The bigger question in our mind is 'What could the business look like next year?',"" he added, referring to new lending initiatives and the food delivery business.In Q1, Square's adjusted revenue jumped 64% to $146 million.In the September quarter, analysts estimate adjusted revenue growth of 39% to $164 million, with a narrower 10 cent per-share loss vs. a 16 cent loss in Q3 2015.IBD'S TAKE: Jack Dorsey has been serving as CEO of both Square and Twitter, which last week reported disappointing Q2 results. Some analysts question whether Dorsey can lead both companies effectively. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.Square Capital, which has provided short-term financing to small businesses, began offering small loans in March through a partner bank.Square acquired food delivery startup Caviar for $90 million in 2014 and has been expanding that business. Square had $444 million in cash on its balance sheet as of March 31.""Given Square's large scale (2 million small-business customers) and strong technology platform, we continue to believe Square would make an excellent acquisition target for Visa (V), American Express (AXP), PayPal (PYPL), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google or others,"" said Neil Doshi, a Mizuho Securities analyst, in a July report.Square stock fell 1.4% to 10.05 in the stock market today.
"
299,SBUX,"This earnings season, companies like Starbucks (SBUX) and McDonald's (MCD) have been more candid about mounting global dread, going beyond euphemisms like ""challenging environment,"" as other giants like Apple (AAPL) and General Electric (GE) grapple with China's slowing economy and the Brexit vote.The remarks offer brief insights into management's thinking about an array of issues that have cropped up in earnings conference calls more recently, including the U.S. presidential election, the failed coup in Turkey and its fallout, mass shootings at home, and ISIS-inspired attacks worldwide.The CEOs of McDonald's and Starbucks -- whose sales depend on people going to their restaurants without worrying about their paychecks or safety -- both weighed in on the unease, according to Seeking Alpha transcripts.""I think we have a situation where you have a very uncertain election,"" Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said. ""You have domestic civil unrest with regard to race. And I think the issues around terror have created a level of anxiety. And so, we're no longer looking at just an economic downturn.""Schultz said conditions were ""quite unusual."" But he also said that the needs which the ubiquitous coffee chain appeals to -- ""the sense of community, the longing for human connection, a safe place, an affordable luxury"" -- would benefit the company overall.While cheaper grocery prices may encourage more people to eat at home, McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook said, ""there's just a broader level of uncertainty in consumers' minds at the moment, both trying to gauge their financial security going forward, you know, whether through elections or through global events, people are slightly mindful of an unsettled world.""The company benefits from ""people moving around, going to the malls, driving around, going on vacations,"" he continued. ""And if people are reining in their (spending) across broader categories, that will have a little bit of a flow-through to us as well.""That sentiment also lines up with a recent note from KeyBanc Capital Markets, which upgraded Papa John's (PZZA), saying that civil unrest and a heated political environment may keep people at home -- and keep them ordering pizza -- instead of going out.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Papa John's and rival Domino's Pizza cleared buy points recently despite the overall restaurant sector facing a slowdown amid wage pressure and tougher price competition.The Brexit vote also has come up a lot during earnings calls, but its impact is not yet clear, while other global events and the outcome of the U.S. presidential vote are adding another layer of complexity, according to comments gleaned from Seeking Alpha transcripts.Michael DeWalt, a vice president at Caterpillar (CAT), said the U.K. vote to leave the European Union, the upheaval in Turkey and ""all the negative rhetoric around the U.S. elections"" added to the risks the construction firm was facing.Big banks generally turned out solid second-quarter results, but Goldman Sachs (GS) and Citigroup (C) commented on the ""unique"" course of the U.S. campaigns, which have turned banks into the favorite punching bags of both Democrats and Republicans.Goldman CFO Harvey Schwartz said he felt ""this cycle will have unique aspects to it vs. other presidential cycles,"" but that he didn't foresee any short-term damage.But Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat said world tensions could further stall any Federal Reserve interest rate increases. ""While the U.K. has a new leader,"" he said, ""the U.S. is still in the midst of a unique presidential campaign, and such geopolitical and economic uncertainty doesn't create a clear picture for potential interest rate increases.""McDonald's said Brexit had not significantly affected U.K. demand and that the vote was unlikely to harm commodity prices there in the near term. But the company shaved a few cents off its profit-per-share forecast in part because the vote caused the pound to plummet. Starbucks said Brexit had piled on to already existing worries in Europe.And General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt said, ""Brexit is just another point of volatility. It wasn't the outcome we hoped for, but we were plenty ready for that as just another point of volatility.""It's difficult to gauge the state of China's economy through executives' commentary, which came in mixed.Apple CEO Tim Cook remained optimistic. Apple's fiscal Q3 results topped expectations, and iPhone sales were better than expected amid concerns the market was saturated.But while he said that ""switchers and first-time smartphone buyers"" made up most of the company's quarterly iPhone sales in Greater China, he conceded that the region's economy has cooled.""This is reflected in consumer confidence and retail spending, and the Chinese yuan has depreciated by 7% relative to the U.S. dollar since August of last year,"" he said. ""Hong Kong's tourism and retail businesses also continue to be significantly impacted by the stronger Hong Kong dollar relative to other Asian currencies.""United Technologies (UTX), a conglomerate that owns the elevator and escalator-maker Otis, offered a glimpse into China's real estate market. Transactions, management said, had picked up some steam, but the gains hadn't translated into more money from elevator sales.""In China, while the number of property transactions and home prices -- particularly in the tier 1 cities -- show growth year-to-date, the elevator new equipment market is down, and price pressure has increased,"" CFO Akhil Johri said on the company's earnings call.Meanwhile, GE said China was ""getting better."" Starbucks touted its own performance in the region, while McDonald's said comps in China rose.Those gains, McDonald's said, came ""despite a challenging environment.""
"
300,SBUX,"Since the fall, McDonald's (MCD) sales gains have been carried in large part by All Day Breakfast, and in smaller part by a stronger value offering, as well as some concessions to the rising demand for higher-quality ingredients.But as restaurant-industry sales trends slow and McDonald's approaches some difficult year-over-year comparisons, U.S. same-restaurant sales and any commentary on the future will likely be a focus when the fast-food giant reports Tuesday.Analysts expect McDonald's to post earnings per share of $1.38, up 9.5% from a year earlier. Total sales are seen slipping 3% to $6.3 billion. Same-restaurant sales are expected to rise around 3.3%.McDonald's launched All Day Breakfast in October. The expansion quickly proved a success, with more diners buying breakfast during later hours or tacking on a breakfast item to their lunch or dinner. The company this month said it would add more items to the breakfast menu in September.IBD'S TAKE: McDonald's stock is in buy range from a 124.18 entry point. But the dividend giant is rated 17th in IBD's Retail-Restaurants group. To see who the real leaders are, go to IBD's Stock Checkup.But some analysts have worried that cheaper value offerings, while essential for competition, have weighed on restaurant sales during Q2. They also worry that consumer optimism has waned as rising gas prices leave less spending room for eating out and as social, economic and political anxieties escalate.Starbucks (SBUX) said Thursday that weaker consumer confidence, geopolitical uncertainty and civil unrest are impacting brands everywhere.The strong dollar could also hurt international sales. RBC Capital Markets on Friday cut McDonald's full-year EPS outlook following the U.K.'s ""Brexit"" vote in June.Others suggest that All Day Breakfast may have masked McDonald's struggles elsewhere, and that it will be hard for the company to keep up year-over-year growth in the quarters ahead. In particular, RBC said in a research note Thursday, ""finding the right value message remains a struggle,"" potentially turning off many customers who go to McDonald's because the food is affordable.""The McPick 2 for $5 has been a sales driver, and it has been good for restaurant margins,"" RBC analyst David Palmer wrote. However, he said, ""the chain continues to wrestle with a 'Dollar Menu hangover' and prices for its premium items that are perhaps too high for perceived quality (e.g., relative to chains such as Chick-fil-A or In N Out).""Many franchisees resisted the Dollar Menu, which McDonald's has since replaced with McPick, complaining that it was difficult to juggle higher labor costs and food items sold for a buck apiece. But Cowen analyst Andrew Charles raised questions about the company's promotion of the McPick during part of the second quarter.""We believe there is risk of a soft Q2 top line ... as MCD paused the heavy value-centric messaging seen in Q1 during April and May,"" Charles said in a research note this week.He added that the company's Monopoly promotion, as well as its promotional efforts tied to ""The Angry Birds Movie,"" ""did not allow the brand to emphasize value as much as the soft industry backdrop demanded."" He said the company stepped up promotion for the McPick in June.On the quality front, McDonald's during the quarter said it would test fresh hamburger patties in the Dallas region.In a Nomura survey of a handful of franchisees published this week, some suggested the fresh-patty test would help consumer perception. Others, however, warned it wouldn't necessarily drive sales, while raising a host of food-prep and safety issues. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is still struggling to rebound from foodborne illness scares last year, and its Q2 results missed estimates Thursday.""We are the lightning rod,"" one McDonald's franchisee said. ""Chipotle will be a walk in the park if we have an incident.""McDonald's stock fell 0.7% to 127.40 on the stock market today. McDonald's is still above a 124.18 buy point in a double-bottom base. The W-shaped consolidation is a bullish pattern.

301,SBUX,"Domino's Pizza (DPZ) easily topped Wall Street's second-quarter estimates, sending shares up to a new high at the open Thursday after the stock ended Wednesday's session just below a buy point.Earnings grew 21% to 98 cents a share on 12% revenue growth to $547.3 million, fueled by higher volumes and store growth, said the company. Analysts had expected 94 cents EPS on $534.1 million.Domestic same-store sales rose 9.7% as international comps grew 7.1%.Domino's Pizza shares jumped 5.7% to 144.66 on the stock market today, a new all-time best. The stock cleared a 137.12 entry point of a new buy range. On Wednesday, shares briefly topped that level but closed slightly under it.IBD'S TAKE: Domino's Pizza is a breakout, but it's only the 10th best stock in IBD's Retail-Restaurants group. To see how Domino's stacks up based on objective criteria and vs. its leading peers, go to IBD Stock Checkup.Could recent world events have helped contribute to the view-topping results?KeyBanc Capital Markets upgraded pizza peer Papa John's (PZZA) to overweight from sector weight this week and bumped up its price target, opining that civil unrest and a heated political environment might be prompting people to eat at home -- and order pizza -- instead of going out.Papa John's stock climbed 2.9% Thursday to close at 73.34 after rising 3.15% Wednesday to its best levels since early November.Meanwhile, Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) topped earnings views by a penny as profit grew 14% to 57 cents a share, but revenue fell short of estimates for $219.9 million with 2% growth to $216.3 million.Dunkin' Donuts U.S. comps edged up 0.5%. Baskin-Robbins U.S. comps rose 0.6%. Traffic fell in both segments, the company said, though average tickets rose.""While this was somewhat short of our recently raised +1.4% forecast, the showing in positive territory is likely still enough to ease some concerns we had heard recently from buysiders about the possibility of Q2 same-store sales possibly being negative,"" wrote Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski regarding Dunkin Donuts' comps.Dunkin' also announced a 30 cent per-share cash dividend for the third quarter.Dunkin' shares sank 0.7% to 46.74, but off early lows of 44.75.

302,SBUX,"Interrupted frappuccino momentum. Weakened consumer confidence. Civil unrest.Calling the 4% growth in U.S. same-store sales an ""anomaly,"" Starbucks (SBUX) management said during the earnings call that several factors contributed to weaker-than-expected comps in the third quarter, including the rollout of the tweaked Starbucks Rewards loyalty program that threw the company's regular summer promotion schedule off balance and ""interrupted frappuccino momentum in the quarter.""In addition to the impact of juggling two marketing campaigns -- the new rewards program rollout and ""Frappuccino Happy Hour"" -- weaker consumer confidence, geopolitical uncertainty and civil unrest are impacting brands everywhere, it said.CEO Howard Schultz called the environment ""quite unusual,"" and different from previous stretches that have experienced economic downturns, but sounded bullish on regaining comp momentum going forward as the new program changes were a ""one-time event.""Starbucks cut full-year global same-store sales growth outlook to mid-single digits, down from prior guidance for ""somewhat above mid-single digits,"" as third-quarter revenue left investors with a bad taste in their mouths.IBD'S TAKE: Starbucks is a household name, but it's not a top-shelf stock right now. It's ranked 18th in the IBD Retail-Restaurant group. Meanwhile, Domino's Pizza broke out of a base to a new high on strong earnings Thursday. For Domino's key fundamental and technical ingredients -- and how it compares to top restaurant stocks, go to IBD Stock Checkup.The global coffee-shop titan also said it now sees full-year consolidated revenue growth of 10%, down from prior guidance for ""10%+"" growth.

Analysts had expected $5.33 billion.Shares fell 3% in late trading in the stock market today after closing up 0.1% in regular trade Thursday. The stock may test its 50-day moving average at Friday's open, after retaking that key line in late June.For the quarter, global same-store sales rose 4%. Americas same-store sales grew 4%. China/Asia Pacific comps rose 3%. Comps in China, a high-growth market of heavy focus for the company, alone grew 7%.Java drinkers apparently didn't mind the loyalty program changes. Starbucks Rewards grew its U.S. membership base by 18% from the prior year to 12.3 million active members. The company recently announced price hikes to some of its beverages.And its mobile push appears to be enjoying solid momentum, with mobile payments now accounting for 25% of all transactions. Its order-in-advance feature, Mobile Order And Pay, now makes up 5% of all orders, said the company.Smaller coffee rival Dunkin' Brands (DNKN), the parent of Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins, reported a mixed bag earlier Thursday.Profit growth of 14% to 57 cents a share topped estimates by a penny, but 2% sales growth to $216.3 million missed views for $219.9 million. Dunkin' Brands closed down 0.7% to 46.74 after falling as low as 44.75.Restaurant peer Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) also reported after the close Thursday and missed earnings and revenue forecasts but said same-store sales trends in July were improving.

303,SBUX,"Quarterly earnings once again took center stage, as stocks held solid gains into the close Friday, extending the major market indexes' win streak for a fourth straight week. All eyes will be on Dow components Apple (AAPL), Caterpillar (CAT) and McDonald's (MCD), which report Tuesday.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 each rose 0.5%, while the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.3%. Volume dipped slightly across the board vs. Thursday, according to preliminary data.

Facebook fell 1.1% to 120.61 on Thursday, undercutting a 121.18 buy point. Facebook cleared that entry area to a new high on Wednesday, though on light volume.Goldman Sachs lowered Starbucks' price target to 69 from 73, but said the coffee giant still has ""comp levers to pull"" and that changes in the loyalty program likely caused the drop in digital business.Late Thursday, Starbucks said the 4% growth in U.S. same-store sales in Q3 was an ""anomaly"" citing weaker consumer confidence, geopolitical uncertainty and civil unrest.In Q3, adjusted earnings grew 17% to 49 cents a share, matching views, while sales fell short of estimates with 7% growth to $5.24 billion. Analysts had expected $5.33 billion.Starbucks now sees full-year consolidated revenue growth of 10%, down from prior guidance for ""10%+"" growth.Shares fell sharply in the premarket but closed up 0.5%.Cowen raised Qorvo's (QRVO) price target to 65 from 55 but lowered Skyworks' (SWKS) price target to 72 from 76.Late Thursday, Skyworks, a supplier for Apple, reported fiscal Q3 sales and earnings that fell year-over-year but still beat analyst expectations.Fellow Apple iPhone chipmaker Qorvo rose 0.8% to 60.56.

306,SBUX,"U.S. stock futures signaled a modest rebound Friday, even as Starbucks (SBUX), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), PayPal (PYPL) and Apple (AAPL) supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) were indicated lower after they reported quarterly results. Dow stalwart General Electric (GE) was little changed after releasing its Q2 resultsDow Jones industrial average futures were up about 0.1% on the stock market today after the Dow snapped a 9-day winning streak on Thursday. So were futures for the Nasdaq and S&P 500.Dow component General Electric reported second-quarter earnings of 51 cents a share excluding items, up 64.5% vs. a year earlier. Sales jumped 15% to $33.49 billion. Both were much better than expected But GE orders and organic revenue dipped.GE shares fell 1% before the opening bell. The stock dipped 0.6% to 32.59 on Thursday after hitting an 8-year high of 33 on Wednesday.Starbucks met EPS views late Thursday but sales fell short.

The coffee giant predicts a return to 5%-plus U.S. comps growth, but Starbucks did cut full-year sales targets.Starbucks shares fell nearly 3% in premarket action.IBD'S TAKE: Starbucks is a household name, but it's not a top-shelf stock right now. It's ranked 18th in the IBD Retail-Restaurant group. Meanwhile, Domino's Pizza broke out of a base to a new high on strong earnings Thursday. For Domino's key fundamental and technical ingredients -- and how it compares to top restaurant stocks, go to IBD Stock Checkup.Chipotle earnings and sales fell even more than expected, with same-store sales plunging 23.6%.

308,SBUX,"The stock market rose modestly in late morning trade Friday's session, as Wall Street pored over another round of earnings reports.The Nasdaq composite rose 0.4% and the S&P 500 climbed 0.2%, while the Dow Jones industrial average just edged higher. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking lower than Thursday's levels in the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: The Nasdaq suffered its second higher-volume decline (distribution day) in three sessions Thursday. Increasing signs of institutional selling can can cause problems for a market rally, but so far it's been contained since the June 30 follow-through day.Starbucks (SBUX) recovered nicely after a rough after-hours session Thursday. Shares edged up slightly despite news that quarterly sales growth decelerated for the third straight quarter. On a weekly chart, Starbucks' 40-week moving average line, just over 58, looms as a potential resistance level.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) jumped 4.2%, retaking its 50-day despite weak earnings late Thursday. Adjusted profit fell 80% from a year earlier to 87 cents a share. Sales growth declined for the third straight quarter, falling 17% to $998.4 million.

Shares are just below a 121.18 buy point after a low-volume breakout. Earnings are due Wednesday after the close.Early gainers in the IBD 50 included red-hot IPO Acacia Communications (ACIA), up 5.5%.

309,SBUX,"Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) led a rally in bank stocks Friday, as the strong July jobs report raised the chances of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike, potentially boosting lenders' net interest margins.The U.S. economy added 255,000 jobs in July, far above expectations for 185,000, and hiring gains for the prior two months were revised up. The unemployment rate for July remained at 4.9%, while the labor force participation rate crept up 0.1 point. The July figures follow strong results in June, after May's data disappointed.Fed funds futures prices indicate the chances of a rate hike at the central bank's September meeting have doubled to 18%.Shares of Bank of America closed up nearly 4% to 15.05 on the stock market today, gapping above their 200-day average for the first time since late December. Citigroup jumped 4.3% to 45.72, touching its 200-day line. JPMorgan rose 2.7% to 66.30. Wells Fargo (WFC) added 1.8% to 48.68, retaking its 50-day line. Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs (GS) climbed 2.6% to 162.09 while rival Morgan Stanley (MS) also rose 2.6%, to end the week at 29.01.IBD'S TAKE: July's jobs figures follow a solid round of earnings reports and stress-test results from the banks this summer. But the U.K.'s vote in June to leave the European Union left the economic landscape there in the balance and led many analysts to believe the Fed would stay cautious on raising rates. A second-quarter roundup can be found here.  Still, the outlook for consumer spending remains uncertain, even though the banks' second-quarter results portrayed a relatively stable consumer outside of the energy sector. Auto sales have also disappointed recently, and concerns have grown about an auto-loan bubble.Companies from McDonald's (MCD) to Starbucks (SBUX) to Delta Air Lines (DAL) have cited the U.S. election, Brexit, and fears of violence in the U.S. and abroad as potentially affecting their business plans and consumer sentiment.

311,SBUX,"Java giants Starbucks (SBUX) and Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) are both slated to serve up earnings gains in the teens when they report quarterly results on Thursday. Expect rewards membership figures and mobile pay updates, among other items, now that Starbucks has had almost a full quarter with its tweaked loyalty program and Dunkin' Donuts' ""on-the-go"" mobile ordering feature has been available nationwide for over a month now.Wall Street anticipates Starbucks' third-quarter earnings to have grown 17% to 49 cents a share on a 9% revenue increase to $5.34 billion. The latter would mark a second quarter of single-digit sales gains following seven straight quarters of double-digit revenue growth.Shares of Starbucks fell 0.85% to 56.92 on the stock market today after retaking support at their 50-day line on June 29. The stock has been trading below its 200-day moving average since late April.The company said a week ago that it would increase the wages of its U.S. workforce by 5%-15%, effective October, and that it is doubling its annual stock award for employees who have been with the company for two years. A day later, it announced price hikes of 10 to 3o cents for some of its coffee, espresso and latte drinks in U.S. company-operated stores.Starbucks' program was over 12 million active members strong as of the end of Q2. On April 12, the company rolled out a revamped rewards offering, in which customers are handed ""stars"" based on dollars spent vs. based on the number of visits. The changes, announced months earlier, were initially ill-received.IBD's TAKE: Starbucks has been a steady earnings performer for the past five years, which makes buying on pullbacks a sound strategy. For more on why investors should pay attention to earnings stability, read this Investor's Corner.Also look for progress on Starbucks' mobile assault. Last week, the global coffee-shop chain began offering mobile payment in China, a high-growth market that will find itself with 3,400 Starbucks locations by 2019, up from around 2,000 today.Meanwhile, Dunkin' Brands is seen growing its per-share Q2 profit by 12% to 56 cents, while revenue is expected to rise 4% to $219.8 million.On June 13, the Dunkin' Donuts parent debuted on-the-go ordering nationwide, a feature similar to Starbucks' mobile-order-and-pay that allows loyalty program members to place orders in advance and pick them up from the store.CEO Nigel Travis has called on-the-go ""one of the most game-changing initiatives in our history.""""Not only is it a way to drive membership in our loyalty program, but it is a clear demonstration of our commitment to enhancing convenience for our guests through technology-based initiatives,"" he said during the previous quarter's earnings call. ""Later this year, we will test curbside delivery.""The Dunkin' Donuts Perks program had almost 4.6 million members as of the previous quarter's end.Shares advanced 0.1% to 46.64. Dunkin' Brands stock has risen above its 200-day and 50-day lines this week as it starts to build the right side of a base.

312,SBUX,"The Runway Playa Vista in Los Angeles recently added a Whole Foods Market (WFM), a movie theater, and upscale shops and restaurants -- retail center staples intended to attract affluent shoppers, condo-buyers and tech companies to the mixed-use development. The next big tenant slated to move in, however, is a little different: A 32,000-square-foot doctors' office, where the Cedars-Sinai Health System plans to house outpatient services including obstetrics, gynecology and pediatrics.While urgent-care centers have been strip-mall staples for decades, the chance to catch dinner, a movie and a surgical procedure under the same roof is new -- and coming soon to a mall near you. The reason is commerce: Mall operators are looking for tenants that trade in entertainment and services to replace the brick-and-mortar retailers slowly being strangled by Amazon.com (AMZN) and its online competitors. Rents, particularly at older malls, are a bargain.The health care industry, meanwhile, is moving away from centralized campuses to bring services closer to patients at a time when two key demographics are entering prime years for consumption. Boomers are hitting an age when they can expect to use more health care services; millennials are starting families and beginning to make doctors appointments for their kids.Put those factors together, and voila: You can get your blood pressure checked just steps from the steakhouse.Chris Isola, vice president in the health care service group for CBRE (CBG), says the idea of putting medical clinics in malls is one that landlords are just starting to come around to. ""I think from Cedars' perspective, that's how you capture the younger demographic,"" he explains. ""The challenge is convincing the landlord of a highly desirable center that there should be a medical clinic. It's like, 'This is why you should put Cedars here and not break up the space for five or six boutiques.' ""Gauging just how rapidly health care companies are absorbing retail space is difficult, because the industry is composed of regional and local players, many of which are using only small amounts of space. CoStar Group (CSGP), a commercial real estate data and analytics firm, has begun tracking health care companies as retail tenants only in recent years, making it hard to measure the industry's footprint. But the consensus among observers is that it's the wave of the future.""It's a big part of demand growth for retail space,"" said Hans Nordby, managing director for Portfolio Strategy at CoStar. ""Ten years from now we aren't going to think anything about it. It will be like, I went to the strip mall, I saw the doctor, and then I bought a pair of shoes.""Cedars-Sinai isn't the only health care provider to take a large space in a retail mall. Others include Prime Healthcare Services, which operates a 23,500-square-foot ambulatory care facility at the Plymouth Meeting Mall outside Philadelphia. Last year, UCLA Health put a dozen doctors in a new medical office at the Village at Westfield Topanga, a high-end mall in Woodland Hills, Calif.Then there's Vanderbilt University Medical Group, which occupies the entire second level at the 100 Oaks Mall in Nashville, Tenn., where patients can pick up a pager when they check in at a clinic, then browse the outlet shops on the lower level while they wait. It used to be that only restaurants would give you a pager to let you know when your table was ready. Now it means the results of your CT scan are in.As this transformation has begun to take shape, strip malls seem to be more popular than traditional malls because they offer medical tenants an appealing prospect: parking spaces directly in front of their stores so the elderly and infirm don't need to cover large distances, let alone navigate stairs or escalators.While outpatient facilities and doctors offices make the move from hospitals and medical suites to the mall, about one-third of the 7,200 urgent-care centers in the U.S. are already there, said Steve Sellars, president of the Urgent Care Association of America. The industry is adding a few hundred new urgent-care centers a year, leading operators to try out new locations. Care Here!, a Brentwood, Tenn.-based health and wellness company, even opened a walk-in clinic in the Nashville airport.For the health care companies, softness in the retail market has helped them negotiate favorable leases, including improvement allowances. Medical facilities also look good financially as tenants, with credit profiles that stack up well compared with nail salons and fast-food restaurants.Still, there's a learning curve on both sides, said Sarah Bader, leader of the global health and wellness practice at the architecture firm Gensler. Many landlords are still coming to grips with the idea that medical clinics won't scare off other businesses, and health care companies are just learning how to use retail space to build stronger relationships with their customers.  In some cases, landlords had promised existing tenants they wouldn't rent to a doctor's office or dialysis center, and will need to renegotiate leases to get permission.""When you go to Starbucks (SBUX), you know it's a Starbucks,"" she said. ""It's been a challenge, because health care systems aren't particularly brand-savvy clients."" Bader has been working with such companies as Chicago's Northwestern Memorial Hospital to create a design manifesto for its growing retail footprint. ""You want people to know that whether they're having an operation or going to the pediatrician, they're in the same health system.""Related:U.S. Shopping Malls Beset By Debt Are Facing An AccountingREITs Preparing For Spotlight Teach Money Managers How They Work

313,SBUX,"The jobs report pushed stocks toward fresh all-time highs in a busy week. Tesla Motors (TSLA) announced a deal to buy SolarCity (SCTY) as tech M&A was strong. General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) fueled a sell-off in consumer-related stocks, while oil prices briefly undercut $40 a barrel. Also, the Bank of England cut rates and revived bond buying.The major averages were little changed through Thursday, but rallied Friday on the strong jobs report. The Nasdaq climbed 1.1% for the week for a record close Friday and just 10 points below its July 2015 intraday peak. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, hitting a fresh intraday best. The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.6%. Energy stocks fell as oil undercut $40 early in the week, but rallied as crude recovered somewhat.The U.S. economy added 255,000 jobs in July, the second straight month of much-better-than-expected hiring, allaying fears about the economy. ISM's manufacturing index and nonmanufacturing index fell a little more than forecast, but still pointed to growth. Strong hiring and wage gains should support consumer spending and housing demand, despite many consumer-related firms reporting stalling demand.Tesla took a step closer toward acquiring SolarCity for $2.6 billion as a special committee of ""independent and disinterested"" SolarCity board members evaluated the proposal and alternatives, stating its approval of the merger. The deal still needs to be approved by shareholders and regulators.Tesla reported Q2 earnings that missed estimates but showed improvements in electric-car production. Its production is on track to support about 50,000 deliveries in the second half of 2016, which reaffirmed previous guidance.The electric-car company's losses ballooned to $1.06 a share from 48 cents in the year-earlier figure, much greater than the 52-cent loss estimate. Tesla reported non-GAAP revenue of $1.56 billion, up 33% but missing the consensus of $1.62 billion.Tesla fell 2% for the week, while SolarCity lost more than 7%.Ride-hailing giant Uber Technologies is selling its Chinese operations to Apple (AAPL)-backed rival Didi Chuxing Technologies, capitulating on an expensive battle for a foothold in China. The deal has Uber swapping its Chinese business for a 20% stake in Didi, making the former foe the largest stakeholder in Didi. In turn, Didi will become the de facto ride-hailing leader in China, valued at more than $35 billion. Uber's most recent valuations put it north of $68 billion.Verizon Communications (VZ) agreed to buy Fleetmatics (FLTX), a vehicle tracking system maker, for $2.4 billion, or $60 per share. The acquisition expands Verizon' push into web-connected vehicles, part of the Internet of Things. Ireland-based Fleetmatics' mobile-software platform lets businesses manage commercial fleets by providing data on vehicle location, fuel usage, speed and mileage.Verizon fell 3.2% for the week, dropping below a buy point and its 50-day moving average. Fleetmatics jumped 38.5% to 59.50.Time Warner (TWX) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA) both turned in mixed results, but Time Warner's move to buy a 10% stake in Netflix (NFLX) rival Hulu – joining current co-owners Walt Disney (DIS), Fox and Comcast (CMCSA) -- stole headlines. Viacom (VIAB) reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, as did Lions Gate (LGF), which posted a surprise Q1 profit.U.S. oil prices fell below $40 per barrel early in the week, following July's 14% tumble, as OPEC production climbed on strong output from Nigeria and Iraq. Saudi Arabia continued to pump out oil near record highs. U.S. crude stockpiles rose in the latest week, according to the Energy Information Administration, but U.S. production dipped and gasoline supplies fell. Shale producers Continental Resources (CLR), Oasis Petroleum (OAS), and Laredo Petroleum (LPI) all lifted their output forecasts. Oil closed the week higher, at $41.80.Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) plunged 16% Friday after its cancer drug Opdivo ended a string of clinical-trial successes with its failure in a trial as a single therapy of newly diagnosed lung-cancer patients. Merck (MRK) had succeeded with a similar patient group in a trial of its competing drug Keytruda, though it was aiming at a smaller potential market. Merck stock jumped 10.4%, hitting its highest level since June 2001.Earlier, Merck was reported to be talking with Biogen (BIIB) about a possible Biogen buyout, as was Allergan (AGN). This further boosted Biogen's stock a day after its partner Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) announced the unexpected success of a clinical trial of nusinersen, a treatment for a rare spinal disease with blockbuster potential. Biogen rose nearly 9% for the week.Meanwhile specialty drugmakers Mallinckrodt (MNK) and Shire (SHPG) rose 19% and 3.5%, respectively, after they beat estimates and raised guidance, while Pfizer (PFE), Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) slipped after they beat Q2 numbers but issued so-so guidance. Animal-health company Zoetis (ZTS) also rose after beating and raising.General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) led auto stocks lower after reporting slower U.S. sales for the month of July, with Ford projecting U.S. industry sales to fall in 2016 and 2017 after years of big gains. Department stores, grocery stores, restaurants and airlines also declined, but recovered somewhat by week's end.The sell-off among consumer stocks triggers a warning for the broader U.S. economy amid falling business investment and homebuilder spending. Consumer spending rose at a strong 4.2% annual rate in Q2, but if that falters, the economy may not be able to match its anemic Q2 GDP growth of 1.2%.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) beat Q2 earnings estimates, with EPS up 57% to 47 cents, but revenue growth of 12% to $508.8 million missed views. The steakhouse chain also said early Q3 same-restaurant sales growth had slowed from Q2.The outlook comes amid growing worries about the restaurant sector overall. Starbucks (SBUX) and McDonald's both recently reported weak U.S. comps amid warnings from analysts about the retail sector.But pizza delivery chains including Papa John's (PZZA) are bucking the trend. Papa John's said EPS jumped 30% to 61 cents to top views, and raised guidance for the rest of the year.

315,SBUX,"McDonald's (MCD) on Wednesday signaled a major shift in its operations, saying that it is testing food deliveries and will launch a mobile order and pay platform in 20,000 restaurants in the U.S. and elsewhere by the end of the year.The moves mark the latest effort by a restaurant to become more mobile-oriented, as the smartphone replaces the drive-through as the next front for convenience in the industry. More restaurants are trying out mobile ordering and delivery services  to appeal to diners who would rather stay home.Dow industrials component McDonald's said at its 2017 investor meeting that it is testing or exploring deliveries with third-parties such as UberEats and GrubHub (GRUB).McDonald's said the deliveries business is already a $100 billion industry. McDonald's has tested deliveries for years, CEO Steve Easterbrook said, but now sees a chance to ""scale quickly."" McDonald's already gets $1 billion in delivery sales worldwide, mostly in China and other parts of Asia.There has been some concern that hamburgers won't travel as well as, say, pizza. However, Jack in the Box (JACK), which is testing late-night deliveries, recently said its late-night customers were more ""forgiving"" on quality issues.A big advantage for McDonald's deliveries: The burger giant noted that 75% of the population in its five biggest markets — U.S., France, the U.K., Germany and Canada — live within three miles of a McDonald's.McDonald's shares rose 1.1% to 129.05, hitting a more-than-nine-month high in the stock market today. Trading was  halted for a substantial time during the investor meeting. The stock has a potential buy point of 132.06 in a cup base going back nearly 10 months.GrubHub, which wasn't moving much before McDonald's comments, rose 3.2%, closing just below its 200-day moving average. Yelp (YELP), a local search service that has a GrubHub rival, climbed 2.85%.McDonald's mobile order and pay news followed news last year that the burger giant would debut such a system in 2017.The plans also follow Domino's Pizza's (DPZ) resounding success with its digital ordering technology. Starbucks' (SBUX) mobile order and pay platform has also been popular.IBD'S TAKE: Domino's CEO Patrick Doyle told IBD explained why his pizza chain should benefit from fast-food rivals adopting mobile ordering.But concerns have surfaced about the longer lines and traffic bottlenecks that have resulted from the coffee giant's mobile ordering platform, perhaps raising questions about what types of restaurants are best suited to the technology or the most effective ways to use it.Domino's stock fell 1.2% as McDonald's looms as a digital and delivery competitor, though it was off session lows. Starbucks rose 0.5%.McDonald's at the investor conference touted other digital initiatives, including revamping 2,500 U.S. restaurants to its advanced ""Experience of the Future"" format by year end as well as digital menu boards at drive-thrus. The chain said that format, which includes table service and kiosk ordering, will be in most of its traditional U.S. restaurants by the end of 2020.Following a Bloomberg report last week that McDonald's would start offering $1 sodas and $2 McCafe drinks, McDonald's also said Wednesday that it saw ""significant"" opportunity in coffee.McDonald's said it was re-evaluating ""everything"" in its core menu products, with an eye on improving the taste and quality of its food as more consumers go for healthier or fresher ingredients.""We are simply a machine when we get going,"" CEO Easterbrook said.McDonald's on Wednesday said it will return $22 billion to $24 billion in cash to shareholders over the next three years.The company also said it was targeting annual sales growth of 3%-5% and annual earnings-per-share growth ""in the high-single digits"" starting in 2019. McDonald's also said it was on pace to refranchise 4,000 restaurants by year's end, ahead of schedule.The plans, the company said, could help it retain and reclaim customers, who may have been lost to smaller burger or fast-casual chains pushing better ingredients.""As customers' expectations increased, McDonald's simply didn't keep pace with them,"" the company said in a statement.The aggressive showcase of McDonald's technological advances Wedneday follows concerns about the momentum of the company's two-year-old turnaround plans.Sales jumped following McDonald's introduction of All Day Breakfast in 2015, but analysts began to wonder last year whether the company could keep up its sales  acceleration and whether it had relied too much on the expanded breakfast hours to do so.RELATED:

316,SBUX,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said Tuesday that the bank would hike its minimum hourly wage to $12-$16.50 for 18,000 employees, many of them bank tellers or other customer service employees, arguing that wages for many in the U.S. ""have gone nowhere for too long.""The increase, which comes as bank branches face potential disruption from new technology, will take hold over the next three years, Dimon said in an op-ed in the New York Times. The bank's current minimum hourly wage for U.S. staff is $10.15, he said.Dimon's announcement also comes amid calls nationwide for higher pay from restaurant and retail employees who have struggled to make ends meet and complained of difficult or reduced schedule hours. A day earlier, coffee giant Starbucks (SBUX) said that it would institute a minimum 5% pay hike for store managers and other employees in U.S. company-operated stores as of Oct. 3. Wal-Mart (WMT) said it would give a raise to more than 1.2 million store employees earlier this year.But wage increases could mean higher prices for customers, as well as  the arrival other ""labor saving"" measures. Starbucks raised coffee drink prices Tuesday, a day after its wage-hike announcement. Wendy's (WEN) has said it would make self-ordering kiosks available to its restaurants. But McDonald's (MCD), which has announced its own base pay hikes, has said such technology would be unlikely to result in lost jobs.Dimon said JPMorgan would also put more than $200 million this year toward training thousands of its entry-level consumer banking employees. The pay increase and the training investment would help retain and develop talent.In the coming years, however, bank branches could be overhauled due to the rise of financial tech startups, which could move many of the services provided at a local branch to one's smartphone. The fintech industry in recent months has had its own problems with loan volume growth and the possibility of increased regulatory scrutiny, but its technology could result in lost jobs.JPMorgan, which reports Q2 earnings on Thursday, closed up 1.5% in the stock market today, pushing above its 50-day moving average. Starbucks climbed 2.1%, while Wal-Mart fell 1.1%.McDonald's edged up 0.2%, while Wendy's ended flat.

Starbucks is approaching its 200-day line, its next technical hurdle.The price hike comes a day after the coffee-shop giant announced 5%-15% in wage increases for its U.S. workers, effective October.In related wage-hike news, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon wrote in a New York Times editorial Tuesday that over the next three years, the bank will increase its minimum hourly pay to $12-$16.50, up from $10.15. The move affects 18,000 employees.JPMorgan shares rose 1.5% Tuesday.Wal-Mart (WMT) and McDonald's (MCD) are among other companies to announce significant base wage hikes in the past year as they face political pressure and tighter labor markets.IBD'S TAKE: Starbucks has been a steady earnings performer for the past five years, which makes buying on pullbacks a sound strategy.

"
322,SBUX,"Believe it or not, the text of the law known as ObamaCare demands that companies provide — not just offer — the same health coverage to most rank-and-file, full-time workers as they do to the CEO.So why did Starbucks (SBUX) just announce -- along with wage increases -- that it's going to let its store employees opt for a lower level of insurance and more take-home pay?""The new health care options allow partners to only pay for the coverage they want and will actually use,"" Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz wrote in a letter to employees.One reason Starbucks is making the move is likely because a lot of workers want that option, which might save them $800 a year. Another reason is that, six years after its passage, the IRS has never been able to translate ObamaCare's pie-in-the-sky dictate into a workable regulation and probably never will.No big deal, you might think, if it's truly pie in the sky. Yet beyond the happy talk of everyone getting the same excellent employer health coverage, the reality of ObamaCare's employer rules has been a disaster for modest-wage, full-time workers and their families.According to Kaiser Family Foundation estimates, there were as many as 4.9 million Americans who were uninsured last year but ineligible for subsidies to buy coverage via the ObamaCare exchanges because they — or a spouse — were offered coverage by an employer.This is the predictable result of employer mandate rules that shield companies from potential fines as long as they offer workers ""affordable"" coverage that costs much more than their modest-wage workers are likely to pay: as much as 9.66% of their gross income for a high-deductible bronze-type plan in 2016.Even low-wage employers offering a somewhat better deal haven't found many takers. Insurance take-up by fewer than 10% of low-wage workers at a company is commonplace, the New York Times has reported. Wendy's (WEN) initially expected its health insurance tab to jump by $25,000 per restaurant. But the burger chain cut that to $5,000 before the law got off the ground in 2013 because Wendy's found few interested employees.This year, for a 30-year-old full-time worker earning $10 an hour ($20,800 a year), ObamaCare deems a $2,000 annual premium for a $6,000-deductible employer plan to be affordable. Yet individuals at the same income level who have no offer of employer insurance can get a subsidized bronze exchange plan for $437 per year, according to Kaiser's health subsidy calculator.The rules don't just hurt workers; they also narrow the potential pool of exchange members, leaving a sicker group of customers that has swamped the likes of UnitedHealth (UNH) and Humana (HUM) with losses and forced them to the exits in a number of states.Amid an absence of more sensible rules, ObamaCare has encouraged employers to offer a type of coverage that the law's crafters thought was history: so-called ""skinny"" plans that don't cover hospitalization or surgery but cost little and will allow workers to avoid an individual mandate tax penalty. The plans are reportedly popular in the staffing and accommodation industry and among other low-wage employers. Another new twist to hold down employer costs is health insurance that doesn't cover outpatient surgery.A survey from the National Business Group on Health found that 16% of large employers in 2015 planned to offer workers the choice of skinny coverage or a more comprehensive but much less affordable plan that would keep the companies from having to pay a mandate penalty.The real fear about the ObamaCare employer mandate was that employers would cut workers' hours below 30 per week to dodge the fines for failing to offer suitable coverage. As Goldman Sachs pointed out recently, that's happened to at least a modest extent and partly explains why nearly 2 million more people are stuck working part-time than a decade ago. Yet companies haven't had to resort to cutting workers to part-time status in a major way because they have figured out how to minimize their liability under the law.Labor Department data confirm that ObamaCare's employer mandate has largely struck out when it comes to getting employers in low-wage industries to provide health coverage to their workers.Private service-occupation employers paid even less for employee health benefits in the first quarter of 2016 — just 89 cents per hour of work — than they paid before ObamaCare became law in 2010. That compares with health benefits of $2.71 per hour for workers in production occupations and $3.81 per hour of work for managers and professionals.The accommodation and food service industries still pay just 65 cents per work hour in insurance benefits, up a mere six cents in the past six years. Retailers now pay $1.25 per hour of work on employee insurance benefits, virtually unchanged from $1.24 per hour in early 2010. While Wal-Mart (WMT) said it faced $500 million in extra health benefit costs in 2014 (and responded by eliminating coverage for some part-time workers), other companies whose employment policies don't face such intense scrutiny have had a relatively easy time escaping the law's costs.The reality couldn't be much further from the idealized vision of low-wage workers getting the same coverage as their bosses.A small section of ObamaCare entitled ""Prohibition on Discrimination in Favor of Highly Compensated Individuals"" was supposed to extend rules governing self-funded plans to all employer-sponsored group plans. But benefits experts suggest the self-funded plan rules were fuzzy and often ignored in the past, and the IRS said it would review those rules even as it drew up regulations for fully insured plans.The self-funded plan rules essentially require that health benefit plans offered to top executives be offered on similar terms to 80% of full-time workers over the age of 25. Yet offering isn't enough: At least 70% of eligible workers must take the offer to prove nondiscrimination.
"
323,SBUX,"More than two-thirds (67%) of African-Americans are now investing in the stock market, according to Ariel Investments' 2015 Black Investor Survey, released this year. That's not the all-time high in percentage terms. But it's up 7 percentage points from Ariel's last such survey in 2010.Will this uptrend continue? To get answers, IBD spoke with Mellody Hobson, president of Chicago-based Ariel Investments, an African-American-owned mutual fund company with more than $10 billion under management. Hobson is also chairman of the board of trustees of Ariel Investment Trust and board chairman of DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc.IBD:  In your surveys, stock investing by African-Americans, as a percentage, peaked in 2002, then generally slid until perking up in 2015. What's been causing the swings?Hobson: The market's dot.com period had been a remarkable time for investors. But when that bubble burst, the result was dramatic: It threw novice, first-time, African-American investors out of the market, and people who had gotten burned became leery of stocks. Since then, there's been a return to the market, especially via the growth of automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans.IBD: From here, will stock investing by African-Americans be growing more consistently?Hobson: With the wide use of auto enrollment in 401(k) plans, my gut instinct is yes. And millennials are likely to be a big part of this.But there are cultural issues -- we've identified five of these -- that have been holding us back. These include limits on market knowledge; misinformation -- such as you have to be wealthy to be an investor; and serious issues about trust in the market and fraud. African-Americans have also lacked the context to figure out how to get actively involved, and as first-time investors, we (the African-American community) tend to invest very conservatively. For instance, we consider buying a CD to be investing. These factors make it hard to catch up soon to the level of stock investing by whites (at 86% of respondents in 2015, according to Ariel's survey).IBD: However, your data show African-Americans are noticeably more optimistic than whites (75% vs. 50%) about the economy and more bullish on the stock market (65% versus (53%). Why?Hobson: It comes down to expectations: Traditionally, we've had lower expectations than whites. That's left us with more room for growth in this area: If you've faced discrimination, or fewer opportunities, you can be discouraged, or you can hope that things will get better. We tend to hold out hope.We've always been rooted in the idea that things will get better. We've been religious, and the church has always been a big factor in our lives. So if you overlay that with our views on the economy and bullishness, you'll find they're consistent.IBD: Do you think the recent violence in this country dims this optimism?Hobson: The African-American community would say that this has been going on a long time. As blacks we were taught about discrimination as children. It's just that recent events have made the lingering problems more evident to whites.But I don't think it puts our (positive) attitudes on hold because the undercurrents have always been there.IBD: Speaking of optimism and bullishness, your survey shows stocks are now African-Americans' top-choice investment. Why?Hobson: Traditionally, real estate had been African-Americans' be-all and end-all, the bricks and mortar that we understood and which could provide rental income. But attitudes changed as the real estate bubble burst in the 2007-09 period. That was followed by a rally in the stock market, which had bottomed in '09. As stocks recovered strongly, people began viewing the market through a more favorable lens.IBD: What are the preferred investment choices now?Hobson: Typically, we start investing through 401(k) plans. Within those plans, popular choices tend to be funds for large-cap stocks, as well as fixed income and balanced funds.And after they've gotten comfortable with retirement plan investing, some people have been opening up a brokerage account.IBD: What are the smart and not-so-smart stock investing moves by African-Americans?Hobson: On the plus side: I'm glad to see a willingness (60% of blacks and 78% of whites) to ride out the market's swings and stay invested.On the downside: 65% of African-Americans and 51% of whites believe that market-timing is important. This is just wrong -- and it's a notion investment firms and mutual funds companies have been fighting.  Another bad idea: acting on stock tips. Before buying a stock, you need to do research and be knowledgeable about it -- not just grab something heard about at the water cooler.IBD: Do many African-Americans use a financial advisor?Hobson: African-Americans are generally more novice investors than whites. Our prior research has shown that (as a group) we're more likely to seek the counsel of financial advisors. Like all people, African-Americans want financial security and a better life for their children.I don't think market professionals have yet been noticing this market. But it is a very real opportunity for them -- and over time, it's one they'll find valuable.IBD: What's the best way for African-Americans to gain knowledge about how to make money in the stock market?Hobson: I'd recommend getting a knowledgeable financial advisor that can help educate clients and explain financial terminology in a clear, understandable way. I also tell people to immerse themselves in publications' business pages so they can get used to the lingo and terminology, which will help educate them over time. Among publications, I particularly like Black Enterprise's coverage of personal finance and investing. Among the books people should read is my favorite, ""Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist,"" by Roger Lowenstein. Among internet resources, Morningstar.com does a great job, and I also particularly like HelloWallet.com.IBD: How did you get into this industry?Hobson: I didn't grow up in a household that discussed the stock market. I was one of six kids raised in Chicago by a single mom, and we worked hard to make ends meet. As a child, I was desperate to learn about money and financial security.I entered the investment world working as a college summer intern at Ariel Investments. Later, as I would give talks and speeches about investing, I discovered my community was a missing link when it came to public knowledge and awareness of savings and investments. So I decided to shine a light on this issue.IBD: What does your personal investment portfolio contain?Hobson:  To accommodate an expected long life, I am 100% invested in stocks. My family has a money manager and we favor value investing. I am not an active stock-picker. I have holdings in all six of Ariel's mutual funds. I also own shares in the individual companies -- Estee Lauder (EL), Starbucks (SBUX) and DreamWorks (DWA) -- in which I sit on the board and I have stock holdings in a few other companies, including Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB).IBD: What's the most important thing African-American parents can teach their children about money and investing?Hobson: It's important for a child to understand compound interest. That's what Warren Buffett calls the Eighth Wonder of the World.  This concept is so important because it explains how money can grow and shows how having high interest rate debt makes it so difficult to get ahead.The way it can be explained to a child:  Show through examples how money grows on top of itself.  Take a penny, add interest onto it. That makes it, say, a penny-and-a-half. After that, interest gets added to the (new total) of a penny-and-a-half, creating a higher amount, and so forth.

324,SBUX,"Chorizo? Rewards program? So far, so good, says one analyst who follows Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG).The fast casual chain's newest efforts to bring more customers through the door are encouraging and could fuel sales in both the short term and further down the road, according to BMO Capital Markets analyst Andrew Strelzik.""While the rewards program's design may have flaws, 'Chiptopia' likely represents an initial offering that could evolve in terms of structure and platform,"" Strelzik wrote in a note Wednesday. He added that the company's lack of a loyalty program (read: lack of customer data) until now may have slowed its recovery following its food-safety stumbles in late 2015.""In addition, 'Chiptopia' and chorizo may represent the first of a broader list of long-term sales drivers, including broadly enhanced mobile capabilities and changes to better utilize the second make line,"" Strelzik went on to say.The Chiptopia loyalty program differs from Starbucks' (SBUX) and other rewards offerings in that it emphasizes visits, not dollars spent. That's likely a reaction to the company's nearly 30% plunge in first-quarter comparable restaurant sales.(Click here for the full rundown on Chipotle's new rewards program -- and its limitations.)Chorizo, one of Chipotle's first new menu items in years, appears to be surprisingly popular with diners, notes Strelzik, with informal polls revealing that 40% of Chipotle locations ran out of the ingredient.BMO rates Chipotle outperform with a 550 price target.Chipotle also unveiled a new ad, an animated short film that criticizes how many fast-food giants use processed ingredients, a way for Chipotle to reinforce its ""Food with integrity"" slogan.Chipotle shares rose 1.2% to 401.05 on the stock market today. The stock has halved in value since peaking last August. Chipotle has, for the most part, been trading below its 50-day moving average since last October, only briefly ascending above that key level in February and March.RELATED:Chipotle Rewards Program Is Generous -- Here's Why It May Fail.

325,SBUX,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) has offered freebies, rewards and promises of more careful food preparation in a bid to woo diners back into its restaurants. Ahead of its quarterly report on Thursday, here's a look at what Wall Street expects from the company.Analysts are currently expecting a 79% drop in per-share profit to 94 cents, down from $4.45 in the prior-year quarter, on a 12% revenue tumble to $1.05 billion.Quick recap: The embattled fast-casual chain clocked in a devastating 29.7% slide in same-restaurant sales in its March-ended quarter and swung to an 88-cent-per-share loss. Chipotle management said in its previous earnings call that April comps were down 26%, excluding Easter benefits.All eyes will be on Chipotle's same-store sales again this Thursday. Credit Suisse said Tuesday that it expects a 20% comp drop for Chipotle's second quarter, matching consensus views, up from prior expectations for a 22% drop.""(But) these sales forecasts are a notable improvement from -30% comp in Q1, CMG's sales recovery seems to have stalled out in recent months,"" wrote Credit Suisse analyst Jason West on Tuesday.And Morgan Stanley on Friday downgraded Chipotle to equal weight from overweight, cutting its price target to 405 from 500, citing ""new evidence that the sales recovery will remain more protracted than the market believes, and possibly more costly as a result, as CMG likely needs to ramp up marketing (spending) to lure consumers back in.""Shares closed up 1.6% at 415.31 in the stock market today. The stock has lost about a third of its value since early November as foodborne illness outbreaks rocked investors' faith in the company. This has translated to a stock that has barely come up for air above its 50-day line over the last nine months.IBD's TAKE: While Chipotle shares have plummeted, McDonald's stock is approaching buy range ahead of its Q2 earnings results. For a deeper look at what that means for investors, read this Income Investor.Chipotle rolled out a loyalty program, Chiptopia, in an effort to attract more foot traffic. While the associated freebies are generous, the stigma and fear of getting food poisoning from the burrito chain seems to be lingering.Morgan Stanley said that its latest 2,000-person poll from June reveals that about 13% of Chipotle consumers maintain that they ""won't go back anytime soon, or at least not for another year — similar to results seen in January.""Domino's Pizza (DPZ), Starbucks (SBUX), and Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) also report on Thursday.

326,SBUX,"The consumer stock sell-off intensified and broadened Tuesday, as bad news from General Motors (GM) added to concerns from McDonald's (MCD), Ford Motor (F) and others.The consumer slide fueled a general market retreat. But it's also a warning for the broader U.S. economy.Recent economic data on consumers have been positive. Consumer spending rose at a robust 4.2% annual rate in the second quarter, with a Tuesday report showing a 0.4% monthly gain in June. But consumers were a rare bright spot, with business investment falling for a third straight quarter and homebuilding spending also falling. If consumer spending falters, the economy may struggle to match its anemic second-quarter growth of 1.2%.General Motors and Ford reported July U.S. sales that fell vs. a year earlier. Fiat Chrysler Automotive (FCAU) eked out a gain, but less than expected. Ford had reported weak earnings last week amid rising incentives spending and stalling U.S. demand. It sees U.S. industry sales falling in 2016 and 2017 after years of big gains.General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler shares fell 4.4%, 4.3% and 4%, respectively, on the stock market today.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), which has been a top-rated restaurant stock, fell 12.4% Tuesday. The steakhouse chain missed on second-quarter revenue and said same-store sales growth was slowing in the early weeks of the current third quarter. Dave & Buster's (PLAY) dived 5.6%, taking a round trip on its breakout.Those follow weaker demand at McDonald's, which had been a great turnaround story in recent months. But last week McDonald's said U.S. comps in the second quarter fell short of Wall Street forecasts, and cited ""softening industry growth."" Starbucks (SBUX) also reported weak U.S. comps.More generally, analysts have been issuing warnings about the retail sector.McDonald's fell 0.3% Tuesday and Starbucks 1.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Texas Roadhouse and Dave & Buster's have been among the best-rated restaurant stocks in recent weeks. For a complete look at these stocks and other consumer giants, take a look at IBD Stock Checkup.Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) cut its 2016 outlook Tuesday, citing higher fuel costs and the weak British pound following the Brexit vote. Royal Caribbean stock sank 6.3% Tuesday. Carnival (CCL) lost 3.1%.Airlines sold off Tuesday as Delta Air Lines (DAL) said unit revenue fell sharply in July. Also hitting the sector: A Zika virus warning for a Miami neighborhood and  German carrier Lufthansa saying that terror attacks and global unease have had a ""tangible"" impact on demand. Delta Air stock fell more than 7% intraday, while American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) fell 6%.Department stores were among the biggest losers, with Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) down 8% and Nordstrom (JWN) tumbling 7%.Kroger got a downgrade from BMO Capital Markets to market perform from outperform, citing the deflationary environment for groceries. Shares are off 4.1%, on track for their lowest close since early January 2015. That follows weak same-store sales from natural foods grocer Whole Foods Market (WFM).One relative bright spot for consumer stocks has been consumer products producers such as Procter & Gamble (PG). P&G edged past profit views Tuesday, rising 0.4% to 86.78 for a 52-week high. But Procter & Gamble and other consumer- and food-product giants have been relying on cost cuts to offset declining revenue.

For Q3, Netflix expects to add 2.3 million new subscribers, vs. analyst estimates for 3.7 million. Netflix blamed the slowing subscriber growth on increased churn related to price increases for longtime subscribers. It also said the Summer Olympics will put the brakes on new subscriber gains in August. Netflix topped profit views, but shares sank nearly 13% for the week.Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk unveiled his ambitious, long-term plans for the electric car company in combination with SolarCity (SCTY), which Tesla aims to acquire in a $2.8 billion offer. Plans include a new kind of pickup and minibus, as well as a compact SUV and a commercial truck. All of this as Tesla struggles to meet its production goals. The expansive report gave no indication about when Tesla will be consistently profitable. Tesla stock fell more than 3% on Thursday after the ""masterplan"" was released, but rose close to 1% for the week, holding above the 200-day line.Tesla will hold a ""grand opening"" event July 29 for its Gigafactory, though the Reno, Nev., battery plant is far from finished.IBD'S TAKE: Tesla stock is still trying to recover and the company has report several quarters of losses.

Shares fell Thursday but rose 2.3% for the week.EBay (EBAY) gapped out of a base, spiking 16% for the week to a record high after reporting Q2 EPS growth of 2% to 43 cents, beating views by a penny. Revenue rose 6% to $2.2 billion, also topping. Top- and bottom-line guidance for Q3 was light, but eBay's full-year projections were strong.

Reports say Verizon (VZ) may announce a Yahoo buyout deal within a few days.Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) reported mixed earnings. Intel's $13.5 billion and 59 cents earnings per share ex items for Q2 edged and topped the consensus, respectively. But Intel shares fell from an 18-month high on weaker-than-expected data center sales, though they closed the week down just 1.2%. Qualcomm reported $6 billion in sales and $1.16 EPS ex items for fiscal Q3, beating Wall Street expectations for a respective $5.58 billion and 97 cents. Qualcomm shares rose nearly 12% to a nine-month high. For fiscal Q3, Skyworks reported $751.7 million in sales and $1.24 EPS minus items, both down 7% vs. the year-earlier quarter but narrowly beating consensus expectations. Skyworks slid 8.6% on Friday and 3.8% for the week.After a long review, the Justice Department filed to block the Aetna (AET)-Humana (HUM) and Anthem (ANTM)-Cigna (CI) mergers, saying they would hurt competition and consumers. Shares rose on the news though, as investors had priced in skepticism that the deals would win approval. Meanwhile, Humana raised its EPS guidance and said it will exit many ObamaCare exchange markets next year. UnitedHealth (UNH), the largest managed care firm, topped EPS views and said 2017 profit will improve from exiting nearly all exchanges.United Airlines (UAL) beat Q2 estimates and cut full-year carrying capacity growth, as international uncertainties weighed. The carrier also said it would reduce winter flights to the U.K. Delta Air Lines (DAL) said in the prior week that it would do the same following the nation's Brexit vote. Southwest (LUV) forecast a Q3 unit revenue decline, which would be its first this year. The carrier also missed Q2 estimates, and, like Spirit Airlines (SAVE), indicated that heavy lower-fare competition persists -- good for customers, but bad for airlines' financial results. American Airlines (AAL) reported a Q2 profit drop that wasn't as bad as expected. American also said the Brexit may help, not hurt, global carriers.The Q2 season kicked off with three solid reports from big-cap drugmakers. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) beat estimates and raised guidance, driven by the strength of its pharma division.

The attempted coup in Turkey isn't expected to weigh on the fighter's sales or production. Textron (TXT), maker of Cessna planes and Bell helicopters, reported a 10% jump in EPS, beating analyst expectations and revenue that climbed 8.1%, also above Wall Street views.

333,SBUX,"The U.K.'s decision last week to exit the European Union apparently hasn't slowed the EU's regulatory crackdown on big U.S. tech companies.The EU is taking steps that could lead to a third antitrust complaint against Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google, this time over its lucrative advertising services, Bloomberg reported Monday.The European Commission's antitrust authority is likely to file a formal statement of objections after it receives permission from the search leader's critics to share their evidence with Google, Bloomberg said.In the other two antitrust cases,  Alphabet's Google was charged with unfairly promoting its own services over rivals in shopping search services and abusing its dominant market share position with the Android mobile operating system.U.S. critics have accused Europe's antitrust regulator of being motivated by an anti-American bias in its pursuit of cases against U.S. companies. The EU has launched probes against Amazon.com (AMZN), Qualcomm (QCOM) and other major U.S. firms.In February, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew accused the EU of unfairly targeting American companies in its investigation into possible corporate tax avoidance. EU targets in the tax probe include Amazon, Apple (AAPL) and Starbucks (SBUX).Amid continued fallout from Britain's vote Thursday to exit the EU, Alphabet stock dipped 0.6% to 661.14 in the stock market today, touching an eight-month intraday low after falling 4.2% on Friday.

334,SBUX,"Cooking-equipment maker Middleby (MIDD) spent a good part of last year trying to address a troubling situation: 75 reports that gas ranges made by Viking, the high-end oven maker it bought some three years ago, were turning on by themselves. Viking recalled around 60,000 ovens due to those reports, and Middleby -- which makes cooking appliances for homes and restaurants -- stresses those ovens were made prior to the acquisition. But the recall heightened problems within Viking that weighed on Middleby's finances. Among them: Delays in refrigeration products Middleby had been trying to make more energy-efficient, concerns about Viking's residential products and questions over whether the $380 million Middleby paid was too much for a company seen as lacking new ideas or sufficient margins.For Middleby officials, quality concerns of this magnitude are not what they're used to encountering.""Papa John's (PZZA) runs our oven almost 18 to 20 hours a day -- especially on weekends,"" Chief Executive Selim Bassoul told IBD. ""And it cannot break down. It is not allowed to break down.""Yet shares of Middleby are up around 32% since February as the company turns out sales growth that outpaces competitors and works aggressively -- and to a large extent effectively, some analysts say -- to turn Viking around. The company has a 98 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99. That sales growth has been led by an array of kitchen items that cater to more selective home chefs and a competitive restaurant industry, which has been set on international expansion and on serving food in a way that's quicker, fresher and more cost-effective.Roth Capital analyst Tony Brenner wrote in a research note last month that new product introductions addressing increased speed, energy and labor saving ""should continue to play a key role in increasing sales and margins."" Those gains would also come as the bar rises for service, even within fast food.  An array of big restaurant chains are customers of Middleby -- Starbucks (SBUX), McDonald's (MCD), Wendy's (WEN), Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Yum Brands' (YUM) KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell -- along with higher-end chains. Want an oven that can cook a pizza in 90 seconds or a steamer that saves water by utilizing the food's moisture? Middleby has those. Need an oven that can make a steak look and taste like it was fussed over by a chef, or an oven system that can do the work of a line cook or two? Middleby has some of those too.Middleby has a lot of those things in no small part because of acquisitions. It has made more than 40 since 2000, according to the Great Lakes Review stock-picking service, with most of those deals coming during Bassoul's tenure. ""He never sits on his laurels,"" Elliott Schlang, Great Lakes' founder, said of Bassoul. ""He's always doing something new and innovative, to broaden his product line and to give the restauranteur what he needs.""Restaurants, Bassoul said, face greater demand for breakfast, potentially requiring adjustments to space in the kitchen and on the grill. Greater demand for delivery and analytics, he said, will necessitate more connected, automated cooking equipment. And higher employee wages -- as have been demanded industrywide -- are inevitable.""It's going to happen,"" he said. After reaching an intraday high of 127 on June 8, shares slipped below their 50-day moving average Friday in light of the U.K. Brexit selloff. Shares ended Monday trading around 110. That means restaurants will likely seek technology in place of people. The company's Kitchen of the Future, a conveyor-oven system with an infrared broiler and warming cabinet, helps restaurants get more usage out of each square foot. The system also uses technology that cuts usage of oven burners when not in use.    ""This array replaces convection ovens, fryers, microwaves, grills, charbroilers and salamanders (broiler units), prepares food faster and with greater consistency and can eliminate two or three line cooks from the kitchen,"" Brenner wrote. Profit margins on such projects, he said, ""reportedly exceed 50%.""Middleby's ventless cooking equipment saves energy -- and a lot of money -- because it doesn't require a large, bolted-down ventilation system. Since much of a kitchen's layout hinges on where ventilation is located, ventless technology helps kitchens become more flexible with floor space and menus. The company's holding trays can also control for moisture and heat, enabling restaurants to keep items fresher for longer and served quickly.""People have a tendency to think this stuff tastes like airplane food,"" BB&T analyst Schon Williams said of machine-prepared items. ""I've done a lot of taste tests -- and it's improved the taste concept among customers.""The company's food and beverage equipment has also helped some restaurants with an international presence to step up their breakfast game, although Middleby wouldn't say who.""We have a number of key executives throughout our organization that literally know how to build a store, build a restaurant, build a small-box retail operation, that know how to lay out a kitchen, that actually have done that,"" COO David Brewer told IBD.And as more people aspire toward the artisanal in their homes, the sophistication in Middleby's commercial operations has made its way into its residential products. Viking plans to launch an oven that, it says, can cook a rack of lamb in four minutes and a 12-pound turkey in 42 minutes.The company could also use design elements from AGA Rangemaster, a U.K. company it acquired that's known for its rustic-chic ovens and cast iron cookers, to make fancy home products even fancier.Management's experience in cooking equipment has also helped during the company's rare moments of difficulty, as with the Viking acquisition.After that acquisition, the company deployed scores of engineers to Viking to assess potential problems. In quality tests, they hung weights off of refrigerator doors, which could sometimes fall off, Williams said, and in one instance Bassoul slammed an oven door over and over until it broke.The company strengthened Viking's packaging materials. Following the recall, Middleby has sued former senior staff at Viking, and Middleby's salesforce has worked to reclaim goodwill among dealers and made the wiring of Viking ovens less complicated.""That's a hallmark of Middleby, just in terms of reducing the number of parts, reducing complexity whenever possible,"" Williams said. He later added: ""Time and time again they've proven they can restructure all these businesses.""Almost all Viking dealers have resumed buying the company's products, Middleby says. As restaurants expand internationally, so will Middleby, and Bassoul hopes to make its Viking residential platform a more global entity.Steel prices, Schlang noted, risk hurting the bottom line if they rise, and the company's food-processing business still lives project to project, analysts say. Brenner also said that Middleby's main competitors are bigger and have deep pockets. Manitowoc (MTW) is among its biggest rivals, but its focus isn't exclusive to food service.Restaurant same-store sales were also sluggish in the second quarter and could lag through the year. But as they try to keep costs down and investors happy, equipment could play just as much of a role as the food in improving what they offer to customers.""You can do that in a simple way,"" Brewer said. ""You can put the ketchup on top of the meat patty, you can put ketchup underneath the meat patty, add a pickle -- that maybe gets you a quarter. But eventually you have to bring in a new bread and toast it a different way.""

335,SBUX,"Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) new rewards program doesn't care about points or dollars, but it does very much care about how often you visit every month. But that set-up could limit the program's appeal to casual Chipotle customers, says an analyst who reiterated a sell rating on the stock.Chipotle's new short-term loyalty play -- unlike those offered by Starbucks (SBUX), Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and others -- is looking to bring back repeat customers in the wake of devastating same-restaurant sales brought on by a series of food-borne illness outbreaks.Under its three-month-long Chiptopia Summer Rewards, which runs from July through September, four visits with entree purchases -- not just a drink or a side of beans -- in one month confer ""Mild""-level achievement, i.e. one free entree.Eight entrees a month gives Chipotle customers ""Medium"" status (and another free entree), and 11 entrees earns ""Hot"" status (and yet another free entree).That's relatively generous: Jack in the Box (JACK) burrito chain Qdoba Mexican Eats essentially has a buy 10 entrees get one free, while Freebirds World Burritos lets customers get a free burrito for every $150 spent.But diners have to come back to Chipotle on different days to earn rewards, so making multiple purchases in a day doesn't translate to more freebies. That means that buying four entrees on one visit still counts toward one visit and is worth less than buying three entrees on three different days.Adding another layer of complexity, earning any of the three status levels for three straight months during the promotion period unlocks more freebies, such as catering for 20 people.The program encourages return visits instead of dropping big bucks. While Starbucks rewards customers on a per-dollar basis (a recent change from its per-visit rule), and allows users to rack up ""stars"" over time, Chipotle's rewards levels all reset at the start of each month.The structuring of the program likely has some ties to the E. coli and norovirus outbreaks late last year that scared off customers -- first-quarter comparable-restaurant sales for the March-ended period plummeted 29.7%.Chipotle's complex-but-generous rewards program risks giving away a lot of free burritos and goodies for already-paying customers, but not attracting lapsed or new diners.Maxim analyst Stephen Anderson reiterated a sell rating and 285 price target on Chipotle in a note discussing the rewards program:""We acknowledge that the rewards offered by the Chiptopia Summer Rewards program are not as extreme as the free and buy-one-get-one burrito giveaways instituted earlier in 2016, and may succeed in getting the 'Chipotle loyalist' to make incremental purchases. Nevertheless, we believe that this promotion does not offer much for the larger population of less frequent Chipotle customers (according to a July 2015 study by market research firm Technomic, only 43% of CMG's customers visit more than once a month), and that the company may need to take additional promotional measures in the coming quarters to bring these customers back.""Few other retail loyalty programs operate on a per-visit basis. Starbucks customers kicked up a fuss when the newest changes were unrolled, but they continue to sign up in droves -- and Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski said in February that the new program would prompt people to spend more money.Specialty beauty retailer Ulta Beauty rewards shoppers with a point per dollar, offering $3 off per 100 points earned, with up to $125 off for 2000 points earned. And American Express (AXP) last year introduced a cross-branded program that includes Macy's (M), AT&T (T) and other companies.Chipotle shares fell 3% to 388.78 on the stock market today, the worst close since July 2013 and just above a recent intraday low. The restaurant chain reports Q2 results on July 21. Jack in the Box lost 2.7%, Starbucks 1.8%, and Ulta lost 1.7%. The broader S&P 500 was lower by 1.8%.RELATED:Starbucks 'Star' Bucks Gain Currency Beyond Its Shops

336,SBUX,"Staying on top of the stock market involves more than knowing whether the stocks in your portfolio are rising or falling.What else is there to check? How about a sector count of the IBD 50?The IBD 50 is a computer-generated list of the stocks with the strongest fundamentals and technicals. Breaking down the IBD 50 with a sector count can give you an idea of where the strength resides in the stock market.In the list published in IBD Weekly for the week of June 13, the sector breakdown looked like this: Nine stocks from the medical sector; six in software; five each in retail, building and chips; and three for internet. Other sectors involved only one or two stocks.The first question we might ask is this: How does this compare with the IBD 50 lineup at the start of the year?At the end of 2015, there were eight medical stocks; six from the software sector; five in finance; four each in retail and business services; and three each from banks and chips.At first glance, there appear to be similarities. The medical, software, retail and chip counts stayed about the same.However, we need to ask a second question: Has rotation occurred within the sector?The medical sector shows the biggest change, despite an essentially unchanged count. For example, at the end of 2015, the biotechs were well into a downward trend. Former leaders such as Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) peaked in the first half of 2015. By the end of 2015, only three biotechs were in the IBD 50. And in the recent IBD 50, two biotechs made the list, but they were not the big winners of the previous up cycle. The two stocks are Medivation (MDVN) and Emergent BioSolutions (EBS).Could they be leaders of a biotech rebound? Possible but unlikely: Only four biotechs have a Composite Rating of 90 or better -- the two mentioned above, along with Anika Therapeutics (ANIK) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) .Software stocks have been a steady story. Four software stocks in the IBD 50 at the end of 2015 are still in the list. In the building sector, only one stock made the IBD 50 at the end of 2015. Now there are five, but none of them are homebuilders.Retail is a mix of fresh names and old names. Dave & Buster's Entertainment (PLAY) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) were in the IBD 50 at the end of the year and are in it now. Two stocks left the list -- Alibaba (BABA) and Starbucks (SBUX).Alibaba has a Relative Price Strength Rating of 65, meaning that a hefty 35% of the market is outperforming the China-based stock. Also, earnings growth decelerated over the past three quarters, and the Street has revised annual earnings lower for this year and next.Starbucks also has struggled since departing the IBD 50. The RS Rating is a miserable 37. Annual earnings revisions, however, are upward. Quarterly earnings growth has been steady, though revenue growth has stepped down.The other current retail stocks in the IBD 50 are Five Below (FIVE), Copart (CPRT) and Dollar General (DG).Sometimes a sector check won't lead to many big conclusions. Aside from the rotation in the medical sector and the increase in the building sector, the changes appear minimal.

337,SBUX,"Starbucks (SBUX) is adding new chilly drinks to its menu as the coffee titan looks to expand its cold-java market share in the U.S.Last year's introduction of ""cold brew"" coffee made a big enough splash for Starbucks to notice. Its iced portfolio grew 20% in the fourth quarter, ended Sept. 27, following the introduction of cold brew earlier in 2015, said the company in Tuesday's release. Also, nitro cold brew -- made with nitrogen -- is the No. 2-selling drink at the company's artisanal roastery and tasting room in Seattle.While cold brew still accounts for only 0.4% of 2015 ready-to-drink coffee sales industrywide, retail sales of the product shot up an estimated 115% in 2015 from the year prior, according to a Mintel report from late last year.Unlike iced coffee, which is essentially hot-brewed coffee plus ice, cold brew coffee is steeped in room-temperature water for hours. According to UCLA's ""Science and Food"" blog, cold brew is smoother and sweeter than its hot-brewed brethren. Starbucks says its cold brew coffee is slow-steeped for 20 hours.Besides cold brew and regular iced coffee, the global chain's new ""cold bar"" includes cold brew with vanilla sweet cream, Doubleshot on ice and caramel iced macchiato. Nitro cold brew is getting a rollout in major metropolitan markets later in the summer, including Seattle, Portland, New York, Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles and San Francisco.Management indicated in its most recent earnings call that cold drinks have been selling well.""In addition to our hot beverage lineup, our expanded iced beverage business is resonating with customers.,"" said Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson in late April's call, following the release of second-quarter results.Shares closed down 0.5% Tuesday as the stock continues to consolidate. The coffee giant broke support at its 50-day and 200-day lines in late April after a rare expectations miss; shares have yet to retake both key levels.Peer Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) shares lost 0.8%.

338,SBUX,"The major indexes remained stronger early Tuesday afternoon, reaching session highs after a midday pause.The S&P 500 and Dow industrials led with gains of 0.8% and nearly 0.9%, respectively, thanks mainly to a rally in the energy sector. Oil stocks gushed on news that Russia and Saudi Arabia had reportedly reached an agreement to hammer out a production cut, even if Iran doesn't go along with it. Crude oil was up more than 3% to $41.63 a barrel, crossing above the 200-day moving average.The Nasdaq was up 0.5%, advancing again after its rebound stalled for about an hour. The small-cap Russell 1000 led with a 1% gain.Volume was tracking sharply higher than at the same time Monday. Winners led decliners by 4-to-1 on the NYSE, and by 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq.The Nasdaq was running behind, not just because the energy sector was outperforming in today's stock market, but also because technology shares struggled.The sector's sell-off was sparked by Juniper Networks (JNPR), which preannounced quarterly results that missed estimates and cut its Q1 revenue outlook. Shares of the networking company tumbled 8% in heavy trading, deepening a long price correction.Other major tech stocks moving lower included F5 Networks (FFIV) and Brocade Communications (BRCD), each down 2%.Networking, software and chip industry groups were among the day's weakest. Cybersecurity stocks also lagged, with that industry group down 1.3% at midday.Starbucks (SBUX) gapped down 3%, falling to its converged 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The stock continued to work on saucer-type base. Deutsche Bank downgraded the company to hold from buy and cut its price target to 64 from 70.Analyst Brett Levy said a new Starbucks rewards program, which many customers have criticized, could slow sales traffic.

339,SBUX,"The European Union on Tuesday laid out proposed new rules governing how big companies report corporate taxes as it battles to keep billions in euros within its borders.The EU's European Commission on Tuesday proposed to amend rules governing how large companies report corporate taxes. The Commission, the EU's executive arm, estimated that tax avoidance in Europe costs EU countries 50-70 billion euros ($57 billion-$80 billion) a year in lost tax revenue.The new rules could impact U.S. giants such as McDonald's (MCD), Amazon.com (AMZN), Starbucks (SBUX), Apple (AAPL) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), which have all faced, or currently face, EU scrutiny.The proposal would force companies with annual European revenue topping roughly $855 million to be more transparent and to publish key information ""on where they make their profits and where they pay their tax in the EU on a country-by-country basis."" The proposal was amended to require corporations to reveal taxes paid in so-called tax havens.European Commission member Jonathan Hill said in a written statement that the proposed changes to existing rules aren't a reaction to the Panama papers. Millions of documents were recently leaked from Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca, which specializes in setting up offshore tax havens, mostly for rich individuals.However, Hill added, ""I think that they (the Panama papers) have strengthened our determination to make sure that taxes are paid where profits are generated.""Last October, the EC ruled that tax deals granted to Starbucks in the Netherlands and Fiat in Luxembourg were illegal state subsidies that the companies must repay.The EU was already investigating McDonald's for allegedly exploiting an agreement with Luxembourg to avoid taxes worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The probe is looking into whether the agreement, under EU rules that prevent taxation in both the U.S. and EU, allowed McDonald's to avoid taxes in both regions.McDonald's has said that it paid its fair share of taxes in the EU, amounting to more than $2.1 billion from 2010 to 2014, Bloomberg reported. The EC is also probing an agreement between Amazon and Luxembourg, centering on whether that country agreed to cap taxes that Amazon pays no matter how much profit it makes there.Alphabet in January agreed to pay $260 million to the U.K. to settle back-tax issues. Many criticized the settlement as peanuts.Apple's Irish tax arrangements also are under EU scrutiny, with a European Commission judgment still pending.The EC statement Tuesday said that the next step is submitting the proposed new rules to the European Parliament and the Council of the EU for discussion, a process that could take months or years, analysts said. If adopted, all 28 EU member states would then have to translate the rules into national legislation.McDonald's, which has a strong 90 IBD Composite Rating -- which means that it's outperformed 90% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth recently -- edged higher in late afternoon trading on the stock market today. It's risen steadily since last fall, advancing about 25% from an Oct. 6 low of 101.98.Amazon, which is on the IBD Leaderboard list of top-rated stocks, may be forming a late-stage cup-with-handle base with a 603.34 buy point. Its shares rose 1% to 601.79 Tuesday.Apple was up 1.2% at 110.31. Starbucks, a stock on the IBD 50 list, fell 2.5%. Alphabet climbed 0.8%.

340,SBUX,"The major market indexes rallied Tuesday along with oil prices, which spiked on a report that Russia and Saudi Arabia reached an agreement to freeze production.The S&P 500 led with a 1% gain, while the Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite added 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively. Volume was sharply higher across the board vs. Monday, according to preliminary figures. Winners trumped losers by nearly 4-to-1 on the NYSE and about 2-to-1 on the Nasdaq.In economic news, optimism among small-business owners dipped to a two-year low of 92.6 in March, according to the National Federation of Independent Business. The International Monetary Fund revised downward its world economy growth forecast to 3.2% this year vs. the 3.4% it saw in January, citing continued slow growth.Energy stocks led the upside in the stock market today, as West Texas intermediate oil prices surged 4%. Chevron (CHK) climbed more than 2% and is near its March high.Metal ores miners and travel bookers also outperformed.Among the latter, Priceline (PCLN) reversed higher and rose 3% after finding support at its 200-day moving average. The stock is working on a handle to a cup base with a 1,361.73 buy point. Analysts expect the online travel site to post 19% EPS growth on a 15% revenue increase when Priceline reports quarterly results May 4 before the open. In other news, Cowen said in a research report that house rental service Airbnb may not be as big a threat to online travel agents as some think.Expedia (EXPE) and Ctrip.com (CTRP) also advanced nearly 3% each.On the IBD 50, INC Research (INCR) gained 4% in heavy volume to finish as the top performer. Shares of the clinical research provider are nearing a 50.50 buy point of a cup base.New Oriental Education (EDU), down 5% in above-average turnover, was the biggest laggard. The stock fell back into buy range from a 33.01 cup-with-handle buy point, after rising as much as 11% after a recent breakout.Starbucks (SBUX) pared its loss to 2% after falling as much as 4% intraday. Volume was about twice its average. The stock found support at its 50-day and 200-day lines as it continues working on a shallow base. Deutsche Bank lowered its rating on the coffeehouse chain to hold from buy and cut the price target to 64 from 70.Economic data due Wednesday include retail sales and the producer price index for March, business inventories for February and weekly mortgage applications.
"
341,SBUX,"After financial tremors in China sent global stock markets cascading lower in August and again in January, a period of calm has returned, and risk-aversion has receded.Triggered by yuan devaluation fears, the Shanghai composite tumbled more than 25% from the end of 2015 to its Jan. 27 low, hitting its worst level since the tail end of 2014. The Nasdaq fell 16% to start 2016, bottoming on Feb. 11.Yet the risk of even more major shocks coming out of China, rather than going away, has continued to grow. The reckoning has only been postponed by Chinese government efforts to keep the economy afloat with an unsustainable rise in debt.China's $1 trillion first-quarter credit surge, equal to an annualized 46.5% of GDP, was ""one of the highest ratios ever,"" wrote Societe Generale economists Wei Yao and Claire Huang.Unlike China's debt binge at the end of 2008 that helped lift the global economy out of recession, this latest surge of government-funded infrastructure spending and an easy-credit-fueled spike in property values didn't buy much growth. China's GDP expanded just 6.7% in the first quarter, the slowest pace in seven years.Slowing growth amid rapidly escalating debt has troublesome implications. Much of the credit is going to unproductive uses and propping up bad debts. The longer that continues, the bigger the eventual debt implosion may be.A China debt crisis would ripple through the global economy. Commodity producers that rely on China demand would buckle. Global financial markets would see a stampede away from emerging markets and risk generally, exacerbating the direct effects of a China hard landing. U.S. Treasuries, gold and other traditional safe havens may fare well, but not much else.The Shanghai composite rose 0.5% Friday, capping its first up week in seven weeks. The Nasdaq fell 0.6% Friday while the S&P 500 slipped 0.3%.China's official data suggest no great cause for alarm. They put problem loans to the corporate and household sectors at a moderate 5.5% of the total, equal to $641 billion or 6% of GDP. Yet few analysts are willing to depend on China's government data. The International Monetary Fund took a deeper dive into corporate balance sheets and concluded that up to 15.5% of commercial bank loans to the corporate sector, equal to $1.3 trillion, were potentially at risk.A broader look from Hong Kong-based brokerage CLSA included banks' off-balance-sheet lending. It concluded that 15% to 19% of outstanding loans are nonperforming, with the potential to rise as high as 25% as the economy deteriorates. CLSA sees potential losses of $1.5 trillion -- nearly 15% of GDP -- or more. That's about twice the amount at risk seen by the IMF, assuming the banks will recover some assets even on bad loans.Now, with Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's in March putting China on notice of possible credit downgrades to come, adding to warnings from the IMF and others, China's leaders are talking up a new era of moderation and reform: ""A tree cannot grow up to the sky -- high leverage will definitely lead to high risks,"" declared an unnamed ""authoritative person"" (speculated to be President Xi Jinping) in a page-one interview published by the People's Daily. ""Any mishandling will lead to systemic financial risks, negative economic growth, or even have households' savings evaporate. That’s deadly.""Here's the problem: China has given up trying to rev up the pace of growth. But it's still trying to maintain 6.5% to 7% GDP gains for fear that a bigger slowdown will be too painful and destabilizing. Even that target is likely to be unobtainable, Goldman Sachs predicted earlier this year in a report advising investors to further reduce emerging market exposure.China is ""walled in"" between two likely fates, Goldman Sachs said. It could try to keep the economy from slowing further, letting bad debts fester and swell, ultimately triggering a financial crisis. Or China heads off a debt meltdown with reforms that aren't aggressive enough to prevent ""a prolonged period of slow growth and possibly deflation,"" similar to Japan.""Every major country with a rapid increase in debt has experienced either a financial crisis or a prolonged slowdown in GDP growth. History suggests that China will face the same fate,"" Goldman wrote.From the end of 2007 through mid-2014, China's government, corporate and household debt surged from 158% of GDP to 282%, McKinsey noted in a 2015 analysis. Nominal debt levels quadrupled from $7 trillion to $28 trillion. A more up-to-date analysis from the Institute of International Finance finds debt-to-GDP rising to 295%.Whichever path it takes, most analysts think China has ample resources to stave off a crisis for a year or two, thanks to a high level of domestic savings and prospects for government stimulus and financial bailouts.George Soros, who made $1 billion betting against the British pound in 1992, has said China's credit growth looks reminiscent of the period before the U.S. financial crisis. ""Most of the money that banks are supplying is needed to keep bad debts and loss-making enterprises alive,"" Soros told a crowd at the Asia Society in New York in April. But he noted that the country may be able to keep feeding its bubble for somewhat longer.The comparison with the U.S. subprime real-estate bubble seems apt because it was only when lower-credit-quality mortgage securities lost their AAA credit ratings that liquidity dried up and the financial house of cards started tumbling. China's credit bubble is likewise built on a belief that high-risk investments there are essentially risk-free, writes Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance professor, Ning Zhu, in ""China's Guaranteed Bubble.""Unlike in the West, many ""bond-like"" products in China ""carry implicit guarantees from their underwriters, regulators and, in the end, the Chinese government,"" Zhu writes. ""Many investors believe that, as long as financial institutions are concerned with their reputations, as long as the regulators are concerned with career advancement, and as long as the Chinese government is concerned with social stability, they will take care of the risks that investors themselves should bear when investing in such products.""Zhu cites $500 million in financing provided to the Shanxi Zhenfu Energy Group via the trust product China Credit Equals Gold #1 with a promised annual return of 9.5% to 11.5%. Financing was arranged via state-owned giant Industrial & Commercial Bank of China. After coal prices plunged, the mining company appeared set to default in January 2014, with ICBC denying any responsibility for repaying investors.Nevertheless, investors and lawyers remained calm, Zhu writes, which ""cannot be attributed to Chinese Taoism or Confucianism,"" but only to the expectation of an eventual bailout.As The Economist wrote in 2014, ""Days before the threatened default, a mystery buyer suddenly appeared and acquired some of Zhenfu Energy’s assets. That allowed all the principal to be repaid; in the end, investors lost only a portion of their last interest payment.""In other words, the Chinese government was unwilling to risk the fallout from the removal of its implicit guarantee, which would cast ""dark clouds over China's economic growth and its economic growth model transition,"" Zhu wrote.But this moral hazard only encourages investors and banks to take more and more excessive risks.Chinese authorities' failure to prevent the stock market rout over the past year following a massive run-up has set off a flight to safety for investors. But in China that means a rush into areas of the economy and financing vehicles more assured of government support. Real estate has been the prime benefactor, with home prices rising 12.4% in May from a year earlier, including a 28.3% surge in tier-one cities.Property might seem like an odd choice for a safe haven. China has a glut of unsold apartments -- 13 million, mainly in mid-sized and inland cities, according to Reuters. But local governments, which went on a borrowing binge in recent years to fund infrastructure, rely on property sales for about one-third of revenue and can't afford a prolonged real estate slump. And regulators, trying to revive soft demand, cut down-payment requirements for first-time buyers to a record-low 20%.Demand for new apartment construction, along with stimulus-fueled infrastructure spending, helps keep orders for commodities such as steel afloat and keeps a lid on bad industrial-sector debt. But that props up inefficient industrial state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and delays a transition to a consumer- and services-based economy.Despite becoming an increasingly important market for the likes of Apple (AAPL), Nike (NKE), Starbucks (SBUX) and Under Armour (UA), China has mostly moved in the wrong direction from its goal of rebalancing the economy, notes Goldman Sachs. Since 2007, when then-Premier Wen Jiabao set the goal of moving away from an export- and investment-driven economy, investment has climbed from 40% of GDP to 45.3%.Goldman says China desperately needs productivity-enhancing reforms that would help revive economic growth without the fuel of rising debt. The largest industrial SOEs generated $1.8 trillion in profits from 2001 through 2013, with a deteriorating performance since 2010. But even that was only thanks to $2 trillion in subsidies, implying a net loss. The investment bank sees dim prospects for much of a lift from reforming SOEs, noting the inherent conflict between economic efficiency and protecting the position of the ruling Communist Party.Productivity growth is so important to China's future in part of because of its demographics, which resemble Japan's shrinking workforce since 1990. China's working-age population is set to decline by 0.5% a year over the next 25 years, a legacy of its one-child policy replaced last October.""Will China grow old before it grows rich? That was an oft-asked question over the past couple of decades. The probable answer, which seems more apparent every day, is: 'Yes,' "" wrote investment strategist Ed Yardeni.One move by China to begin addressing high corporate debt levels would have banks swap nonperforming loans for equity stakes in the borrowing companies. But such efforts ""could actually worsen the problem, for example, by allowing 'zombie' firms (nonviable firms that are still operating) to keep going,"" the IMF said in a blog post.No matter how hard China tries to keep growth going, the days of it rescuing the global economy appear to be over. Data from April suggest that the government began tapping the brakes on the rise of debt in the second quarter, with areas outside of real estate showing further slowing.""Industrial output and investment surges in March led many in China to expect, or unrealistically wish for, a sustained rebound in the economy. In our view this is almost impossible,"" wrote IHS Global Insight economist Brian Jackson.Moody's sees growth slowing from 6.9% in 2015 to 6.3% this year. ""Near-term downside risks to China’s growth have receded for now, due to the ample support provided by the government. However, the sheer scale of leverage ... exposes the economy to the risk of a rapid deterioration in the event of a negative shock.""If and when a China debt crisis erupts, U.S. investors will find few stock winners. Utilities and other defensive stocks outperformed early this year amid China fears, but in a true crunch such stocks may only fall less. U.S. Treasuries, gold -- and moving to cash -- would once again likely be the safe harbors.

347,SBUX,"Whereas many U.S. companies have yet to crack the code in China, it’s Starbucks’ (SBUX) largest international market. And the coffee giant is betting on further growth there.Starbucks announced Thursday its first international Reserve Roastery & Tasting Room, which will open in Shanghai in 2017.CEO Howard Schultz told CNBC that he wouldn’t be surprised if one day Starbucks had more stores in China than it does in the U.S.Despite the bullish outlook, Starbucks shares are in need of a caffeine boost. The stock has been trending lower since gapping below its 50-day and 200-day lines after earnings in April. Shares ended trading 0.3% higher in slightly above-average volume on Thursday. Starbucks is now about 13% below its all-time high reached last October.Other notable companies are trying to tap into the China market. McDonald’s (MCD) announced in March that it plans to open 1,500 new restaurants in China, Hong Kong and South Korea within the next five years. McDonald's edged higher in the stock market today.But for some, the market has proved to be very tricky, with government censorship rules making it seemingly impossible for Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google and Netflix (NFLX) to do business there, at least for now.Facebook rose 1.3% while Alphabet dipped 0.2% and Netflix jumped 2.6%.And though Apple (AAPL) relies heavily on China for the production of the iPhone, its sales in the Greater China region plunged 26% in the fiscal second quarter, as local competitors are on the rise.Apple was up 0.8% at the close.As for Starbucks and its success in China, Schultz said that while the Chinese economy may see “cyclical changes,” the company early on had established “a great enduring relationship with the local customer.”
"
348,SBUX,"McDonald's (MCD) CEO Steve Easterbrook said Thursday that self-ordering kiosks and other technology were unlikely to result in job cuts and were not ""meant as a labor replacement,"" even as higher wages prompt fast-food rival Wendy's (WEN) to aggressively seek labor-saving technology.Easterbrook's response came at an occasionally tense company shareholder meeting, before which protesters staged demonstrations and demanded McDonald's pay its employees more. He was addressing an attendee who asked the following question:“With all the talk and all the protesters and the $15-an-hour wage, if that is mandated, if the government does raise the minimum wage, do you see McDonald’s substituting capital -- having kiosks where people order, automatic pancake machines and things like that taking the place of workers where people will end up losing jobs because of the higher wages?”Easterbrook said that he saw that technology complementing labor more than replacing it.""If we were able to alternate certain non-value-added processes in the restaurant we’ll do that because it’s a smart thing to do,"" he said. ""But then that gives us more opportunity to bring that manpower front-of-house -- we can offer better dining area experience and service experience. So I don’t see it being a risk to job elimination.""Still, he said, the jobs themselves could be different.""It may change the nature of the jobs in the restaurant, because frankly technology is something that our customers are embracing, whether it’s through their phone or whether through self-order kiosks -- that is a societal trend,"" he said. ""We want to adapt to that, but it’s not actually meant as a labor replacement. We can just re-apportion that labor into more service-orientated roles.""Easterbrook's announcement follows Wendy's plans to make kiosks available across its restaurants in the second half of this year, although franchisees don't have to use them. Minimum wage hikes in some areas as well as efforts to attract stronger talent have pushed up Wendy's labor costs, the company said this month on its first-quarter earnings call.President Todd Penegor said then that ""we'll continue to invest in technology with things in the front of the house and consumer facing, like customer self-order kiosk, mobile order, mobile pay.""McDonald's is testing mobile ordering apps, something that Yum Brands' (YUM) Taco Bell, Starbucks (SBUX), Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and others and others already are doing. New mobile payment services such as Apple (AAPL) Pay, Samsung Pay also are fueling the shift. Such mobile services also substitute for labor, though workers could be shifted elsewhere.Along with higher wages, fast-food restaurants have been squeezed by competition both on value offerings and chains advertising better ingredients. April was a slow month for the restaurant business, possibly due to bad weather in some areas, the discounting and more tepid consumer sentiment, analysts suggest.""In addition, we wonder if declining food at home prices have begun to weigh on restaurant demand,"" RBC analyst David Palmer wrote in a research note last week. ""For fast food, we believe recent weakness is increasing resolve to deploy value marketing this summer, which may increase risk of market share losses by those chains with limited marketing scale.""McDonald's shares closed up 0.4% on the stock market today. Starbucks edged up 0.25%, Domino's added 1.4% and Apple added 0.8%. Wendy's dipped 0.6% and Yum Brands fell 0.2%.

350,SBUX,"Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Starbucks (SBUX) were all near buy points ahead of their most recent quarterly reports, but have since dropped from those levels after issuing weak results. On the other hand, Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN) had formed bases and were propelled higher by their strong earnings.Here's a look at four stocks that are trading near or in buy range ahead of their quarterly reports later this week: Applied Materials (AMAT), Autodesk (ADSK), Eight By Eight (EGHT) and Campbell Soup (CPB).You may not think of Campbell Soup when you think of top stocks, but the maker of packaged food has a high IBD Composite Rating of 92 out of 99. The company is expected to report Friday an earnings increase of 3%, a big slowdown from two quarters in a row of roughly 30% bottom-line growth. Revenue is expected to fall a fraction.Campbell breached support at the 50-day line Wednesday in above-average volume but was able to finish the session just above the line. Shares are now about 5% below their all-time high reached as the stock cleared a flat base buy point of 65.58. The stock is trading 3% below that pivot.Eight By Eight is a telecom services firm with an 85 Composite Rating. Earnings are expected to drop 60% while revenue climbs 25% when it reports Thursday.Shares tried to break out of a cup-with-handle base with a 12.05 buy point Wednesday, but closed the session below that level. The stock is 13% below its January peak.Applied Materials is expected to see earnings grow 10% on a fractional sales decline. The chip equipment maker, which reports Thursday, has a Composite Rating of 66.Shares are trading in buy range from a cup base the stock initially cleared in March. The stock ran up as much as 11% in the following weeks, but has since pulled back about 8% from its high reached one month ago.And computer software firm Autodesk is expected to swing to a loss of 14 cents a share on a 21% decline in revenue when it reports Thursday. The company has a 49 Composite Rating.Shares recently breached support at the 50-day line and are dipping back below buy range from a cup-with-handle base. The stock is now about 12% below its December peak.

351,SBUX,"Shares of mobile-payments firm Square (SQ) were tumbling early Friday as the company was downgraded following a mixed Q1 earnings report issued late the previous day.Square lost 29 cents a share in the quarter, or 14 cents excluding a one-time legal cost. Either way, it was worse than the 9-cent loss analysts had expected, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue beat expectations, though, rising 51% to $379 million.Square lifted its adjusted-revenue guidance for the year (which excludes the soon-to-be-defunct partnership with Starbucks (SBUX)) by $15 million, now $615 million to $635 million. It also raised its EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) guidance by $2 million, now $8 million to $14 million.However, the May 16 expiration of Square's post-IPO lockup period was looming on analysts' minds. Wedbush's Gil Luria downgraded the stock to underperform from neutral, with a 9 price target, predicting that insider shareholders will use this opening as a chance to get out.""We believe that Square is rapidly growing a business that may never reach peer (or guided) profitability, which will become apparent as growth slows over the next couple of years on competition and saturation,"" Luria wrote.Square stock was down more than 17% in early trading on the stock market today, below 11 and sitting at a two-month low. The stock went public at 9 last November and peaked at 15.91 on March 31.BTIG analyst Mark Palmer was more confident about Square's future but was still concerned about the lockup expiration.""Square arguably needed to post a strong Q1 2016 report to convince the soon-to-be unlocked investors to hold on to their shares,"" Palmer wrote in a research note affirming his neutral rating. ""While the company posted a headline earnings miss, much more important at this stage in its life cycle was a better-than-expected revenue print and increased fiscal 2016 guidance for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA.""

Same-store sales rose 7% in the Americas, which for Starbucks is comprised mostly of U.S. sales.In Q3, the company sees 48-49 cents a share in profit, on the light side of views for 49 cents a share.For the year, Starbucks bumped up EPS guidance to $1.88-$1.89 from a prior outlook for $1.87-$1.89. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect $1.89 a share.Starbucks’ rewards program now boasts 12 million members, up from 11.1 million in the previous quarter.The company also OK’d an additional 100 million share buyback authorization as part of its ongoing program.Shares closed the regular session down 0.4%.

The oil and natural gas producer spiked 20% in heavy trade Monday after affirming its $4 billion revolving credit facility, a surprise acknowledgment of stability from banks at a time when lenders are increasingly guarded vs. oil and natural gas companies. Chesapeake remains deep in a 20-month correction.Glass maker Corning (GLW) polished a 3% gain, after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to buy from neutral and boosted its price target to 26 from 19. The gain put shares 30% above a late January low, as they climb the right side of a 14-month consolidation.Starbucks (SBUX) stumbled 4% lower.

"
354,SBUX,"It’s hard for many coffee lovers these days to imagine the world before Starbucks (SBUX). It’s a bit less difficult to recall life before Perfumania (PERF).The two companies went public six months apart in 1991-92. Both had hot starts on the market. Yet today, Starbucks trades at what feels like a skillion times its June 29, 1992, IPO price and has underwritten many a happy retirement.Today, Perfumania trades at a fraction of its Dec. 20, 1991, launch price. The stock has risen briefly above its starting level only three times in the past 25 years.Were those fortunes apparent in the stories of the two stocks at their christenings? The answer is ""somewhat yes"" and highlights the importance of understanding the story of an IPO -- in order to judge the degree of risk you are taking on before you jump into early-stage, unproven stocks.The period of 1991-92 was busy for IPOs. Snapple (now Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS)) went public at 20 on Dec. 15, 1992. It ran up 100% in eight days, slumped into a five-month IPO, then broke out to spike another 200% in four months. Bed, Bath & Beyond (BBBY) went public on June 5, 1992. It formed a tight seven-week cup base, broke out and scorched out a 272% rally in 15 months.Starbucks may have been a hard sell for a lot of folks. Founded in 1971, it ended 1987 with 11 stores. Over the next three years, it grew to more than 125. It spread from Seattle north to Vancouver, B.C., south to Los Angeles and east to Chicago. The growth was impressive, but for some consumers, the idea of standing in line for a $3 cup of coffee was tough to imagine.Additional uncertainty came from existing brands, such as Folgers and Maxwell House, which were reportedly working on premium brands at the time.Perfumania, on the other hand, was perhaps an easy-to-digest concept: discount perfume sold at specialty stores, aimed at stealing market share from the pricey department store market. Like Starbucks, it expanded quickly: from three stores to 70 stores in the three years up through 1989. As a result, it carried a heavy debt burden that forced maneuvers such as paying 24% interest to a Japanese financier in order to purchase inventory.Perfumania lost money in 1989 and 1990. Its two quick public offerings in 1991 and 1992 brought in $42 million and solved the debt problem. But the company remained vulnerable due to buying its product on an international “gray market” -- distribution channels that, while technically legal, are not authorized by brand manufacturers. They are the same channels that Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) use. But the risk was higher for a monorail retailer like Perfumania.Perfumania was trading 153% above its IPO price in June 1992, when allegations of selling fake name-brand perfume hit shares hard. The stock lost 67% of its value in four weeks and never fully recovered. Starbucks, meanwhile, had climbed 118% by the end of 1992. The stock ended that year with an 84 EPS Rating, an 88 RS. Very respectable. Today, an investors who had placed $10,000 on Starbucks' IPO would have nearly $1.7 million plus dividends to show for it.

Sales rose 11% excluding currency swings.Herbalife also said that talks with the FTC over its marketing are at an advanced stage, saying it expects to pay about $200 million in a settlement.Herbalife sees Q2 EPS of $1.10-$1.20 raised its full-year EPS target to $4.40-$4.75 from $4.05-4.50. Analysts had expected $1.16 in Q2 and $4.65 for 2016.Herbalife stock shot up 14% in after-hours trading to 66.46 on its strong Q1 results and hopes for an FTC resolution.

Revenue rose 34% to $168 million, short of estimates for $171.8 million.Q2 guidance for a loss of 38-40 cents a share and $178 million-$185 million in revenue is worse than views for a 36-cent per-share loss on $192.8 million in revenue. For the year, it sees a per-share loss of $1.20-$1.27 on $780 million-$810 million in sales vs. views for a $1.25 per-share loss and $828.6 million in revenue.Shares sank nearly 7% after hours.

Stocks poised to move higher often have a high Comp Rating.In addition, holdings include Adobe Systems (ADBE), which sports a 92 Comp Rating.Trading around 95, Adobe is working on a cup-with-handle base with a 98.10 buy point. Volume has dried up as the handle forms, which is positive. But as IBD's Leaderboard analysis of the stock points out, Adobe's earlier breakout past an 88.65 handle entry within the base was successful, and from that point of view the stock is extended. Still, you could make a case that the right side of the base needed more work.Adobe has succeeded in morphing into a company that lets customers receive products through the cloud and pay a subscription fee.Is Adobe a buy or a sell? Take a free trial of IBD Leaderboard today to find outRevenue growth has sped over the past three quarters, from 9% to 21%, 22% and 25%. The fiscal second quarter ends this month. Wall Street currently expects earnings to rise 42% to 68 cents a share. That would extend the slowdown in EPS gains of 30%, 93%, 59% and 50% in the prior four quarters. It's still vigorous profit growth.Facebook (FB), another Leaderboard stock, is one of those top holdings. It has a 99 Composite Rating.EPS gains are accelerating, rising 16%, 33% 46% and 83% the past four quarters. The 83% earnings jump to 77 cents a share easily beat Wall Street estimates as did the 52% jump in revenue to $5.4 billion. The stock responded to the upbeat results by gapping up 7% April 28 and clearing a 117.09 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. It got as high as 121 before easing to just below the buy point.Facebook has gifted investors with a big 300%-plus return since it broke out past a 29.17 buy point of a double-bottom base in the week ended July 26, 2013, as IBD pointed out recently.Electronic Arts (EA) is a top new buy, which has a 95 Comp Rating.The video game publisher delivered better-than-expected earnings and sales growth last week.Q4 EPS rose 28%. That profit got a boost from EA's growing digital sales, which made up over 70% of all fourth-quarter revenue, as IBD reported on Tuesday.Also, EA had no debt last year and a solid 32% return on equity. That, plus a 46% average annual EPS growth rate over the past five years, has attracted a rising number of funds as investors. Two typically better-performing funds own shares in Electronic Arts: $12 billion Fidelity OTC (FOCPX) and $12 billion MFS Growth (MFEGX).Among other holdings, Zimmer Biomet Holdings (ZBH) has a 99 Comp Rating and is up 16% so far this year.The maker of orthopedic and dental reconstruction implants, trauma products and related surgical products has seen EPS rise in each of the past four quarters, climbing from -2% to 30% in that span. Revenue grew 59%, 58% and 68% in the past three stanzas. The company beat consensus estimates for both EPS and revenue in Q1.The company was born from last year's $14 billion merger of Zimmer Holdings and Biomet. That created a global leader in musculoskeletal health care, which does business in more than 100 countries, IBD recently reported.Last month, Zimmer said it would take over Cayenne Medical to strengthen its sports medicine offerings.Trading near 117, the stock is within 1% of the 117.87 buy point of a long cup-with-handle base.The portfolio is run by two separate subadvisors. Winslow Capital and Wellington Management each manage about 50% of the fund. When one side's outperformance skews the split by too much, USAA rebalances by funneling inflow into the lagging portion. It also takes any shareholder redemptions from the larger portion.Winslow's Clark Winslow, Patrick Burton and Justin Kelly are somewhat more aggressive in their style, says USAA's Wasif Latif, who oversees the subadvisors. Wellington's manager is Paul Marrkand. ""Wellington is more conscious of valuation,"" Latif said.The subadvisors' sleeves share many names. ""But Winslow has more FANG stocks,"" said USAA analyst Julius Barnes, referring to 2015 high-flyers Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google, now Alphabet (GOOGL).As of Jan. 31, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Starbucks (SBUX) were in the Winslow sleeve only.Going into Thursday, UnitedHealth was up about 11% for the year. It had an 86 Comp Rating but a weak D+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which is a sign of more recent selling than buying by mutual funds over the past 13 weeks. Starbucks was down about 9% for the year. It has a so-so 70 Comp Rating and worst-possible E Accumulation/Distribution Rating.Oracle (ORCL) and PepsiCo (PEP) were two names in Wellington's sleeve only.Oracle was up 8%, but has a weak 55 Composite Rating and a D Accumulation/Distribution Rating. EPS fell the past four quarters and were flat in the two frames before that.Pepsi was up less than 1%, with a 59 Composite Rating and E Accumulation/Distribution Rating.""When we have a high-growth, bullish market, Winslow does better,"" Latif said. ""The opposite happens when the market is not led by growth and is challenged."" Wellington's sleeve has outperformed Winslow's so far this year, Latif says.

359,SBUX,"Before other states jump on the $15 minimum-wage bandwagon, they might want to look at what's happening in Massachusetts — one of two states with a statewide $10-an-hour minimum.The Bay State, which hiked its minimum wage from $8 to $9 at the start of 2015 and to $10 on the first day of 2016, is now mired in its longest stretch of net job losses since the recession in both the retail and the leisure and hospitality sectors, Labor Department data show.Retail sector employment in February was down 2,200 from its post-recession peak of 354,100 in July, seasonally adjusted data show. In fact, retail employment is below its level in November 2014, before the first step of the state's wage hike went into effect.While the retail sector has no shortage of challenges, especially competition from Amazon (AMZN) and other online rivals, retail employment has been on the rise nationally, growing by 416,000 between November 2014 and February 2016.Meanwhile, employment at restaurants, hotels and other leisure and hospitality venues in Massachusetts, has fallen by 1,300 since hitting an all-time peak of 350,600 last May.The state lost 57 jobs when the Price Chopper grocery store in North Adams closed down amid doubts about its ""future viability."" The chairman of the 135-store chain in six states has warned that minimum-wage hikes would be difficult to bear.In January, two of the four Sam's Clubs slated for closure by Wal-Mart (WMT) were in Massachusetts. While the company didn't specifically blame the state's rising minimum wage, closures of other Wal-Mart discount centers or Neighborhood Markets came in high-minimum-wage havens including Oakland, the city of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart scrapped plans for two stores in D.C., where the $10.50 minimum wage will rise by $1 this July.Massachusetts was also home to two of the 40 department stores targeted for closure by Macy's (M) in January after a weak holiday season.Other modest-wage employers have tried to adjust to the $10 minimum wage in other ways. In a February earnings call held by Dunkin' Brands (DNKN), one analysts noted that a Boston franchise of Dunkin' Donuts was charging more for a regular coffee than Starbucks (SBUX).While California also has a $10 minimum wage, a further hike to $11 an hour at the start of 2017 has long been anticipated by Massachusetts employers. By contrast, California quite suddenly and abruptly just voted to keep lifting its base wage, to $11 by 2018 and eventually to $15.That means Massachusetts employers have had a longer time to weigh the consequences of a higher minimum wage and to begin adapting. Because of its early-mover status and its diverse economy and geography, Massachusetts may offer the best early evidence for assessing the experiment with high minimum wages.In contrast to the experience in Massachusetts, the higher D.C. minimum wage hasn't stopped job growth in the retail or leisure and hospitality sectors, Labor Department data show.While earlier figures had pointed to job losses, revisions to the data wiped those losses away. Yet a closer look reveals that the impact of the wage hikes may not be entirely benign after all. In the leisure and hospitality sector, the average workweek over the past year was 1.5 hours shorter than it was in 2013, a drop of 5%.Here's an even bigger shock: In this modest pay sector dominated by restaurants and hotels, the average weekly wage of $477.86 in February was actually down 8.3% from $521.29 in June 2014 — before the wage hikes began.Though some of the data is subject to revision, it seems that the help of higher wages is being offset to a great extent by fewer hours of work and perhaps a leveling of pay scales, as jobs that used to pay far more than the minimum may no longer do so.Image provided by Shutterstock.

360,SBUX,"San Francisco might manage a $15 minimum wage without much of a dampening effect on employment, but what about a $36-an-hour minimum?That's roughly the equivalent of the challenge now facing El Centro in California's Imperial County, where the $15 minimum wage will equal 95% of the average wage in 2015.It's only logical to expect that El Centro, whose nearly 19% jobless rate in February was the highest of any metropolitan area in the U.S, will have an enormously more difficult time adapting to a $15 wage than San Francisco and San Jose, where average wages are close to $40 and joblessness is just 3% to 4%.Yet California, almost unbelievably, has ignored the dramatic economic disparities from the Bay Area to the Central Valley to the communities near the Mexico border and has embraced a one-size-fits-all $15 wage, phased in by 2022. It puts the Golden State out a limb where neither New York nor Oregon dared to go as those liberal states pushed their minimum wages into uncharted territory.Oregon took a three-tiered approach, putting its minimum wage on a path to $14.75 in the Portland metropolitan area by 2022, while the wage will top out at $13.50 in midsize counties and $12.50 in so-called ""frontier"" areas.New York City will get a $15 minimum wage by 2018, with the surrounding counties getting there by 2022. But the minimum wage for the rest of the state is on course to get to $12.50 an hour by 2021 — with one exception. Quick-service chain restaurants throughout New York will be on the hook for a $15 wage, including small businesses operating a single franchised location. New York's fast-food wage applies to a broad range of limited-service or takeout places, including Subway, Starbucks (SBUX), Wendy’s (WEN), Shake Shack (SHAK), Yum Brands’ (YUM) Taco Bell, Dunkin’ Brands’ (DNKN) Dunkin' Donuts and Jamba’s (JMBA) Jamba Juice.On the same day that Gov. Jerry Brown signed the minimum wage law, Dunkin’ announced plans to open 29 franchised stores in the next few years. Such deals don’t come together overnight, and the adoption of a $15 statewide minimum was seemingly sudden and abrupt. Still, the possibility of a $15 wage initiative on the fall ballot has been in the news, so some businesses still see opportunity amid much higher wages.Yet the biggest batch of new Dunkin’ Donuts is slated for Contra Costa County, a suburban county in the East Bay area of the broad San Francisco metropolitan statistical area. With above-average wages and a 4.5% jobless rate, the economy of Contra Costa County will have a far better chance to sustain a $15 minimum wage than Imperial County, an agricultural area bordering Arizona and Mexico.Rather than a great leveler, a $15 minimum wage may end up widening geographical disparities as the high wage scares employers from adding jobs in economically depressed areas.Dunkin’ Brands CEO Nigel Travis told CNN last year that New York's $15 fast-food wage would mean ""probably less hiring, probably less growth.""In its third-quarter conference call, the company told analysts that one franchise that raised prices in response to a minimum-wage hike lost sales, so it’s advising that the best approach is to focus on increasing sales, not prices.An early warning of the potential downside of adopting a much higher minimum wage came from Wal-Mart (WMT), which earlier this year announced store closures in Los Angeles County and the city of Oakland while scrapping plans for two stores in a low-income part of D.C.The New York Farm Bureau warned that a statewide $15 minimum wage would threaten the financial viability of close to 20% of farms. Particularly if farmers in neighboring states didn’t face a similar hike, the high wage would shrink the size of the state’s agricultural industry and cause farming operations to shift to less labor-intensive crops.Now California has gone where New York feared to go -- at least in most of the state -- and the agriculture industry is bracing for the fallout. One supplier of farm labor predicts a 10% drop in agricultural hiring.The consequences of a $15 wage also may be understated for another reason: When you add up all the nonwage costs -- paid sick leave, extra payroll taxes and the ObamaCare employer mandate to offer health insurance -- California's statewide $15 minimum will really amount to $18.52 for full-time workers.

361,SBUX,"Afraid you'll run out of money in retirement? Worried that money woes will force you to drastically cut back on your retirement lifestyle?To avoid those perils, pundits advise that you kick in more money to your retirement nest egg. And 75% of retirees wish they had done exactly that -- save more for retirement -- according to a new survey by BMO Harris Financial Advisors. But where's that extra cash supposed to come from?Advisors suggest cutting your spending. But many advisors only offer  nickel-and-dime steps, like downsizing the coffee you order from Starbucks (SBUX). That won't provide nearly enough money quickly enough.IBD has a better idea. In a recent report, we offered practical, real-world steps you can take, each of which could cut your yearly spending by $10,000 or more -- without forcing you to live in a puptent, trade in your car for a bicycle, or live on bologna sandwiches three times a day.As a follow-up, we're offering ideas from financial advisors about steps that can save you $500 or more for each expenditure, usually yearly. You can plow some or all of the savings into your retirement accounts.Cut back on dining out. ""Dinner for two at many decent, non-fast-food restaurants will cost about $100 these days,"" said Jared Snider, senior wealth advisor at Exencial Wealth Advisors in Oklahoma City. ""If a working couple eliminates one dinner out a week, that's a savings of $5,200 a year.""Buy your next car through a warehouse club. John Gajkowski, co-founder and vice president of Money Managers Advisory, in Oak Brook, Ill., bought a Ford Edge through Costco, a members-only warehouse club, where retail goods are sold at a discount. Members must pay an annual fee of $55 or more with certain additional perks. ""I paid $37,250 for the car, which is $1,390 off the factory invoice price of $38,640 and below the local list price of $40,440,"" Gajkowski said. ""It's also $640 less than the average price of $37,890 for that car, shown on Truecar.com. I did my homework in advance. I knew what I wanted, I knew the average price. There was no haggling. They even went 200 miles away to find the make and model and color that I wanted.""Wean your adult children off your cellphone plan. Gajkowski's three adult children have jobs, thank you very much, and are ages 26 to 29. He decided to give them a choice of either getting their own cellphone contracts or paying to remain part of his. Each kid's share of his monthly bill would be $65.20. All three decided to chip in to their old man's plan, saving dad $2,347 a year. ""I throw that into a Roth IRA,"" he said.Insurance. You probably already know that you can save money by having the same insurer cover both your car and your home. You can likely save more by shopping your business around. ""My brother-in-law was with Allstate Insurance (ALL). You know how your premiums get jacked up a little each year? Well, when his policies were coming up for renewal, he shopped them around and saved $2,500 a year. Now I advise clients to shop their insurance around every two or three years.""Debt reduction. Clients of Joe O'Boyle, principal of O'Boyle Wealth Management, in Beverly Hills, Calif., came to him for help when they decided they had begun to drown in debt. They had in fact racked up $70,000 in debt. Of the total, $30,000 was on credit cards, $15,000 was in loans from a 401(k) account and $25,000 was from student loans.The Southern California couple -- he is an attorney, she is a teacher -- have about $10,000 a month in net take-home pay. But they were spending $12,000 a month.""We took a hard look at problem areas,"" said O'Boyle, who is affiliated with Voya Financial Advisors. ""The biggest was $3,500 a month for entertainment, restaurants and concerts. The next was $1,000 a month for travel. The third was $500 a month by the wife for shoes.""One key to slashing their spending was to use a Voya online budgeting tool. The couple posted all of their expenditures. That kept them accountable to each other and to O'Boyle. All three could see the couple's progress in whittling down the mound of debt. ""I think that tool was the secret sauce that helped them achieve their goal -- getting rid of their debt,"" O'Boyle said.They succeeded in cutting monthly spending to $7,000. The couple devoted the $3,000 reduction to paying off their debt. The couple's goal was to eliminate the debt by the husband's upcoming 40th birthday. In the time they had, they could pay off $54,000 of their $70,000 debt. ""So they needed additional ways to reach their goal,"" O'Boyle said.The husband had paid about $60,000 for his sports car. He still owed $12,000 on a loan. He sold the car for $26,000, netting $14,000.Still short, the couple scoured their home, selecting furniture, video games and clothes they could sacrifice. They sold the items online, raising the $2,000 they needed.

Industrial production has also been weak, and the strong dollar has hit exporters.David Kostin, Goldman Sachs' chief U.S. equity analyst, came up with the recommendations for recession stocks on the assumption that strong balance sheets and high domestics sales should outperform in a downturn, according to Bloomberg.In addition to Facebook, Starbucks and Visa, Goldman also named Alphabet (GOOGL,), Whole Foods Market (WFM), which continues to benefit from the trend in the U.S. toward healthy food, industrial giant 3M (MMM) and Verizon Communications (VZ), the top wireless service provider.Facebook closed up 0.3% on the stock market today. Starbucks rose 1.5%, Visa ticked 0.2% higher, and Alphabet rose less than 0.1%. Whole Foods ended up 0.9%, while 3M surged 5.2% after reporting strong earnings Tuesday.Verizon last Thursday reported that Q4 EPS shot up 25%  to 89 cents on a 3.2% rise in revenue to $34.25 billion, both topping estimates. Shares gained 2.6% Tuesday.Facebook reports Wednesday, and consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is for earnings per share to rise 26% to 68 cents a share on a 40% jump in revenue to $5.37 billion.Visa will report Thursday, and analysts see EPS up 8% to 68 cents on a 7% hike in revenue to $3.62 billion.Chipotle (CMG), Marathon Petroleum (MRO) and Michael Kors (KORS) made it on Goldman's list despite coming under major pressure recently.Chipotle's sales and stock have plunged since an E. coli outbreak at some locations. Marathon has sold off along with the rest of the energy sector as oil prices sank. And Michael Kors has been in an extended slide amid a shift in consumer tastes.On Tuesday, Chipotle shares rose 1.35%, Marathon rallied 3.8%, and Michael Kors rose climbed 2.9%.

382,SBUX,"There's more than meets the eye to California Gov. Jerry Brown's plan to hike the state minimum wage to $15 an hour — about $3.50 more.Including nonwage costs — payroll taxes, paid sick leave and ObamaCare's employer mandate — minimum compensation for a full-time worker could rise as high as $18.52 an hour by 2022, an IBD analysis finds.Social insurance taxes would add $1.15 an hour to the $15 wage. Three days of paid sick leave now on the books in California would add another 19 cents. And the ObamaCare after-tax fine, now $2,160 per uncovered full-time worker and rising each year, will equate to roughly $2.18 an hour in pretax wages. Adding in workers' compensation insurance and unemployment insurance would push the total close to $19 an hour.One big change from a $15 minimum wage has flown below the radar: Many low-wage workers would no longer qualify for Medicaid. For example, a single mom with one child who worked 32 hours per week would earn more than the 138% of poverty cutoff for expanded Medicaid under ObamaCare, though her child would still qualify. A single adult who works just three full days a week also would exceed the income threshold.To no small degree, the $15 minimum-wage movement is asking low-wage employers to lift their workers up closer to the middle class and to provide a full menu of social benefits on top. It looks like a recipe for trouble, and even Brown may be wary about it, insisting that the governor retain authority to delay wage hikes if the state sees a fall in employment or retail sales, or if the state faces a budget deficit. Brown had little room for maneuver because a $15 wage initiative that qualified for the November ballot looked like a sure winner and would have provided no flexibility if the wage hike started backfiring.One early-warning sign for California's wage experiment was Wal-Mart's (WMT) announcement in January that it would shutter stores in Oakland and Los Angeles and cancel two planned stores in Washington D.C., dealing a blow to three cities on the leading edge of the push for a much higher minimum wage.Before Los Angeles put its minimum wage on a path to $15 an hour, the question of how city employers would respond to the simultaneous imposition of a health insurance mandate was simply ignored. An analysis of the wage hike's labor cost impact by the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of California, Berkeley, explicitly excluded health insurance — or a mandate penalty. The authors explained: ""Health benefits are excluded since ... the costs of the benefits will not change if wages are increased."" The Congressional Budget Office came to a different conclusion, finding that the ObamaCare employer mandate would exacerbate the impact of a minimum-wage hike. It estimated that a minimum-wage hike to $10.10 an hour could cost 500,000 jobs.""(The) additional cost on employers for some low-wage workers who do not currently have employment-based health insurance ... further boosts the likelihood that employers' savings from reducing the size of their workforces would exceed their adjustment costs,"" the CBO said.Those adjustment costs might include adding labor-saving technology.Wendy's (WEN) CFO Todd Penegor explained in an August earnings call, ""We continue to look at initiatives and how we work to offset any impacts of future wage inflation through technology initiatives, whether that's customer self-order kiosks (or) whether that's automating more in the back of the house in the restaurant.""Starbucks (SBUX) and Yum Brands’ (YUM) Taco Bell are among the restaurant chains promoting mobile ordering, which reduces the need for cashiers. McDonald's (MCD) is about to start testing mobile apps as well.The truth about the ObamaCare employer mandate is that it hasn't been nearly as much of a burden on businesses as feared, so they haven't had to cut workers' hours below 30 per week in a dramatic way. But the reason is hardly cause for celebration: Employers have figured out how to dodge liability by offering ""affordable"" coverage that costs much more than their modest-wage workers are likely to pay.That's left millions of modest-wage, full-time workers without affordable coverage options. It's possible that California's embrace of a $15 minimum wage will add to their ranks. But the status quo of full-time workers thrown under the bus by ObamaCare may not hold. If the mandate ever becomes something that can't be easily dodged, minimum-wage employers in California will likely cut work hours in a big way, diluting the promise of a living wage.

383,SBUX,"With stocks on track for their worst January since at least 2009, breakouts have been few and far between. But for a stock to break out, it has to form a base first.Here’s a look at five IBD 50 stocks that are building bases: Facebook (FB), Starbucks (SBUX), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Foot Locker (FL) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW).Facebook earns a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. The social networking giant reports quarterly earnings after the close on Wednesday.Shares are trading about 12% below a consolidation buy point of 110.75. Last week, shares were able to find support at the key 200-day line. Facebook rose 0.3% on Tuesday.Starbucks, which has a 96 Composite Rating, also found support at the 200-day line last week. Shares are trading 8% below a 64.10 buy point. Starbucks rose 1.6% Tuesday.Last Thursday, the coffee giant beat quarterly earnings expectations but missed revenue views and issued weak guidance. Still, Starbucks says it’s bullish on its expansion in China.Ulta Beauty reported better-than-expected quarterly results in early December. The beauty products retailer has a 97 Composite Rating.Ulta stock is building a flat base with a 188.58 buy point and is trading 5% below the pivot. Shares are looking to retake the 50-day line in Tuesday’s session. Ulta rose 2%, above its 50-day.Foot Locker is trying to retake its 200-day line, but looks to be hitting resistance there. Shares are trading 14% below a consolidation buy point. They're up 2.6% today.The shoe retailer has a 93 Composite Rating.Edwards Lifesciences has a 94 Composite Rating. When the heart valve maker issues its quarterly results next week, earnings are projected to have risen 17%.Shares were able to retake the 50-day moving average just a few sessions after finding support at the 200-day line. The stock is now just 3% below an 83.53 flat-base buy point. But the stock fell 4 cents to 80.16.O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY), Ross Stores (ROST) and Campbell Soup (CPB) are among other IBD 50 members working on bases.While breakouts provide buying opportunities, the current market environment warrants a cautious outlook.

But in what could be seen as a big letdown for investors, all four issued disappointing results and/or guidance, which has sent the stocks tumbling below key levels.Not only is this notable because of their big names, but also because most of them are highly rated by IBD. Alphabet currently earns an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99, while Visa has a 92, and Starbucks has a 90. Microsoft has a Composite Rating of 73, meaning it outperforms 73% of all stocks based on fundamental and technical factors.IBD's Take: How do Alphabet, Microsoft, Starbucks, Visa measure up?

388,SBUX,"Tech stocks took some hard early hits Friday, but action was much quieter in the S&P 500 and the Dow.The Nasdaq lost 0.7%. The S&P 500 and Dow were mostly unchanged.The stock market today slips into Friday's session with slender gains: the S&P 500 is up 0.5% for the week. The Nasdaq holds less than a 0.2% gain. But nearly two-thirds of the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD advanced for the week through Thursday, with steel makers, ore miners, enterprise software developers and pipeline operators among those posting gains of 5% or more.

Bonds held effectively flat.In stocks, big names were in motion all over the map.Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) shed 7% and 4%, respectively, in early trading.Late Thursday, Microsoft's fiscal Q3 sales and earnings missed consensus expectations, and management's revenue guidance stopped short of analyst estimates. Alphabet earnings and sales also missed targets in its Q1 report. Analyst chatter was active in both stocks Friday.Starbucks (SBUX) and Visa (V) dropped 3% in early action following their quarterly reports late Thursday. Visa said spending in the U.S. remained ""reasonably strong,"" but a strong dollar and weak oil prices were creating headwinds in cross-border spending. Starbucks earnings met, but revenue missed analyst projections.McDonald's (MCD) edged 0.4% higher.  Its Q1 earnings jumped 22% and easily topped expectations. Revenue slipped less than expected and global same store sales rose more than 6%, vs. expectations of less than 5%.

390,SBUX,"Grant Chen's Seattle restaurant netted just $8,856.57 last year after he had to start paying a minimum wage of $11 an hour. Starbucks (SBUX) raked in about $2.8 billion.So here's a puzzle: How can it be that the city's minimum-wage law puts Chen, a decidedly small-time restaurant owner, in the same large-employer category as Starbucks CEO Howard Schulz?You might call it guilt by association. Chen, a second-generation Chinese American, pooled together retirement savings with a few friends, along with loans from family members, and used the money to buy a franchise of a fast-casual chain that could provide the stability of a familiar brand, training and procedures that wouldn't require them to reinvent the wheel.Yet now national chains like McDonald's (MCD) that use the franchise model are under political and legal attack on multiple fronts. Small businesses — many of them minority-owned — are suffering collateral damage.Under the Seattle law, and potentially to a much greater extent under New York state's minimum-wage hike for fast-food outlets, small-business owners are being penalized for their association with large corporations that license out their brands.Discriminating against franchises ""paints the cross hairs on a disadvantaged portion of the population that utilizes the franchise model because the barriers to entry are low,"" Chen wrote in a blog post. The title: ""Seattle's $15 Minimum Wage Is Driving My Restaurant Out Of Business.""The crackdown on franchising comes even as minority ownership of franchises is surging, providing a tried and true method of democratizing the benefits of capitalism. The latest data from the Census Bureau released late in 2015 show that among businesses with at least 10 employees who operate franchises, 17.5% were minority-owned in 2012, up from 13.8% in 2007. Meanwhile, outside the franchise business, just 10.8% of firms with 10-plus workers were minority-owned.This year, Chen and Starbucks have to pay a minimum of $13 an hour, rising to $15 in 2017, with inflation adjustments thereafter. Smaller employers, those with 500 workers or fewer, get two extra years before they have to pay $15.In New York state, where the minimum-wage just began rising toward $15 an hour for quick-service chains with at least 30 U.S. locations, even small-business operators with a single location are on the hook for the higher wage. Meanwhile, the state's minimum wage for everyone else is $9 an hour, at least for now.The higher New York wage applies to a broad range of limited-service or takeout places, including Starbucks, Yum Brands' (YUM) Taco Bell, Shake Shack (SHAK), Dunkin' Donuts (DNKN), Jamba Juice (JMBA), Wendy's (WEN) and Subway.The earliest consequences of this attack on national franchises are mostly confined to Seattle and New York state. Yet the consequences for the franchise business model could be incredibly far-reaching if courts uphold the National Labor Relations Board decision to designate McDonald's a joint employer of the 90% of its workers who are hired, managed and paid by franchise operators.That case, now being argued before an NLRB administrative law judge in Chicago, could put companies that use the franchise model on the hook for labor violations by the franchisees that operate company-branded restaurants.""To protect yourself, you would have to manage the employees,"" said Andy Puzder, CEO of CKE Restaurants, the company behind chains Carl's Jr. and Hardee's.""At that point, the 4% royalty doesn't work anymore,"" Puzder said, referring to the common 4% of revenue that goes to the franchisor as payment for everything it provides to help a franchise succeed.Further, if the franchisor is found to be a joint employer with its franchisees, that would effectively turn small businesses into large ones and create new liability to provide workers clocking 30 hours a week with health insurance under ObamaCare's employer mandate, says David Kaufmann, whose law firm Kaufmann Gildin & Robbins represents franchise industry employers.But the primary objective in rewriting decades of law and regulations governing the franchise industry is ""unionizing workers at franchises,"" Kaufmann said.Unquestionably, the push to unionize would be easier. Instead of organizing workers at individual franchises or groups of outlets under common ownership, unions could deal directly with the corporations behind the brands.The big flaw in the NLRB's case is that McDonald's, like other big franchisors, doesn't control the workers at its franchise locations and doesn't have the power to tell franchise operators how much to pay in wages. That reality was evident when McDonald's said last year it would raise its starting wage at company-owned locations to $1 above the local minimum wage. Franchise operators were reportedly less than thrilled by the move, likely because their workers wanted the same deal. But they had the ultimate decision.The NLRB joint-employer designation would fundamentally redefine the role of a franchisee, from someone who puts up risk capital and runs a business to make a profit into one among perhaps hundreds or even thousands of middle managers in a corporate empire.""The ability to run my own business was the very reason I put my savings on the line to become a franchisee,"" wrote Amir Siddiqi in a Wall Street Journal op-ed last year.Born in Pakistan, Siddiqi came to the U.S. at age 19 in 1985 and worked as a dishwasher at a Carl's Jr. across the street from his community college. He eventually worked his way up through management of the parent company, then seized the chance to become his own boss, putting up all of his savings and borrowing the rest needed to buy three Carl's Jr. franchises. Now he has more than 40 restaurants and 900 workers, including teenagers and immigrants working their first jobs.Making franchisors joint employers, Siddiqi said, could ""destroy a road to the American dream for people who are willing to take some risks for the chance to build a business and a better life.""The NLRB's joint-employer rule is expected to wind up before the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and possibly the Supreme Court before it takes effect. Meanwhile, the International Association of Franchises has joined business owners in asking the Supreme Court to invalidate Seattle's discriminatory treatment of franchises. Among the petitioners is Ronald Oh, whose dad fled North Korea as a youngster. Now the family has its livelihood invested in a Holiday Inn Express (IHG) with a few dozen employees.""The way to become rich is to put all your eggs in one basket and then watch that basket,"" Oh said at a hearing on the wage hike, quoting Andrew Carnegie. ""This is our basket, and the eggs are the lives of my entire extended family. We are watching that basket carefully.""

391,SBUX,"The stock market rallied nicely at the open Wednesday as overseas factors, earnings reports and economic data all influenced early trade.The Nasdaq led the way, rising 0.9%. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 picked up 0.7% each.The stock market today benefited from a positive mood started in Asia. China's March exports surged 12% from a a year ago, the first rise in eight months, according to the General Administration of Customs. Imports declined less than 8%, vs. a 14% drop in February. The export improvement was partially due to a sharp drop in exports in March 2015. Strong exports were also helped by a weaker yuan.Hong Kong's Hang Seng index responded with a 3.2% gain. The Shanghai Composite climbed 1.4%. In Japan, the yen continued lower against the dollar, helping send the Nikkei 225 ahead 2.8%.The positive tone carried over into Europe, where markets pushed strong gains in afternoon trade. The CAC 40 in Paris and Frankfurt's DAX traded up more than 2% each. London's FTSE 100 showed a 1.4% gain.The overseas momentum helped compensate for the drag caused by oil and gold, both of which traded briskly lower. West Texas Intermediate traded down 1%, but held firmly above $41 a barrel. Gold futures were off nearly 1% to $1,250 an ounce.In U.S. economic news, inflation received a tame report card, as producer prices eased 0.1% in March, the Labor Department estimated, well below the 0.3% increase expected by consensus forecasts. Declines in cost of services apparently offset rebounding energy prices. Core prices, minus energy and food, also dipped 0.1%, vs. forecasts for a 0.2% increase.Retail sales also dropped in March, down 0.3%, Commerce Department data showed. Consensus expectations called for a 0.1% increase. Minus automobiles, sales rose 0.2% -- below the consensus estimate for a 0.4% gain.The Census Bureau offers up February business inventories data at 10 a.m. ET, followed by the Energy Information Administration's weekly oil inventories report at 10:30.

JPMorgan's Q1 results showed consumer and community banking growing net income 12% on a 4% rise in revenue. Investment banking revenue dropped 24%.Other banks tapped into the momentum. Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial Services (PNC) -- all scheduled to report results on Thursday -- rose 2% apiece. Overseas banks were also in serious motion: Germany's Deutsche Bank (DB) leapt 6%, London-based HSBC Holdings (HSBC) swung up 5%. Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), Lloyd's Banking Group (LYG) and UBS Group (UBS) all climbed 3%.Among other companies reporting quarterly results, Adtran (ADTN) jumped 4% after a positive report late Tuesday. Railroad CSX (CSX) rose 1%, as revenue missed and earnings just met analyst consensus estimates, but management reported firmer pricing and rising volumes in automotive and other segments.Beyond earnings, biotech drug maker Medivation (MDVN) sparked up 8% after Bloomberg reported the company had snubbed a buyout offer from French drug giant Sanofi (SNY). Shares of Sanofi added 0.6%.China's Baidu (BIDU) and JD.Com (JD) led the Nasdaq 100, up 3% and 4% respecitively. S&P 500 name Harley Davidson (HOG) rebounded 3.5%. The stock tanked 14% last week on a string of critical analyst notes.Early IBD 50 leaders included Facebook (FB). Shares added more than 1%. The social networking heavy found quiet support at its 50-day line on Tuesday, ending 6% below a 117.09 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Coffee chain Starbucks (SBUX) added 2% after Tuesday's gap down in heavy trade. The stock managed to find support at the converged 50- and 200-day moving averages. That is a positive, but shares have been unable to rise clear of those lines of support as they've climbed the right side of a shallow six-month consolidation.

"
398,SBUX,"Thursday is a huge day for earnings, with earnings reports from a slew of companies, including many that are highly rated industry leaders. Here is what to expect from Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Starbucks (SBUX) and Visa (V).The Google parent likely benefited from strong mobile ad revenue in the first quarter. Earnings per share ex items likely grew 21% to $7.97. Total revenue is forecast to climb 18% to $20.37 billion. Revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs likely climbed 18% to about $16.5 billion.Core search and search-related ad sales should be strong, analysts expect. Also keep an eye on cloud-related services. Google competes against Amazon (AMZN) Web Services and Microsoft's Azure.Alphabet stock tried  to break out last week from a cup-with-handle base with a 777.41 buy point, but volume was lackluster. Shares closed slightly below that entry area on Wednesday, but are up 0.5% to 778.63 in intraday trading on the stock market today. A strong gain in powerful volume would be an encouraging sign.The software giant should report a 2% revenue gain to $22.09 billion for the March quarter, ending a three-quarter string of declines. Microsoft earnings likely rose 5% to 64 cents. While Microsoft is trying to shift to its new mobile/cloud focus, weak PC sales will remain a drag on its core Windows/Office software suite.For the June quarter, analysts expected slightly faster growth, helped by declining currency headwinds as the dollar retreats.Much like Alphabet, Microsoft stock last week broke out of a cup-with-handle base in light volume, but then retreated below the buy point (55.76), dropping 1.4% to 55.59 on Wednesday. Shares moved just above that point Thursday afternoon, rising 0.4% to 55.79.Starbucks has continue to deliver surprisingly strong growth for a long-established coffee chain. For its fiscal Q2, analysts expect EPS to rise 18% to 39 cents. Sales should climbs 10% to $5.03 billion, though that would be the second straight quarter of decelerating growth.Aside from EPS and sales guidance, investors will be interested in how customers are responding to Starbucks' recently revamped loyalty rewards program. Some analysts have argued that it could hurt business, at least in the short term.Starbucks stock has been consolidating since peaking at 64 on Oct. 30. Starbucks fell 0.4% to 60.66 intraday. It offers a buy point at 61.88, though 61.74 also could serve as an alternative entry.The credit and debit card giant is expected to report a 6% EPS gain to 67 cents, with revenue up nearly 6% to $3.6 billion.Visa recently agreed to buy Visa Europe for $23.4 billion. Discover Financial (DFS) and American Express (AXP) reported this week.Visa stock cleared a buy point at 81.11 on Monday, hitting a new high but in light volume. Visa undercut that buy area on Tuesday, retook the entry point on Wednesday, but traded down 0.4% to 80.81 Thursday afternoon.

399,SBUX,"Apple (AAPL) and Starbucks (SBUX) are expanding the reach of their mobile payment systems, aiming to get a bigger edge on rivals such as PayPal (PYPL) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google.Apple Pay -- which supports in-store shopping at retail checkout as well as in-app purchases for Uber, Disney stores and others – will be included in Apple’s Safari browser in time for Q4 holiday shopping, says a Re/code report. The payment system will continue to work with Apple’s fingerprint ID technology as a substitute for inputting 16-digit credit card numbers.Apple aims to solve a problem with mobile shopping; smartphone users tend to browse for products but often don't pull the trigger to buy.“The checkout page tends to be clunky and requires much in the way of manual entry. Apple Pay boils the checkout down to putting your finger on Touch ID, eliminating multiple steps,” Jordan McKee, an analyst at 451Research, told IBD. “This is troubling news for dominant Web players such as PayPal.""PayPal stock was down 4.5% in early trading in the stock market today while shares of Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) were down a fraction.“While this (Apple Pay-Safari) could represent some near-term headline risk for PayPal, we believe the competitive impact introduced by Apple Pay in-browser will be limited due to potential consumer and merchant adoption hurdles,” said Jason Kupferberg, a Jefferies analyst, in a research report. “PayPal's own expedited checkout process, One Touch, is already in use by more than 250 of the top 500 internet retailers”Apple Pay will also be more competitive with Visa CheckOut. Visa, though, has been active making deals, said Josh Beck, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, in a report.“Visa has certainly not been sitting idle as shown by recent minority investments in Chain, Stripe and Square (SQ) and product enhancements, including Visa Commerce Network, Visa Token Services and Visa Checkout,” wrote Beck.Starbucks, which has one of the most successful mobile wallets, is expanding its rewards system using a branded prepaid Visa card.Starbucks on Wednesday said the loyalty rewards system will allow customers to earn points for all purchases made with the prepaid  card. The Starbucks branded card can be used at any retailer that accepts Visa cards.Image provided by Shutterstock.

400,SBUX,"They're two fast-food staples with two different stock patterns. McDonald's (MCD), benefiting from its new All Day Breakfast service, was close to a possible breakout from a cup base. Meanwhile, Starbucks (SBUX) is trying to claw its way out of a five-month consolidation but ended the week strong.""Given the 'fast money' playing MCD currently, we understand why maybe SBUX has underperformed,"" Jefferies said in a research note last week. But the investment firm noted that the valuation gap -- based on forward PE multiples -- between the two stocks is relatively small compared to recent years. Either way, here's a look at their charts.McDonald's, which has a buy point of 124.93, closed up 0.75% at 124.08 on Friday. The stock began its base in February. Shares dipped and wrapped around their key 50-day line through March 8 in mostly lower-than-average volume. They began climbing on March 9.Breakouts with higher-than-average volume are ideal. The base is second-stage. The earlier the stage, the likelier the stock is to still have something in the tank for future gains.Outside technicals, things look bright for the company's current quarter. A year prior, the stock suffered amid concerns that the fast-food giant wasn't adapting to a restaurant landscape that seemed to focus on healthy and fast-casual.But the fried-food behemoth seems to have eased those concerns by doubling down on what it already does, with its all-day breakfast service, launched last year, and value options helping push results higher. And investors, for now, have soured on fast-casual as more restaurants tried to cash in on the trend and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) tries to pick up the pieces following food-borne illness scares.""We believe business materially improved in Feb. as the company began re-emphasizing All Day Breakfast, weather was more favorable across the U.S., and the McPick campaign shifted to a '2 for $5' price point, which better combatted the other value-based meal platforms in the QSR (quick-service restaurant) space,"" Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh said in a research note this week.""We also think that this momentum has continued into March, and, were it to continue throughout the month, we believe the quarter’s results could prove our estimates conservative,"" he added.McDonald's stock rose from a flat base in October, and strong quarterly results have driven its 32% ascent since 2015.Stock action for Starbucks, the chain that has given Americans a reason to drink coffee at any time of the day, hasn’t been as healthy. The stock’s 50-day line has come close to slicing through its 200-day line, a bearish sign.Shares have closed up five out of the last six sessions and rose 0.25% at 59.70 on Friday in heavy volume, an encouraging sign after prior gains in weak volume. But they have a way to go before clearing the Oct. 30 record high of 64.""We suspect high expectations and strong performance in 2015 ... has not been a good recipe so far in ’16,"" Jefferies said in a research note last week.The company’s investments could more than double this year, following additional spending on higher wages in Q1, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said in a note last week.""This reinvestment, together with ongoing technology initiatives, delivery testing and FX drag ($0.05/share or 3pp headwind), may limit FY16 EPS growth to 18-20%,"" Palmer said. He added: ""However, we believe these investment areas are protecting the brand from the risks that befall many larger brands as Starbucks captures scale advantages through technology.""Mobile payments, one of those technology initiatives, accounted for 21% of orders last quarter, RBC said, and may have gained ""to the mid-20% range in the current quarter.""

401,SBUX,"St. Patrick's Day, which takes place Thursday, is day to go to bars, drink, yell, yell about how not enough people are yelling, get your annual dose of the Pogues, leave green objects in the street, connect with or grossly exaggerate your Irish heritage, and above all, loudly discuss the hottest and top-rated stocks in the IBD 50 that have any connection at all to the nation.To that end, here's a look at what's happening with Ryanair (RYAAY), an Irish budget air carrier, and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, which like Apple (AAPL), Starbucks (SBUX) and many other large companies, has used low-tax Ireland to ease their financial burden -- unfairly, many say.Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's profanity-prone CEO, has in the past reportedly expressed his pride for Ireland's culture by remarking, “All flights are fueled with leprechaun wee and my (excrement, as derived from a bull),” using another excrement-related term to describe Ireland’s former prime minister, and asserting that the airline industry is loaded with liars and alcoholics, and that Ireland produced the best of both.Now that Ryanair has become a leader in Europe's market, O'Leary appears to have softened his tone. Ryanair has also made more of an effort to attract business travelers as low-cost competition from rivals in Europe intensifies.Either way, the stock remains in solid shape today. It broke out of a cup-with-handle base early this month, then dipped slightly but found support at its 50-day line. Prior to that, the stock broke out of a flat base in November and then in December.You probably Google things every day, and on St. Patrick's Day, Google could help you find restaurants and party supplies, or verify your area's DUI laws. Alphabet, Google's parent, has grown on mobile ads and search, and has set its sights more recently on artificial intelligence.Google's relations in the European Union have been contentious. It has landed in hot water over privacy complaints, antitrust issues and its taxes.The company, which has been accused of not paying its fair share in Europe, recently agreed to pay 130 million pounds ($184 million) in back taxes in the U.K. -- a deal that some have criticized as too small. However, France is reportedly seeking $1.8 billion in back taxes from Google.The search giant several years ago moved the headquarters for many of its international operations to Ireland. Doing so enabled it to whisk proceeds through tax-friendly laws in the Netherlands and then to extremely tax-friendly Bermuda.Shares broke out of a consolidation in October on a company quarterly earnings report. The stock has fought to retain support at its 50-day moving average.

407,SBUX,"Starbucks (SBUX) should post another quarter of double-digit earnings and revenue gains, analysts project, but will a good second quarter be good enough for investors?The coffee shop chain is expected to post 18% profit growth to 39 cents a share on a 10% revenue rise to $5.03 billion, when it reports results after the close Thursday.Shares have been consolidating since November, largely trading above their 50-day and 200-day moving averages for the last month. Starbucks shares rose 0.6% to 60.89  in the stock market today.IBD's Take: How healthy are the shares of Starbucks and its rivals? Find out at IBD Stock Checkup""We continue to view SBUX as a best-in-class operator and an industry leader in the increasingly important realm of technology-driven consumer engagement,"" wrote Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh on Monday. He has an equal-weight rating and 56 price target on the stock.Starbucks' rewards program boasted 11.1 million active U.S. members as of January, with its mobile app accounting for over a fifth of all domestic transactions and with its order-ahead feature also picking up steam.Consensus estimates for domestic same-store sales and global comps are 7% and 6.5%, respectively, according to his report.Piper Jaffray, which noted in its semiannual teen survey last week that Starbucks was still No. 1 with young people, said its latest channel checks leave the firm ""confident that Starbucks is well-positioned to continue driving strong same-store sales trends in 2016,"" citing well-received food and drink offerings and targeted promotions.But with expectations high for the coffee titan, a solid quarterly report may not impress.""(E)ven if Starbucks reports good results -- based on lofty investors’ expectations -- the shares may still face some added pressure, as good results may not be good enough to support SBUX’s shares at current levels,"" wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Brett Levy on Friday. He has a hold rating on the stock.Starbucks is a member of IBD's Retail-Restaurants industry group, which includes Dunkin' Brands (DNKN), McDonald's (MCD), Taco Bell parent Yum Brands (YUM) and the beleaguered Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG).Yum is slated to report Wednesday.

But China's reliance on debt-fueled stimulus may not be sustainable, analysts warn.China grew 6.7% during the first quarter vs. a year earlier, the smallest gain in seven years, Beijing reported Friday local time. But that matched estimates and was only a slight deceleration from Q4's 6.8% expansion.  Also, other economic reports, including retail sales and industrial production, found growth accelerating in March.But even setting aside the usual doubts about whether Chinese economic statistics can be trusted, some analysts worry that China's economy is being propped up by increasing financial leverage and escalating real estate prices.""It could take a few years before that is exposed -- as we know from our own economy in the last slowdown,"" according to Gil Luria, managing director and analyst at Wedbush Securities.The U.S. exposure to China is somewhat limited, comprising barely 1% of U.S. GDP. But stronger Chinese growth could be a boon to U.S. corporate giants, from Apple (AAPL) to United Technologies (UTX) to Starbucks (SBUX).Meanwhile, U.S. and other global stock markets have rallied strongly from early February lows.Crude prices have moved back above $40 a barrel, along with big gains in iron ore and steel prices. That's bolstered commodities-sensitive industries.""The indirect price effect is the most important channel through which Chinese growth affects the U.S.,"" according to William Adams, senior international economist at PNC Financial Services.But questions remain about China, Adams said. In Q1, the three major sectors of the economy -- agriculture, industrial and services -- decelerated from Q4 more than the aggregate growth rate.Retail sales grew 10.5% in March, picking up from 10.2% in February, but China includes government purchases in that number, making it somewhat unclear if actual consumer spending is accelerating.Meanwhile, government measures bolstered China's flagging real estate sector, which had been hampered by a glut of development.Investment in fixed assets such as factories and buildings grew 10.7% in Q1, better than expected. Cement production climbed 24% last month compared to a year earlier. Crude steel production gained 2.9% in March compared to the 5.7% decline during January and February.But private firms' investment rose just 5.7% vs. 23.3% for state-owned businesses. China's state-owned enterprises tend to be less efficient than the country's dynamic private sector.Social financing, which includes bank and nonbank lending, soared to a record high in the first quarter, raising concerns that China has been throwing money at the problem.Still, after a bumpy start to the year, China's policymakers have engineered a soft landing, steadied the yuan and slowed capital outflows.""Chinese fiscal stimulus has cushioned the first quarter slowdown and has reduced the downside risks to near-term global growth,"" Adams said.The world's No. 2 economy is in a well-publicized and long-term transition from an industrial, export-based economy to one led by services and domestic demand. The Chinese consumer's share of GDP rose two points year over year to 56.9%, but that remains far below U.S. numbers.Reform plans to rationalize laggard SOEs have been mooted; Beijing is wary of reforms that would cut millions of jobs. Next year, a lot of provincial officials are up for potential promotions or demotions, according to Sung Wohn Sohn, an economics professor at California State University, Channel Islands. They don't want to risk weak economic figures or widespread labor unrest.Accelerating growth in China and improved global financial markets, even in the short term, should give the Federal Reserve hawks a little more impetus to tighten U.S. monetary policy.""They're more likely to raise interest rates now,"" Sohn said.

409,SBUX,"Chipotle Mexican Grill’s (CMG) series of food-borne illness outbreaks may have cost the company three years of earnings growth, according to JPMorgan’s estimates. But the bank sounded bullish as it upgraded the beleaguered restaurant chain to overweight from neutral.""In all, our call is based on Chipotle being a highly meaningful brand that with time and expense can regain customer trust,"" wrote JPMorgan analyst John Ivankoe on Thursday.Shares closed 2.55% higher but remain below their 50-day moving average. The stock has been trading below its 200-day since losing support at the level in late October, and is 40% off its all-time high.The E. coli and norovirus episodes that hit Chipotle locations across the country also hit its brand image, with same-store sales down 14.6% in Q4 and an expected loss in Q1, the latter of which would mark a first for the company’s quarterly results.""We expect normal earnings growth to resume by F18 -- after nearly doubling in F17 -- and believe 20%+ EPS growth can be sustained through at least F20,"" said Ivankoe.He is not the only analyst who sees the light at the end of the tunnel for the burrito chain.Piper Jaffray’s latest semiannual teen survey found that Chipotle still holds major sway over America’s young people. The firm is positive on the company’s long-term story as well, with an overweight rating and 590 price target.The stock is a member of IBD’s Retail-Restaurants industry group, which is at No. 75 among IBD’s Industry Sub-Group Rankings, joined by Starbucks (SBUX), McDonald's (MCD), Yum Brands (YUM) and others.RELATED:Starbucks Is Still Tops With Teens, Chipotle Hangs OnWhy Chipotle Mexican Grill May Have Reached ‘Peak Burrito’

410,SBUX,"Today’s Investor’s Corner kicks off a short series of articles detailing why some breakouts fail and how to handle them when they do.Teen retail chain Rue 21 staged what looked like a very solid breakout on July 7, 2011, (1) (a weekly chart is shown). The five-month cup with handle was just 23% deep. The base was a first-stage pattern, and the stock had been public for less than two years, also a plus.But some red flags were waving.Institutional activity over the course of the base was skewed toward distribution. This activity rippled into the handle (2). The volume, rather than drying up along the length of the handle, was jerky, with heavier weekly volume on the downside. This isn’t the kind of orderly shakeout you like to see ahead of a breakout.The handle also dipped nearly 15%, beyond the 12% limit that defines a well-behaved stock.The breakout, a powerful 8% spike in better than double its average trade, past a 34.93 buy point, did not erase these elements of risk.Rue rose for two days, then began a rapid pullback in generally light trade. It dropped to a test of 50-week support, violating the 8% sell rule on July 27 (3). Technically, this marked a failed breakout.In real terms, the breakout still had a fighting chance. A great many breakouts -- particularly in a challenging market -- have pulled back below the 8% loss level, then reversed to retake the buy point and move on to new highs.Recent examples include Hi Tech Pharmacal and Starbucks (SBUX) in September and October. More recently, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Nu Skin Enterprises (NUS) and W.W. Grainger (GWW) have recovered after triggering the golden sell rule to retake new highs.The lesson: Keep your eye on the ball, even if it has failed.Rue’s death knell came in the first two sessions of August 2011 (4). The stock cut its 50-day moving average with a big loss in mildly above-average trade Aug. 1. On Aug. 2, it sliced its 200-day line with an even larger drop in heavier volume.(Editor's Note: This column first ran on Investors.com on Jan. 6, 2012.)

411,SBUX,"Teenagers love Starbucks (SBUX) and love eating out, according to the results of a new Piper Jaffray poll, which says that restaurant spending is still outpacing apparel spending. The coffee giant is still No. 1 and the only brand to continue to harness double-digit market share preference among teens, according to the firm.""Starbucks remains our top investment recommendation based on its proven global brand equity and an accelerating asset-light growth model, both of which generate strong cash flow in support of continued reinvestment into the business and an ongoing commitment to capital allocation,"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Nicole Miller Regan following the release of its Spring 2016 Taking Stock With Teens survey results.But Deutsche Bank cooled on the stock, downgrading it to hold from buy Tuesday as it argues that Starbucks' comp and earnings growth are fully priced into shares.Shares rose 1.2% in the stock market today after falling 2.3% Tuesday.Meanwhile, McDonald's (MCD) is still edging up in popularity and remains the top burger choice for America's young people.McDonald's stock fell 0.6% but remains near recent record highs and is still in buy range from a late March breakout.And Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) maintained its position as the second-place favorite among upper-income teenagers, though it unsurprisingly lost some share in the wake of a series of food-borne illness outbreaks at its restaurants.Piper Jaffray remains positive on the brand's long-term story, with a ""when, not if"" outlook on improvement, an overweight rating and a 590 price target.Chipotle shares rallied to close up 4 cents at 444.66 after falling early. CtW Investment Group urged shareholders not to re-elect directors Patrick Flynn and Darlene Friedman at the company's annual meeting, citing a lack of diversity, and called for more ""independent oversight.""RELATED:Why One Analyst Is 'Taking A Pause' From Starbucks.

412,SBUX,"If necessity is the mother of invention, then maybe it’s the uncle of price. If you need something and have trouble getting it, you are generally willing to pay more.That is how the floor of a stock exchange works, with buyers bidding and sellers trying to coax the best price possible. When a stock is in short supply and multiple buyers want it, prices get bid up and the stock’s chart action heads north.What would make a stock’s supply run short?That is the subject of the S in CAN SLIM: weighing the supply of and demand for shares. And it is a key factor in setting the stage for a leading stock’s price rally.There are several ways to measure the supply of a company’s stock. The first is total shares outstanding. This is used to calculate market capitalization and earnings per share. The important number for price action is a stock’s float. The second is a company's float, or total shares outstanding minus the number of shares closely held by management or other inside shareholders. These closely held shares rarely, if ever, make it to the trading floor.Differences between shares outstanding and float can vary widely. Starbucks (SBUX) has total shares outstanding of 1.478 billion and a float of 1.419 billion, a difference of 59 million shares. Alibaba Group (BABA) (which trades American Depositary Receipts) shows total ADRs outstanding of 2.446 billion and a float of 929 million -- a 1.5-billion-share differential. But Priceline Group (PCLN) counts 50 million shares outstanding and a float of 49 million.The third gauge is average trading volume (bought and sold each day) over the past 50 sessions. Seek a minimum of more than 400,000 to 500,000 shares. High-priced stocks may show a smaller average volume and still be highly liquid.This may seem counter-intuitive. If a tight supply drives up prices, why not go for stocks that have small floats and are thinly traded? The problem: Thinly traded stocks tend to be volatile, typically rising fast and steep when they rally, and falling especially hard when they lose. Thinly traded stocks generally form erratic bases, characterized by wide daily or weekly price swings. They can be easily manipulated by a single large investor, driving prices up and taking profits according to their own needs, and fracturing the group behavior that drives base patterns and breakouts.A large float and a healthy current of daily volume makes it much less likely one or two brokerage shops can manipulate a stock. Basing patterns track a stock in which share supply gradually tightens as institutional players build positions at comparatively low prices.When the supply becomes constrained due to large-volume buying and a lack of willing sellers, a stock surges as investors crowd in for the rally that will hopefully follow.

414,SBUX,"New money never sleeps -- or so February's first-ever PayPal (PYPL) Super Bowl ad asked viewers to believe.The aggressive spot was an attempt to tell the public that PayPal is the future of money. It was also meant to suggest to investors that good things lie ahead now that the company is once again on its own after being spun off from 13-year parent eBay (EBAY).PayPal, however, finds itself surrounded by some big companies with payments technologies that could disrupt its lead. Apple (AAPL), Square (SQ) and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google are among the companies building digital wallet technologies that compete in one way or another with PayPal.""The new campaign is the very positioning we did pre-IPO (in 2002),"" Eric Jackson, CEO of business technology company CapLinked, told IBD. Jackson was PayPal's first director of marketing and wrote a memoir about his time at the company.Companies in the payments sector often do business with one another. Many of the merchants signed up with Apple Pay have their payments processed by PayPal subsidiary Braintree, for example.""As the kids say, there are 'frenemies' in payments,"" Wedbush analyst Gil Luria told IBD.Still, PayPal stock was down more than 4% in late-afternoon trading Thursday on news that both Apple and  Starbucks (SBUX) are expanding the reach of their mobile payment systems, aiming to get a bigger edge on rivals such as PayPal and Google.Apple Pay will be included in Apple’s Safari browser in time for Q4 holiday shopping, reported Re/code. The payment system will continue to work with Apple’s fingerprint ID technology.At least one analyst didn't see a big impact on PayPal, however. “While this (Apple Pay-Safari) could represent some near-term headline risk for PayPal, we believe the competitive impact introduced by Apple Pay in-browser will be limited due to potential consumer and merchant adoption hurdles,” Jefferies analyst Jason Kupferberg said in a research report. “PayPal's own expedited checkout process, One Touch, is already in use by more than 250 of the top 500 internet retailers”Meanwhile, in many ways, Braintree's peer-to-peer payments app Venmo is in a position similar to PayPal in its own very early days. Instead of focusing only on its first market, person-to-person payments, Venmo -- like PayPal, which started out as a free service before it built enough heft to charge merchants -- is turning to merchant transactions to turn a profit.Targeting merchant transaction fees ""is not that much of a leap,"" Luria said. ""That's what Elon Musk and Peter Thiel (PayPal co-founders along with Max Levchin) did 15 years ago. It's not unprecedented to take the Venmo users and turn them into paying customers.""That PayPal would be able to unlock business opportunities previously inaccessible to it with eBay as its owner -- other e-commerce rivals didn't particularly care to give business to a competitor such as eBay -- was a notable selling point when the split-up was announced in 2015.PayPal executives say that the company has advanced in several ways that it couldn't while it was a part of eBay. The marketing campaign that the Super Bowl ad was designed to support might not have been a priority under eBay, says Juan Benitez, general manager and CTO at Braintree.Braintree powers payments behind fast-growing private companies such as ride hailing app Uber and alternative accommodations provider Airbnb. Analyst Luria says that most of Braintree's profit comes from those two firms. Uber and Airbnb were Braintree's top clients when it was part of eBay as well, but the separation has led to at least one marquee client: the fast-growing e-tail startup Jet.com. Its CEO, Marc Lore, aims to compete with Amazon.com by, like Amazon, offering free two-day shipping. EBay is another rival. ""Jet is something that maybe would have had a question or two asked before before the split,"" Benitez told IBD. In addition, he says that PayPal is expanding its pilot merchant program with China e-commerce leader Alibaba (BABA).ITG Investment Research analyst Steve Weinstein told IBD that PayPal's post-eBay success has much to do with the company bringing on new merchants while part of eBay, ""and that moment has continued."" He says that it's ""hard to tell"" whether things have changed since the split, since it's so recent.But according to Wedbush's Luria, the truth about PayPal's real post-eBay value is related to the spinoff's financials.""When the carving out was happening, when the separation was negotiated, the eBay board allocated a lot of the revenue to PayPal and expenses to eBay,"" he said. The reasoning, he says, is that PayPal was getting twice the multiple (price-to-earnings ratio), so every dollar of profit they put into PayPal was going to get twice as much market value.Luria said that beyond the financials, the split produced a ""freeing effect"" that has allowed the deals with Alibaba and Jet.com. ""It's now an easier decision to incorporate PayPal into merchant acceptance,"" he said.The split, says Luria, gave PayPal the ""power of focus."" PayPal no longer needs approval from eBay executives on important decisions.No doubt competition with tech titans in payments will remain fierce, but PayPal is in a strong position. With its base of 13 million active merchants, the company can achieve powerful network effects from that critical mass, which makes it a considerable challenge to unseat PayPal as payments king.CEO Jeff Bezos' mighty e-commerce firm Amazon.com has been competing with PayPal for 10 years via its own payments platform, with negligible results.""Now the subtlety is that Apple Pay and Android Pay have an advantage,"" Luria said. Because the companies integrate their payments into iOS and Android, respectively, the payment experience is seamless -- which is critical for digital wallets.PayPal executives say that Apple Pay and Android Pay are actually good for their company, since those services often use PayPal's Braintree to process transactions.Others, however, don't see PayPal walking arm in arm with Apple or Google. ""Embracing the advent of Android Pay and Apple Pay sounds a little hollow,"" former PayPal exec Jackson said. ""It sounds more like corporate spin than reality.""Both Apple and Google are able to position their payments systems as the default option on their own mobile devices and services, which could make things rougher for PayPal.But even if Apple and Google do it, Weinstein says, that move by itself would not be enough to unseat San Jose, Calif.-based PayPal from the payments lead.""PayPal has a lot of other products,"" he said.Analysts and industry watchers aren't sure how PayPal plans to tackle its challenges. Innovation is one strategy that's worked well in the past, such as with One Touch, the company's tech tool to reduce checkout time. Acquisitions have been helpful, too -- for example, the $800 million Braintree purchase, which included Venmo.Regardless of how PayPal proceeds, how it separates itself from its competition will be key, says Jackson. As the Super Bowl ad shows, PayPal has its game face on.

415,SBUX,"The lifting of sanctions against Iran could be a double-edged sword for Schlumberger (SLB) as it gets ready to report fourth-quarter results Friday amid a round of layoffs and oil prices that have plunged to below $30 a barrel.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the oilfield service provider to report a 58% drop in quarterly earnings to 63 cents per share. Revenue is seen falling 38.2% to $7.8 billion.In December, Schlumberger said it would cut more jobs in the fourth quarter ""in light of expected reduced activity for 2016."" Industry peers Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) have already slashed tens of thousands of jobs due to weak demand for their services as U.S rig counts fall as low crude prices make many projects unprofitable. Halliburton has a deal to buy Baker Hughes, which regulators have yet to approve.Halliburton is scheduled to announce quarterly results Monday.On Saturday the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog confirmed that Iran has curbed its nuclear program, allowing Western sanctions to be lifted and unfreezing $100 billion in assets. Oilfield-service companies may get a boost if their equipment can be used for drilling. But the return of Iranian crude on the world market will push oil prices even lower as Saudi-lead OPEC is unlikely to scale back production to make room for Iran's additional output.

My Starbucks Rewards had over 20 million members as of its Q4 report in late October, and mobile payments accounted for 21% of all U.S. transactions.""Given the continued benefit from differentiated food offerings, mobile ordering, delivery, continued compelling beverage (limited time only offerings), throughput, and loyalty and mobile adoption initiatives, we believe Americas comp growth is poised for sustained mid- to high-single-digit comp momentum,"" said Setyan.Starbucks' mobile-order-and-pay feature, which allows customers to order ahead of arriving at the store, remains a ""potential game changer"" as it gains users, he wrote.Meanwhile, Starbucks continues to introduce new food and drink offerings, including alcoholic beverages in some stores.Additionally, Starbucks has been optimistic about market expansion into China, with plans to open 500 stores there this year, and a broader goal of operating 3,400 stores in the country by 2019.

421,SBUX,"McDonald’s (MCD) took over the top spot from Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) as the favorite restaurant destination among U.S. teens and young adults in 2015, according to a new poll released Wednesday, with the burger giant benefiting from a rebound in the quick-service sector.Meanwhile, Starbucks (SBUX) remained a pretty popular destination among female respondents -- though less so than in previous years -- while Yum Brands’ (YUM) Taco Bell was a hit with young males.William Blair’s annual Teen/Young Adult Survey found that restaurant sentiment “weakened somewhat” in 2015, with about 43% of respondents saying they ate out more often than a year earlier vs. 48% in 2014. Still, those numbers compared well to the apparel category, where only 31% of respondents said they spent more on apparel in 2015.“For those eating out less often, financial reasons were by far the main culprit (40%), while the response ‘too expensive’ jumped to roughly 25% from 18% last year, perhaps reflecting push-back to price increases taken by restaurants on structural government-mandated wage inflation,” William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia said in a report.She said the quick-service sector “had a quantum leap in popularity” in 2015. Eateries in this category accounted for 38% of total restaurant visits by respondents in 2015, up from 30% in 2014. This represented an all-time high for the survey, driven by strong share gains from McDonald’s and Taco Bell.Fast-casual visits fell to about 20% of total visits in 2015 from 28% the prior year, and Chipotle lost the biggest chunk of share. That was the case even though the survey was completed before the E. coli outbreak at Chipotle restaurants, which was first reported in the fall. Casual dining surpassed fast casual to become the second-most-frequented subsector in 2015.“In terms of frequency (of visits), McDonald’s topped the list across genders, while Chipotle fell to second among females (from first the prior year) and third among males (from second the prior year),” Zackfia said.Among female respondents, Panera Bread (PNRA) held the third spot behind McDonald’s and Chipotle for the second year in a row. Starbucks remained in fourth place, though the percentage of female respondents who said they ate there most often fell to 6.3% in 2015 from 7.2% in 2014. Darden Restaurants' (DRI) Olive Garden rounded out the top five among females.“McDonald’s gained material share over the past year across both genders, with the second-highest share gains behind Olive Garden for females and Taco Bell for males,” Zackfia noted.Among male respondents, Taco Bell ranked second behind McDonald’s as the most-visited restaurant.

COO John Milligan has also sold 112,000 shares.Gilead (GILD) lost 1% for the week.Insider transactions don’t typically have a major impact on a stock or indicate major pending news. Rapid liquidation of all or most of an insider’s holdings, however, can affect a stock.

423,SBUX,"After a long decline from a peak hit last April, Apple (AAPL) got back above a key benchmark on Tuesday: the 10-week moving average. Does that mean the polish is back on the iPhone maker’s stock?A look at Apple’s chart shows the 10-week moving average is still trending lower and is well below the longer-term 40-week line. While the tech titan may go on to launch a big new run, that’s a sign of lingering technical weakness.When searching for clues that a beaten down, former leader may be bouncing back, look for the 10-week line to get back above the 40-week moving average.While that type of crossover doesn’t guarantee success, it is a sign of renewed strength and until it happens, the stock isn’t likely to make a sustained new climb.You’ll find examples of this telltale clue in the charts of Amazon (AMZN), Starbucks (SBUX), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Michael Kors (KORS).While forming a long, 65-week consolidation from January 2014 to April 2015, Amazon’s 10-week line spent most of that time beneath its longer-term cousin.But while building the right side of that pattern, the 10-week line crossed back over the 40-week moving average after the e-commerce and cloud giant reported strong earnings. From there the stock went on an 11-month run until peaking in January.Starbucks brewed up a breakout not long after its 10-week line reclaimed the 40-week moving average in January 2013. The stock rose over 40% before peaking in November of the same year. While working on a new price consolidation, the 10-week benchmark fell below, but then crossed back above the 40-week line in July 2014 to set the stage for another big move.

426,SBUX,"With Frank Caruso at the helm since mid-February 2012 -- almost exactly four years -- the $2.7 billion AB Large Cap Growth Fund (APGAX) has topped 98% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. through Jan. 31.The fund notched a 14.55% average annual gain in that time vs. 10.71% for its direct rivals and 12.08% for the S&P 500. It garners an A+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, meaning it's performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.Lately, the mutual fund has shown it can outperform in ugly markets as well as in beautiful ones. By losing less than its peers and the broad market over the turbulent past three months, the fund ranked in the top 8% of its category. It fell 6.08% last month, a little better than the average U.S. diversified stocks fund's 6.25% decline.Caruso, who is 59 years old, is a member of the AB fund complex, which last year changed its name from AllianceBernstein. Caruso, the lead manager on this fund, discussed with IBD at his Manhattan office how his team invests.IBD: How have you achieved outperformance in bad markets as well as good?Caruso: It's our focus on great businesses, our obsession with the fundamental integrity of holdings and the way we manage risk. Looking at data from March 31, 2012, through Dec. 31, in the 28 up months in that time we were in the 23rd percentile of our peers. In the down months, we were in the 2nd percentile, beating 98% of our peers. The risk-adjusted performance of the portfolio is extremely good.IBD: Business cycles are not your focus, right?Caruso: I don't want people to associate with us any overarching concern about business cycles. We look for consistent performance. That's particularly important in growth stock investing. Companies we want need to have the kind of business that has a long runway to invest those high returns and earn returns in excess of their cost of capital. So it's a combination of persistence and duration that creates and unleashes the power of compounding. Rather than saying we look for high-growing companies, we look for returns and look for that in these really good businesses.IBD: You are looking for companies that can meet your requirements for several years, right?Caruso: Our window is three to five years. For companies in the Russell 1000, you've got a high-teens number of earnings forecasts for this year and next, then it falls off a cliff. As you get fewer estimates three, four, five years out, the variability about forecasts increases a lot. Longer time horizons lead to inefficiency in growth stock investing.IBD: In other words, by having a longer time horizon than most other investors, it's easier for you to find companies that are priced inefficiently?Caruso: It is. Absolutely.IBD: What's a recent example, please?Caruso: Most investors look at Nike (NKE) and see one of the most efficiently priced stocks in the market. But that changes longer-term. What's provocative is that they've been experimenting with new manufacturing technology, a weaving technology. Most people would say Nike's biggest cost is labor. But it's not. It's shipping, tariffs and duties. You can eliminate a lot of those if you localize manufacturing. Weaving technology might let them do that. Instead of (needing a lot of low-paid) workers cutting, banging, stitching, gluing, coloring and packing products, what if they have . . . smaller factories all over the world, decreasing those shipping, tariff and duties costs?So when we model Nike, we can push the profitability up by hundreds of basis points. That gives us confidence in the long term. It informs us about how we might want to behave in the short term if there's volatility.IBD: For a manager who pays little attention to the short term, you're doing well in the short term. Luck or design?Caruso: The fact that stocks go up and down doesn't impact the way we manage the portfolio. Having said that, a year ago we had had good, consistent performance for the last four years. We started to see a lot of risk exposure to momentum (stocks), and we spent the entire year managing that down to more conservative levels. And we have seen reversion to the mean.IBD: In the recent months of volatility, what have you trimmed and what have you added to?Caruso: Part of why we've done well in 2016 is that the market continues to be concerned about earnings, and our portfolio is delivering. But we've reduced our size in excess winners last year and redeployed into more, not defensive, but more edgy, controversial companies that had not been leadership stocks. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is one of those names.IBD: Which of the FANGs do you own, and which have you trimmed?Caruso: We don't own Amazon.com (AMZN) or Netflix (NFLX). We have Facebook (FB) and Google (Alphabet (GOOGL)), and haven't trimmed them.We've been more inclined to trim some discretionary stocks. We took profits and reduced positions in Starbucks (SBUX) and Nike because we thought in the moment it was pretty fully valued. But we would welcome an opportunity to build that back through volatility.Disney (DIS) was trimmed. Monster (MNST) and Staples (SPLS) -- which has been a phenomenal performer -- were trimmed.What we've added to: Last summer, we were basically market weight in health care, a little overweight. Those were put through the grinder in late summer, early fall. Into and emerging from that correction, we started increasing our exposure there. We added to Intuitive Surgical last summer. We rebalanced into Biogen (BIIB). We introduced (a position in) Edwards Lifesciences (EW).We did a number of things in tech. We introduced Adobe (ADBE) and Cognizant (CTSH), and we did some adds to longer-term positions, such as ServiceNow (NOW).IBD: Why do you like Intuitive Surgical?Caruso: The company has unbelievable returns. It has $3 billion in enterprise cash and no debt. We’re seeing the utilization of robotics in an ever-increasing number of procedures.For this company to win long-term, we must see more surgeon adoption of robotics, and we’re seeing that. The stock suffered a fair amount of underperformance the past couple of years. But we stuck to our knitting. We added to our stake opportunistically, and we’re starting to see a contribution to fund performance from this stock.IBD: You weren’t in on Facebook’s IPO, but you bought when many others were fleeing. What’s your thesis?Caruso: We were controversial buyers when the rest of the Street was puking it out. We’re proud of that.If you go back to the IPO in the summer of 2012, every banker that bought them had a five-year forecast model -- 2016 was the terminal year. Now their current forecasts are 40% to 60% higher than they were back then. My point is that fundamentals overachievement is really hard to model. But Facebook has potential to drive tremendous excess performance.IBD: Go back to Monster Beverage: Why did you trim it?Caruso: They were on the verge of deploying a lot of capital to be able to sell overseas. Then Coke (KO) took a strategic position in the company. As shareholders, we appreciated before many others that Monster would not have to spend $1 billion to become a global company. They would be able to leverage Coke’s best-on-the-planet global distribution platform. They would get to profits we thought they'd see in 2017-18 in the year 2016.The growth opportunity is increasing exponentially. So the sizing decision was really another one of those Starbucks-type decisions, where these have been unbelievably successful stocks. But the valuations got a little uncomfortable in the short term, so we reduced our exposure. There’s no diminution of our long-term conviction.IBD: You boosted your current stake in Cognizant in between September and November. What’s the attraction?Caruso: They bring a level of expertise in software-as-a-service and mobility solutions to companies that are trying to figure out how to get their IT architecture to the next level.Positioning in key technologies interests us. Cognizant was a stock we talked about at the end of 2013. We stepped away and more recently started to build it back.IBD: Adobe posted earnings-per-share gains for five quarters after suffering EPS declines in seven of the eight prior stanzas. What’s the crux of why things are working?Caruso: They used to put a product in a shrink-wrapped box and sell it. They’ve switched to a subscription model. That allows them to be consistent in how upgrades are managed and deployed. Customers don’t have to wait for upgrades. That model is destined to compress the ups and downs of their business. The lower volatility that results is good from a valuation point of view. And this model lets them manage the risk of piracy in a more head-on fashion. So the long-term value of their subscription model is more attractive than their old model.IBD: Are you among the investors who started to like Alphabet more when the company brought in Ruth Porat as CFO?Caruso: Yes, we became excited when they brought in Porat from Morgan Stanley (MS).Google had a great business, focused on search. But they used cash flow to fund a variety of initiatives that in many cases didn’t appear to make a lot of sense.With the appearance of a strong CFO, we hoped there was finally an adult in the room who would bring financial discipline to the way they thought about allocating capital. So far, she’s done that.Now they’ve got two companies, basically. One is focused on advertising, whether it’s YouTube, which is growing into an economically handsome property, or search.Then you’ve got essentially all of these call options about driverless cars, robotics. They’ve been deploying capital to build out telecom networks in cities. So it’s a portfolio of early-stage companies, some acquired, some nurtured, some ready for prime time, some needing more incubation.The split in the company lets investors have more transparency to properly value the businesses.

427,SBUX,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Gemalto exec David Etue hinged the success of the nascent Internet of Things industry -- and its 30 billion connected devices in four years -- to an efficient software update process.Because when 30 billion devices are connected to the Internet, there's a lot that can go wrong ... and fast.""Our adversaries are highly motivated,"" Etue told attendees at the RSA Conference in San Francisco, a major annual gathering of security companies. ""But if we can get a secure software update process right, at least we can make changes.""He added: ""If we get this right, this puts us in a position for long-term success.""France-based Gemalto competes in the software application and secured devices market, and therefore has a big dog in the upcoming Internet of Things fight for market share.Although the IoT presents a huge market opportunity for tech and pure cybersecurity players, its mass scale also terrifies chief information security officers, Etue said.""We don't generally intentionally put our IoT-connected devices in hostile territory,"" he said. ""We might put them on the local Starbucks (SBUX) Wi-Fi. ... That's not that scary when it's your fitness meter. It's pretty scary when it's a pacemaker.""On the business side, retail stores use sensors to count shoppers -- information hedge funds used to pay people to gather outside brick-and-mortar establishments. Farmers use devices to track the development of seeds. Tesla Motors (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), Toyota (TM), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Ford (F) are already racing toward autonomous vehicles.""So we're seeing a lot of demand to monetize this data,"" Etue said.But on the flip side, consumers are spooked after a fault in Fiat Chrysler's (FCAU) Jeep Cherokee GPS system allowed it to be hacked, Rapid7 (RPD) researchers were able to hack baby monitors and Santa Cruz, Calif., residents protested smart meters.""We get really excited about the device, but forget about where that data is from and how it's being managed,"" Etue said.He suggests consumers and developers ask themselves a series of questions before taking on Internet of Things devices. Most of those questions center on how, where and what data are stored; whether it's accessible by a third party; and who manages the accessibility.""We're never going to get this right the first time,"" he said. ""We're going to have to change.""Image provided by Shutterstock.

428,SBUX,"Amazon (AMZN) raised its minimum shopping-cart threshold to qualify for free shipping. Starbucks (SBUX) tweaked its rewards programs so customers have to spend more to earn free drinks. Both moves, which made the news rounds Monday, aren't exactly sitting well with people.""Wow, @Starbucks new rewards program is garbage. Looks like I found my motivation to switch to something else,"" posted Twitter (TWTR) user addlee24.""Really. @amazon raised their free shipping to $49. This is an outrage.#Amazon"" tweeted samiam_253.But despite complaints on Twitter and other social media, the not-so-free freebies are likely designed to nudge customers toward joining Amazon Prime and Starbucks' Rewards.Over at Amazon, non-Prime customers now have to have at least $49 -- up from $35 -- worth of eligible merchandise in their shopping carts to get free shipping privileges. (The threshold is $25 for books.)That figure is considerably closer to the $99 that it would cost to buy a yearlong Prime membership, and a longer ways off from the $25 non-subscriber shipping minimum that it once offered some years ago. The new hike could encourage more users to sign up for the service, which includes two-day shipping.Amazon's shipping costs have been rising, and there has been talk that the e-commerce heavyweight aims to get into the shipping game.Amazon shares closed down 1.2% in the stock market today after rising 4.6% on Monday, moving back over the 200-day moving average.Meanwhile, beginning in April, Starbucks' new incentive program -- which will be renamed Starbucks Rewards from My Starbucks Rewards -- will dole out two stars per dollar spent. Currently, rewards members receive one star per transaction.That in itself seems like a win for java drinkers everywhere, as that $4 latte will soon garner 8 stars instead of one. Starbucks said in a release that that was the top suggested change from customers.But the coffee giant also uprooted its milepost for earning free drinks. Gold-level members will need 125 stars -- i.e. $62.50 in receipts --  to get that reward, vs. the current 12-star minimum. Even at $4 a pop, customers would only have to spend $48 today to reach free-drink status. And entry-level users will need 300 stars -- not 30 -- to reach Gold membership.The program update was ""one of the main reasons -- perhaps even the largest reason"" that Starbucks is targeting high-single-digit same-store sales growth this year, said Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski, citing management.""The more money spent, the more Stars earned . . . which is, all else equal, more incentive to spend more money,"" wrote Kalinowski in a Monday report. ""Crucially, we believe most customers will view this change positively, as this modification was the #1 member-requested update to the rewards program.""Starbucks stock dipped 0.7% Tuesday, closing below its 50-day moving average again just a day after retaking it.RELATED:Amazon Primes Pump, Hikes Minimum Free Shipping For Non-Subscribers.

429,SBUX,"Cable TV leader Comcast (CMCSA), coffee king Starbucks (SBUX),  “innovative” drug companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and a few biotechs make Morgan Stanley’s list of companies with pricing power.Amid a low-inflation environment and worries over a global recession, stocks with pricing power should get a serious look, says the Morgan Stanley report.Its list also includes American Tower (AMT), Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG), Constellation Brands (STZ), Equinix (EQIX), L Brands (LB), Mindbody (MB), Phillip Morris (PM), Reynolds American (RAI), Sally Beauty Holdings (SBH), and Sherwin-Williams (SHW).Here’s Morgan Stanley’s take on why some of these companies have pricing power.1) American Tower. “Towers effectively offer local monopolies, and there is little alternative for wireless carriers wishing to add capacity to improve network quality.”2) Amgen. “While drug pricing has been a topic of debate since U.S. presidential candidates raised focus on the topic in the late summer of 2015, we continue to see pricing power among large cap biotech.”3) Biogen. “In 2015, management took around 11% to 12% gross price increases across its portfolio.”4) Celgene. “Management in 2015 took 7-10% gross price increases across its portfolio and we would expect a similar net price trend in 2016.”5) Comcast. “We are positive on CMCSA’s broadband growth story and see improved results in video given X1 (set-top box deployment).”6) Sherwin-Williams. “(Its) pricing power relates to its control of its own distribution, as well as its outsized leverage to professional painting contractors.7) Starbucks. “SBUX remains the category leader in the high-margin, premium coffee segment and benefits from selling an often-craved, habitual product.”

With m-commerce, or mobile commerce, maybe Starbucks (SBUX), with its smartphone payment system.C-commerce, or car-commerce, could be down the road, and Visa (V) aims to make a name for itself by partnering with auto makers.At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Visa announced a partnership with Honda as well as ParkWhiz.Visa, as well as MasterCard (MA), has developed security technology that replaces the 16-digit account numbers in credit cards. Tokens are essentially electronic security keys. Mobile payment systems generate a one-time, random digital code during transactions, instead of transmitting 16-digit credit card numbers. Apple Pay uses tokens. Visa launched the service on Apple (AAPL) devices in October, 2014.Visa has also been working with online retailers. With the Visa Checkout Service, transactions are also tokenized.With car-based commerce, Visa expects applications such as automatic payment for parking spaces, gas at service stations or fast-food at drive-in establishments.Visa first talked about car commerce at the WMC in 2015 and followed up Monday with the Honda deal.“Eliminating the need for drivers to take tickets or check out at pay boxes is a giant step toward a frictionless experience and a big win for drivers,” said Aashish Dalal, CEO of ParkWhiz, in a release.

Over a fifth of all U.S. Starbucks transactions are made via mobile.""We just can’t wait to introduce Mobile Order and Pay in China because it’s going to be a runaway success,"" said CEO Howard Schultz during the company's Q1 earnings call last month.Starbucks should also continue to gain market share, said Kalinowski, with the expectation that the coffee titan can reach 56% share by 2020, up from 54.1% in 2014.For Kalinowski, Starbucks ranks among three restaurant companies excelling in their technology efforts, alongside Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA).

The stock gained 37% during that period, a nice gain in a tough year.Realistically, when would've a disciplined investor have sold?There were several defensible exits.The first was a profit-taking zone when profit hit 20% to 25%, or 51.90 on April 24 (2) and 54.06 on June 18 (3). The 20% level was reached on a gap up in heavy volume, which makes it unlikely that the investor would've sold.A gap-up is a clear bullish signal.So those determined to sell in the 20% to 25% profit zone more likely exited at the 25% level.Individual investors who decided to hold past the 20% to 25% profit-taking zone found additional gains. Up to the July 22 close, Starbucks reached a profit level of 31%. Then the stock began showing some peculiar daily action.The stock staged a sharp negative reversal July 24 (4). After rising almost 5%, Starbucks reversed to a 1% gain that day. Volume was heavy, and the stock closed near the bottom of the day's range.Additional negative reversals came on July 27, July 31, Aug. 3 and Aug. 5.How many warning signals does an investor need? Often, the difference between top investors and average investors is how quickly they recognize a change in a stock's character. Starbucks slashed 3% lower Aug. 6 in volume 45% above average ahead of the Aug. 24 flash crash.

459,SBUX,"If there is a rule that managers of huge mutual funds can't outperform the stock market, Will Danoff is an exception. He's proved that size hasn't robbed him of the flexibility needed to build positions in stocks before they make their big moves up.The $102 billion Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) stood as the fifth largest U.S. stock mutual fund tracked by Morningstar Inc. as of Jan. 31. And its performance ranked in the top 1% of its large-cap growth peers over the 15 years through Feb. 29.Its 12.65% average annual return since Will Danoff took the helm on Sept. 17, 1990, ranked in the top 5% of its direct rivals. In that time span, those competitors averaged an 8.42% annual gain. The S&P 500 racked up a 9.64% average annual return.Contrafund is also the largest among the 370 Fidelity funds that Morningstar follows.The fund garners an A+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, which means that its performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.Contrafund fell 1.18% last month, a little worse than the average U.S. diversified stocks fund’s 0.15% decline.Danoff also runs or co-runs three additional portfolios, with $30.5 billion in assets.Danoff, 55 years old, talked with IBD from his office in Boston about how he invests.IBD: If you don't mind me saying so, Will, you sound like you have a cold. How are you doing?Danoff: No, I don't have a cold. It's just been a long earnings season. It's like this every quarter.IBD: Does your fund's large size make it harder to do any of the things you want to?Danoff: Yeah, Paul, managing a $100 billion-plus fund is harder than managing a smaller fund.I can't move as quickly as smaller funds, so one has to play to (one’s) strengths. The strength of having about $110 billion is that I really have to think about the three-to-five-year opportunity in stocks I own. So I want stocks that are what I call best-of-breed.They're well-positioned in their industry, doing something special, have strong brands (and) excellent management teams and excellent business models.Over the years, I've found that companies that generate a lot of free cash flow have more options when in an uncertain environment. And when management owns a chunk of stock and thinks like owners, they tend to do the right thing at the right time in the cycle.Every industry is cyclical, so you really have to try to identify smart management teams that are experienced and passionate about their industry.And over time, that's one of the huge lessons I've learned. Being big, I have to think long-term. I do have to think about whether I trust the management team, whether I fully appreciate all of the risks in a particular stock in a particular industry. So being thoughtful before jumping in has reduced my turnover over time. And I think it's increased the quality of the companies I own.IBD: How do some of your holdings fit this overall thesis?Danoff: If I look at my top 10, you see Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), Wells Fargo (WFC), Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Visa (V), Starbucks (SBUX), Nike (NKE). These are well-run companies that are relatively easy to understand the value proposition of, the kinds of companies that consumers rate very highly in terms of value derived.If you ask your kids, ""Do you like Google?"" I think they would say, ""Yes,"" and they would use it all the time and derive a lot of value from Google.Nike: the same sort of thing. Thirteen-year-old boys love it whether that's (based on their) perception or reality (about whether they should). And as an investor, you layer on that this is a good business.Facebook: the core app and the core Instagram app are the two most popular apps on smartphones in terms of what people actually do on smartphones. And as more eyeballs spend more time on Facebook and Instagram, Facebook should be able to monetize those eyeballs.And Starbucks: they're so far ahead of other restaurants and cafes in developing mobile order and pay and pickup. They doing well overseas, especially in Asia. And they're improving their food and improving their average paycheck. And they bought Teavana. The development of that is a built-in option. I like optionality.As we've talked about in the past, Paul, when your customers are deriving a lot of value, most likely the customer in the U.S. is going to be similar to the customer in Europe and Asia. Google is excluded from China, but we've talked about Nike. That 13-year-old boy in China is probably just like the 13-year-old in the U.S. and Europe. They want to wear the same sneaker that LeBron James or Roger Federer is wearing.That model enables Nike to sell (products) at a healthy margin. That's good for shareholders of Nike.The world has become competitive. The world has opened. But if you have products that people want, you will have a bigger market.Technology has proliferated and made companies more efficient. Nike can sell over the world, but now it has only one computer system to worry about. They don't need to replicate a big infrastructure all over the world. That's made corporate America and big corporations worldwide more profitable than in the past.Top-line opportunities are much greater. And the expenses associated with attacking that opportunity grow less than revenues do. So that's a very good thing.IBD: So size helps you more than hurts you?Danoff: Size allows me to work with a world-class research team. Fidelity has an army of smart, motivated analysts all over the world who are looking around for best-of-breed companies, companies that are gaining market share, companies that are doing something different.I also have access to very smart (non-Fidelity) people on Wall Street, analysts who help us with their ideas.And I have access to companies' management teams. They know that we are or could be their largest shareholder. So (they talk with us, and) we can dig a little deeper than the typical company. We can see someone other than the CFO and CEO. What I've found over time is that a deep management team that is aligned with the same strategy and the same incentives makes a very powerful organization.IBD: You don't mind being forced to focus more on bigger companies?Danoff: The issue becomes that if three investors visit a company and (one investor) is managing $1 billion and the second is managing $5 billion, I can't make that company a large position in my fund instantly. I must slowly build that position.Bigger positions in my fund are about $5 billion. But you can't just call your broker and say, ""I want $5 billion of Nike or Starbucks."" It takes time to build a position to that size. So this is a poker game, Paul. And in poker, you're not sure when you're first dealt your cards whether you've got a winning hand. If you have two aces and another player and I are showing a two or a three, you might bet a little more than if the hand were different.But if you get a third ace, you might bet more. That's worked well for me.IBD: How hard is it to go through a down market like the one we've had since late 2015?Danoff: One advantage of being a big fund is that I see a shareholder probably every day. If I'm having a bad week like (some recent ones), some shareholder says, ""Hey, I've been in the fund 20 years. Thank you."" And I realize he's right. The point isn't whether you win every second or every day. You've got to win over time instead.That means avoiding big mistakes. That means trying to capitalize when you have a lot of conviction in particular stocks.Right now, whatever's out of favor -- oil -- I can continue to talk to our oil analyst and say, ""Let's talk to someone smart who's been around a long time, talk to a survivor, and see what they say. Let's talk with an executive who has made you money over time. Hopefully, they will help you understand what's happening right now and how to play this situation.""If you're managing just $1 billion, you don't have that breadth of (access). The more companies that you talk to, the better that you do.IBD: Are you buying bargains amid the pullback?Danoff: What am I doing as the market pulls back? I've been talking to a lot of companies. (Danoff began to look at his calendar and recite the industries whose executives he has recently spoken with.) Biotech, gold, retailers, media, autos, refining, defense, restaurants, more media, paper, steel, housing related, media again, tech, autos, pharma, semiconductors. That's this week.I've probably talked with seven, eight, nine -- 35 companies this week. It's been busy because a lot of companies are reporting earnings. But that's what you've got to do.What I've done over time is concentrate on earnings-per-share growth. Every industry is cyclical. You've got to find companies that are going to grow over time, names that you want to buy on a market pullback like we've seen.IBD: So you're bargain hunting?Danoff: Yeah, that's what's happened. I'm trying to upgrade the quality of my portfolio in this downturn. That's worked for me. Other people have different strategies. But when the whole market sells off 10% or 15%, I'm looking to buy the very best companies that have pulled back with the market.IBD: What's the hardest part of your job when overall economic growth slows a lot?Danoff: We've seen a slowdown in earnings forecasts. That's what the market is struggling with. But hopefully good stock pickers like my colleagues at Fidelity will be able to find companies that, despite the sluggish economic environment, are going to grow.When perceived growth slows, with an expensive stock you get the double whammy of earnings growth slowing and the P-E (ratio) declining. That's what you want to avoid. So we're trying to be certain of our earnings growth projections on individual companies. It's not easy.IBD: Jason Weiner (manager of $1.2 billion Fidelity Growth Discovery Fund (FDSVX) and its advisor-sold clone $2.6 billion Advisor Equity Growth Fund (EPGAX)) once told me you were one of his mentors. Who has been your mentor?Danoff: Joel Tillinghast (manager of three funds, including $38 billion Low-Priced Stock (FLPSX)) and I started when Peter Lynch (current Fidelity vice chairman, who managed now-$14 billion Fidelity Magellan (FMAGX) from May 1977 to May 1990), Bruce Johnstone (former manager of three funds) and George Vanderheiden (former manager of five funds) were the leading fund managers.Peter is an exceptional human being. He's a really hard worker, smart, a great individual. He's a walking encyclopedia of corporate knowledge and business history.I made some rookie mistakes. Because he was so experienced, he let it roll.I was a retail analyst. I would walk into some manager's office and say, ""Let me tell you about this great stock story."" But if the manager was focused on something else, he (would not be interested). But Peter would say, ""That sounds interesting. Let's call them."" Or ""Let me know the next time you're calling them so I can hear it. Can I come with you for a visit?""Peter was all about when in doubt, call the company. Find out the facts. When you have facts, you can make better decisions.IBD: Do you still talk with him?Danoff: Oh, yes. Peter comes around. He's a great sounding board. I'd say probably twice a year, Joel and I and probably a few others reach out to him and say, ""Let's have lunch.""His message is still the same: Stay on the offensive. When you find a good idea, that gives you perspective on something else you own.That's where Peter is outstanding. He says, ""Keep flexible. Keep looking forward. Call companies.""He has a tremendous ability to keep looking in areas where I might have had limited interest. Peter is great at keeping an open mind, staying on the offensive. George was like this as well.

460,SBUX,"Wall Street is settling into the first earnings season of the calendar year, and after the long weekend, IBD 50 stocks Starbucks (SBUX) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) are set to disclose quarterly results.Coffee giant Starbucks, which reports Q1 results after the close on Thursday, is expected to experience 12.5% earnings growth to 45 cents per share on a 12.3% revenue rise to $5.39 billion, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. The growth would mark a slowdown from previous quarters.The company remains bullish about expanding market share in China, even as that country experiences market volatility and less rapid economic growth. Starbucks plans to open 500 stores there in 2016, with the goal of opening 3,400 stores in China by 2019. CEO Howard Schultz says that China has the potential to become the company's biggest market.While other retailers flounder, Starbucks has remained a bright spot. Shares fell 1.7% in the stock market Friday but gained 2.4% for the week despite a broader market dip. It is currently trading below its 50-day line.Intuitive Surgical also reports Thursday. The robotic surgery leader released preliminary Q4 results on Wednesday saying that revenue climbed 12% to $677 million, vs. Wall Street views for 8.8% growth to $653.5 million.Analysts expect earnings to rise 1.6% to $5 a share. The company said that it expects procedures using its da Vinci system to grow 9%-12% in 2016.Shares edged up 0.3% Friday and 3.9% for the week.New Oriental Education and Technology (EDU) is expected to break even when it reports Q2 earnings on Tuesday, down from 2 cents a share last year, while revenue is seen rising 14.6% to $270.6 million. Shares edged down 0.3% for the week.Its IBD 50 counterpart, TAL Education (XRS), experienced a sharper decline of 4.8% for the week that ended Jan. 15.

The stock received a downgrade to neutral from Credit Suisse earlier in the month, while American Airlines (AAL) received an upgrade to outperform from the firm.Shares were essentially flat on Friday but stumbled 2.3% for the week.A fellow carrier that currently occupies a seat at the IBD 50 table, Hawaiian Holdings (HA), announces Q4 earnings on Jan. 26. Wall Street anticipates EPS to more than double to 84 cents and revenue to dip 1.3% to $567.2 million.Shares rose 1.5% Friday but dipped 0.9% by week's end.Follow Elaine Low on Twitter @IBD_ELow.RELATED:What To Do When A Good Stock Threatens A Round TripIntuitive Surgical Tries Breakout, Gets Turned AwayIntuitive Surgical Up, St. Jude Down On Prelim Q4Starbucks To Expand; China May Become Biggest MarketWill 2016 Be As Good As It Gets For Airlines?

464,SBUX,"Starbucks' (SBUX) fiscal-first-quarter results are expected to decelerate slightly from previous quarters, but same-store sales are seen getting a boost from the coffee titan's mobile aggressiveness, among other factors.When the Seattle-based java giant reports after the close on Thursday, analysts expect earnings of 45 cents a share, a 12.5% year-over-year climb but a slowdown from preceding quarters' growth of 16% and 24%.Revenue is seen growing 12.3% to $5.39 billion. The company has logged 18% sales growth for the last three consecutive quarters.Domestic same-store sales will likely come in ahead of estimates, says one analyst.""Our recent checks of 5% of U.S. locations indicate Americas comp growth in the high-single digits, above current 7.7% consensus,"" wrote Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan in a Tuesday note. He expects 8%-9% comp growth.While that would be in line with 8% growth in Q4 and Q3 and a 7% gain in Q2, it would mark significant acceleration from the prior year's 5% increase.Shares closed up 1% in the stock market today.On Tuesday, the company announced the launch of a partnership between Spotify and over 7,500 U.S. Starbucks locations, in which customers can use the Starbucks mobile app to identify what music is playing in the store and listen to Starbucks-curated songs on the streaming music service.The move aligns with Starbucks' greater mobile strategy as it continues to push its smartphone app, which is tied to a sizable loyalty program. My Starbucks Rewards had over 20 million members as of its Q4 report in late October, and mobile payments accounted for 21% of all U.S. transactions.""Given the continued benefit from differentiated food offerings, mobile ordering, delivery, continued compelling beverage (limited time only offerings), throughput, and loyalty and mobile adoption initiatives, we believe Americas comp growth is poised for sustained mid- to high-single-digit comp momentum,"" said Setyan.Starbucks' mobile-order-and-pay feature, which allows customers to order ahead of arriving at the store, remains a ""potential game changer"" as it gains users, he wrote.Meanwhile, Starbucks continues to introduce new food and drink offerings, including alcoholic beverages in some stores.Additionally, Starbucks has been optimistic about market expansion into China, with plans to open 500 stores there this year, and a broader goal of operating 3,400 stores in the country by 2019.

468,SBUX,"McDonald's (MCD) has imposed ultra-high rents and restrictive contracts on its European franchisees, ultimately harming their competitive position by forcing them to pass on costs to consumers, according to an antitrust complaint filed with the European Commission by three Italian consumer groups.The complaint could add to the fast-food chain's difficulties in the European Union. Authorities last month began investigating whether the company received illegal tax breaks in Luxembourg.McDonald's shares closed down 0.6% in the stock market today.The European Commission said it would review the consumer groups' complaint, which alleges that McDonald's made franchisees pay rents that were 10 times normal market value. It also says one- to two-year noncompete clauses in franchise contracts prevent franchisees from changing brands.McDonald's stood by its franchise system, saying in a statement that it ""helped create the best business opportunities for our franchisees and the best overall experience for our customers.""If the company were found in violation of the law, it could face penalties of as much as 10% of its international revenue, according to the Wall Street Journal.EU lawmakers in recent months have tried to crack down on multinationals who have allegedly used their size — and some creative accounting — to work out favorable tax arrangements.In October, the EU ordered Starbucks (SBUX) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) to pay unpaid taxes after ruling that their tax arrangements in the Netherlands and Luxembourg, respectively, broke the law. Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) have also been in the Continent's cross hairs over their tax deals there.Apple shares rose 1.5% Tuesday. Amazon was flat. Starbucks climbed 2.8%, and Fiat Chrysler was up nearly 1%.And on Monday, the European Commission determined that tax exemptions, which had given dozens of multinationals some $760 million in tax breaks on Belgian profits, ran afoul of the law.AB InBev (BUD) and BP (BP) were among the companies that benefited, the Journal reported.Follow Bill Peters on Twitter @IBD_BPeters.

It was the second straight quarter of accelerating EPS growth.Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which is on IBD's Leaderboard, opened lower Tuesday but is holding above a 260.28 buy point of a double-bottom base, which it cleared Friday.The stock is well within buy range, only 2% above its entry.

471,SBUX,"ICE benefits from volatile markets like the current one because its exchanges feature derivatives that many investors buy and sell to offset market gyration risks. Earnings are due Thursday before the open. Q4 EPS is seen rising 16% to $3.01 a share.Ross Stores (ROST) also slipped early Tuesday, but it is still in a buy range, less than 2% past a 55.74 cup-with-handle buy point, which it cleared on Friday in slightly above-average volume. Volume accelerated on Monday.Ross Stores is the biggest U.S. discount apparel chain. The stock held up better than most in the market's recent pullback. The retailer's three-year profit growth rate is 12%. EPS for fiscal Q3 rose 13%, beating Wall Street estimates. The company reiterated its fiscal Q4 guidance, but said it faces challenges due to ""uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment.""Starbucks (SBUX) stayed above its 50-day moving average early Tuesday after gapping above the line Friday in heavy volume.For now, the stock is working on a flat base with a 64.10 buy point. Signs of institutional support at the 200-day line emerged on Jan. 20 when the stock closed in the upper half of its intraday range in heavy volume after a soft start.The specialty coffee retailer runs roughly 23,000 stores in 70 countries. CEO Howard Schultz recently told the Wall Street Journal that the chain plans to open 500 stores annually over the next five years in China. Schultz thinks China could become his largest market.On Jan. 21, Starbucks reported that fiscal Q1 EPS rose 15% to 46 cents on a 12% sales increase to $5.37 billion. Views were for 45 cents on $5.39 billion.

472,SBUX,"Domino’s Pizza is grabbing a bigger piece of the pie by investing in digital technology to dominate the world's pizza-delivery market.That’s right: world. Domino's (DPZ) opened its 1,000th store in India earlier this month. Last year, it entered Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Georgia, Portugal, Belarus and -- wait for it -- Italy.Fast food pizza ... in Italy? Domino's Chief Executive J. Patrick Doyle told IBD that, yes, Italy invented pizza, but he’s not intimidated.""We think there are some things we bring to the market that are terrific for customers,” Doyle said. That's true even in pizza’s holy land, he says.Domino’s does delivery like no neighborhood pizza shop. By boosting its e-commerce commitment, it’s expanding its franchise network and gaining market share in the U.S. and around the globe. It now has roughly 5,000 stores here and another 7,000 outside the U.S.“Domino’s tries to innovate in everything they do -- especially with technology and engagement with the brand -- you’re not going to find that with most other restaurant brands,” Keybanc Capital Markets analyst Christopher O’Cull told IBD. “I think it’s the best-managed company in the restaurant industry. Starbucks (SBUX) is up there, but Domino’s is one of the top two or three.”O’Cull rates the stock a hold, due to its run-up in valuation, though he says he's had a buy rating on it for a long time.Domino’s pizza chain competitors include Papa John’s (PZZA), Pizza Hut (part of Yum Brands (YUM)) and privately held Little Caesars.Domino’s has been “investing heavily for five years” in technology, said Doyle. Today, Domino’s customers can place orders on a computer or laptop, mobile phone app, through texts, on a smartwatch, from a car through Ford’s (F) onboard computer, using a Samsung Smart TV, and via Amazon’s (AMZN) new Echo, a voice command device. They can also tweet orders via their Twitter (TWTR) accounts, which advertises orders to their followers, an extra benefit for Domino’s.“They’re really at the forefront of pushing mobile technology and positioned to benefit from it,” said Alton Stump, a Longbow Research LLC analyst who spoke with IBD. Stump has a buy rating on the stock.Doyle says that in the U.S., more than 50% of Domino’s customers now order via digital platforms. Other chains are investing in technology too, but it’s hard for local pizza shops to fund such projects. Thus, Domino’s is “really gaining share over those local players,” said Stump.Last October, Domino’s also came out with ""DXP,"" a specially designed pizza delivery vehicle. It’s a version of the Chevrolet Spark that includes a warming oven, GPS navigation and a “puddle light” that projects the Domino’s logo on the ground. Doyle says that so far, 100 DXP’s are purveying pizzas in the U.S.In 2015's third quarter ended Sept. 6, Domino’s reported total revenue rose $38 million or 8.5% to $484.7 million from $446.6 million in the year-earlier period. Net income was up 6.2% to $37.8 million. And diluted earnings per share rose 4% to 67 cents from 63 cents in the year-earlier quarter.The company’s turnaround began back in 2010. Doyle came aboard and he knew the first issue Domino’s had to tackle was the quality of its pizza. The company’s test kitchen got to work and reformulated and improved its product. Then it launched an unusual rebranding campaign, blatantly telling the market that its pizza had been lousy, but it had made dramatic changes.Customers listened and growth took off. Domestic same-store sales for the third quarter of 2015 grew 10.5%, while international same-store sales rose 7.7%, the 87th consecutive quarter of growth in that category. Investors responded. Back on Jan. 1, 2010, Domino's closed at $11.30 a share. It hit an all-time intraday high of $119.73 a share on July 13, 2015. And despite a wobbly stock market, the stock still hovers around $115.“Domino’s has been able to put up really strong same-store sales,” Jefferies analyst Alexander Slagle told IBD. He rates the stock a hold and says that “franchisees have seen 50% growth in profits since 2009.”And Domino’s has just been through the equivalent of its Black Friday: Super Bowl Sunday.“It is often our biggest day of the year, for sure the busiest two hours of the year,” said Doyle. From an hour before kickoff until halftime ends, “we have an order coming in almost every minute at every store, and those orders have typically more than one pizza.” Domino’s also sells chicken, hot sandwiches, bread, desserts and sodas.The profitability of Domino’s franchises makes them an attractive investment. Doyle says that in the U.S., adjusted per-store earnings are “north of $120,000, and the average cost of building a store is $300,000.” Thus a franchisee can “make back the investment in less than three years.”Domino’s had 4,722 U.S. franchises as of mid-June and 376 company-owned stores. The vast majority of the U.S. franchise owners came up through the Domino’s ranks, says Doyle.“We’re an entrepreneurial factory here,” he said.Outside the U.S., in India and elsewhere, Domino’s leverages a Master Franchisee model to expand rapidly.“(Through) Master Franchisees, who sell locations to smaller franchisees, Domino’s can generate a lot of growth and cash with a very asset-light model,” said O’Cull. Then Domino’s can “focus on just managing the brand.”Where will Domino’s deliver next? Africa is poised for pizza growth, says Doyle.“We’re in Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa,” he said. “I’m excited about Sub-Saharan Africa. Everyone has a cell phone … and (countries) are going to cell-phone-based payment systems.”He added: “Gross domestic product per capita (in Africa) has been growing for the past decade, and you have a growing middle class. We think (Africa offers) opportunities.”
"
473,SBUX,"Legendary trader Jesse Livermore once said, “The only way you get a real education in the market is to invest cash, track your trade and study your mistakes.” There simply is no substitute for going back and reviewing your past trades to see what you did right — and wrong. But to do that, you need to have the game tape. You need to have good records that show what was going on — and what you were thinking — at the time you bought or sold a stock.So when you buy or sell any stock this year, first take these two simple steps. That will keep you from making impulsive decisions and create a record of your trades that you can then use to improve your stock-picking skills.Step 1: Print Charts For Each Buy & SellEvery time you buy or sell a stock, print out both the daily and weekly charts. That way you’ll have a permanent record of what the price and volume action looked like on that day.You can print the charts on paper and keep them in a binder, or create PDF files instead and store them on your computer. Either way, the key is to make sure you have the info.You can also print out or make a PDF of the IBD Stock Checkup for that company. It’s an easy way to get a quick, permanent snapshot of all the pass, neutral or fail ratings your stock had at the time. It also shows you the current industry group ranking, and lets you know what stage the overall market was in: confirmed uptrend, uptrend under pressure or market in correction.Step 2: Write Down Your Reasons For The TradeTake a minute to write down why you are buying or selling a stock. For example, if it’s a buy, draw the base pattern and note the ideal buy point (which may be different from your own actual purchase price).Jot down additional reasons why you decided to invest: accelerating earnings growth, heavy buying by institutional investors, a rising Relative Strength line, etc.For example, when Starbucks (SBUX) broke out of a flat base in January 2015, the pieces of stock-picking puzzle had fallen into place. The market was in an uptrend...the coffee giant had just posted  strong earnings report...and the stock cleared a flat base in heavy volume.From there, Starbucks rose over 50% in the next nine months.If you’re selling a stock, note the reasons for that trade. Maybe the stock reached the 20% - 25% profit-taking range. Maybe the overall market was weakening and you wanted to protect a smaller profit. Or perhaps you sold to cut your losses at no more than 8%.Even though your brokerage service has the basic info, also write down your buy or sell price, and the number of shares bought or sold. And if this trade is part of a larger position in the same stock, note how many shares you now own, in total, and your average purchase price.For any buy or sell, you can also write down any other thoughts you have about the company and the overall market. The more detail, the better. That way, when you do a post-analysis later, you’ll have a clear record of what you were thinking when you made the trade.Can You Justify This Trade? In addition to giving you the game tape to help you do a profitable post-analysis, here’s another reason to start keeping these kinds of records: It helps prevent you from making impulsive trades.Knowing that you have to literally write down why you bought or sold a stock will help make sure you think through the trade before you make it. That simple step can save you from making the wrong moves for the wrong reasons.Excerpt from the IBDextra Newsletter

475,SBUX,"Amazon (AMZN), Nike (NKE), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) are among the companies based in the 10 hottest housing markets for 2016, according to a report from online real-estate research company Zillow this week.Topping the list is Denver, followed by Seattle and Dallas-Fort Worth. Other places that made the list are Utah markets Ogden and Salt Lake City, along with Omaha, Neb., and Boise, Idaho.To determine which markets would be hot, Zillow looked at home value appreciation, low unemployment rates and strong income growth.""Trendy tech centers like San Francisco, Seattle and Denver hogged the spotlight in 2015,"" noted Zillow Chief Economist Svenja Gudell in the report. ""But this year, the markets that shine brightest will be those that manage to strike a good balance between strong income growth, low unemployment and solid home value appreciation. As the job market continues to hum and opportunity becomes more widespread, the best housing markets are no longer limited to the coasts or one-industry tech towns.""Omaha, home of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, among others, has the lowest unemployment rate of the 10 hottest markets — just 2.9%, the report noted.Denver, home of Chipotle and numerous other big companies, saw housing values rise 16% in 2015, and Zillow forecasts that they will rise another 5% in 2016. Denver's recent income growth is 1.1%, and the unemployment rate is 3.1%, the report noted.Zillow also forecasts that Portland, Ore., which is close to power brand Nike's home base of Beaverton, will see a 5% rise in home values this year vs. a year earlier. Income growth is 1%, while the unemployment rate is 5%.Seattle, home of Amazon and Starbucks (SBUX), to name a couple, is estimated to enjoy 5.4% home value appreciation this year. Income growth is 1.1%, while the unemployment rate is 4.5%, Zillow noted.Zillow forecasts that Dallas-Fort Worth, home of such companies as Exxon Mobil (XOM) and AT&T (T), will see an estimated home appreciation of 5.6% this year vs. a year earlier. Income growth in Dallas-Fort Worth is 1.1%, while the unemployment rate is 4%.Richmond, Va., home of tobacco giantAltria Group (MO), is expected to see home price appreciation of 2.2% vs. a year earlier. Its recent income growth is 1.2%, while its unemployment rate is 4.4%.""A strong and diverse economy is the driving force behind Richmond's high income growth, with government, finance, education and manufacturing jobs robust in the area and expected to continue in 2016,"" the report noted.Boise, Ogden, Salt Lake City and Sacramento, Calif., all have high forecast home value appreciation, the report said. Homes are expected to appreciate an average of about 5% over the next year.

476,SBUX,"The first step to making money in 2016 is to review your 2015 trades. A look back on your buy and sell decisions — and the reasons behind them — will often reveal one or two adjustments you can make to significantly improve your future results.So here are five basic questions you can ask to do a profitable post-analysis.Tip: See two ways to keep better records of your trades to make doing a post-analysis easy, quick and effective.1.   Was the overall market in a confirmed uptrend when you bought the stock?History shows 3 of 4 stocks move in the same direction as the general market.  To keep the odds in your favor, only buy when the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are in an uptrend. (See which of three stages the market is in right now.)2015 was a tough year for growth stock investors and offered many reminders of why it’s important to stay in sync with the market.While several stocks, such as Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL), Stamps.com (STMP) and others, made nice gains for the year, it wasn’t an easy ride. Due to the volatile, rollercoaster nature of the 2015 stock market, investors who stayed cautious - i.e., took profits and cut losses sooner -  generally ended up with better overall results.2. Did the stock pass a buying checklist?The top-performing stocks tend to display seven common characteristics just before they launch their biggest moves.Did your stock share those same traits when you bought shares?While there are no guarantees in the market, you can significantly help reduce your risk and increase your rewards by staying disciplined and picky. Focus on stocks that have exceptional earnings and sales growth, an industry-leading product or service, strong demand among mutual fund managers and other key characteristics. (See what traits to look for in a winning stock.)3: Was the stock near a proper buy point?Finding stocks with great earnings and other fundamentals is just one part of the puzzle.  You also have to understand that there is a right — and wrong — time to buy a stock. You can tell the difference by looking at a chart.Start by staying patient and waiting for the stock to form and break out of a proper chart pattern in unusually heavy volume. That tells you fund managers and other large investors are stepping in to buy. And it’s their large-volume buying power that fuels a stock’s upward move.So go back and see what the chart looked like at the time of your purchase. If the stock was not coming out of a sound pattern at the time, make a note to yourself to stay patient and wait for proper setups in 2016.For an example of what to look for, see how Starbucks (SBUX) broke out of a flat base in January. It jumped 9% on the week of the breakout in volume 68% higher than normal. From there, the coffee king rose as much as 51% by October.4: Did you follow your sell rules?There are essentially 2 types of selling, and both are essential: Defensive selling to cut your losses, and offensive selling to lock in your gains.Here’s the cardinal rule of defensive selling: If a stock drops 7% - 8% below what you paid for it, sell. No questions asked. That’s the simplest way to make sure you protect your capital and avoid large losses.Knowing when to take your profits can be a little trickier, but here’s a good rule to follow: In most cases, lock in your gains when a stock rises 20% - 25% from a proper buy point.Here’s why: After a stock climbs that much, it will typically pull back and form a new base. So instead of sitting through that pullback, you can lock in your gains and see if the stock goes on to form and break out of another base.When reviewing your trades, if you find you’re getting some good gains, but then giving much of it back, start applying this rule. It can help you proactively lock in more of your profits.5: Did you weed out your laggards and focus your money on your winners?You want your biggest winners to also be your biggest positions.To help make that happen, sell stocks that are not performing well, and move that cash into stocks that are.Don’t make the mistake of holding your losers, while selling your winners. You don’t build a great baseball team by trading away your best players and holding on to your benchwarmers. And that’s not how you build a great portfolio either.Small Changes Can Lead To Big GainsWhile reviewing your trades, chances are you’ll keep coming across the same one or two issues. Maybe you buy too soon or sell too late. Or maybe you weren’t staying in sync with the general market.Whatever your particular situation is, making a couple of small adjustments can lead to significantly better returns in 2016 and beyond.Excerpt from the IBDextra Newsletter

A 5% plunge within 10 minutes triggered a 15-minute halt, followed by an even sharper decline.The Shanghai Composite fell 7.3% and the Shenzhen lost 8.4%.U.S. stock futures sank overnight after the major indexes fell more than 1% Wednesday.China's sell-off is bad news for U.S.-traded stocks such as Alibaba (BABA), JD.com (JD) and NetEase (NTES). NetEase already is down more than 4% this week, with Alibaba falling almost 5% and JD.com nearly 8%.It's also not a good sign for U.S. companies with significant China exposure, such as Apple (AAPL) and Starbucks (SBUX)The onshore yuan fell 0.6% to the lowest since 2011 as China's central bank cut its reference rate for an eighth straight day, with Thursday's 0.5% cut the biggest since August's devaluation. The offshore yuan, which had widened to a record discount vs. the onshore yuan, rallied 0.5% Wednesday.A weaker currency should help exporters, who are competing against other countries with much-cheaper yen, won, euros and more. But it could hurt foreign currency borrowers and suggests that China's economy is in far worse shape than official data indicate.In the short run at least, a cheaper yuan could hurt U.S. companies the rely on China.

480,SBUX,"Warmer weather, online shopping and heavy discounting have made retail a tough space to be in right now, but at least five stocks on the IBD 50 list are bucking the trends.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) has held off Amazon (AMZN) better than its retail peers, partly because of the experiential nature of buying beauty products and partly because of the dedicated customer loyalty that companies like Ulta and Sephora have built, according to analysts.Notably, specialty beauty retailers have the benefit of not being in a seasonal industry, say experts, which means that they are not subject to the promotional pressures that department stores and clothing retailers face.Ulta, a member of IBD's Retail-Specialty industry group, has risen 35% over the last year. The group has collectively lost 6%.Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA) have also fared well amid a struggling retail backdrop as ""athleisure"" continues to make its way out of the gym and into offices and even major fashion houses.Health and wellness trends -- think juice bars, cleanses and the much-anticipated SoulCycle (SCYL) IPO -- have worked in both companies' favor, and Under Armour's push into wearable technology has inserted itself into the tech conversation alongside Fitbit (FIT) and the Apple (AAPL) Watch.Nike's stock has climbed 31% and Under Armour has grown 17% since Jan. 29, 2015. Shares of the Apparel-Shoes and Relating Manufacturing group and Apparel-Clothing Manufacturing have risen 5% and declined 15%, respectively.Both companies are not the only two activewear companies on the list. Foot Locker (FL), which carries both Nike and Under Armour in its stores, also made the cut.Starbucks (SBUX), for its part, isn't afraid of a slowdown in China. The java giant is expanding assertively into the country, with a goal of operating 3,400 stores there by 2019.Starbucks missed Q1 revenue and guided Q2 below consensus estimates when it reported on Jan. 21, but CEO Howard Schultz expressed enthusiasm about bringing Starbucks' mobile-order-and-pay feature to Chinese consumers. He anticipates that it will be a ""runaway success.""Domestically, its mobile efforts have yielded success, with over a fifth of all U.S. transactions now made via smartphone.Starbucks shares have grown 36% while IBD's Retail-Restaurants group has tumbled 15%.Ross Stores (ROST) doesn't even have an e-commerce presence, but the chain of off-price stores has been labeled ""un-Amazonable"" by Cowen analyst Oliver Chen, citing the appeal of the ""treasure hunt"" experience that compels shoppers to visit brick-and-mortar stores.Amid a shift to off-price retailers, analysts agree that there's room for square-footage growth as Ross expands into other regions stateside.Ross Stores' stock has risen 20% over the last year, compared to the Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories group, which has declined 14%.A number of other consumer stocks abound on the IBD 50 list, including energy-drink maker Monster Beverage (MNST), discounters Five Below (FIVE) and Dollar General (DG), and baby-clothing merchant Carter's (CRI).RELATED:Why Under Armour’s Market Share May Be Bigger Than You ThinkThink We’re In A Recession?

481,SBUX,"Major averages faded badly and were near session lows in late-afternoon trading Monday, held hostage by the oil market once again.Stocks started to bleed around the time that oil started its descent. The Nasdaq fell 0.1%, a far cry from an early 1.7% intraday gain. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial fell by the same amount.Volume on the NYSE was tracking slightly higher than Monday's levels in the stock market today. Nasdaq volume was lower.In economic news, the latest data from the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index showed that Americans are still modestly pessimistic about the economy.Once again, oil- and gas-related groups were among the worst performers as oil reversed lower. Benchmark WTI crude oil was down 3.5% to $30.30 a barrel.Among the day's gainers, Chuy's (CHUY) broke out in heavy volume, rising 5%. It's still in a buy range from a 35.86 buy point, but the market hasn't been kind to technical breakouts in recent weeks. Chuy's is also on the speculative side, with an average daily dollar volume of around $10 million.Stamps.com (STMP) gained nearly 4%. After an orderly pullback, it's finding support at its 10-week moving average for the first time after gapping out of a base in November.Solid performers in the Nasdaq 100 included Starbucks (SBUX). Shares rose nearly 2% on news that the company plans to open 500 new stores in China every year for the next five years. Also in the Nasdaq 100, Ross Stores (ROST) was off session highs but still rose around 2%. It's just below a 55.74 handle buy point. The retailer is also an IBD 50 component.Nasdaq 100 bellwethers Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) benefited from positive comments from Credit Suisse earlier in the session but, just like the broad market, gave back early gains.On the downside, Alcoa (AA) cratered 9.5%.

Dow futures steered more than 200 points above fair market value, up 1.3%. S&P 500 futures gained 1.5%. Nasdaq 100 futures were ahead 1.9%.The stock market today took some early strength from oil prices, which perked back above $31 a barrel, up more than 5% as a broad range of factors — including potential eurozone stimulus, terrorist attacks on Libyan oil sites, and cold weather in Europe and the U.S. — lifted prices and appeared to scare some short sellers out of their positions.Economic news starts with a preliminary estimate on January manufacturing from researcher Markit at 9:45 a.m. ET.

Emergency generator maker Generac (GNRC) jumped 5%, and Home Depot (HD) rose more than 1%.Dow stocks were generally positive. Nike (NKE) and Chevron (CVX) topped the index with 3% gains in premarket trade. American Express (AXP) slipped lowest, down 5%, although Q4 earnings and revenue declined less than expected.General Electric (GE) and Boeing (BA) both traded slightly lower. GE reported quarter results. Boeing said late Thursday it will take a Q4 charge.Oil- and energy-related plays posted most of the big gains on the S&P 500: Williams (WMB) swept up 7%; Marathon Oil (MRO) and Freeport-McMoran (FCX) vaulted 6% each.Irish drugmaker Mallinckrodt (MNK) lapped the pack with a 9% gain. The stock is consolidating below its 10- and 40-week moving averages within a deep, five-month correction.Constellation Brands (STZ) muscled up nearly 4%. The stock remains extended after an August breakout and multiple touchbacks to its 10-week moving average.Starbucks (SBUX) slipped almost 3% before the open after reporting its fiscal Q1 results late Thursday.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) added 2% after its Q4 conference call, also after Thursday's close. The move implied an opening back above the 556.70 buy point around which the stock has been caught up, but premarket moves do not always carry through to regular trade.LinkedIn (LNKD) hammered out a 4% premarket gain. The professional networking site ended Thursday with a 3.3% loss this week after falling in seven of the past eight weeks.Overseas, rising oil prices and possible stimulus action in Europe helped boost China's markets. The Shanghai Composite rose 1.3% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 2.9%. That left Shanghai up a half-point and the Hang Seng down 2.3% for the week.In Japan, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 bolted 5.9% higher, its biggest move in five months. Rising oil prices, a weakening yen and possible new stimulus measures in Europe were all factors. So was speculation that the Bank of Japan could adopt fresh monetary aid action at its meeting next week, according to Reuters.

And they expect to find better investment opportunities outside the U.S.Eighty-nine of 2015's 100 top-performing U.S. diversified stock funds as of Dec. 30, excluding funds that do a lot of shorting, borrowing and hedging, were large-cap growth, according to Morningstar Inc.That's because investors, reacting to stock market news, believed that only big, strong companies had the resources to eke out gains.See The Top Stock Funds of 2015""Growth was harder to come by,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist of Ameriprise Financial. ""In that environment, investors gravitate to stocks where they presume growth will be more visible. And they're willing to pay a premium for growth when it's hard to find.""Reflecting that, large-cap growth mutual funds led the market, advancing 4.57% through Dec. 30 .The top-performing fund was $853 million Polen Growth Institutional , which was up 16% for the year.Technology was the fund's top sector, with a 35% weighting. Consumer cyclicals were next, at 29%.Top holdings included Nike (NKE), Visa (V), Starbucks (SBUX) and Alphabet (GOOGL).Among all U.S. stock funds, health/biotechnology and technology funds led major sectors, gaining 9% and 6% respectively.It was also clear which segments of the market fared worst: the oil patch and commodities.Energy funds lost 28%. Natural resources funds were off 22%.And with U.S. diversified stock funds overall losing ground, down 0.5%, precious metals funds were down 23%, among the worst performing sector funds.The Outlook For 2016What's murkier, of course, is the future. What will work best for your financial plan in 2016?""Essentially, it will be a repeat of 2015,"" said Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro for Fidelity Investments.But Timmer cautions that the market is not pricing-in the risk that the price of oil will stay low, which would delay a rebound in the energy sector.""So I expect an overall market gain of less than 7%,"" he said.In the slow-growth environment that Timmer anticipates, growth stocks should outperform value, he says.He expects financials, especially banks, to benefit from margin expansion in the wake of the Fed's rate hike.Consumer discretionary should do well, but China's slowdown will pinch luxury retailers, he adds.And consumer staples, which tend to be higher-yielding than growth sectors, ""will get hurt because the bond market will generate more attractive yields"" as rates rise, Timmer said.Darrell Riley, a vice president of T. Rowe Price and a member of the team that runs the firm's multi-asset investment strategies, says that his group is overweight in non-U.S. equities, in particular European, Japanese and selected emerging markets.""Europe and Japan are at earlier stages in the economic recovery than the U.S. is,"" he said.In addition to room to run, Europe and Japan are ramping up their respective easy-money stimulus programs, which should buoy their stock markets.Also, he prefers developed markets like the U.K., Japan and Sweden that benefit from lower commodity prices, in contrast to resources producers like Canada, Australia and Norway.He has a similar take on emerging markets: Riley likes markets that benefit from low commodity prices, not countries that depend on exporting resources. ""The Philippines and India benefit from lower energy prices, for example,"" he said.U.S. Bright SpotsDespite Joy's overall preference for European and Japanese stocks vs. U.S. equities, he does like the outlook for segments of the U.S. market.That includes parts of health care, especially portions that are focused on U.S. revenues. European and Japanese economies are poised for faster growth but should also be more volatile.Also, U.S. health care spending continues to rise, the U.S. population is aging and the industry keeps producing new therapies, Joy says.In consumer stocks, he likes U.S. automakers and the housing sector. ""Department stores will continue to struggle,"" he said.Why? ""Consumers are exhibiting more discipline in the wake of the financial crisis,"" he said. ""Auto and housing spending are solid, but department store sales are soft and the savings rate is trending upward.""And he likes the outlook for financials and the technology sector.""Financial stocks should benefit from higher interest rates and a modestly growing economy, and are not significantly impacted by a stronger dollar and weakness overseas,"" Joy said. ""Tech will also benefit from modest capital spending growth, and growth in mobile payments, data storage, cloud computing, and Internet traffic.""In fixed income, he prefers investment-grade corporates over Treasuries, because of superior yield.He also likes higher-quality high yield. ""We're staying in the BB- and B-rated range,"" he said. Amid uncertain economic growth and rising rates, which make borrowing more expensive, he only wants to bet on financially stronger companies.A key question for the global economy, Joy says, is whether China can avoid a hard landing by stimulating its economy with easy money, while the U.S. continues to strengthen as it tightens money.His global bottom line: If either economic giant's policies hurt the other's, global GDP growth is likely to suffer. No one wins, Joy says.

489,SBUX,"Given the market's volatility and descent into a correction, few leading stocks are holding above their buy points following recent breakouts. But Blackhawk Network (HAWK) is doing just that, though it has also faced some downward pressure. The stock is in buy range from a 45.88 cup-with-handle buy point cleared Nov. 23. Volume on that day was below average and didn't pick up until two sessions later, when the stock marked a new high. It rose as much as 5.5% from the entry before easing.Shares undercut the buy point intraday twice last week, but they closed above the entry on both days, a sign of support. The stock remains above the buy point and in buy range — though keep in mind that all purchases are riskier now with the market in correction.Blackhawk ran into some trouble after an early October breakout past a 46.23 buy point. It climbed above the entry for three consecutive sessions but closed below it each time, before pulling back to form the latest cup-with-handle pattern. Its Relative Strength line is in new high ground, a bullish sign and a rarity in the current market environment.An Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B and up-down volume ratio of 1.3, higher than the neutral 1.0 level, point to recent demand for shares. Shareholders as of the third quarter included highly regarded mutual funds CGM Focus FundC and Fidelity Contrafund .

The stock has more than doubled in price from its $23 a share offering and is up about 20% for the year, well ahead of the Nasdaq's 4% year-to-date gain.Blackhawk provides prepaid gift cards, as well as related prepaid products and payment services. Its gift cards are sold in grocery chains, malls and other venues. It also makes gift cards for major retailers, including Amazon (AMZN), Best Buy (BBY), Home Depot (HD) and Starbucks (SBUX). Gift cards were the No. 1 requested holiday gift by consumers, according to a November National Retail Federation survey.Blackhawk has been growing via acquisitions.

508,SBUX,"The practice of shopping for high-end makeup has not yet gone the way of book-buying and succumbed to the weight of Amazon's (AMZN) can't-beat-'em discounts and free shipping — contrary to the hand-wringing over the 2013 launch of the e-tailer's luxury beauty portal.In fact, specialty beauty retail leaders Ulta (ULTA) and Sephora are doing just fine. More than fine, if anything.Ulta shares hit a new intraday high of 188.48 on Dec. 17, and Sephora continues to shine for luxury parent LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMUY).So what elusive ""It"" qualities does the specialty beauty industry have that make customers immune to the charms of Amazon?For one thing, it offers something that the pure-play e-commerce giant, by definition, can't offer: a satisfying in-store experience.""It's like a good glass of wine,"" said Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink. ""You can find yourself in your own space for a period of time. That 15 minutes is glorious.""Vanity FairWalking into a Sephora is a bit like wandering backstage at a Victoria's Secret runway show — it's all flattering vanity lighting and glossy makeup kits and the tacit promise of looking like Gisele Bundchen upon exit. Ulta comes equipped with full-service salons and Benefit Brow Bars in-store for those seeking the full makeover-montage experience.""Ulta and Sephora provide a place to play,"" said Wissink, adding that there's an ""intangible benefit"" of being in the store.A Beautiful EducationPlus, the ""test-and-trial"" nature of beauty products prompts first-time buyers to head to a brick-and-mortar shop instead of ordering online, she said.Testers and samples abound at beauty stores. Buying items like lipstick and eye shadow on the Internet is a tricky business — what appears to be one shade in one's browser can be very different from what appears in one's mailbox.There is, however, potential for Amazon to steal share when it comes to replenishing products.""In theory, (cosmetics) should be the perfect online business,"" Nomura analyst Simeon Siegel told IBD. ""On the other hand, even repeat customers will walk into these stores and find new products all the time. There will always be an element of discovery with cosmetics.""YouTube and beauty bloggers offer a fairly well-rounded education online, for those willing to dedicate the time to it. But deciphering the latest makeup application techniques — think contouring or strobing — can be a little overwhelming.Ulta, which sells both mass brands like Revlon and L'Oreal, in addition to luxury brands like Urban Decay and Smashbox, offers makeup consultations at no charge. Sephora holds free makeup classes that conveniently allow shoppers some time to buy newfound products before the store officially opens for the day.No Seasons — Or DiscountsBeauty has the added buffer of not being a seasonal industry, say analysts, which keeps prices in check. Makeup colors keep changing, but the products generally remain the same. A facial cleanser knows no season. An acne cream is a year-round need.Contrast this to the season-dependent world of apparel, where fast-fashion retailers are pressuring traditional department stores and clothing boutiques.""There aren't four seasons; there are 52,"" said Siegel of the apparel space. When a product doesn't work, it goes on sale, and retailers have to hurry to push out inventory, creating what he calls a ""circular promotional death spiral.""Plus, prestige beauty brands have managed to keep pricing and distribution on a fairly short leash as they keep product availability exclusive to certain merchants.Still, there's nothing technically stopping Amazon from offering deals on Estee Lauder (EL) and other higher-end names.""My understanding is that luxury brands that are hesitant to partner with Amazon are concerned that this pricing consistency may be at risk,"" said NPD Group analyst Karen Grant.But even brands that don't have an official presence on Amazon are often sold via third-party sellers on the site. And counterfeit beauty products are a documented problem on Amazon, Alibaba (BABA), eBay (EBAY) and elsewhere.""(Brands) are deluding themselves into thinking Amazon doesn't have a large impact on their business because they're not officially distributed"" on the platform, said Scott Galloway, founder of research firm L2 and a professor of marketing at NYU Stern School of Business.Amazon's luxury beauty portal has been a ""disappointment"" for the company so far, he said, but it ""shows no signs of giving up"" — outspending Sephora and Macy's (M) on beauty-related search-engine keywords on Alphabet 's (GOOGL) Google.And as the online retailer continues its assertive march toward retail domination, it holds a bargaining chip or two. Brands that choose to distribute via the platform can enlist its cooperation in erasing third-party listings, according to Galloway, who said once Burberry and Calvin Klein gave Amazon the go-ahead to sell a ""small number"" of their fragrance products, ""unofficial SKUs (stock-keeping units)dropped dramatically.""""The implicit message from Amazon is: Work with us, or we will (mess) with you,"" he said.No Specifics On RelationshipsAmazon would not provide specifics on its relationships with brands, but a spokeswoman told IBD that Amazon's luxury beauty segment is one its ""fastest-growing categories,"" and its online storefront offerings have resulted in ""more brands want(ing) to join Amazon's Luxury Beauty store.""For now, however, specialty beauty retailers are holding their own, especially as they build out their e-commerce reach.Ulta's online sales soared 56.3% in Q3 as it crushed estimates and boosted guidance. Sephora's e-commerce sales are ""rapidly increasing in all regions,"" according to LVMH's latest earnings report. Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen wrote that ""Sephora is best-in-class with regard to their mobile/online execution."" Plus, it has been gaining share ""in all its markets,"" with same-store revenue growth ""particularly strong,"" said LVMH.And never discount the appeal of being part of an exclusive backstage club.Ulta's loyalty-program membership has been accelerating, quarter over quarter, reaching 17 million active members. By comparison, Starbucks' (SBUX) much-lauded rewards program has over 20 million members globally.Amenities ProvidedThe things that Amazon does so well — offering a wide variety and free shipping — are amenities Ulta and Sephora already provide. Members of both Ultamate Rewards and Beauty Insider (Sephora's loyalty program) have the added benefit of redeeming points for products.Over the summer, Sephora shoppers had the chance to redeem ""Epic Rewards,"" ranging from a foursome of full-size Givenchy lipsticks for 1,000 points to a trip to Paris to visit Lancome for 10,000 points. (Notably, the rewards promotion faced scrutiny for selling out items too quickly, prompting a social media backlash.)Perks like that have so far been enough to steer beauty buyers away from the less lavish space of an online megamart. Cowen analysts wrote Thursday that beauty is one area with an ""un-Amazon-able"" retail proposition, and that offering a differentiated shopping experience and/or selling a product with an ""emotional component"" offers a viable path to compete against Amazon.""Loyalty programs are extremely compelling,"" said NPD's Grant. ""It's like candy.""""(They) incentivize you to shop and to shop with them, and they do an excellent job of it,"" she said. ""Price isn't everything. But they also offer a good price and good service and all of the rest.""

551,SBUX,"Fast Casual Off IPO Menu?
"
552,SBUX,"The challenge facing fast-casual restaurant stocks as they enter 2016 is figuring out how to recapture some of the magic that pushed the group to record highs during the first half of 2015. That won't be easy, considering the current mindset of many investors.
"
553,SBUX,"It's also unlikely that you'll see many new issues stepping in to give the fast-casual group a shot of adrenaline in 2016, says Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson.
"
554,SBUX,"""You're seeing harder market conditions for a lot of IPOs — not just for restaurants, but also for tech firms and other industries,"" Anderson told IBD.
"
555,SBUX,"Meanwhile, slowing same-restaurant sales growth has hit most fast-casual chains of late. Zoe's, Fiesta, El Pollo Loco and Habit logged decelerating comp growth during the first three quarters of the year. While Panera saw a year-over-year improvement in comp growth during each of its first three quarters of 2015, that came off easy comparisons with 2014, when gains were minimal.
"
556,SBUX,"Chipotle Stock Turns Toxic
"
557,SBUX,"The real trouble came for Chipotle, whose comparable restaurant sales growth decelerated in each of the first three quarters of 2015, all down sharply from 2014. During the second quarter, Chipotle's comp growth fell to 4.3% from 17.3% the prior year. Q3 comps grew 2.6% vs. 19.8% a year earlier.
"
558,SBUX,"Things got even worse earlier this month when Chipotle, in the throes of its E. coli crisis, warned that fourth-quarter same-store sales won't increase but instead will fall by 8% to 11%. The company also said that earnings per share will end up at $2.45 to $2.85 a share, well off the $4.09 that analysts had expected.
"
559,SBUX,"Amid new E. coli issues, Chipotle's stock fell 8.5% in the last week, 35% off its August peak.
"
560,SBUX,"The best performer among fast-casual stocks has been Shake Shack, which had its initial public offering in January. Its year-over-year comps grew 11.7% during the first quarter, 12.9% during the second, and 17.1% during the third. Even so, Shake Shack shares are down 58% from their high of 96.75, set in May.
"
561,SBUX,"All of the fast-casual players have faced rising competition — not just from each other, but also from privately held chains and small local and regional operations looking to hop on the fast-casual bandwagon.
"
562,SBUX,"""It's a very fragmented industry,"" Cowen's Charles said. ""There's not just one player you have to worry about, but many different types of players.""
"
563,SBUX,"Competition doesn't come just from other fast-casual chains, either. Darren Tristano, president of Technomic, a research and consulting firm, points out that some companies face increased competition from chains that don't fall under the fast-casual umbrella.
"
564,SBUX,"Panera Faces Bakery Rivals
"
565,SBUX,"""There are a number of menu categories that are starting to see some maturity, including bakery cafes,"" Tristano told IBD. ""Panera is the leader in the bakery cafe segment. It's not only seeing competition from other fast-casual chains, but also from Starbucks and drive-through chains like Dunkin' Brands (DNKN). A lot of fast-food players are really pushing the convenience of drive-through.""
"
566,SBUX,"Companies that focus on more narrow niches should fare better. Tristano points to Zoe's, which specializes in healthier Mediterranean dishes.
"
567,SBUX,"""That's a good category where there's not a lot of competition and plenty of room to grow,"" Tristano said.
"
568,SBUX,"Chipotle Pain, Qdoba Gain?
"
569,SBUX,"The Mexican category is ""still dominated by Chipotle,"" Tristano said, though he added that Qdoba Mexican Eats, owned by Jack in the Box (JACK), is continuing to grow in a lot of markets where it overlaps with Chipotle.
"
570,SBUX,"The wild card is how Chipotle's E. coli woes will affect the competitive landscape. The outbreak has spread across nine states and sickened more than 50 customers. The chain also came under question when 150 people who ate at a Boston Chipotle contracted norovirus.
"
571,SBUX,"Chipotle's woes could open up opportunities for other fast-casual chains to pick up market share.
"
572,SBUX,"""For every loser, there will be a winner, and Panera will be the real winner at the start,"" said Maxim's Anderson. ""Even though Panera is not a direct competitor to Chipotle in terms of Mexican food, they have a lot of geographic overlap and share the same types of customer.""
"
573,SBUX,"Anderson recently made Zoe's a top pick for 2016, saying that its compelling menu, demographic targets and solid economics all support continued expansion.
"
574,SBUX,"Tristano is among those who reckon that Chipotle can bounce back and re-establish itself as a force in the restaurant industry.
"
575,SBUX,"""Fortunately for Chipotle and other brands, consumers tend to be very forgiving,"" he said. ""The Chipotle brand has a very strong customer following, and because of that they are still in a great posi tion. Of course, they still have to ensure quality and safety, which they are very focused on right now.""
"
576,SBUX,"Even though fast-casual chains have stumbled of late, many industry watchers still have a positive outlook on the sector.
"
577,SBUX,"Sit-Down Still No Standout
"
578,SBUX,"Tristano forecasts 7.1% unit growth for fast-casual chains in 2016, in contrast to around 1% for full-service eateries.
"
579,SBUX,"""There's still a market-share shift away from more traditional full-service/fast-food categories and toward fast-casual,"" Tristano said.
"
580,SBUX,"That's mainly because consumers continue to gravitate toward what fast-casual chains offer, according to analyst Charles.

584,SBUX,"Here's a pop quiz for small-cap ETF investors: What do Texas homebuilder LGI Homes (LGIH), Mississippi egg producer Cal-Maine Foods (CALM) and California's AMN Healthcare Services (AHS) have in common?They're rock stars among smaller companies and within the elite IBD 50 stock list. Each recently posted triple-digit quarterly earnings growth, far outpacing big-cap market leaders such as Alphabet (GOOGL), Starbucks (SBUX) and Facebook (FB).LGI Homes and AMN have gold-plated IBD Composite Ratings too.Small-cap ETFs such as iShares Core S&P Small-Cap (IJR) slumbered in the second and third quarters, but they've perked right up in the past eight weeks.Investors are leery of large caps in a more risk-on environment, according to S&P Capital IQ.The financial data firm sees reasons to be bullish on small caps in the year ahead. ""We believe small-cap stocks will experience above-average earnings growth in 2016,"" says Todd Rosenbluth, Capital IQ's director of ETF research.That's true across sectors, with small caps overall expected to grow earnings 59% year-over-year vs. 8% for large caps, he added.Historical precedent works in their favor too. Small caps have significantly outperformed large caps in presidential election years since 1980, Capital IQ analysts say.IJR tracks the cap-weighted S&P SmallCap 600 index. The ETF holds AMN Healthcare and Cal-Maine, as well as top-notch medical stock Cambrex (CBM) and airline firm Hawaiian Holdings (HA).IJR is up 2.7% this month and 2.8% so far in 2015. By comparison, iShares Core S&P 500 (IVV), holding large caps, has risen 0.4% and 3.1% in those periods.Why To Invest In Small CapsIn the past 15 years, IJR produced an average annual 10% gain vs. 5% for IVV. That performance has helped small-cap stocks find their way into investors' ETF strategies.But individual small-cap stocks can be risky and volatile. So a diversified ETF approach can make for a sound investing strategy.Smaller caps ""are still emerging companies with more opportunities to succeed (as well as fail),"" Rosenbluth cautioned.Having at least a small stake in small-cap ETFs can make sense. Small caps are a small part of the total stock market, after all.Plus, the small-cap market segment is more sensitive to changes in monetary policy and could be hurt by a Federal Reserve rate hike, says Russ Koesterich, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist.""When rates are rising, large-cap stocks outperform roughly 65% of the time,"" he wrote Nov. 8, citing Bloomberg data.ETFs give investors diverse ways to invest in small-cap stocks.IJR ""offers very pure small-cap exposure"" compared with Vanguard Small Cap (VB) or iShares Russell 2000 (IWM), according to Morningstar. VB has more midcaps, IWM more microcaps.PowerShares DWA SmallCap Momentum (DWAS) takes a ""smart beta"" approach. It aims to outperform market-cap indexes with an alternative indexing method.It selects roughly 200 stocks using relative price trends. It's up 4.7% in November and 2.4% year to date.A greater weighting to health care stocks has worked in DWAS' favor, Rosenbluth said.""Through Nov. 27, the S&P Small Cap 600 health care index was up 8.6% vs. 2.9% for the broader small-cap index,"" he added.

600,SBUX,"When it comes to holiday wish lists, gift cards remain a top choice among consumers this season. That's music to the ears of prepaid card and payments company Blackhawk Network (HAWK).""Blackhawk is one of the big providers of gift cards and related services,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria told Investor's Business Daily. ""It helps content providers like retailers that want to sell outside their premises on grocery store shelves.""Blackhawk uses proprietary technology to offer a broad range of prepaid gift, telecom and debit cards, in physical and electronic forms, as well as related prepaid products and payment services. The company supports the management and distribution of these products in a number of different retail, digital and incentive channels.It sells to consumers through its retail distribution network, whether in stores or on websites. Blackhawk also provides services, software and prepaid products to business clients for loyalty, incentive and reward programs, using its own sales force, as well as third-party resellers.23 CountriesBlackhawk's retail distribution partners showcase gift cards on displays that Blackhawk manages. Outside the U.S., Blackhawk distributes to its non-U.S. partners in 23 countries via grocery stores and other retail channels.The company seems to be in the right place at the right time. Gift cards remained the most requested holiday gift by consumers in a November National Retail Federation survey. And a recent poll by Deloitte found redeemable cards are the No. 2 gift that shoppers plan to buy this holiday.Consumers showed just how popular gift cards are over the Thanksgiving/Black Friday weekend. Stored Value Solutions reports sales of gift cards in the U.S. were up 4% year over year for the four days of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, double 2014's year-over-year gain of 2%.Blackhawk distributes merchant-branded prepaid, or ""closed-loop,"" cards for companies such as Amazon (AMZN), Apple's (AAPL) iTunes, Macy's (M), Starbucks (SBUX)and Best Buy (BBY), in addition to other prepaid products like telecom cards, open-loop gift cards that can be redeemed anywhere, and reloadable prepaid debit cards.The company isn't content with that, however. Blackhawk has bulked up with a steady flow of acquisitions, new businesses and expanded distribution. That's helped it gain traction in its traditional space and in the ""incentive"" gift card arena, where customers are rewarded for loyalty.New DivisionMany of the buyouts are part of a new division, Blackhawk Engagement Solutions, that was formed this year.""Our strategy since inception has been to connect great brands to consumers through a productive global network,"" Teri Llach, Blackhawk's chief marketing officer, told IBD. ""Motivating employees via a prepaid card or gift card is a logical expansion going from a retail presence, where we're connecting brands to consumers, to corporate incentives, where we're connecting employers to employees.""The incentives and rewards business has proven to be the fastest-growing segment for Blackhawk and is driving its rapid expansion, says Wedbush's Luria.""Their biggest business, which is closed-loop gift cards, has slowed down to maybe single-digit growth,"" Luria said. ""To generate growth, they've been making acquisitions of these corporate incentives and rewards companies.""Showing In NumbersIt's showing up in the numbers. In the third quarter, Blackhawk's adjusted earnings grew 52% to 35 cents a share. Adjusted revenue jumped 54% to $193.4 million.Its incentives and rewards segment's adjusted operating revenues soared 392% from a year earlier, primarily due to the acquisition of Parago and the purchase of Achievers, Chief Executive Bill Tauscher said in a recent press release. Meanwhile, its U.S. retail segment grew adjusted operating revenue 21% in the third quarter. The international retail segment posted adjusted operating revenue growth of 27%.Luria says the corporate incentives and rewards business is more of a year-round concern, while the company's core gift card segment is seasonal, with all of its business generated in the fourth quarter around the holidays. Luria expects the company to continue to make acquisitions since its core business is slowing down.Latest PurchaseBlackhawk's latest buy came last month with the purchase of Didix Gifting & Promotions.Based in the Netherlands, Didix issues and markets leisure-themed gifts and promotions using a prepaid card that can be redeemed for services at multiple leisure outlets, including regional retailers, restaurants, cinemas and spas. It develops gifting and promotional products and brands across the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Germany and Belgium.Blackhawk's Llach says all of the company's acquisitions have been a ""significant driver of Blackhawk's earnings growth.""""We are in 23 countries, and we are looking at smart ways to expand where we see a market (opportunity),"" Llach said.Safeway SpinoffBlackhawk was spun off from privately held grocery giant Safeway in 2014. Safeway and other grocers such as Kroger (KR) are distribution partners.Other partners include Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW) and Staples (SPLS) as well as online giants Amazon and eBay (EBAY).Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Blackhawk's full-year 2015 earnings to rise 31% to $2.31 a share. They see a 14% gain in 2016 and an 11% increase in 2017.""As long as they continue to make acquisitions, they will grow (at a rapid) rate,"" said Luria. ""At some point it will be harder to do. If they run out of balance-sheet ability (because of too much debt), it will be harder for them to borrow more money to make acquisitions.""Blackhawk is part of IBD's Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processors industry group. It leads the group with a 99 IBD Composite Rating out of a possible 99.

642,SBUX,"In a perfect world, an individual investor would load up on a stock in one single transaction and then watch the profits grow. Rarely is investing that simple.More often, investors operate in an imperfect world. And in such a world, the add-on stock purchase can prove its worth.The proper add-on transaction reflects smart portfolio management.It involves a follow-up buy that is often smaller in total dollar terms than the initial buy. The add-on opportunity comes in several forms. The entry could emerge from a three-week tight pattern; a first or second trip to the 10-week moving average; or a new base.The new base (or base-on-base) is probably the only time when the second buy could be as big as the initial buy, especially if the base count is first or second stage.Here's why add-on buys are useful tools: Add-on opportunities emerge after a stock is working, reducing (but not nixing) risk of failure. Add-on buys let the investor bulk up a position. Sometimes conditions are unclear on the initial breakout. Maybe volume kicks in late. Maybe the market looks iffy. Maybe the stock has a few flaws.Any and all of these factors can cause the investor to downsize the initial buy. The add-on allows for some catch-up. Add-on buys that fail can indicate trouble in the stock or the market.Starbucks (SBUX) wasn't an obvious investing choice in the fall of 2014. Wasn't the stock kind of mature? Yes and no. Yes, growth that once rolled in at a 20% to 50% pace was now a 10% to 20% story. But no, Starbucks isn't a mature story in China, and the company is a leader in mobile orders.In late October to early November 2014, Starbucks sketched a narrow handle (best seen on a daily chart) in a first-stage base. The buy point was 77.77, or a split-adjusted 38.89.Things got tricky. Starbucks hesitated over the buy point in quiet volume. Breakout volume didn't come until Nov. 21, 2014, with the stock still in the 5% buy zone.The stock moved up modestly and then formed a base on base.

In April, a bounce off the 10-week line offered a second chance to add shares (2).An investor could've sold on an ugly reversal on July 24 (3) (best seen on the daily chart), locking in profits of 45%, 32% and 18% in the three separate buys

724,SBUX,"McDonald's (MCD) is in an interesting position as it approaches its annual investor/analyst day, with a rising share price but sluggish sales as it and other fast food giants face rising competition from fast casual chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Shake Shack (SHAK).
"
725,SBUX,"The investor day meeting is scheduled for Tuesday from 1 p.m to 5 p.m. Eastern. Investors should be pretty pleased with McDonald's stock performance of late. Its shares are up about 20% for the year and touched a new high of 113.96 on Oct. 26.
"
726,SBUX,"That rise comes despite five straight quarters of lower sales. Its Investor's Business Daily Composite Rating of 80 out of a possible 99 is not bad, but not nearly as strong as retail-restaurant group leaders like Starbucks (SBUX), which has a 94.
"
727,SBUX,"Even so, McDonald's has lately rewarded investors who watched the company's stock price go sideways for much of 2015. In a Monday morning note, RBC analyst David Palmer said McDonald's stock price has mainly been driven by gains in return on invested capital as well as earnings growth and earnings-per-share revisions.
"
728,SBUX,"EPS growth has been driven in part by same-store sales gains in international markets, he said.
"
729,SBUX,"On the downside, U.S. comps ""(have) dramatically slowed,"" Palmer noted. ""The company's struggles inside the U.S. have been the most troubling since declining same-store sales have been the result of significant share losses in an otherwise healthy U.S. fast food market in 2015.""
"
730,SBUX,"One thing Palmer will be looking for from Tuesday's meeting is whether certain company initiatives, including a bigger national advertising push, will drive higher sales of improved menu items such as the Quarter Pounder and Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Sandwich.
"
731,SBUX,"What else should investors look for from the gathering?
"
732,SBUX," Menu upgrades. Publicly traded changes such as Chipotle and Shake Shack, as well as privately held ones like In-N-Out Burger and Chic-fil-A, have raised the bar in terms of consumer expectations regarding fresh, quality ingredients.
"
733,SBUX,"McDonald's has made similar moves by working to improve its crispy and grilled chicken offerings, as well as the size and prep methods of its premium burgers, Palmer said. Look for the company to continue looking for ways to upgrade its offerings.
"
734,SBUX,"""Improving its core premium quality is going to be one way it can be more like the best-in-class burger/sandwich chains,"" Palmer said.
"
735,SBUX," Continued focus on breakfast. McDonald's recently took pains to announce plans to serve certain breakfast items throughout the day, including its popular Egg McMuffin sandwich.
"
736,SBUX,"The results so far have been positive, Palmer said. This means McDonald's might expand its all-day breakfast menu in coming months.
"
737,SBUX,"""We believe that McDonald's consumer base is broader at breakfast, so increased availability of breakfast items could inspire trial of other core items and day parts,"" Palmer said.
"
738,SBUX," Refranchising. At the investor/analyst day meeting, Palmer expects McDonald's ""to reiterate its previously communicated target to refranchise 3,500 stores, taking its ownership mix to 90% (from 81% today).""
"
739,SBUX,"It's also possible for McDonald's ""to go deeper on refranchising over time,"" Palmer said.
"

Its Investor's Business Daily Composite Rating of 80 out of a possible 99 is not bad, but not nearly as strong as retail-restaurant group leaders like Starbucks (SBUX), which has a 94.Even so, McDonald's has lately rewarded investors who watched the company's stock price go sideways for much of 2015. In a Monday morning note, RBC analyst David Palmer said McDonald's stock price has mainly been driven by gains in return on invested capital as well as earnings growth and earnings-per-share revisions.EPS growth has been driven in part by same-store sales gains in international markets, he said.On the downside, U.S. comps ""(have) dramatically slowed,"" Palmer noted. ""The company's struggles inside the U.S. have been the most troubling since declining same-store sales have been the result of significant share losses in an otherwise healthy U.S. fast food market in 2015.""One thing Palmer will be looking for from Tuesday's meeting is whether certain company initiatives, including a bigger national advertising push, will drive higher sales of improved menu items such as the Quarter Pounder and Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Sandwich.What else should investors look for from the gathering? Menu upgrades. Publicly traded changes such as Chipotle and Shake Shack, as well as privately held ones like In-N-Out Burger and Chic-fil-A, have raised the bar in terms of consumer expectations regarding fresh, quality ingredients.McDonald's has made similar moves by working to improve its crispy and grilled chicken offerings, as well as the size and prep methods of its premium burgers, Palmer said. Look for the company to continue looking for ways to upgrade its offerings.""Improving its core premium quality is going to be one way it can be more like the best-in-class burger/sandwich chains,"" Palmer said. Continued focus on breakfast. McDonald's recently took pains to announce plans to serve certain breakfast items throughout the day, including its popular Egg McMuffin sandwich.The results so far have been positive, Palmer said. This means McDonald's might expand its all-day breakfast menu in coming months.""We believe that McDonald's consumer base is broader at breakfast, so increased availability of breakfast items could inspire trial of other core items and day parts,"" Palmer said. Refranchising. At the investor/analyst day meeting, Palmer expects McDonald's ""to reiterate its previously communicated target to refranchise 3,500 stores, taking its ownership mix to 90% (from 81% today).""It's also possible for McDonald's ""to go deeper on refranchising over time,"" Palmer said.McDonald's shares fell 0.3% on the stock market today. Starbucks lost 1%, while Chipotle gave up 0.5%.Follow Vance Cariaga on Twitter: @IBD_VCariaga.

742,SBUX,"Whether the stock market is enjoying a big market uptrend or bobbing up and down like a buoy in the ocean, earnings growth still matters. The numerous positive surprises in earnings-per-share gains that large-cap companies have issued across the market in the past couple of weeks have certainly helped investors feel more bullish.Earnings research firm S&P Capital IQ sees third-quarter earnings dropping 3.8% among S&P 500 firms to $28.92 a share. That's a solid improvement from the 5% decline seen on Oct. 6. Plus, earnings would likely be up 4.5% for the S&P 500 minus the energy drag.A 4.5% overall gain might not be something to hoot and holler about. The mild increase reflects an economy that is still recovering at a modest pace. Revenue increases have been equally weak. In that light, today's IBD Big Cap 20 screen can be useful in guiding readers to the small minority of companies that are growing much faster.Do not forget that 25% EPS growth is the minimum threshold for IBD's CAN SLIM stock selection system. Consistent double-digit profit increases that fall short of that high bar are still acceptable for large, established companies.Growth deceleration, as seen in former Big Cap 20 component Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) (EPS up 52%, 47%, 27% and 11% in the past four quarters) can knock the stock's EPS Rating down and spark sell-offs.Today, Chipotle is still a great business with outstanding products, service and management. Yet for now, the hot sauce is missing from its quarterly numbers. Thus, the stock is no longer on the screen.Southwest Airlines (LUV) is coming off a thrilling ride, thrusting ahead 11.5% last week for its fourth straight up week.Some traders might say that the reason lies in the stock's ""cheap"" valuation, currently 14 times trailing 12-month earnings per share. But a bigger reason may be the company's outstanding job in delivering above-normal profit growth. Last week, the discount air carrier reported a 71% jump in Q3 earnings to 94 cents a share, slightly above the consensus view. That's on top of a 62% EPS increase in the year-earlier quarter.No matter what the industry, that is called ""crushing it."" Over the past six quarters, Southwest's EPS growth has averaged 102%.Alphabet (GOOGL) is rising fast after notching an 18% jump in Q3 profit, marking a third quarter of growth acceleration (3%, 5%, 17%, 18%).Cognizant Technology (CTSH) has rallied 51% since last October. On Monday, the stock was just above a 68.06 cup-with-handle entry point. Wall Street sees EPS up 15% to 76 cents a share in Q3. Over the past four quarters, the average gain was 15.3%. Earnings are due Nov. 4.Starbucks (SBUX) issues Q4 results late Thursday. Expect a 16% rise to 43 cents a share. Earnings have nearly quadrupled from fiscal 2008 (36 cents) to 2014 ($1.33).

766,SBUX,"Big-cap stocks are sometimes like the tortoise in the Aesop's fable ""The Tortoise and the Hare,"" lumbering along while rabbit-like growth stocks speed ahead. But sometimes, as in the fable, slow-and-steady really does win the race.Just look at the charts of Starbucks (SBUX), Reynolds American (RAI) and O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) in recent years.IBD's Big Cap 20 column, which appears in IBD every Tuesday, showcases stocks that have solid growth potential. They must also have a market capitalization of at least $15 billion.These behemoths often trade millions of shares a day and yet give investors a chance to reap significant capital gains with less volatility than small-cap growth stocks, which can fall much faster.Furthermore, big-cap stocks often pay dividends, which can significantly boost returns over time.Top big-cap stocks should still have fundamental and technical characteristics similar to the strongest growth stocks. High-quality big caps should show good profit and sales growth, rising mutual- and hedge-fund sponsorship column has featured Reynolds American more than a dozen times this year.Both IBD Big Cap 20 and the Dividend Leaders screen have showcased Starbucks, which has given shareholders stellar returns for those patient enough to sit through a number of bases formed over the years. The coffee seller has risen nearly 600% in the five years since it broke out past a 13.34 buy point (adjusted for a 2-for-1 split) of a cup-with-handle base in the week ended Oct. 15, 2010.At the time, Starbucks had Composite and Earnings Per Share Ratings of 87 out of 99. The annualized dividend of 64 cents a share produces a 1% yield; the long-term dividend growth rate is 24%. And with a 3-year Earnings Stability Factor of 1 on a scale of 0 (stable) to 99 (wild), investors stand a reasonable chance of continuing to reap steady stock price and dividend gains.A number of real estate investment trusts and utility stocks have also fared well in recent years, as low interest rates reduced their borrowing costs and made it easier for them to invest in new power plants or assets such as apartments and hospitals.DTE Energy (DTE) and Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI) have been a fixture in the Dividend Leaders and REIT Leaders screens.DTE, an electricity and natural gas supplier that also operates gas pipelines, has been a slow-but-steady gainer since it cleared a long consolidation with a 49.16 buy point in March 2011.The stock briefly stumbled, triggering the 8% loss rule during the steep summer correction that year. However, DTE formed a new base with a 52.92 buy point and broke out again for good in December. Through a Jan. 28, 2015, high of 92.27, it gained 74%. DTE's long-term dividend growth rate is 5% and its annual dividend of $2.92 a share currently yields 3.6%.The accompanying table shows some big caps and dividend plays that have performed well so far this year.

803,SBUX,"McDonald's (MCD) held its annual investor/analyst day Tuesday on the same day that thousands of fast-food workers nationwide held protests calling for higher pay, but the company chose to focus on its growth strategies.The meeting took place as McDonald's eyes ways to better compete against fast-food rivals such as Yum Brands (YUM) — owner of the KFC and Taco Bell chains — as well as fast-casual chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Panera Bread (PNRA) and Shake Shack (SHAK).During the first hour of the scheduled four-hour meeting, McDonald's Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook and other officials outlined several new goals that the company looks to achieve in coming months.""My priorities for McDonald's as a modern, progressive burger company are threefold: driving operational growth, creating brand excitement and enhancing financial value,"" Easterbrook said. ""We are taking bold, urgent action to reset the business and prepare the company for the next chapter of its history.""McDonald's constant-currency financial targets for 2016 include systemwide sales growth of 3% to 5% and operating income growth of 5% to 7%, excluding potential charges associated with its refranchising strategy and cost-saving initiatives.More Franchises, Fewer CostsIn terms of refranchising, the company raised its target to 4,000 restaurants from an earlier target of 3,500. This accelerates the pace and increases the global franchised percentage from the current 81% to about 93% by the end of 2018. McDonald's long-term goal is to become 95% franchised.McDonald's also raised its net annual general and administration cost-savings target to $500 million, most of which will be realized by the end of 2017. This reflects a $200 million increase from the previously announced target. The new target excludes the impact of foreign currency changes.In addition, Easterbrook said McDonald's has no plans to spin off its properties into real estate investment trusts, as had been speculated.""We have given REITs serious consideration, but we don't believe it serves best the interests of shareholders to pursue REITS at this time,"" he said.Easterbrook also mentioned plans to grow its store count internationally and improve McDonald's level of efficiency and customer service. It looks to add more restaurants along Germany's Autobahn, for example. Meanwhile, it is looking to change the way it toasts buns and grills meat.""We were not executing to our standards,"" he said. ""We were missing customer expectations in too many places. For too long we've asked customers to adapt to us. A big part of turning that around is giving customers more choice and always adapting to meet their needs.""Meanwhile, McDonald's board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 89 cents per share of common stock, payable on Dec. 15 to shareholders of record at the close of business on Dec. 1. This represents a 5% increase over its previous quarterly dividend.Protests NationwideWhile the meeting was taking place, fast-food workers in hundreds of U.S. cities held strikes and demonstrations calling for higher wages. It was the largest collection of rallies yet in a cause that seeks to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.The demonstrations began around dawn at McDonald's locations in New York, Boston, Philadelphia and other cities. The protests are expected to continue throughout the U.S. for the remainder of the day and culminate in a rally at the Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee.Earlier this year McDonald's said it would raise wages by more than 10% for workers at U.S. restaurants that it operates, and pay at least $1 more per hour than the local minimum wage for workers at U.S. restaurants.Financially, though, the company has been in a bit of a funk of late. It has logged five straight quarters of lower sales. Year-over-year earnings have declined in four of the last five quarters, though its most recent quarter showed a 28% EPS gain. That kind of performance compares unfavorably to other stocks in IBD's Retail-Restaurants group, including Starbucks (SBUX), Chipotle and Shake Shack.Even so, McDonald's stock price has been on a nice roll lately. Shares hit a fresh high of 113.96 on Oct. 26 and are up more than 10% since Oct. 21.Growth DriversIn a Monday morning note, RBC analyst David Palmer said McDonald's stock price has mainly been driven by gains in return on invested capital as well as recent earnings growth and earnings-per-share revisions.EPS growth has been driven in part by same-store sales gains in international markets, he said.On the downside, U.S. comps ""(have) dramatically slowed,"" Palmer noted. ""The company's struggles inside the U.S. have been the most troubling since declining same-store sales have been the result of significant share losses in an otherwise healthy U.S. fast food market in 2015.""On a more positive note, McDonald's recent decision to offer an all-day breakfast menu has been a success.""We believe that McDonald's consumer base is broader at breakfast, so increased availability of breakfast items could inspire trial of other core items and day parts,"" Palmer said.McDonald's shares rose 0.3% on the stock market today. Starbucks added 1.4%, while Chipotle climbed 3.2% and Yum lost 0.3%.Follow Vance Cariaga on Twitter: @IBD_VCariaga.

804,SBUX,"Best Mutual Funds 2015: October Performance ReportU.S. diversified stock mutual funds opened the fourth quarter with a strong 6.18% advance on average in October, according to Lipper Inc. It was a muscular rebound from September's 3.51% setback and August's 2.50% loss. The October gain was the best monthly showing for stock mutual funds' since October 2011's 12.57% gain.It reflected the broad market's strength. The S&P 500 concerning China's economic slowdown and currency devaluation.Investors gained 6.34% last month.Reflecting lower anxiety among investors globally, China region funds gained 8.93%, topping all world equity fund categories.October's top-performing U.S. diversified stock fund with more than $100 million in assets was $649 million Thrivent Large Cap Growth . It rose 11.64%.Amazon (AMZN), a top holding that's on IBD's Leaderboard, soared 22% last month. Starbucks (SBUX), another top holding that's on the Leaderboard, high-jumped 10%. Facebook (FB), a third top holding on the Leaderboard, climbed 13%.Back To CyclicalsOctober's climb was driven in large part by a rotation into downtrodden parts of the market.""There was a rotation out of secular growers — like retailers and consumer discretionary names — into names that work only when the economic cycle works,"" said Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro for Fidelity Investments.That helped energy, materials, mining and industrials, he said. Natural resources funds gained 9.86%.The only sector category that did better was global science/technology funds, with a 10.54% gain.Investors were also encouraged by the Fed's decision to hold off on its rate hike in the wake of China's devaluation of the yuan. A rate hike would have pulled investment dollars out of China, undercutting China's attempts at stabilizing its economy, Timmer says.""Money was already rotating out of secular growth names like retailers, health care and some tech names, into deep cyclicals, industrials, energy, materials emerging markets — anything tied to global growth,"" Timmer added. ""Money also came in (to cyclicals) from other areas, presumably from bonds or cash.""Bonds and bond mutual funds marched to the same drummer.Taxable bond funds edged up 0.94% last month. U.S. Treasury funds lost 0.48%. Tax-exempt bond funds inched up 0.40%.Investors decided that their fears in August and September of China's economy suffering a hard landing were overblown, said Tony Rodriguez, co-head of fixed income for Nuveen Asset Management. They also decided that summer fears that global central banks were not doing enough to pump liquidity into markets were not warranted, he added, noting markets rebounded in October.OutlookTimmer's outlook is upbeat. The Fed is listening to the market, ""and the market is telling the Fed not to raise rates,"" he said.Decent but not great corporate earnings, plus low inflationary pressure, also give the Fed room to delay a rate hike.""Chances are the Fed will hold off until 2016,"" he said .That will take upward pressure off the dollar, helping U.S. exports.Even the energy sector is poised to help sustain the rally. Earnings could be bottoming, ready to rise.""If oil stabilizes around $50 to $60 a barrel, then the earnings hits from Q2 and Q3 will work their way through (the market) and get back to trending north at about 5% annual growth,"" Timmer said.Santoro does not expect the market to repeat October's dramatic jump. ""It will be more of a grind higher,"" he said.Gains will be modest. Investors will be forced to pay up for the dwindling number of stocks that are able to post vigorous earnings growth, he says. He added, ""It will be a stock-picker's market.""

Alphabet is also developing self-driving cars and finding ways to extend human longevity.But while some analysts and investors have been hoping that the additional transparency might pressure Alphabet to rein in spending, Bank of America Merrill Lynch recently said that the new structure could actually result in an acceleration of spending, as the noncore units become freer to expand.Follow James DeTar on Twitter @IBD_JDeTar and Facebook.

"
850,SBUX,"Chipotle's base corrected just 18%, just a little more than the S&P 500. It was less than other group leaders such as Starbucks (SBUX) and Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), which formed bases at about the same time and corrected 21% and 26%, respectively. Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD), another top stock in the group, fell 35% in price.
"
851,SBUX,"A Great Base
"
852,SBUX,"Other bullish signs included an upside reversal at the bottom of Chipotle's base in the heaviest volume within the pattern (1). A proper downward-slanting handle was formed by a mild pullback in light volume.
"
853,SBUX,"The buy point was at 154.53, or 10 cents above the peak of the handle, which Chipotle cleared in healthy volume during the week ended Sept. 3. The stock went on to rise for 12 out of 13 weeks, hitting a new high of 262.77 in the week ended Dec. 3.
"
854,SBUX,"From there, Chipotle shaped a series of base-on-base patterns featuring mild corrections en route to a peak of 442.40 in the week ended April 13, 2012, before correcting to form a much deeper base. In the two years from the Sept. 1, 2010 breakout, Chipotle nearly tripled. Virtually all bases begin with a down week that's often followed by further declines before the stock finally gets its footing and moves higher. But some declines within a base are better than others.The best stocks usually shape bases that show mild corrections compared to their peers or to the market as a whole. That's because institutional-class funds will step in to buy stocks they believe have the potential to go higher, while allowing less promising stocks to wallow.During a market correction, the major indexes may fall anywhere from 5% to 25% from their 52-week highs, or even more. You can expect leading stocks fall one-and-a-half to two-and-a-half times that amount.So if the S&P 500 drops 10%, then it's normal for a top-rated stock to fall 15% to 25%. But what if it only falls 12% or 13% from its peak? That's a subtle sign of strength; institutions don't appear so eager to sell shares.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) was one of the stocks that held up relatively well as the market headed into a correction in late June to early July 2010. Chipotle was at the vanguard of a shift to so-called fast-casual restaurants that offer fresh, high-quality ingredients at a price above fast-food shops but below traditional sit-down diners.The company was posting strong profit growth at the time. It ranked 6th in the IBD 100, which in 2011 became the IBD 50.Investors no doubt recognized the company's underlying strengths, reflected by best-possible 99 Composite and Earnings Per Share ratings. The stock's 94 Relative Price Strength Rating meant that it was outperforming 94% off all listed companies.Such strong fundamental and technical indicators had propelled Chipotle to the top of the restaurant industry, which over the prior seven months had jumped more than 100 places to No. 30 out of the 197 groups tracked by IBD.Furthermore, the broader retail sector was ranked 4th out of 33 IBD industry sectors in early July as the stock began shaping a cup-with-handle base.Chipotle's base corrected just 18%, just a little more than the S&P 500.

897,SBUX,"Apple Pay is finally coming to Starbucks' U.S. stores by year-end, more than a year after Apple (AAPL) launched its mobile wallet. But coffee drinkers might stick with Starbucks' own app to earn points and perks through a loyalty program.Starbucks (SBUX) says its mobile-wallet app, introduced in 2010, has 16 million active users. Starbucks says it garners more than 19% of U.S. revenue from mobile payments.Apple's mobile-payments service will be available only at some Starbucks locations by year-end, but it's expected to reach 7,500 company-owned stores in 2016.Starbucks did not respond to an IBD request for information as to whether customers would earn loyalty points by using Apple Pay.Starbucks' mobile wallet, a barcode-based payment app, enables customers to pay with a swipe of their mobile phone.Apple Pay, introduced in September 2015 as part of Apple's iPhone 6 launch, uses near-field communications (NFC), a short-range wireless technology, to send data to payment readers. But analysts say only 20% or so of U.S. retail locations have NFC-equipped sales terminals.The lack of loyalty programs tied to Apple Pay has been one drawback to its slow start, analysts say. A Bloomberg report says Apple Pay accounts for only 1% of all retail transactions in the U.S.Apple in June said it would support some retailers' frequent-buyer/loyalty rewards cards. Checkout terminals need to be upgraded to NFC technology at some of those retailers.For retailers, it's better that Apple isn't offering its own incentives, such as letting iPhone users rack up iTunes store points, analysts say.Seattle-based Starbucks says its U.K. stores have been accepting Apple Pay for several months.Google's (GOOGL) mobile-payment app also has been slow to gain traction.

"
910,SBUX,"Last month and in Q3 overall, investors' anxiety was cooked up in China, with sour seasoning thrown in by the Federal Reserve.
"
911,SBUX,"""China was the No. 1 reason,"" said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist of Nuveen Asset Management. ""The Fed was No. 2. No. 3 was general concern about the pace of economic growth.""
"
912,SBUX,"Rich Weiss, senior portfolio manager of American Century's target-date One Choice Portfolios, said, ""China's growth is decelerating.""
"
913,SBUX,"No one outside the Chinese government knows the exact size and pace of the slowdown or whether it has bottomed, he said. ""That uncertainty makes the market nervous. And it creates more uncertainty about China's ability to manage the slowdown so it does not become worse than it is.""
"

921,SBUX,"Outlook
"
922,SBUX,"So what lies ahead?
"
923,SBUX,"Investors are looking for signs that China's slowdown has leveled off. Finding reliable signs is dicey.
"
924,SBUX,"Many investors believe that the Chinese government cooks its numbers for political reasons. ""Official data comes through a filter,"" said Weiss. ""And there are questions about their integrity. Is the government trying to make things look better than they might (really) be?""
"
925,SBUX,"To compensate, investors watch data that are harder for the government to fudge. ""Investors watch indicators of economic activity, such as electricity consumption, car sales and transportation industry data,"" Doll said.
"
926,SBUX,"Swanson keeps an eye on China's monthly retail sales data, which have been improving. He also watches the purchasing managers' index. ""If that keeps falling, it shows their economy is still getting worse,"" he said.
"
927,SBUX,"As for the U.S., despite the stock market's doldrums the economy is in good shape — for the moment.
"
928,SBUX,"Signs of improvement could emerge in mid-October as the third-quarter earnings report season starts. Investors are expecting mixed to good results, Doll says. Anything less would likely have a chilling effect on the market.
"
929,SBUX,"Swanson notes that the Q2 GDP estimate was revised upward in late September to a strong 3.9%.
"
930,SBUX,"""New housing starts have accelerated,"" he said. ""Retail personal consumption numbers show Americans making more money and spending it. Week by week, even through this whole period of (stock market) sell-offs, unemployment claims fell and the composite picture you get is that, so far, the U.S. hasn't missed a beat due to China.""
"
931,SBUX,"Investors generally expect the Fed to act in December, says Swanson. Investors will take additional foot dragging as a clue from the Fed that the economy is not strong enough to withstand a rate hike.
"
932,SBUX,"""The market wants (the Fed) to raise rates,"" he said. ""Like taking a patient off antibiotics, it will indicate that the patient is healthy.""
"
933,SBUX,"Mindful of macro events in China and the U.S., American Century's asset allocation team has begun adjusting its funds' holdings.
"
934,SBUX,"""We were generally 5% overweight toward growth funds and 5% underweight in value. We're now equal-weighted to 1% overweight growth,"" he said.
"
935,SBUX,"He added: ""We're not bracing for a recession. We haven't moved into utilities and financials, but we've taken some cyclical positions off the table.""
"
936,SBUX,"In sectors, his group has trimmed consumer discretionary to a market weight and trimmed its tech overweight.
"
937,SBUX,"In fixed income, his group has boosted its allocation to TIPS, especially shorter-term TIPS, ""directly in response to a rate-hike prospect,"" he said. ""We're replacing some diversified bonds with TIPS.""
"
938,SBUX,"He added: ""We've battened down the hatches.""
"
939,SBUX,"Sectors In Focus
"
940,SBUX,"Real estate funds topped sectors in September, gaining 2.22%, one of the few sectors up last month.
"
941,SBUX,"As the market sold off, many investors shifted money to REIT funds for the sake of dividend yield. Utility funds, seen by many investors as even more of a proxy for bonds, did not fare as well. They lost 1.09%.
"
942,SBUX,"Weiss likes U.S. defensive sectors best, given slowing global demand.
"
943,SBUX,"Global Market Outlook
"
944,SBUX,"The only happy story in foreign stock funds in September was the 1.35% gain by India region funds.
"
945,SBUX,"All others lost ground.
"
946,SBUX,"Latin American funds lost 6.64%, easily the worst laggards among foreign stock funds.
"
947,SBUX,"For Q3, no nation or region gained ground.
"
948,SBUX,"Latin American funds lost the most, 21.69%. That left them down 27.44% for the year.
"
949,SBUX,"China region funds were not far behind in the loss department in Q3, surrendering 21.18%.
"
950,SBUX,"""My view is that we've seen the worst of the decline,"" said Nuveen's Doll, referring to the overall market's tumble, much of which was made in China. ""But that doesn't mean the market is prepared yet to go back up.""
"
951,SBUX,"He added, ""The breakout to new highs probably won't be until next year.""
"

955,SBUX,"Weiss' team has cut foreign stock allocations ""across the board.""Best Mutual Funds 2015: Q3 Performance ReportU.S. diversified stock funds declined 3.51% in September, capping off an 8.15% decline for the third quarter overall, according to Lipper Inc. data.That was the third worst Q3 decline by the group in 10 years. It was the sixth worst decline by the group in any quarter the past decade.In a quarter marked by investor jitters, the top-performing U.S. diversified mutual funds were dedicated short-bias funds. They surged 16.47%.That same group also led in September, advancing 4.73%.Among just the major market-capitalization-and-style categories, large-cap growth did best in Q3 by losing the least for investors: 6.30%.Large-cap core funds were tops in September. Their 2.93% setback for the month was smaller than any other group's loss.International stock mutual funds slightly outperformed in September, losing 3.44%.But they lagged U.S. diversifieds in Q3, losing 11.24%.All in all, the market drubbing was a setback for any investor's retirement planning.Last month and in Q3 overall, investors' anxiety was cooked up in China, with sour seasoning thrown in by the Federal Reserve.""China was the No. 1 reason,"" said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist of Nuveen Asset Management. ""The Fed was No. 2. No. 3 was general concern about the pace of economic growth.""Rich Weiss, senior portfolio manager of American Century's target-date One Choice Portfolios, said, ""China's growth is decelerating.""No one outside the Chinese government knows the exact size and pace of the slowdown or whether it has bottomed, he said. ""That uncertainty makes the market nervous. And it creates more uncertainty about China's ability to manage the slowdown so it does not become worse than it is.""How much China's ills will affect America is what investors want to know. ""How bad can it get? In September the market was very frightened by that question,"" said Jim Swanson, MFS Investment Management's chief investment strategist.Vanguard 500 Index , tracking the broad market, lost 2.49% in September.Q3's top-performing nonleveraged U.S. diversified stock fund with more than $100 million in assets was $555 million Polen Growth Institutional.It edged up 0.7% despite losing 0.53% in September.A focused large-cap growth fund holding 22 names, it has top holdings such as Starbucks (SBUX), which has IBD's Composite Rating of 99; Nike (NKE), with a Comp Rating of 97; and O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), with a Comp Rating of 98.Composite Ratings range from 1-99, with 99 the best.The two best performing funds with more than $1.5 billion in assets year to date are $2.2 billion Janus Forty and $1.7 billion Fidelity Small Cap Growth , up 3.95% and 3.46%, respectively.OutlookSo what lies ahead?Investors are looking for signs that China's slowdown has leveled off. Finding reliable signs is dicey.Many investors believe that the Chinese government cooks its numbers for political reasons. ""Official data comes through a filter,"" said Weiss. ""And there are questions about their integrity. Is the government trying to make things look better than they might (really) be?""To compensate, investors watch data that are harder for the government to fudge. ""Investors watch indicators of economic activity, such as electricity consumption, car sales and transportation industry data,"" Doll said.Swanson keeps an eye on China's monthly retail sales data, which have been improving. He also watches the purchasing managers' index. ""If that keeps falling, it shows their economy is still getting worse,"" he said.As for the U.S., despite the stock market's doldrums the economy is in good shape — for the moment.Signs of improvement could emerge in mid-October as the third-quarter earnings report season starts. Investors are expecting mixed to good results, Doll says. Anything less would likely have a chilling effect on the market.Swanson notes that the Q2 GDP estimate was revised upward in late September to a strong 3.9%.""New housing starts have accelerated,"" he said. ""Retail personal consumption numbers show Americans making more money and spending it. Week by week, even through this whole period of (stock market) sell-offs, unemployment claims fell and the composite picture you get is that, so far, the U.S. hasn't missed a beat due to China.""Investors generally expect the Fed to act in December, says Swanson. Investors will take additional foot dragging as a clue from the Fed that the economy is not strong enough to withstand a rate hike.""The market wants (the Fed) to raise rates,"" he said. ""Like taking a patient off antibiotics, it will indicate that the patient is healthy.""Mindful of macro events in China and the U.S., American Century's asset allocation team has begun adjusting its funds' holdings.""We were generally 5% overweight toward growth funds and 5% underweight in value. We're now equal-weighted to 1% overweight growth,"" he said.He added: ""We're not bracing for a recession. We haven't moved into utilities and financials, but we've taken some cyclical positions off the table.""In sectors, his group has trimmed consumer discretionary to a market weight and trimmed its tech overweight.In fixed income, his group has boosted its allocation to TIPS, especially shorter-term TIPS, ""directly in response to a rate-hike prospect,"" he said. ""We're replacing some diversified bonds with TIPS.""He added: ""We've battened down the hatches.""Sectors In FocusReal estate funds topped sectors in September, gaining 2.22%, one of the few sectors up last month.As the market sold off, many investors shifted money to REIT funds for the sake of dividend yield. Utility funds, seen by many investors as even more of a proxy for bonds, did not fare as well. They lost 1.09%.Weiss likes U.S. defensive sectors best, given slowing global demand.Global Market OutlookThe only happy story in foreign stock funds in September was the 1.35% gain by India region funds.All others lost ground.Latin American funds lost 6.64%, easily the worst laggards among foreign stock funds.For Q3, no nation or region gained ground.Latin American funds lost the most, 21.69%. That left them down 27.44% for the year.China region funds were not far behind in the loss department in Q3, surrendering 21.18%.""My view is that we've seen the worst of the decline,"" said Nuveen's Doll, referring to the overall market's tumble, much of which was made in China. ""But that doesn't mean the market is prepared yet to go back up.""He added, ""The breakout to new highs probably won't be until next year.""Swanson's outlook is brightest for developed markets, which stand to benefit from low prices on input commodities like oil.Low costs for goods should keep consumers spending.U.S. consumer spending accounts for 15% of global GDP, more than China's GDP.Weiss' team has cut foreign stock allocations ""across the board.""

1002,SBUX,"Some things just don't feel right in the stock market. It's not easy cutting a loss when a trade doesn't go right, taking profits when a gain reaches 20% or averaging up in price with a top performer in your portfolio.You know what else doesn't feel right? Buying a stock when it gaps up in price.Few have the courage to do it, but market precedents show that it can be a profitable endeavor.When a high-quality stock gaps up more than 5% past a buy point, it's easy to say that it's extended in price and too late to buy. But if the stock has the look of an emerging leader, with outstanding fundamentals and a bullish chart, it's OK to buy. Just try to buy as close to the opening price as possible.The forces of supply and demand govern a stock's price movement every day. Buyers and sellers are always matched, but when a stock gaps up in price, buyers overwhelm sellers. Buying on a gap-up might seem counterintuitive, but all you're doing is swimming with the market's current, riding the coattails of institutional investors and others.Priceline Group (PCLN) gapped up powerfully on Aug. 4, 2010, just a few weeks ahead of a follow-through day for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 that marked the start of a market uptrend. Strong earnings and a raised outlook were the catalyst. The online travel firm opened at 281.30, well above a cup-with-handle buy point of 234.55. Volume was at 6.8 million shares, well above an average daily volume of 1.5 million. Clearly, big investors were buying.The monster gain triggered IBD's eight-week-hold rule for handling fast movers because it rallied 20% within three weeks after the breakout.Plenty of other stocks show how a gap-up in price can be a good time to buy. Starbucks (SBUX) did it on July 22, 2009, also on strong earnings. LinkedIn (LNKD) did it on July 25, 2013, and J2 Global (JCOM) did it on Feb. 14, 2013. The moves marked the start of lengthy uptrends for all.A common myth on Wall Street is ""all gaps must be filled."" When a stock gaps up powerfully in price, the thinking is that the stock must trade down to the pre-gap level before resuming its advance. The above three examples show that this is not always the case. Sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't.Investors shouldn't buy gap-ups when a stock has already made a major run and is well extended in price. Such price action can often flag a stock's top.

The stock, which has a 98 IBD Composite Rating, is trading above its 50-day line after retaking support earlier in the month. The Relative Strength line — which tracks the stock vs. the S&P 500 — has been hitting new highsJust as Facebook has expanded its presence abroad with buyouts, Starbucks has broadened its appeal beyond coffee drinkers with several nonjava acquisitions: tea seller Teavana, baked goods purveyor La Boulange and juice maker Evolution Fresh.Additionally, investing in mobile payment technology has paid off for the coffee giant, whose My Starbucks Rewards program has over 10 million members. RBC Capital Markets said last week that mobile payments accounted for over 20% of Starbucks' August sales, and adoption of its new Mobile Order & Pay feature is seen growing.Shares closed up 1.2% Wednesday. Starbucks also toughed out the recent selloff, and shares remain above their 50-day.Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) has made over 100 acquisitions since merging with Biovail in 2010. The biotech failed to beat out Actavis in its battle for Botox parent Allergan (AGN), but it has not stopped shopping, acquiring gastrointestinal drug maker Salix Pharmaceuticals and sexual-health drug firm Addyi this year.Shares took a hit Monday following Hillary Clinton's ""price gouging"" tweet in which she said she would outline a plan to take on high drug prices in the specialty drug market.Valeant shares rallied 0.2%, remaining below their 50-day.Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW), another 99-rated stock, announced in May the acquisition of CirroSecure, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) securer.Last year, Palo Alto also bought Morta Security and Tel Aviv-based Cyvera. The recent spate of hacks and cyberattacks on businesses and government agencies has boosted interest in network security infrastructure products.Shares of Palo Alto Networks are trading above their 50-day line, but ended the session down 0.4% Wednesday.RELATED:Biotech Stocks Dive On Clinton's 'Price Gouging' TweetFacebook Hits Home Run With Instagram, Monetizing AdsAmazon, Facebook Holding Up Amid Market Sell-OffStarbucks Mobile Order Pops As Android To Join AppleValeant Missed Out On Botox But Hits With Other Buys.

1043,SBUX,"Best Mutual Funds 2015: August Performance Report
"
1044,SBUX,"Sophomore slump? Not for Joe Fath. He took the helm of $47 billion T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund a year and a half ago — on Jan. 16, 2014. In that first calendar year in charge, his fund's 8.83% gain topped only 35% of its large-cap growth rival mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
1045,SBUX,"This year — in which the broad market has imitated a bucking bronco — his fund has climbed 5.93% as of Aug. 31 , outperforming a whopping 96% of its peer investors.
"
1046,SBUX,"Fath is more concerned with the longer term. The broad market's rally of nearly 6-1/2 years has made it increasingly hard for him to find attractively valued growth stocks.
"
1047,SBUX,"The late-summer volatility has made it harder to find gainers.
"
1048,SBUX,"Fath, who is about to celebrate his 45th birthday, talked with IBD from his office in Baltimore about why his mutual fund is performing so much better this year than last year and about how he is searching for new market leaders.
"
1049,SBUX,"IBD: When you took charge of this fund, you cut the size of the overall portfolio and of its top 10 names. You initially trimmed to 100, down from 118, and more recently you're at 106 as of July 31. Is your initial retooling complete?
"
1050,SBUX,"Fath: I'm where I want to be. The tail end of the fund is half what it used to be. It's 10% of the fund now. The top 10 decreased a little bit. The middle is bigger.
"
1051,SBUX,"IBD: How does each segment differ?
"
1052,SBUX,"Fath: I describe my philosophy as an upside-down pyramid. The top slice is secular-growth names. That typically makes up 50% to 60% of the portfolio. Those are innovative disrupters that are the most dynamic growth companies.
"
1053,SBUX,"The middle section would be more cyclical opportunities. These would typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio. They're likely to be more opportunistic and have shorter holding periods in the fund than the average holding.
"
1054,SBUX,"The last section would be what I generally characterize as special situations. These are in three primary areas:
"
1055,SBUX,"First, stocks transitioning from value to growth.
"
1056,SBUX,"Second, companies underway in a lasting industry structural change, like what has been going on the last several years in the U.S. airline sector.
"
1057,SBUX,"Third, roll-ups, where strong management teams that are good capital allocators are applying discipline and efficiency in fragmented industries through acquisition.
"
1058,SBUX,"This bucket will typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio.
"
1059,SBUX,"The top 10 or 20 names are generally the most compelling secular ideas. The tail of my portfolio has the smallest holdings and are typically my farm team — earlier-stage growth names and private companies that I own.
"
1060,SBUX,"IBD: Give me some examples of special situations, please.
"
1061,SBUX,"Fath: Gilead Sciences (GILD) went through the value-to-growth transition when it bought Pharmasset and got into (treating) hep C in addition to its core HIV business.
"
1062,SBUX,"Airlines are in the industry structural change category, and I own American Airlines (AAL) and United Continental (UAL).
"
1063,SBUX,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) is in the roll-up category, bringing capital allocation discipline to the pharma industry through an assertive allocation strategy.
"
1064,SBUX,"IBD: Name examples from your secular bucket, please.
"
1065,SBUX,"Fath:Amazon (AMZN) would be the poster child. Tesla (TSLA) is a bit more extreme. It's an on-the-come story. Other names include Priceline (PCLN), MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V).
"
1066,SBUX,"IBD: And name some from your cyclical bucket, please.
"
1067,SBUX,"Fath: Stuff in financials like TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and Morgan Stanley (MS) to a degree, but it is also a shifting business model, looking more like a value-to-growth shift.
"
1068,SBUX,"In industrials, I hold names like FedEx (FDX), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Flowserve (FLS), an energy industrial for the most part.
"
1069,SBUX,"IBD: Why has fund performance zoomed up this year — at least until the broad sell-off?
"
1070,SBUX,"Fath: It was a drag last year when secular-growth names sold off. A lot of that was due to people wanting to see more transparency in big names. They wanted to see Amazon break out its core e-commerce business and Amazon Web Services. That company is becoming more disciplined on expenses and costs.
"
1071,SBUX,"And we're starting to see that in Google (GOOGL).
"
1072,SBUX,"This year I've taken up the health care weighting significantly. And I've taken down energy. Both moves paid off.
"
1073,SBUX,"I have a number of biotech and managed care and big-pharma names. That's played well. There's been some M&A activity in that space.
"
1074,SBUX,"IBD: So you have a bigger bet on growth this year, and that has paid off?
"
1075,SBUX,"Fath: The slowdown in growth happened prior to the sell-off in 2014.
"
1076,SBUX,"I was positioned for a cyclical recovery, but that didn't play out. It's been the reverse in 2015.
"
1077,SBUX,"We've been in a slow-growth environment. And the world has been thrown off by exogenous shocks like Greece and China, which is devaluing its currency.
"
1078,SBUX,"Those external factors help make growth more valuable. That bids up the valuations of companies that are delivering growth.

1079,SBUX,"But you've got to be disciplined about position sizes.

1080,SBUX,"Google, Priceline — their outlooks look good. They've gone through heavy investment cycles.
"
1081,SBUX,"Google has a new CFO, Ruth Porat, who came from Morgan Stanley. They're creating a new holding company called Alphabet, which will give more visibility to profitability of the core company going forward. People wanted more transparency there, and Google is starting to provide it.
"
1082,SBUX,"IBD: Let's talk about some of your interesting names, as of your latest disclosure. Do you share the concerns that some people have about Apple (AAPL)?
"
1083,SBUX,"Fath: It's done well. But I've been underweight. The stock peaked around 130. It's been sort of trading sideways. I'm guarded.
"
1084,SBUX,"The most constructive part is its valuation and capital structure.
"
1085,SBUX,"The worry has been about the company after this iPhone cycle.
"
1086,SBUX,"They've done well with iPhone. Now the issue is its replacement cycle. What we underestimated is how impactful the replacement cycle would be.
"
1087,SBUX,"I remain concerned about their ability to innovate, and does that drive enough of a replacement? They've done so well. Can they grow (as fast) off this base? It's hard to drive a higher multiple.
"
1088,SBUX,"We'll see where it will go. The watch doesn't look like it will be a success — or at least not move the needle enough. I do own it. I don't have it overweight.
"
1089,SBUX,"IBD: Why should anyone like Facebook (FB), whose earnings per share growth has slowed a lot for two quarters?
"
1090,SBUX,"Fath: They've done everything right. Right now things are in transition in mobile. As they get a big base (of users), revenue growth is slowing as they invest in new initiatives. And they want a lot of users before they turn on the monetization engine.
"
1091,SBUX,"They have 300 million users on Instagram, a lot on WhatsApp. They have 1.5 billion users on Facebook. They'll monetize over time, so profit will reaccelerate.
"
1092,SBUX,"IBD: What's your thesis for Facebook's Oculus, which is buying Israel's Pebbles Interfaces, which specializes in depth-sensing tools that can track hand movement?
"
1093,SBUX,"Fath: Oculus is a virtual reality play. It's interesting, but not a needle mover, but it's on the come. It's a green banana. It still needs to ripen. It shows (Mark) Zuckerberg is thinking multidecades.
"
1094,SBUX,"IBD: What's your Visa thesis?
"
1095,SBUX,"Fath: It ties in with durability of growth because it is at the center of online payments, the movement from cash and checks to digital and disruption.
"
1096,SBUX,"In the U.S., cards still use magnetic swipes, but they are moving to chips with a PIN. All cards will be reissued with chips imbedded. That makes it much harder to steal card information.

1098,SBUX,"Visa Europe is another potential driver for Visa. Visa's takeover looks like it's coming to fruition. Maybe there will be an announcement in October.
"
1099,SBUX,"IBD: You've built your stake in Celgene (CELG) for at least four quarters. What do you like?
"
1100,SBUX,"Fath: The biotechs I want to own are going after big markets.
"
1101,SBUX,"Over time, Celgene has built an arsenal where they can go after multiple things. Revlimid has been an anchor to what they do. But they've acquired companies and build their own franchise.
"
1102,SBUX,"Now they've got Otezla, an immunology drug, for psoriasis (and psoriatic arthritis).
"
1103,SBUX,"They've also got a cancer drug, Pomalyst, and chemotherapy treatment, Abraxane (acquired through Abraxis).
"
1104,SBUX,"Another drug they acquired is GD-301 for treatment of Crohn's disease. Early trials are promising.
"
1105,SBUX,"There's a patent cliff ahead for Revlimid. They'll protect it as long as possible.
"
1106,SBUX,"And there's their recent acquisition of Receptos, which was viewed as a pretty reasonable price relative to some other deals. It's attacked multiple indications, but the most promising appears to be in gastrointestinal (disorders like) colitis and Crohn's.
"
1107,SBUX,"IBD: Why have you been trimming your stake in Gilead Sciences?
"
1108,SBUX,"Fath: They're a victim of their own success. They turned what was a chronic disease into an acute disease that is treatable.
"
1109,SBUX,"Their treatment for hepatitis C is a monster drug. But its cure rate is almost 100% in eight to 12 weeks. Once someone is cured, they've got to find new patients.
"
1110,SBUX,"IBD: You've also pared your stake in Regeneron (REGN). What's your outlook?
"
1111,SBUX,"Fath: I probably shouldn't have trimmed. They've got a good core franchise in Eylea, which is used for treating wet age-related macular degeneration in the eye. Now it's also used for diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion.
"
1112,SBUX,"They've got a powerful pipeline.
"
1113,SBUX,"IBD: You've pared Starbucks (SBUX). What are your concerns?
"
1114,SBUX,"Fath: I still feel good about their core story. Our trims are just position-size management.
"
1115,SBUX,"They have a lot of presence, not just in the U.S., but globally. They've introduced nice food with their purchase of La Boulange. They're driving new traffic in the afternoon and evenings. They've got a good China story. Their menu is being broadened.

Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund a year and a half ago — on Jan. 16, 2014. In that first calendar year in charge, his fund's 8.83% gain topped only 35% of its large-cap growth rival mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc.This year — in which the broad market has imitated a bucking bronco — his fund has climbed 5.93% as of Aug. 31 , outperforming a whopping 96% of its peer investors.Fath is more concerned with the longer term. The broad market's rally of nearly 6-1/2 years has made it increasingly hard for him to find attractively valued growth stocks.The late-summer volatility has made it harder to find gainers.Fath, who is about to celebrate his 45th birthday, talked with IBD from his office in Baltimore about why his mutual fund is performing so much better this year than last year and about how he is searching for new market leaders.IBD: When you took charge of this fund, you cut the size of the overall portfolio and of its top 10 names. You initially trimmed to 100, down from 118, and more recently you're at 106 as of July 31. Is your initial retooling complete?Fath: I'm where I want to be. The tail end of the fund is half what it used to be. It's 10% of the fund now. The top 10 decreased a little bit. The middle is bigger.IBD: How does each segment differ?Fath: I describe my philosophy as an upside-down pyramid. The top slice is secular-growth names. That typically makes up 50% to 60% of the portfolio. Those are innovative disrupters that are the most dynamic growth companies.The middle section would be more cyclical opportunities. These would typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio. They're likely to be more opportunistic and have shorter holding periods in the fund than the average holding.The last section would be what I generally characterize as special situations. These are in three primary areas:First, stocks transitioning from value to growth.Second, companies underway in a lasting industry structural change, like what has been going on the last several years in the U.S. airline sector.Third, roll-ups, where strong management teams that are good capital allocators are applying discipline and efficiency in fragmented industries through acquisition.This bucket will typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio.The top 10 or 20 names are generally the most compelling secular ideas. The tail of my portfolio has the smallest holdings and are typically my farm team — earlier-stage growth names and private companies that I own.IBD: Give me some examples of special situations, please.Fath: Gilead Sciences (GILD) went through the value-to-growth transition when it bought Pharmasset and got into (treating) hep C in addition to its core HIV business.Airlines are in the industry structural change category, and I own American Airlines (AAL) and United Continental (UAL).Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) is in the roll-up category, bringing capital allocation discipline to the pharma industry through an assertive allocation strategy.IBD: Name examples from your secular bucket, please.Fath:Amazon (AMZN) would be the poster child. Tesla (TSLA) is a bit more extreme. It's an on-the-come story. Other names include Priceline (PCLN), MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V).IBD: And name some from your cyclical bucket, please.Fath: Stuff in financials like TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and Morgan Stanley (MS) to a degree, but it is also a shifting business model, looking more like a value-to-growth shift.In industrials, I hold names like FedEx (FDX), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Flowserve (FLS), an energy industrial for the most part.IBD: Why has fund performance zoomed up this year — at least until the broad sell-off?Fath: It was a drag last year when secular-growth names sold off. A lot of that was due to people wanting to see more transparency in big names. They wanted to see Amazon break out its core e-commerce business and Amazon Web Services. That company is becoming more disciplined on expenses and costs.And we're starting to see that in Google (GOOGL).This year I've taken up the health care weighting significantly. And I've taken down energy. Both moves paid off.I have a number of biotech and managed care and big-pharma names. That's played well.

Starbucks (SBUX) recently rolled out its mobile-order-and-pay feature across the country after launching a regional test in the Pacific Northwest late last year.Apple (AAPL) Pay will be available in Dunkin' stores beginning in 2016. The mobile payment feature is launching on the Dunkin' Donuts app this month. The Cupertino, Calif., tech giant in June announced that Apple Pay would become available at Dunkin' Donuts, Panera Bread (PNRA) and a number of other retailers.The Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins parent also reiterated guidance for 2015 per-share earnings of $1.87 to $1.91 and sales growth of 6% to 8%.

China's Xi Jinping visited a Boeing facility near Seattle as part of his visit to meet business and technology leaders in the region. Xi also attended a roundtable with officials from Boeing, Alibaba (BABA), Apple (AAPL) and Starbucks (SBUX).Boeing will sell 300 aircraft to three Chinese firms and open a plant in China that will put the finishing touches on 737 jets — its first plant overseas as it looks to stay competitive in the region vs. European rival Airbus (EADSY). Airbus has already assembled over 200 jets in a factory near Beijing and is building a plant for its A330 work there.China accounts for nearly a quarterly of Boeing's single-aisle jet deliveries this year. Airbus has been expanding in that market.Boeing shares fell 1.7% to close at 131.67 in the stock market today.Boeing sees demand for 6,020 new planes, valued at $870 billion, over the next two decades in China, accounting for 45% of total demand for airplanes in the region.China is also the home to many budding low-cost carriers, as Beijing lifted restrictions on creating new airlines earlier this year.U.S. workers are concerned about job losses at home as Boeing looks toward China, but Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said there wouldn't be any job cuts back home, according to Reuters.Boeing isn't the only American industrial giant heading overseas. Caterpillar (CAT) and Joy Global (JOY) already have plants in China, and General Electric (GE) is moving some of its power turbine work to China, which it says is due to the expiration of the Export-Import Bank's charter.GE shares were flat.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter @IBD_GRich.

1120,SBUX,"Mobile payments accounted for over a fifth of Starbucks' (SBUX) August sales, a ""strong indication of the rapid adoption"" of the coffee giant's Mobile Order & Pay technology, noted RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer on Tuesday.According to the firm, mobile payment accounted for an estimated 21.6% of last month's total sales, up from 18.6% in July and 16.4% in June.In July, Palmer said that the order-ahead feature had captured ""almost two-thirds of mobile payment mix"" in the Pacific Northwest, even though it had been available in the region for only a few months and even though only Apple (AAPL) iPhone users, who account for less than half the smartphone market, could access it.Palmer noted Tuesday that with the mobile pay feature expected to be available on Google's (GOOGL) Android and in locations nationwide by the end of September, he is ""encouraged by the potential for (Mobile Order & Pay) to accelerate sales contribution from My Starbucks Rewards by 1-2"" percentage points.Last week, Starbucks CFO Scott Maw said at a conference that the feature, originally seen as launching on Android and nationwide by the holidays, was ""running ahead of our expectations,"" according to the Seattle Times. Mobile Order & Pay first rolled out last December in Portland and as of June was available at more than half of company-operated Starbucks locations.Shares of Starbucks closed up 1.1% to 56.91 in the stock market today. Apple shares were up 0.8% as well. Google advanced 1.9%.The order-ahead service, embedded into Starbucks' mobile app, allows java drinkers to place and pay for a customized order from their phones, then pick it up at a nearby cafe. Users must sign up for Starbucks' rewards program in order to access Mobile Order & Pay.RBC's Palmer has a 64 price target and an outperform rating on the stock. He raised his 2016 EPS estimate to $1.94 a share from $1.89 a share to account for an extra week in Q4. Analysts currently expect $1.87 in per-share earnings for 2016.""Our view remains that innovation in beverages, food and technology should sustain sales momentum that, when combined with a benign input cost environment, is enabling further investment in labor, productivity, technology and brand development (e.g., Starbucks Reserve; Teavana) and should fuel sales and earnings momentum over the long term,"" he wrote.RELATED:Facebook, Starbucks Providing Safety Amid TurmoilStarbucks' Run Shows How To Stretch Out ProfitsStarbucks 'Star' Bucks Gain Currency Beyond Its Shops.Follow Elaine Low on Twitter @IBD_ELow.

1150,SBUX,"Samsung frequently advertises its better battery life vs. rivals like the iPhone.Hoping to regain ground it lost to Apple (AAPL) in big-screen smartphones, Samsung Electronics on Thursday debuted two new phablets.Samsung had the phone-tablet market largely to itself for three years until last September, when Apple responded with the iPhone 6 Plus. Samsung's newest phablets feature 5.7-inch Quad HD Super AMOLED displays, compared with the 5.5-inch LED-backlit IPS LCD screen on Apple's iPhone 6 Plus.""Bigger screens have gone from nice-to-have to must-have,"" Justin Denison, Samsung vice president of product strategy and marketing, said at a webcast event in New York City.The new Samsung phablets include the Galaxy S6 Edge Plus, which is designed for multimedia consumers, and the Galaxy Note 5, which is optimized for productivity. Both Google (GOOGL) Android-based phones will go on sale in the U.S. and Canada on Aug. 21.Samsung likely will have a three-week jump on Apple's ninth-generation handsets, the iPhone 6S series. Apple is rumored to be planning a media event for Sept. 9 and likely would release the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus on Sept. 18.Samsung opted to forego a global launch to get its new phones out in key markets ahead of the next iPhones, IHS Technology analyst Daniel Gleeson said in a report. The Seoul-based company traditionally has announced its new Note phones in late August or early September.""By launching a couple weeks earlier, Samsung is hoping to steal a march on Apple's new iPhone announcement,"" Gleeson said. ""The Galaxy Note 4 was hit by direct competition from the larger-screen iPhone 6 Plus during the year, which likely had a significant impact on the Note 4's success. Until autumn 2014, Apple had no large-screen smartphones which could compete with Samsung.""The iPhone 6S phones are expected to feature a Force Touch display that can distinguish between taps and presses, as well as a speedier processor and better cameras.Charging, Memory UpgradedSamsung hopes to trump Apple's features with built-in wireless charging, faster charging, more random access memory, and advanced cameras capable of taking ultra HD 4K video.The multimedia-focused Galaxy S6 Edge Plus features a dual-edge curved display. The thin edge displays can show apps and preferred contacts.The productivity-focused Galaxy Note 5 features a pop-out stylus called the S Pen. Users now can quickly jot down notes when the screen is off without even unlocking the phone.Samsung also is making an attachable physical keypad for the Note 5 for users who like to type messages.Both new smartphones come with 4 gigabytes of RAM for more processing power for multitasking. The current iPhone 6 handsets come with 1 GB of RAM, but Apple is rumored to be upping that to 2 GB with the next models.The latest Samsung smartphones feature a live broadcasting feature that lets users post live video streams and archive video on Google's YouTube. The feature competes with apps such as Meerkat and Twitter's (TWTR) Periscope.Samsung's new smartphones also will come with Samsung Pay, the company's new mobile payment service, which competes with Apple Pay. It will launch Aug. 20 in South Korea and Sept. 28 in the U.S.Samsung Pay works with both MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission) and NFC (Near Field Communication) technologies, allowing it to be broadly adopted without retailers having to upgrade their checkout hardware. Samsung Pay transactions are protected by Samsung Knox technology, fingerprint verification and digital tokenization.At the unveiling of its new smartphones, Samsung touted improvements to battery charging capabilities, including fast charging and cord-free charging.With wired charging, both new phones can go from empty to fully charged in about 90 minutes, and through Samsung's latest wireless charger, they can be fully charged in about 120 minutes.The phones also are compatible with virtually any wireless pad available today.

But the halo effect surrounding the grocer's upscale image doesn't extend to property values, according to a home price analysis out Tuesday from RealtyTrac.When it comes to home value appreciation, bargain-priced grocery chain Trader Joe's has more of a halo effect than Whole Foods Market.RealtyTrac looked at home values, appreciation and property taxes in U.S. ZIP codes with a Whole Foods or a Trader Joe's to determine the best combination of food and shelter when it comes to these two grocery store chains.RealtyTrac found that homeowners near a Trader Joe's experienced better home value appreciation since their purchase but also paid higher property taxes on average.Homeowners near a Trader Joe's have seen an average 40% rise in home value since they purchased, compared with 34% appreciation for homeowners near a Whole Foods, RealtyTrac found.The average appreciation for all ZIP codes nationwide is also 34%.Homes near a Trader Joe's also have a higher value on average — $592,339, which is 5% more than the $561,840 average value for homes near a Whole Foods, according to the analysis.The average value of homes was $262,068 across all zip codes nationwide.But homeowners near a Trader Joe's pay an average of $8,536 in property taxes each year, 59% higher than the $5,382 average for homeowners near a Whole Foods.The average property tax across all ZIP codes nationwide was $3,239.Separately, a halo effect in home price appreciation may also come from having a Starbucks (SBUX) nearby.

1154,SBUX,"Accelerating growth is hard to come by in this economy. Had the economic recovery since 2009 been merely average, U.S. GDP would be bigger to the tune of $16,000 per household.Yet despite the sluggish economy, some big-cap companies are showing acceleration in earnings and revenue.The Big Cap 20 features several companies that are stepping up growth.Starbucks (SBUX) grew quarterly earnings on a year-earlier basis by 14%, 18% and most recently 24%. Revenue expanded by 13%, 18% and again 18% in the same period.How rare is that? Among roughly four dozen restaurants trading above $12 a share, only one besides Starbucks shows a similar achievement on the top and bottom lines. (It's DineEquity (DIN), a small cap.)Starbucks broke out in January and is now more than 30% above its original buy point. The stock has climbed steadily, pausing to brush just above the 50-day line in April. Starbucks recently pulled off its high and could be approaching a second brush with the 50-day line.If that develops along with a bounce off the line, that would constitute a secondary buy range.The Retail-Restaurants stock group was a respectable No. 48 among 197 industry groups in six-month price performance in Monday's IBD.Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) stepped up quarterly earnings from 12% to 14%, 15% and 20%. Revenue expanded 12%, 16%, 20% and 23% in the same quarters.The company provides technology outsourcing services.Cognizant broke out Wednesday. The 5% buy zone runs to 69.36. The RS line — which measures relative price strength vs. the S&P 500 — is at a 52-week high.The Computer-Tech Services stock group was No. 38 in Monday's IBD.Of stocks trading above 12, Cognizant is the only stock in its group delivering accelerated growth on the top and bottom lines.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) pumped up earnings growth from 1% to 8%, 22% and 23% in recent quarters. Revenue grew 6%, 7%, 36% and 48% in the same period.The stock broke out in July and remains in its 5% buy zone. The buy zone runs to 98.20.The Retail-Drug Stores stock group was No. 49 in Monday's IBD.Walgreens Boots is the only stock in its five-stock group that stepped up growth on both the top and bottom lines.Looking for acceleration among Big Cap 20 stocks isn't a bad place to begin a search for buy or watch-list candidates.Going into the start of Monday's session, the Big Cap 20 was outperforming the major stock market indexes this year. The Big Cap 20 was up 8% vs. 6% for the Nasdaq, 1% for the S&P 500 and 0% for the small-cap Russell 2000.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings of $1.37 a share for the quarter, which ended in April. That's up 11% from the prior year and would mark the fifth straight quarter of double-digit EPS growth, but would mark a slowdown from 24% in Q2. Revenue is seen climbing 6% to $680 million. That would snap a four-quarter string of gradually accelerating top-line growth.Cracker Barrel, which runs a chain of more than 630 family restaurants in 42 states, boasts a strong IBD Composite Rating of 90. The stock fell 0.9% to 141.08 on the stock market Friday, finding resistance at the 50-day moving average for a third straight session. Shares have been consolidating since peaking at 149.94 on March 20.Cracker Barrel remains one of the better stocks in a group that has fallen to No. 62 out of 197 industries tracked by IBD — down from No. 2 as recently as 13 weeks ago.The restaurant group has been rocked by problems plaguing industry giants such as McDonald's (MCD), which is undergoing a restructuring plan designed to help it return to growth mode; as well as former Wall Street darling Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which has seen shares sag recently amid sales that have failed to live up to historic rapid pace.There are still some tasty restaurant stocks out there, however, including highly rated Starbucks (SBUX), which touched a new high on Friday, as well as Sonic (SONC) and Papa John's Pizza (PZZA).

Dow futures traded 14.6 points above fair market value and had halved their gains over the prior hour. Nasdaq 100 futures doubled their hour-earlier gains to 18 points. S&P 500 futures were steady, showing a 3.6-point gain.The stock market today is expected to put in a short, quiet session. Stock markets close at 1 p.m. ET instead of the usual 4 p.m. Calendars show no significant economic releases and only a dribble of quarterly earnings reports due. And a sizeable segment of the trading population has seized the day to complete a four-day holiday weekend, so trading volume is likely to remain quiet.The Nasdaq opens the day with a mild 0.2% gain for the week. The S&P 500 starts 0.3% in the hole. Both are trading sideways, below early November highs and above their 50- and 200-day moving averages.It's been a stronger week for small caps.

China-based social networking platform YY (YY) fell more than 2% to the bottom of the list. The stock is also working to climb the right side of a five-month consolidation.On IBD's Your Weekly Review list, Ireland-based Ryanair (RYAAY) popped 2% before the open.

1509,SBUX,"Red Robin Gourmet Burger (RRGB) is still riding the wave of its blowout first-quarter performance a couple weeks ago, and there might be even more good times ahead for the restaurant operator.Red Robin boasts a strong IBD Composite Rating of 92, making it one of the better potential investing prospects in IBD's Retail-Restaurants industry group along with Starbucks (SBUX), Sonic (SONC) and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen (PLKI).On May 19, Red Robin stock surged 15% to 84.14 after the company crushed first-quarter earnings estimates. The stock, which set a record high of 89.46 on March 24, currently trades near 83.Here are four reasons investors should consider putting Red Robin on their menus: Brand transformation: Red Robin has spent the last couple of years renovating its restaurants, tweaking its menu and changing its marketing strategy. Those initiatives are paying off.Miller Tabak analyst Stephen Anderson, who recently met with Red Robin execs, noted in a Monday research report that the company said renovations done in the past 12 months ""are generating traffic gains of 350 to 400"" basis points.""This gain is similar to the renovations done in 2013,"" Anderson said. ""Moreover, management said traffic gains even from the earlier round of renovations are surpassing those of non-renovated locations.""He is ""particularly optimistic"" about the current round of renovations taking place in California and Washington. Burger Works works: Red Robin Burger Works is a fast-casual concept that features a stripped-down menu and lower prices. At the end of the first quarter the company had 10 Burger Works locations, three of which were added in Q1.Anderson models as many as seven new Burger Works units for the full year and as many as 10 in 2016.""We think the concept is gaining ground in Denver (RRGB's home market), Chicago and Washington, D.C.,"" he noted. ""Certainly, newer fast casual-specific chains such as Shake Shack (SHAK) and Habit Burger (HABT) have succeeded in the premium and value segments, respectively.""He reckons there is room for Burger Works ""to fill its own niche in urban markets where a traditional 5,000-square-foot Red Robin restaurant cannot be built."" Bigger focus on seasonal and regional items: Locally-sourced food items are all the rage this decade, particularly among millennials. Look for Red Robin to hop aboard.""We can expect RRGB to roll out regionally sourced and seasonal items, potentially as premium-priced limited time offers,"" Anderson said. ""Management did not mention this specifically on our call, but given recent pronouncements in the quick-service and fast casual segments toward increased menu transparency, we think RRGB and other casual dining chains will move in this direction."" Tasty stock price: In addition to a strong Composite Rating from IBD, Red Robin's stock is setting up a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 88.18. It is currently about 6% below that buy point.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters project that after four years of double-digit annual earnings growth — most recently a 12% gain in 2014 — Red Robin will see a 20% EPS gain this year and 16% next year.

"
1516,SBUX,"Costs for downtown Seattle office space soared 22% in the 12 months ending March 31, according to global commercial real estate firm CBRE Group (CBG).
"
1517,SBUX,"That was the second fastest pace in office markets worldwide, behind Dublin.
"
1518,SBUX,"""A lot of the tech companies in San Francisco have opened engineering and sales offices in Seattle,"" said Owen Rice, a senior VP at CBRE who is based in Seattle. ""Some have grown tremendously, such as Facebook and Salesforce.com. I'm talking about big tech tenants making a meaningful impact.""
"
1519,SBUX,"In addition, he added, ""Apple (AAPL) is looking for space right now.""
"
1520,SBUX,"On the housing front, demand for homes in Seattle is growing faster than supply, causing prices to rise around 10% from the previous year.
"
1521,SBUX,"""This year almost every single home that goes on the market is getting multiple offers, sometimes 10 to 20 offers,"" said Chad Pluid, managing broker with real estate brokerage and research firm Redfin, which is headquartered in Seattle. ""As you get closer to core areas like downtown Seattle or Bellevue, it gets more competitive.""
"
1522,SBUX,"Demand is being fueled largely by ""the huge increase in tech workers,"" many of them recent arrivals from elsewhere, he says.
"
1523,SBUX,"According to a Redfin analysis of LinkedIn (LNKD) data, the number of tech workers in Seattle climbed 21% in May from a year earlier.
"
1524,SBUX,"Despite rising home prices, Seattle homes are still much more affordable than in the Bay area.
"
1525,SBUX,"The median home price in San Francisco is more than $1 million, vs. $481,300 in Seattle, according to Zillow Group (Z), the online real estate company. And while San Francisco's median rent is $3,995, it's $1,765 in Seattle.
"
1526,SBUX,"""Seattle is becoming a digital technology city,"" Pluid said, but it's still ""an affordable West Coast city.""
"
1527,SBUX,"Still, the kind of wealth created from technology in the Bay area and Silicon Valley is extending to cities across the country — especially Seattle, Portland, Austin, Boston and Denver, Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman said in a recent blog.

1530,SBUX,"""People who come back to Austin after two years feel as though they traveled 20 years into Austin's future,"" Kelman said, pointing to the city's ""new level of prosperity,"" traffic jams and higher home prices.
"
1531,SBUX,"How many tech workers does it take to increase home prices?
"
1532,SBUX,"Redfin looked at hiring trends at Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon (AMZN) as a proxy for each metro area's overall tech hiring growth. It found that for every 1% gain in tech workers, there was about a half-percentage point uptick in home prices above the national rate of appreciation.
"
1533,SBUX,"Tech companies are gobbling up much of the available office space in new tech corridors. In Seattle, they are responsible for ""the lion's share of tenant growth,"" notes a report from CBRE.

1534,SBUX,"In the hot South Lake Union district of downtown Seattle — home to Amazon's main campus — only 4% of the 4.1 million square feet of office space is vacant, CBRE's Rice says.

"
1544,SBUX,"""Seattle is a place where the millennials want to live and work. We have a downtown with a strong residential base, and alternative types of transportation,"" Rice said, citing bus, light rail and car services Uber and car2go.
"
1545,SBUX,"""And if you can tell an engineer that you can buy a house for $400,000 in Seattle and it is a million bucks in San Francisco, that's a huge spread.""
"
1546,SBUX,"A home listed in Seattle last month sold in eight days on average, according to Redfin. And 46.5% sold above list price, compared to 37.4% a year earlier.
"
1547,SBUX,"In up-and-coming tech market Denver, homes sold the fastest of any market in the country — a mere five days, Redfin noted. A Redfin broker in Denver said San Francisco-basedTwitter (TWTR) is looking for 60,000 square feet of office space for more than 400 mostly new employees in Denver.

1566,SBUX,"Increase the bottom line by making cuts in departments where you spend the most money. So suggests Matthew Figgie, author of ""Maximizing Profits Immediately"" and chairman of Clark-Reliance, which makes liquid gauges for the oil and gas industry.""Expensive software or consultants are not necessary,"" he told IBD. ""Just an understanding and implementation of a few foundational profit improvement techniques"" can make a big difference.Tips on how best to profit: Analyze. Identify which years your firm performed best in a variety of spending categories. Next, check how profit would rise if those numbers were garnered in the same 12-month period. ""You'll be amazed at the yearly profit that is attainable,"" Figgie said. Look beyond growth. A 5% reduction in costs will more than double pretax profit, says Figgie. Buy intelligently. Purchase, don't expedite, is Figgie's point.Your purchasing department should avoid single-sourced items. Make sure that unit has the independence to be creative when negotiating with competing suppliers. Charge properly. Companies work hard to cut costs in a product's design, parts and manufacturing, then give away all their savings through poor pricing strategies.Say you manufacture a part for $10 and sell it wholesale for $20. After using profit improvement techniques, you reduce costs to $9 and use the same markup to sell the product for $18.""You are giving away $2 for every dollar you save,"" said Figgie.He adds that thousands of small and midsize U.S. firms are profitable while competing with international competition — and don't always have to underprice ""as long as they are providing their customers with a superior product."" Compensate. Start thinking you can boost profit if you treat all of your stakeholders as partners. That's the view of Philip Kotler, who has studied under three Nobel laureate economists and authored ""Confronting Capitalism.""""Winning companies see their employees, suppliers and distributors as a working team,"" he said. ""All of them must feel fairly rewarded."" The payoff is ""stakeholder-oriented companies often earn greater profits than shareholder-only rewarded companies."" Boost fitness. Knowing that medical costs rise 20% per year, Jim Miller, CEO of tech platform Krowdfit, financially rewards members for healthy living.""What other single cost in running your business is going up at 20% per year that you have the direct ability to influence by simply deploying an accountable wellness incentive program?"" he said. ""There is no better way to improve profits, individual performance and reduce costs than to improve the health of your employees."" Market accordingly. Spend money to make money to increase profit through consumer awareness. Glean insights from analytics and digital marketing.Kotler recommends putting 10% of your promotion budget in blogging and social media presentations on such sites as Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR), LinkedIn (LNKD) and Google (GOOGL)-owned YouTube. If you get good results, add another 10%. He adds that Procter & Gamble (PG) spends 25% to 35% of its promotion budget on digital marketing. Know the consumer. ""Many companies offer similar products and deals,"" Kotler said. ""You must not only match your competitors, but do one better. There are many coffee shops, but only one Starbucks (SBUX). Starbucks not only sells good coffee, but positions itself as a third home for its customers. Your job is to create a better life for your customers.""

"
1571,SBUX,"Among the weekly chart's strengths :

1572,SBUX,"It covers a longer period than the daily chart, giving a broader perspective. One big psychological benefit: It's easier for shareholders to stay calm when looking at the weekly chart.
"
1573,SBUX,"Weekly action can smooth out minor noise. If an investor is looking only at daily charts, it's easy to get too focused on moves in the latest 6-1/2-hour session. Worse yet, if an investor gets too focused on daily charts, many are tempted to ""graduate"" to intraday charts.

"
1579,SBUX,"But weekly charts don't carry every advantage. Among the daily chart's strengths:
"
1580,SBUX,"Bearish wedging in the handle is often easier to see on the daily chart.
"
1581,SBUX,"Counting the days to see if a stock triggers the eight-week hold rule is more precise on the daily chart. (Keep in mind that the eight-week hold rule is designed to be used only with high-quality stocks.)
"
1582,SBUX,"Some investors say that an ascending base is easier to see on the daily chart than on the weekly. MarketSmith's pattern recognition technology can help an investor spot this pattern.

That sounds like asking for window or aisle seat, smoking or nonsmoking, fries or no fries with that. Investors naturally gravitate to either the weekly or the daily chart in their stock routine.The risk in using only one is that an investor could miss something important.What are some advantages of each chart?Among the weekly chart's strengths :It covers a longer period than the daily chart, giving a broader perspective. One big psychological benefit: It's easier for shareholders to stay calm when looking at the weekly chart.Weekly action can smooth out minor noise. If an investor is looking only at daily charts, it's easy to get too focused on moves in the latest 6-1/2-hour session. Worse yet, if an investor gets too focused on daily charts, many are tempted to ""graduate"" to intraday charts.If an investor is looking for a way to mess with his or her own mind, intraday charts are it. Short of electric-shock treatments, few things jar the psyche more intensely than intraday charts.The bullish three-weeks-tight pattern is visible only on the weekly chart.The bearish railroad-tracks pattern is spotted only on the weekly chart. This is one pattern that an investor can't afford to miss. It usually leads to bad action, sometimes even a gap down.The bullish short-stroke pattern is seen most easily on the weekly chart.The bullish high, tight flag is more evident on the weekly than on the daily chart.But weekly charts don't carry every advantage. Among the daily chart's strengths:Bearish wedging in the handle is often easier to see on the daily chart.Counting the days to see if a stock triggers the eight-week hold rule is more precise on the daily chart. (Keep in mind that the eight-week hold rule is designed to be used only with high-quality stocks.)Some investors say that an ascending base is easier to see on the daily chart than on the weekly. MarketSmith's pattern recognition technology can help an investor spot this pattern.The daily chart is necessary if an investor is looking for a market follow-through day, which confirms that a new uptrend is underway.A stock's trip to its 50-day moving average can occur before or after its trip to its 10-week line.

1657,SBUX,"Keurig Green Mountain (GMCR) and big backer Coca-Cola (KO) are working to dethrone incumbent cold drink machine maker SodaStream (SODA) with their Keurig Kold, but a new appliance from Whirlpool (WHR) and Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) is also making waves.The B.blend, which is the result of a four-year collaboration between the appliance maker and beer company, is an all-in-one machine that can make hot coffee as well as cold juice and soda. The device went on sale Tuesday in Sao Paulo, Brazil, for about $1,150.The B.blend is based on technology that comes from a licensing deal with Bevyz, which Keurig fully acquired at the end of last year, several months after the August announcement from Whirlpool about the launch of the platform.Depending on demand, Whirlpool and Anheuser-Busch plan to expand sales to the entire South American country and beyond.Whirlpool and Anheuser-Busch shares were down a fraction in afternoon trading in the stock market today.Keurig Kold, which can make iced coffee, soda, sports drinks and iced tea, will start selling online this fall and in select stores this holiday, but it won't reach all retail stores until the 2016 holiday season.It's priced starting at $300, which left some analysts cold on last week's post-earnings conference call.The Keurig 2.0 carafe-and-pod duo is $200, but sales have been weak, in part due to backlash over the latest brewer's unlicensed pod lockout technology.Argus Research analyst John Staszak on Wednesday downgraded the at-home beverage machine maker to hold from buy, and says Keurig is seen facing pressure from price cuts on its K-cup pods that it manufactures for Starbucks (SBUX) and Kraft Foods (KRFT).Costs associated with the new Kold machine, as well as 2.0 markdowns, are expected to weigh on near-term earnings, Staszak says.Keurig shares rose fractionally Wednesday afternoon. The stock is trading a steep 43% off of its all-time high of 158.87 reached last November. Just this month, shares have dropped 23%.And in addition to competition from the high-end, early-adopter machine from Whirlpool and Anheuser-Busch, Keurig also faces pressure from SodaStream, whose machines range in price from $80 to $180.But SodaStream sales have been plunging. Shares are in an extended downtrend and are 73% below their August 2011 all-time high of 79.72.Follow Alissa Williams on Twitter: @IBD_AWilliams.

1732,SBUX,"Brinker International (EAT) and Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (RRGB) are already among the better restaurant stocks, with IBD Composite Ratings of 93 and 96, respectively.Can the two companies gain an even bigger edge thanks to a technology designed to improve the dining experience?Maybe so, according to a new research note from Sterne Agee analyst Lynne Collier.That technology, made by Dallas-based tech firm Ziosk, is a Wi-Fi enabled tablet that lets diners order at the table, entertain themselves before or while dining, and quickly pay their bills when they're finished dining.In a note released Wednesday, Collier said Ziosk's technology ""will transform the industry and enable casual dining to much more effectively compete with fast casual.""She also said early adopters of the technology ""will be at a competitive advantage."" Those early adopters include Brinker, owner of the Chili's and Maggiano's chains; and Red Robin, owner of its namesake chain of burger restaurants.""We expect rollout to additional casual dining companies over the next 12 to 24 months,"" Collier noted, though she didn't say which companies might be part of the rollout.Longer term, she reckons that other segments of the restaurant industry, including fine-dining establishments, will be users as well.""The model works as a revenue sharing arrangement as sponsorship and gaming revenues pay for the cost of the hardware,"" Collier said.She cites a few advantages of adopting Ziosk technology, including quicker service and higher checks due to an expected increase in the number of drinks and desserts ordered. She also says more kids might convince their parents to patronize Ziosk-enabled restaurants because of the tablet's gaming capabilities.Red Robin set a record stock high of 89.46 on March 24 and currently trades near 84. Brinker set a high of 63.40 on Feb. 19 and currently trades near 60.Both belong to IBD's Retail-Restaurants group, which ranks No. 6 out of 197 industries tracked.

1736,SBUX,"Dunkin' Brands Group (DNKN) delivered its lowest EPS growth in years last quarter and is expected to post only single-digit gains over the next three quarters — but investors still have reason to like the seller of doughnuts and coffee.
"
1737,SBUX,"Dunkin' boasts a strong IBD Composite Rating of 93, has seen its share price rise about 15% since hitting a five-month low Dec. 19, and belongs to a Retail-Restaurant group that ranks No. 9 out of 197 industries that IBD tracks.
"
1738,SBUX,"Those positive signs come even amid slower earnings growth at the Canton, Mass.-based company, which ended a years-long run of double-digit EPS gains by posting a 7% year-over-year increase during its 2014 fourth quarter.
"
1739,SBUX,"Here are three reasons to feel perky about Dunkin':
"
1740,SBUX," Improving comps: In a new research note, analyst Stephen Anderson of Miller Tabak says that he expects Dunkin's same-restaurant sales to accelerate toward the high end of guidance in 2015.
"
1741,SBUX,"He cites a slight rise in menu prices, the introduction of new products such as cold blended drinks, and increased enrollment in Dunkin's DDPerks rewards program — changes that Anderson estimates will add 50 to 75 basis points to 2015 same-restaurant sales.
"
1742,SBUX,"""We also argue that continued job gains and, to a lesser extent, lower gasoline costs will fuel breakfast traffic for the industry,"" Anderson noted.
"
1743,SBUX,"He reckons that Dunkin' can take market share away from rivals such as McDonald's (MCD), in part because the latter company has less wiggle room to offer heavy promotions on coffee and other breakfast and lunch items.
"
1744,SBUX," Lower coffee costs: Even with recent volatility in coffee prices, Dunkin' executives expect year-over-year coffee costs to be flat to down slightly in 2015.
"
1745,SBUX,"""Previously they had expected a slight headwind from coffee costs,"" Anderson noted.
"
1746,SBUX,"Dunkin' doesn't get a direct bottom-line boost from lower coffee costs because almost all of its units are franchised, so the franchisees get the benefit.
"
1747,SBUX,"However, Anderson said, ""We think there will be an indirect benefit as more profitable franchisees accelerate unit expansion.""
"
1748,SBUX,"More units means more franchise revenue for Dunkin'.
"
1749,SBUX," Dunkin' K-Cups: Dunkin' K-Cups' being rolled out in grocery and online channels should be an ""incremental catalyst"" for the company, Anderson said, though probably more for 2016 than 2015.
"
1750,SBUX,"Dunkin' management will wait until the release of its first-quarter results to provide more specific details on expanded distribution of Dunkin' K-Cups, he said. For now, they are distributed exclusively at its Dunkin' Donuts restaurants nationally and at its Baskin-Robbins locations on the West Coast.
"
1751,SBUX,"Dunkin' K-Cups currently contribute about $150 million in total sales for Dunkin', Anderson said: ""Although there is the risk of cannibalization at Dunkin' restaurants, we think there is the potential for DNKN to double K-Cup sales to $300 million through the grocery/retail and online channels.""
"
1752,SBUX,"Meanwhile, coffee powerhouse Starbucks (SBUX) also made news during its annual shareholders meeting Wednesday when it announced a 2-for-1 stock split as well as plans to roll out a new delivery service later this year.

"
1775,SBUX,"The 110,000-square-foot store at 1514 Broadway, with an indoor Ferris wheel and mechanical Tyrannosaurus Rex dinosaur, is too big for any single tenant, said C. Bradley Mendelson, vice chairman at Cushman & Wakefield, who is handling leasing for building-owner Bow Tie Partners. The landlord plans to break up the space, Mendelson said.""The configuration of space is just too expensive for any one tenant,"" Mendelson said. ""Market rates have changed substantially. It has nothing to do with Toys' ability. Toys has been a very good tenant for the last 15, 16 years.""The move reflects rapid rent growth in the Times Square ""bow tie"" — the blocks immediately surrounding the area where Broadway and Seventh Avenue cross, often called the crossroads of the world. Retailers clamoring for access to the square's tourist traffic have been driving rents higher.Rates for ground-floor retail space in the bow tie area averaged $2,317 a square foot in late 2014, higher than anywhere in Manhattan except Fifth Avenue between 49th and 59th streets, according to a report by the Real Estate Board of New York. Three years earlier, the average was $1,433 a square foot.'Proud Resident'Toys R Us has been ""a proud resident of Times Square since our international flagship store opened there,"" Linda Connors, a spokeswoman for the company, said in an emailed statement. ""The lease for our store in Times Square expires in 2016 and, as previously noted, we have been reviewing our lease renewal options. We have not signed a lease agreement for a new location, and any rumors regarding this ongoing process are just that.""The ground floor of 21,000 square feet is being marketed for $2,500 a square foot, its second-floor space for $350 a square foot, and the lower level at $150 a square foot, he said. There are four other retail tenants in the 150,000-square-foot building: Foot Locker (FL) and Swatch stores, a Starbucks (SBUX) coffee shop and the Bond 45 restaurant. Their leases all expire in February, the same time as Toys R Us, he said.Toys R Us may relocate to the retail storefronts across the square at the Marriott Marquis Hotel, where Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) controls the retail portion of the property, according to the Commercial Observer, which reported the retailer's move. Vornado, which owns a stake in the toy retailer, has installed Times Square's largest digital advertising sign above its stores.About 43,000 square feet of retail space are immediately available at the hotel, according to Vornado's website. Wendi Kopsick, a Vornado spokeswoman, said the company would have no comment.The model dinosaur and Ferris wheel are Toys R Us property, and could be used at its new store, ""wherever that may be,"" Mendelson said. There have been discussions with Toys R Us about taking less space but ""nothing ongoing right now"" with the retailer, he said. The Times Square store was a staging area for marketing for the company, which has struggled in competition with the likes of Wal-Mart (WMT) and Amazon.com (AMZN).

1792,SBUX,"Starbucks (SBUX) says it wants its baristas to spark conversations about race. Here's a topic: Its coffee shops help spark local gentrification and home prices, Zillow data show.""Racial inequality is a topic rarely discussed in a corporate setting and seldom encouraged as a coffee shop conversation. That is changing as Starbucks and USA TODAY embark on an initiative called Race Together,"" Starbucks said in a statement Monday.Baristas can now choose to give customers cups with ""Race Together"" or #RaceTogether written on them. The #RaceTogether hashtag trended on Twitter (TWTR), but frequently in mockery. People accused Starbucks of hubris and self-satisfaction and criticized the idea of pressuring service staff to confront customers ordering a Frappuccino.CEO Howard Schultz conceded that the effort won't solve racism, but said in a statement it's an ""opportunity to begin to re-examine how we can create a more empathetic and inclusive society.""However, Starbucks' actual corporate strategy appears to be finding more exclusive areas for new locations. Starbucks stores tend to open in wealthier areas, and those areas see faster home appreciation than other neighborhoods.That's according to Zillow (Z) CEO Spencer Rascoff and chief economist Stan Humphries, authors of ""Zillow Talk: The New Rules of Real Estate.""""Starbucks equates with venti-sized home-value appreciation,"" the Zillow execs wrote in a book excerpt published in Quartz. ""Moreover, Starbucks seems to be fueling — not following — these higher home values.""The typical U.S. home was valued at $102,000 in 1997, rising 65% to $168,000 by 2014. But homes within a quarter mile of a Starbucks appreciated 96% over that span, from $137,000 to $269,000.The authors also studied whether this was a Starbucks effect, or just a generic coffee shop effect. So they looked at homes near Dunkin' Donuts (DNKN). Dunkin-adjacent homes appreciated faster than the national average — 80% — but less than Starbucks-area dwellings.""Whatever the reasons — because they genuinely like drinking coffee, or because they see Starbucks as a proxy for gentrification — it seems pretty clear that people are paying a premium for homes near Starbucks,"" the authors conclude.Moreover, the Starbucks effect isn't just luck, but reflects ""careful, data-driven decisions"" on where to site new coffee shops.Gentrification has many benefits, but it can make neighborhoods unaffordable for poor and moderate-income people and families, many of them minorities.Starbucks said it will talk more about its Race Together initiative at Wednesday's annual shareholder meeting.Given that the coffee shop giant sees a barista-Twitter #hashtag campaign as meaningful action, don't expect Starbucks to consider its own impact.USA Today is owned by publishing giant Gannett (GCI).Follow Ed Carson on Twitter: @IBD_ECarson.

"
2014,SBUX,"Starbucks customers are a loyal bunch — loyal enough to protest the departure of their beloved eggnog latte, prompting the coffee chain to revive the seasonal favorite, and loyal enough to make the company the No. 1 most-expensed restaurant for business travelers.
"
2015,SBUX,"But would they be loyal enough to someday use a Starbucks (SBUX)-brand mobile payment system outside its coffeehouses instead of Apple (AAPL) Pay?
"
2016,SBUX,"Apple may have been able to boast 1 million sign-ups for its e-payment service within three days of launching, but the java giant has long been sitting on an impressive database of coffee lovers — and their credit card information — with its mobile app.
"
2017,SBUX,"Starbucks would join an increasingly competitive field, which includes Google (GOOGL) Wallet, eBay's (EBAY) soon-to-be-spun-off PayPal and CurrentC, a system backed by retail giants like CVS Health (CVS), Rite Aid (RAD) and Wal-Mart (WMT) and set to roll out next year.
"
2018,SBUX,"Of the 7 million weekly transactions that take place at Starbucks registers, 16% are made from a mobile device, CEO Howard Schultz said last month in an earnings call, during which he claimed Starbucks had nabbed nine-tenths of the $1.3 billion mobile payment market last year.
"
2019,SBUX,"""What they're doing with mobile pay is revolutionary, in my opinion,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Nick Setyan told IBD. ""Ninety percent of mobile pay in the U.S. takes place at Starbucks locations. That's a testament to how far ahead of everyone else they are.""
"
2020,SBUX,"And Schultz has hinted that a stand-alone e-payment system may be on the horizon.
"
2021,SBUX,"Starbucks had ""cracked the code"" at connecting mobile payments to customer loyalty, he said during the call.
"
2022,SBUX,"""(W)e are now receiving great interest in partnerships from mobile payment companies who see the value of our rewards program and the mobile payment behavior we established,"" he said, adding that the company would be cautious in choosing partners and how it moves forward.
"
2023,SBUX,"""But I can assure you that Starbucks will have a major role to play, both inside and outside of our stores as the nascent mobile payment industry evolves.""
"
2024,SBUX,"While no definitive details are out, the move wouldn't be a complete surprise to some, given Starbucks' acquisition of Evolution Fresh, launch of Evolution Fresh bars and trail mix, and purchase of the La Boulange bakery chain.
"
2025,SBUX,"""If you look at what Starbucks has been doing the past five years, one thing becomes clear: It wants to control its own destiny and own its ecosystem,"" said Belus Capital Advisors' Brian Sozzi via email.
"
2026,SBUX,"When asked if the coffee chain could give the tech behemoth a run for its money, he replied: ""Yes, indeed. Starbucks has become our daily habit, something we constantly think about ... almost as much as using our iPhone.""
"
2027,SBUX,"Not A 'Reasonable Investment'
"
2028,SBUX,"Yet creating an Apple Pay-like system from the ground up would be a different beast than simply connecting rewards accounts to credit cards, and instead would involve banks and plenty of compliance hoops to jump through.
"
2029,SBUX,"""To develop a stand-alone payment system is. . . not a reasonable investment"" on Starbucks' part, said analyst Setyan, who said the only benefit would be lower transaction-processing costs. Taking it to the mainstream would be a ""big, big, big process.
"
2030,SBUX,"""From my point of view, I just think it's not the best use of their time,"" he said.
"
2031,SBUX,"Wedbush Securities' Gil Luria agrees. While he also called mobile order-and-pay ""a revolutionary step,"" he was less optimistic about the idea of a stand-alone system, calling it an ""uphill battle"" and questioning why issuers and banks would want to cut the coffee chain in on the action.
"
2032,SBUX,"And consumers?
"
2033,SBUX,"""Just because they want to use a Starbucks card at Starbucks doesn't mean they want to use a Starbucks card anywhere else,"" he said.
"
2034,SBUX,"Siren Song
"
2035,SBUX,"But those skeptical of the green mermaid's devotees should also keep in mind that her siren song has made consumers do crazier things than sign up for an e-pay service. Starbucks memorably sold all 1,000 of its $450 rose-gold metal gift cards within minutes last year, and may very well sell out again with this season's $110 Swarovski-studded tumblers and $200 sterling silver cards — which notably only come loaded with $50.
"
2036,SBUX,"In the meantime, Starbucks is keeping customers caffeinated with order-ahead and delivery pilot programs in a digital push that's more about e-commerce than coffee.
"
2037,SBUX,"Starbucks' mobile order-and-pay service launches in Portland in December, allowing customers to order their Venti mochas and Grande Fizzios by smartphone and pick them up in stores. It will expand nationwide next year.
"
2038,SBUX,"""Going forward, what they're doing with mobile order-and-pay should give them a leg up,"" said Wedbush's Setyan, noting in an Oct. 31 report that he sees order-and-pay and the delivery pilot as ""potential game changers in FY15.""
"
2039,SBUX,"The order-ahead program could also help streamline in-store foot traffic as the company expands its food and drink selection to items like wine and tapas-style plates in select cities. Sozzi thinks mobile pay and deliveries could ease pressure on lines as Starbucks' menu gets larger and more complex.
"
2040,SBUX,"With more purchases moving online, CEO Schultz has made clear his concerns about a ""seismic shift in consumer behavior."" His answer to that appears to be a delivery program in certain markets in the latter half of 2015.
"
2041,SBUX,"""Imagine the ability to create a standing order of Starbucks delivered, hot or iced, to your desk daily. That's our version of e-commerce on steroids,"" said Schultz during the call.
"
2042,SBUX,"Of course, there are plenty of potential obstacles involved with delivery, including quality control — how well will that latte survive a cross-town trip in the dead of winter? — and the resources and manpower involved in rolling out such an ambitious undertaking.
"
2043,SBUX,"""It's very early days at this, but we are moving ahead — full steam ahead,"" said Starbucks Global Chief Strategy Officer Matt Ryan during the call. ""The pilots are coming soon.""
"
2044,SBUX,"The company said capital expenditures will be ""somewhat higher"" at $1.4 billion for fiscal 2015 as it invests more in the mobile order-and-pay program, store growth and evening stores.
"
2045,SBUX,"Analysts don't seem concerned.
"
2046,SBUX,"""If anyone can do it, it's Starbucks,"" said Wedbush's Setyan.Starbucks customers are a loyal bunch — loyal enough to protest the departure of their beloved eggnog latte, prompting the coffee chain to revive the seasonal favorite, and loyal enough to make the company the No. 1 most-expensed restaurant for business travelers.But would they be loyal enough to someday use a Starbucks (SBUX)-brand mobile payment system outside its coffeehouses instead of Apple (AAPL) Pay?Apple may have been able to boast 1 million sign-ups for its e-payment service within three days of launching, but the java giant has long been sitting on an impressive database of coffee lovers — and their credit card information — with its mobile app.Starbucks would join an increasingly competitive field, which includes Google (GOOGL) Wallet, eBay's (EBAY) soon-to-be-spun-off PayPal and CurrentC, a system backed by retail giants like CVS Health (CVS), Rite Aid (RAD) and Wal-Mart (WMT) and set to roll out next year.Of the 7 million weekly transactions that take place at Starbucks registers, 16% are made from a mobile device, CEO Howard Schultz said last month in an earnings call, during which he claimed Starbucks had nabbed nine-tenths of the $1.3 billion mobile payment market last year.""What they're doing with mobile pay is revolutionary, in my opinion,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Nick Setyan told IBD.

"
2056,SBUX,"To boost the bottom line, Aruba had announced in the last quarter that it would cut staff by 4%, or 70 employees, and relocate another 4% to lower-cost locations.

2058,SBUX,"""They had a really good July quarter and a good October quarter. Just when you think there's a winning streak, they came out with guidance that was a bit disappointing,"" said analyst Jason Ader of William Blair. ""They are running into an expectations challenge. The margins are expanding, but the revenue (guidance) is a little light — just enough to question the sustainability.""
"
2059,SBUX,"Though most of its business is in the U.S., Aruba sells overseas as well. And in the post-earnings conference call, management cited challenging sales in Asia.

And in the post-earnings conference call, management cited challenging sales in Asia.But operating margin of 21.8% was well up from last year's 16.2%, prompting analyst Mark Sue of RBC Capital Markets to note that Aruba is able to contain spending while growing the top line.""The quarter was pretty strong, considering the environment was a little mixed,"" he said.Taking Share From CiscoSunnyvale, Calif.-based Aruba says it has been taking share in the $5 billion enterprise Wi-Fi networking market from larger rival Cisco Systems (CSCO), as evidenced by its much faster revenue growth than Cisco's over the last year.""The Wi-Fi market is growing in the mid-teens. Aruba is growing faster,"" Sue said.Aruba also competes with smaller companies such as Aerohive Networks (HIVE) and Ruckus Wireless (RKUS).Earlier this month, Aruba said that it would expand into indoor location-specific mobile marketing, using Aruba Beacons, a Bluetooth sensor technology.Marketing departments in retail, hospitality, sports venues and others can use Aruba's technology to relay promotions, product location and other information in real time to customers' Android and iPhone devices.

2103,SBUX,"Let the gobbling begin. Turkey Day signals tasty sales, and service with a smile sticks to shoppers' ribs.• Wine and dine.  Capturing consumer interest isn't enough. Businesses must offer a great experience to keep them coming back.That's one takeaway from a recent survey by Tenet Partners, a brand innovation and marketing consultancy. ""More than half of consumers surveyed said they stopped using a brand because of poor service,"" Tenet CEO Hampton Bridwell told IBD.• Be gracious. The study looked at brand performance for Apple (AAPL) Best Buy (BBY), J.C. Penney (JCP), McDonald's (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), Target (TGT), Verizon (VZ) and Wendy's (WEN).It takes time, money and effort to build a good name, ""but it's all wasted whenever a customer encounters bad service,"" Bridwell said.Being helpful, knowledgeable and caring increases a brand's value to consumers. ""This is especially important to keep in mind during the holiday season, as employees and customers are stressed and impatient,"" Bridwell said.• Serve it up. There's no more harried day than Black Friday.""Many shoppers set up their day as a mission,"" said Kevin Leifer, vice president with customer service consultancy ICC/Decision Services. Make it easier by putting deals front and center, instead of burying them in the store's back.• Fill the table. More retailers are slashing prices beyond Black Friday. Those planning door-buster specials are wise to offer alternatives for items in short supply. Some big boxes like Wal-Mart (WMT) guarantee product availability during specific sale times, and offer to ship the product for free when on-site supplies run out. Not every retailer can follow through like that, but ""let's have a prepared list of options,"" Leifer said.• Manage expectations. If quantities are limited, say so in ads.You might make a few customers happy with a rare deal, but ""you're disappointing far more than you're satisfying,"" Leifer said.• Make it clear. Be precise about pricing. Customers get annoyed trying to guess what the deal is — or finding out the numbers are different at the register. ""You want to be completely transparent for your customers,"" Leifer said.• Mind manners. Teach employees — especially newbies helping out at holidays time — how to treat shoppers. ""You can't forget the basics of customer interaction,"" Leifer said. ""Every one of those touch points, that is the brand.""• Keep good company.  Smart retailers employ the cream of the crop. ""You're hiring for attitude, not skills. If an applicant doesn't smile during the job interview, don't hire him."" So advised John Tschohl, customer service expert and author of ""Moving Up.""• Chat them up. ""This is your chance to make a hell of a first impression,"" said Tschohl.Teach workers to introduce themselves and address customers by name. Doing so makes the experience more personable.""You cannot own the customer only on price. There are too many options out there,"" he said. ""People buy relationships.""• Solve sticky situations. Give frontline workers tools to keep cool when tempers flare. ""Most employees have never been trained to handle irate customers,"" Tschohl said. Empower staff to make decisions in the moment.Then back them up.""The number one reason people will not use empowerment is because they know in their hearts they will lose their jobs,"" Tschohl said.• End with gratitude. ""It does not take extra time,"" said Tschohl, ""to smile and say: 'Thank you for coming.'""

2104,SBUX,"Uber's decision this summer to release its application programming interface (API) could be a game changer for the travel industry.An API is software code that lets other applications and websites easily integrate each other's functionality.By making its API public, Uber lets customers book rides directly from TripAdvisor (TRIP), Hyatt Hotels (H), United Airlines (UAL) and a handful of other apps and sites, including Starbucks (SBUX).Previously, ""shared services"" providers like Uber and its rival taxi service Lyft, as well as private-accommodations marketplaces such as Airbnb and HomeAway (AWAY), distributed their listings directly to consumers only through their websites and mobile apps.Shared services offer convenience but also have brought legal and regulatory issues.Still, the integration of shared services into the listings of TripAdvisor and other online travel agencies, or OTAs, promises more wide-ranging implications.And we can expect to see a lot more activity on this front, says a longtime industry observer.""Just as department stores change their merchandise mix, you'll see OTAs evolve similarly,"" said Henry Harteveldt, co-founder of Atmosphere Research, a travel industry advisory firm.Harteveldt says that OTAs have to offer shared services if they want their customers to find what they're looking for, since they are increasingly looking for Uber and Lyft rides and private accommodations via Airbnb and HomeAway.""Those companies are reshaping how people travel,"" he said.Lyft Could Follow SuitUber is the only one of the above firms to have released a public API. Observers expect that Lyft will have to respond in kind.Airbnb and HomeAway have built APIs for specific partners but have yet to release public code.Harteveldt says his research indicates that 12% of leisure travelers stay at least once a year at a rented condo or home, the types of places that people book with Airbnb or HomeAway.""That's definitely a noticeable number, and the OTAs are taking steps to embrace that,"" Harteveldt said. ""They do not want to be left out of the loop.""OTAs decline to discuss a topic that's touchy with hotel chains, car rental agencies and their other longtime partners.Online travel leaders Expedia (EXPE) and Priceline (PCLN), which have not adopted the Uber API, didn't respond to requests for comment.TripAdvisor spokeswoman Erin Millard said via email that the company wouldn't comment on strategy, revealing only that the firm's integration with Uber is a commission-based relationship.But John Samuel, a senior vice president at Sabre (SABR), a travel industry tech provider and parent of online travel agency Travelocity, suggests that the playing field could get crowded sooner rather than later.Samuel runs Sabre's fast-growing TripCase travel itinerary-management app.In response to a question about linking with Airbnb, Samuel implied that TripCase — which is among the apps that have integrated with Uber — is investigating how to integrate with other shared accommodations providers.""We are having lots and lots of conversations with everybody,"" Samuel said.While the taxi industry and government officials in the U.S. and other countries are trying to deal with the impact of Uber and Lyft, the growing prospect of online travel sites exposing travelers to shared-services alternatives is certainly causing consternation at car rental firms and hotels, all of which reluctantly pay healthy commissions to OTAs in exchange for the bookings that they generate.""I'm sure there are some very tough negotiations that will take place between traditional hotel companies and the OTAs over the fact that OTAs are selling these alternative accommodations,"" said Harteveldt. ""If I was the brand manager or CEO of a major hotel company where we already have issues working with OTAs because of perceived high costs, I would not be at all happy to hear them say they'll be selling alternative services.""Travel Agencies Must AdaptBut traditional travel services providers will have to adapt, says Harteveldt. He points out that shared services like Uber and Airbnb have become popular with younger, tech-savvy travelers. Sabre's Samuel argues that the proverbial genie is out of the bottle.""Mobile unlocked an opportunity in travel that didn't exist before, and that's to connect with a traveler in a pretty sophisticated way while they're traveling,"" he said. ""We know when you've gotten off your flight, and we know what hotel you're staying at, so it's only logical that we offer Uber as a complimentary service.""But travel industry observers don't expect shared service providers to duplicate the OTA-centric models of hotels and rental car companies. They prefer that customers use their smartphones to deal with Uber or Airbnb directly.""Shared services won't ever let themselves be reliant on OTAs,"" Harteveldt said. ""They want the majority of business to come directly from consumers.""In other words, the Ubers and Airbnbs of the world are likely to approach their integration efforts with online travel agencies as incremental revenue streams.

Quite naturally, these companies also tend to show the most rapid growth in earnings and sales in the market.Although there is a phenomenal amount of innovation occurring right now in the high-tech field, don't fall into the trap of thinking innovation is limited only to technology companies.Among the market's most innovative headliners, automaker Tesla Motors (TSLA) easily holds its own beside names like Facebook (FB) and GoPro (GPRO).Not so many years ago, groundbreaking tech name Google (GOOGL) went public shortly ahead of another innovative concept, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG).Going back even further, two pioneers in their fields, Qualcomm (QCOM) and Starbucks (SBUX), went public within six months of each other at the start of the 1990s.To understand the actual technology from companies like Qualcomm or Aruba Networks (ARUN), investors often must read extensively as well as learn from the insights provided by analysts and others familiar with the technology. That's where IBD's New America and Internet & Technology sections come in.For more consumer-oriented offerings, first-hand experience is often the best way for an investor to determine just how innovative their target company is.No matter how innovative the firm, fundamentals always count. Keep in mind that innovative companies often make for lousy stocks. An innovative product is only one ingredient of a successful stock. Management must come up with an enlightened business plan, and then execute at high levels to manage finances, workforce, production, distribution, sales and marketing, and the company's network of suppliers.Debt, return on equity, profit margins and cash flow are all key metrics to track, along with sales and earnings. Support by mutual funds is also crucial. Do a fast check of all these gauges by using Stock Checkup on Investors.com and the research tables in the paper (starting on this page).General Electric (GE), with its nuclear facilities engineering, jet engines, sea water filtration and wind energy technologies, is a jewel in the U.S. crown as a leading innovator. But its sales have not increased in almost five years. The stock trades 36% below a 2007 peak of 42.15 and deep in the shadows of its record high in 2000.Even the best growth names aren't always a thrill a minute. Apple (AAPL) introduced its highly innovative and successful iPod in October 2001, nearly three years before the stock broke out in August 2004 and took off for good.

2128,SBUX,"Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) sales growth over the last decade is the highest across the ""quick service/fast casual"" segments, Wells Fargo analyst Jeff Farmer said in a report.System sales have jumped at a 25.2% compound annual rate from 2003 to 2013, according to his analysis of data from QSR Magazine.The next fastest-growing restaurants include sub and sandwich chain Jimmy John's (24.2%), burger and fries chain Five Guys (22.9%), fast-casual sandwich restaurant Panera Bread (PNRA) (15.9%) and Chinese eatery Panda Express (15.2%).""Even more impressive for Chipotle is that average unit volume growth accounted for more than 600 (basis points) of the 25.2% compound annual growth rate,"" Farmer noted.Shares of the burrito chain were down 1% on the stock market today.Chipotle is also among the biggest market-share gainers in the past decade, adding 1.6 percentage points. But it trails Starbucks' (SBUX) 3.7-point increase and Subway's 2.1-point gain.Chipotle's earnings per share have grown at a double-digit rate six quarters in a row. Consensus of 28 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters is for a 43% pop in EPS for the current quarter.The chain is growing fast in part because of the rising popularity of Mexican food. The taste for Mexican is also driving fast growth for El Pollo Loco (LOCO), which launched its initial public offering in late July.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar .

2146,SBUX,"It's obvious when you look around coffee spots, classrooms, even corporate offices: the smartphone and tablet boom is making wired connections look passe for most uses.Following the lead of their employees, businesses and institutions are cutting the Ethernet cord.They're making Wi-Fi connectivity to the Internet a bigger part of their culture and mission. And they need infrastructure to do that.Enter Aruba Networks (ARUN), which bills itself as a pure-play in enterprise wireless networking.The company's chief products are access points — they're the small boxes mounted on or near ceilings, roughly one for every 100-square feet of coverage — and larger controllers that manage them.Aruba adds software to the access points that makes Wi-Fi connectivity ""smart, fast and secure,"" says the firm's chief marketing officer, Ben Gibson.Gearing Up GoogleSome large companies have thousands of access points. Aruba has enabled Wi-Fi connectivity at Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) offices, Starbucks' (SBUX) cafes and numerous colleges, grade schools and hospitals, among other venues.""Wherever Wi-Fi is mission-critical, that's where Aruba wants to play,"" said Jason Ader, an analyst with William Blair & Co.Aruba, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., has around 30,000 customers worldwide — and counting. Most of its revenue comes from the U.S. The three largest sectors it sells to are education, corporate and health care, especially hospitals.The $5 billion enterprise Wi-Fi networking market is growing around 15% a year, Ader says. Aruba's revenue has been growing about twice that much recently.In its fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, ended July 30, revenue jumped 33% from a year earlier to $202.9 million. The previous quarter it had grown 28% year-over-year.Aruba isn't the largest player in wireless networking. It's No. 2 to computer networking giant Cisco Systems (CSCO), which has many business lines under its vast scope, some of which address the wired world.Citing data from research firm Gartner, Aruba says Cisco has 47.5% market share to Aruba's 15%.""But in the past year we have been gaining share,"" Gibson said.He points to the firm's 33% year-over-year revenue growth in the last quarter vs. Cisco's 4% for its wireless business.""We're catching up. We're the challenger in this market,"" he said.But some investors have had concerns about Aruba's ability to keep growing at such robust rates, Ader says. Their concerns: potential commoditization of products, Cisco competition and an inconsistent earnings record.Ader thinks all three concerns are likely overblown and that Aruba is addressing each of them.Not only has Aruba been gaining share from Cisco in the last couple of quarters, he says, but the presence of strong margins by Aruba and others in wireless networking ""flies in the face"" of commoditization arguments.""Gross margin tends to be an indicator of pricing pressure, and the gross margins have been strong across the board in the industry. There is zero evidence of any kind of commoditization,"" he said.At 70% to 73%, Aruba's gross margins are even stronger than rivals, among them smaller playersAerohive Networks (HIVE) and Ruckus Wireless (RKUS).And in the last quarter, Aruba's operating margin hit the company's goal of 20%. That led management to raise its forecast for the current fiscal year to 21% to 22%, from 19% to 20% previously.Gigabit Wi-Fi SpeedsGibson adds that Aruba's ""value-add"" and ""premium"" solutions keep prices up. Also, wireless equipment vendors are making products for a new, faster networking standard known as 802.11ac.Products using the new standard allow for the fastest wireless connectivity available. Aruba's CEO Dominic Orr said in the recent Q4 conference call that products built to the standard accounted for 37% of total access-point shipments in the quarter, up from 18% two quarters ago. Such growth, he said, ""highlights the share gains we are making in this rapidly growing portion of the market.""Prices tend to stay high in the early stages but trend down as the cycle matures. ""Cycles tend to last three to five years and we're early in the cycle,"" Gibson said.Aruba's earnings have bounced around. In the fourth quarter ended in July, they jumped 100% to 24 cents a share. That beat analysts' estimates, as did revenue. For the full fiscal year of 2014, earnings rose 22% to 77 cents a share. They fell 2% the prior year.Management said it expects earnings of 24-25 cents per share in the current quarter, a gain of 50% to 56% over last year. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate full-year earnings will grow 43% to $1.10 a share.Aruba announced it would cut costs by laying off 4% of its workforce (about 70 employees). It plans to relocate another 4% to lower-cost locations in India, Ireland and Portland, Ore. ""This past quarter was somewhat of an inflection point in terms of investors understanding that management is very focused on the bottom line and not just revenue growth,"" Ader said.Revenue has been growing from new customer wins and from existing customers' upgrades and network expansions, Gibson says.Aruba sells through a global network of resellers and its own sales force, who work with larger customers. In the U.S., the federal government's recent order for an additional $5 billion in Wi-Fi funding to outfit needy schools over the next five years will likely provide another boost to Wi-Fi equipment vendors, analysts say.Pacific Crest analyst Ryan Hutchinson noted in a report that federal contract wins should provide new opportunities for three vendors in particular: Aruba, Ruckus and especially Aerohive, which derives nearly half of its revenue from education accounts.But the biggest growth driver will likely end up being the rising usage of smartphones and tablets in and out of the workplace, analysts say.""People want portability. They want freedom,"" Ader said.

"
2150,SBUX,"Late Tuesday, two key industry sales indexes were released, showing that August sales trends improved ""considerably"" from the very weak trend of the past several months, Derrington noted.
"
2151,SBUX,"""While both the Knapp Track Casual Dining Index and Black Box Intelligence Sales indices have been especially volatile in recent months, the August improvement potentially could mark a period of improving industry sales possibly through next summer as the industry laps especially weak trends from last year,"" Derrington wrote. ""With the modestly improving macro economic backdrop, including improvements in consumer confidence and sentiment, these improved August industry trends could potentially usher in a period of improving industry SSS (same-store-sales) through summer 2015.""
"
2152,SBUX,"Casual-dining restaurant operators Red Robin (RRGB) and Brinker International (EAT) are also among Derrington's favorite picks — he rates each a buy.
"
2153,SBUX,"The Black Box Intelligence (BBI) overall Industry Index improved significantly for August, with same-store sales for the month's index up 2.1%, with traffic down 0.5%. Derrington says this was the strongest BBI industry same-store sales performance since February 2012. On a two-year basis, August same-store sales improved 230 basis point to +1.9% vs. the July two-year trend of -0.4%.
"
2154,SBUX,"Derrington also points out: ""The BBI index, which collects a broader cross-section of industry sales data from fast-food, fast-casual, and casual dining restaurant companies, also faces relatively easy comparisons through June 2015, lapping relatively flat nominal SSS through next summer,"" Derrington said.
"
2155,SBUX,"The improved industry trends follow ""very weak and volatile"" same-store-sales trends of both June and July, Derrington noted. He says the two months were believed to have been impacted by factors such as weak consumer spending, delayed school dismissals in June, and the much wetter and cooler weather in both June and July vs. last year's unusually hot summer.

2159,SBUX,"The improved industry showing in August came despite weakness from the industry's biggest player, McDonald's.

2160,SBUX,"Attention shoppers: Apple on Tuesday unveiled tap-to-pay technology for using iPhones to buy things.
"
2161,SBUX,"The company said ""Apple Pay"" will be available in October as a free update to its iOS 8 software.
"
2162,SBUX,"Apple's (AAPL) push into mobile payments isn't expected to power earnings growth, analyst say. But Apple's digital wallet will likely re-energize the iOS ecosystem's cool factor, amid rising smartphone competition. That, of course, depends on how many iPhone users tap-to-pay, instead of pulling out cash or swiping credit cards in retail stores.
"
2163,SBUX,"Apple didn't disclose terms with credit-card companies that will support the payment system. JPMorgan speculates Apple may collect a small transaction fee, perhaps pennies, each time iPhone users wave their device to pay at check-out terminals.
"
2164,SBUX,"Apple is taking on Google (GOOGL), eBay's (EBAY) PayPal, retail consortium MCX, phone companies and others in mobile payments.
"
2165,SBUX,"U.S. consumers have been slow to embrace digital wallets, partly over security concerns. Worries over credit-card security have been heightened by data thefts at Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD) and others. Apple, stung by last week's celebrity-photo hacking scandal involving iCloud data storage, aims to win over shoppers, retailers and credit-card firms with its approach to protecting consumer financial data and limiting fraud.
"
2166,SBUX,"""Security is at the core of (Apple) Pay, but so is privacy,"" Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet software and services, said at Apple's product unveiling event Tuesday, taking a shot at Google. ""Apple doesn't know what you bought, where you bought it or any other details about the transaction. And the cashier doesn't even see your name.""
"
2167,SBUX,"Apple's security measures include ""TouchID"" fingerprint authentication technology to log in and verify users. IPhones will generate single-use, random digital code during transactions, instead of transmitting 16-digit credit-card numbers to store check-out systems. A ""secure element"" chip stores encrypted data.
"
2168,SBUX,"NFC Rollout Will Get Boost
"
2169,SBUX,"Apple Pay uses near-field communications, a short-range wireless technology, to send data to payment readers. Analysts say just 15% to 20% of U.S. retail locations have NFC-equipped sales terminals, but Apple's push into mobile payments could speed NFC adoption.
"
2170,SBUX,"Aside from its ability to build easy-to-use devices, one of Apple's strengths in the payments field is the more than 800 million credit cards on file in iTunes app store accounts. IPhone users will be able to load eligible credit cards into the Passport app.
"
2171,SBUX,"IPhone users are prime candidates for ushering in the mobile wallet age, says Jordan McKee, an analyst at 451 Research.
"
2172,SBUX,"""Not only do iPhone owners earn more than their Android counterparts, they also spend more,"" McKee told IBD. ""IPhone owners are the most advanced users of mobile transaction services across a wealth of categories. An iWallet would simply be a natural extension of how iPhone owners already use their devices.
"
2173,SBUX,"""The number of iTunes accounts has ballooned from 575 million to 800 million in a year, with many of those accounts having a credit or debit card associated with them. While most vendors are clutching at straws for new ways to increase cards on file, Apple trumps them from day one by a significant factor.""
"
2174,SBUX,"Apple, which acquired Beats Electronics' music streaming service in May for $ 3.2 billion, aims to diversify from hardware into services.
"
2175,SBUX,"At around a penny per transaction, Apple's payment revenue would amount to a few hundred million dollars annually, analysts estimate. A JPMorgan report says the ""impact to Apple's earnings would be immaterial.""
"
2176,SBUX,"McDonald's, Macy's On Board
"
2177,SBUX,"Apple's biggest benefit would be ""significant platform lock-in"" amid fierce competition from Google-Android based smartphones and other rivals, JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall said. Mobile payments, said Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider in a report, will ""increase the stickiness of the iOS platform over time.""
"
2178,SBUX,"Apple says its payment system will work with Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) and American Express (AXP), as well as credit cards from six banks.
"
2179,SBUX,"Apple Pay can be used at McDonald's (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), Macy's (M), Bloomingdale's, Walgreen (WAG), Walt Disney (DIS), Staples (SPLS), Duane Reade and Subway. Some 22,000 retailers are equipped to accept the payment system, Apple said.
"
2180,SBUX,"Some speculate that Apple may launch a rewards program with partners to encourage use of the payment system. Analysts say it's unclear if Apple will be able to garner revenue from advertising or special product offers.
"
2181,SBUX,"Retailers have been testing Apple's iBeacon wireless technology, which provides customer location data in stores. Analysts say retailers hope to whisk coupons or other discounts to shoppers via iBeacon.
"
2182,SBUX,"Analysts say Apple made a good move in teaming with credit card companies. Visa, MasterCard and American Express have a strong presence in the mobile market. Almost all mobile wallets today rely on credit-card networks to authorize and clear payments, says Goldman Sachs. PayPal, which uses a clearinghouse system set up by banks, has more than half of transactions linked to traditional credit cards.
"
2183,SBUX,"Apple has taken years to cobble together a digital payments strategy. It bought security firm AuthenTec in 2012 and began testing iBeacon last year. But mobile wallets are off to a slow start.
"
2184,SBUX,"PayPal has tried to expand its online payment processing business into retail stores. Consumers with PayPal accounts use a plastic card or mobile phone number and PIN combination to make purchases at checkout.
"
2185,SBUX,"Yet, fewer than 5% of PayPal's nearly 120 million online users are forecast to use its retail payment system by 2015.
"
2186,SBUX,"MCX, a consortium backed by Wal-Mart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY) and 60 other retailers, might not be ready to launch its smartphone-based digital wallet until 2015, analysts say. MCX members hope long term to reduce the credit-card transaction fees they now pay, analysts say.
"
2187,SBUX,"A mobile payments joint venture formed by AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and T-Mobile US (TMUS), rebranded as Softcard last week, has struggled to gain traction.

JPMorgan speculates Apple may collect a small transaction fee, perhaps pennies, each time iPhone users wave their device to pay at check-out terminals.Apple is taking on Google (GOOGL), eBay's (EBAY) PayPal, retail consortium MCX, phone companies and others in mobile payments.U.S. consumers have been slow to embrace digital wallets, partly over security concerns. Worries over credit-card security have been heightened by data thefts at Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD) and others. Apple, stung by last week's celebrity-photo hacking scandal involving iCloud data storage, aims to win over shoppers, retailers and credit-card firms with its approach to protecting consumer financial data and limiting fraud.""Security is at the core of (Apple) Pay, but so is privacy,"" Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet software and services, said at Apple's product unveiling event Tuesday, taking a shot at Google. ""Apple doesn't know what you bought, where you bought it or any other details about the transaction. And the cashier doesn't even see your name.""Apple's security measures include ""TouchID"" fingerprint authentication technology to log in and verify users. IPhones will generate single-use, random digital code during transactions, instead of transmitting 16-digit credit-card numbers to store check-out systems. A ""secure element"" chip stores encrypted data.NFC Rollout Will Get BoostApple Pay uses near-field communications, a short-range wireless technology, to send data to payment readers. Analysts say just 15% to 20% of U.S. retail locations have NFC-equipped sales terminals, but Apple's push into mobile payments could speed NFC adoption.Aside from its ability to build easy-to-use devices, one of Apple's strengths in the payments field is the more than 800 million credit cards on file in iTunes app store accounts. IPhone users will be able to load eligible credit cards into the Passport app.IPhone users are prime candidates for ushering in the mobile wallet age, says Jordan McKee, an analyst at 451 Research.""Not only do iPhone owners earn more than their Android counterparts, they also spend more,"" McKee told IBD. ""IPhone owners are the most advanced users of mobile transaction services across a wealth of categories. An iWallet would simply be a natural extension of how iPhone owners already use their devices.""The number of iTunes accounts has ballooned from 575 million to 800 million in a year, with many of those accounts having a credit or debit card associated with them. While most vendors are clutching at straws for new ways to increase cards on file, Apple trumps them from day one by a significant factor.""Apple, which acquired Beats Electronics' music streaming service in May for $ 3.2 billion, aims to diversify from hardware into services.At around a penny per transaction, Apple's payment revenue would amount to a few hundred million dollars annually, analysts estimate. A JPMorgan report says the ""impact to Apple's earnings would be immaterial.""McDonald's, Macy's On BoardApple's biggest benefit would be ""significant platform lock-in"" amid fierce competition from Google-Android based smartphones and other rivals, JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall said. Mobile payments, said Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider in a report, will ""increase the stickiness of the iOS platform over time.""Apple says its payment system will work with Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) and American Express (AXP), as well as credit cards from six banks.Apple Pay can be used at McDonald's (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), Macy's (M), Bloomingdale's, Walgreen (WAG), Walt Disney (DIS), Staples (SPLS), Duane Reade and Subway. Some 22,000 retailers are equipped to accept the payment system, Apple said.Some speculate that Apple may launch a rewards program with partners to encourage use of the payment system. Analysts say it's unclear if Apple will be able to garner revenue from advertising or special product offers.Retailers have been testing Apple's iBeacon wireless technology, which provides customer location data in stores. Analysts say retailers hope to whisk coupons or other discounts to shoppers via iBeacon.Analysts say Apple made a good move in teaming with credit card companies. Visa, MasterCard and American Express have a strong presence in the mobile market. Almost all mobile wallets today rely on credit-card networks to authorize and clear payments, says Goldman Sachs. PayPal, which uses a clearinghouse system set up by banks, has more than half of transactions linked to traditional credit cards.Apple has taken years to cobble together a digital payments strategy. It bought security firm AuthenTec in 2012 and began testing iBeacon last year. But mobile wallets are off to a slow start.PayPal has tried to expand its online payment processing business into retail stores. Consumers with PayPal accounts use a plastic card or mobile phone number and PIN combination to make purchases at checkout.Yet, fewer than 5% of PayPal's nearly 120 million online users are forecast to use its retail payment system by 2015.MCX, a consortium backed by Wal-Mart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY) and 60 other retailers, might not be ready to launch its smartphone-based digital wallet until 2015, analysts say. MCX members hope long term to reduce the credit-card transaction fees they now pay, analysts say.A mobile payments joint venture formed by AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and T-Mobile US (TMUS), rebranded as Softcard last week, has struggled to gain traction.The three firms formed the joint venture in 2011, but early partners Barclays and Capital One (COF) have backed out of the venture.

2233,SBUX,"A stock investment doesn't end the moment you buy shares.A purchase is just the start of a process that requires investors to make adjustments to control risk and enhance rewards.Here's how the process works:The starting point is the initial purchase. If you plan on investing $10,000 in a stock that breaks out of a sound base at 50, consider starting with half of the total investment as your foundation. In other words, buy 100 shares.Spend the other $5,000 making a couple of additional purchases as the stock moves up. The second purchase could be worth $3,000 in additional shares, and the final purchase worth the remaining $2,000. When do you make those follow-up buys?Look for secondary entries in the stock's chart. A primary one is when shares pull back to the 50-day or 10-week moving average and rebound in robust fashion. (Another way is to add shares as the stock rises a few percentage points from the buy point, a concept that was discussed in Monday's column.)Another important part of managing a new purchase is to sell part of your shares if the stock is not working out. For example, you might need to sell a portion of your shares if the stock starts trading below its 50-day line. Sell the higher-priced shares first.If the stock falls 7% or 8% below the primary buy point, you must sell all shares to cut losses short.In the week ended Oct. 14, 2011, Starbucks (SBUX) broke out of a choppy cup with loose handle at 42.10, 10 cents above the handle's high of 42. Volume was light, yet the coffee-chain giant was a tempting choice, having recorded impressive earnings growth and accelerating sales growth in the most recent quarters.At the breakout, investors had their chance to make a first purchase. After climbing 6% from the buy point to 44.69, Starbucks eased to its 10-week moving average 1. Volume was thin 2, a good sign. But the new buy point near 41.35 was lower than the original buy point, so this was not a proper time to buy. It's key to average up in price, not down.A couple of weeks later, a light pullback to the 10-week line near 43 3 provided a proper follow-on entry. The stock dipped no more than 3.7% below the original 42.10 entry, so there was never a sell rule.Starbucks gained 47% by April 2012. In May, it made a decisive break below the 10-week line. That triggered a sell signal and capped the investing cycle.

2234,SBUX,"Whether you're running a startup or you've inherited the family store, you need to sharpen your entrepreneurial mindset constantly, says Lloyd Shefsky, innovation expert and author of ""Invent, Reinvent, Thrive.""""Every business has to be reinvented,"" he told IBD. ""Part of being a good manager is knowing you have to change the business.""How to stay inspired:• Notice. ""Every time you see somebody struggling, there's an opportunity,"" Shefsky advised.Case: Tom Stemberg launched retail giant Staples (SPLS) after getting frustrated. He was trying to finish a project during a holiday weekend and couldn't get a typewriter ribbon. At that time, most businesspeople had to get supplies from small, specialty stores.The glitch? They were pricey and closed at times when plenty of office types were still hard at work.• Update. ""The industry was entrenched in antiquated thinking,"" said Shefsky, who profiled Stemberg in his book. ""Tom saw great opportunity in their status-quo outlook. He wouldn't just think outside the box; he would reinvent the box.""Stemberg built Staples to stay open longer and put consumers and small businesses in touch with manufacturers — while plenty of experts told him he couldn't reinvent the existing business model.• Believe. ""Successful entrepreneurs always accentuate the positive and know when to be deaf to their nattering nabobs,"" Shefsky said.In the early 1980s, Howard Schultz was jazzed about espresso. He visualized a high-end coffee shop on every corner — Starbucks (SBUX). The problem? More than 200 investors couldn't stomach the idea. They told him his concept would never work.• Connect. Schultz kept doing his homework, visiting cafes in Europe to try to better explain his notion to investors. ""He saw the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle, together with the picture on the puzzle box cover,"" Shefsky said. ""The naysayers saw different pictures, making it difficult for them to imagine the pieces coming together as Howard knew they could.""• Get with it. Schultz told Shefsky that it wasn't until he realized that he wasn't exactly selling coffee but an atmosphere in which to hang out and work that his concept started to catch on.• Listen. Peanut galleries can fire up your innovation engines and push you to crystallize your plan, Shefsky noted: ""Due diligence isn't just to satisfy investors. It also should convince the entrepreneur.""• Ask. When Build-A-Bear Workshop (BBW) founder Maxine Clark got stirred to open up a store where children and adults could make their own teddy bears, she heard a lot of flack, mostly from the over-18 set. They just didn't get it. Why would customers want to make their own toys?""Nobody needed another teddy bear. That's for sure,"" Clark told Shefsky. ""But they might have needed a place to have personalization and customization and a feeling that they had more control over their destiny, to actually put their own story, their own creativity, their own personality into this bear.""So Clark asked a different demographic. ""I could see the vision,"" she said. ""And every kid I talked to could tell me every animal they could see in their Build-A-Bear store.""• Try. Models, pilot projects and test cases help stir support.""Don't assume others know what you know,"" Shefsky said.Clark, who had a bit of capital, built a full-sized store. One of her first customers was an angel investor, who gave her the cash to stitch together the rest of her concept of a retail entertainment franchise.

"
2278,SBUX,"Once you've reached the top of your game, don't flaunt it while on the job. Never act like you've earned it.
"
2279,SBUX,"Instead, she says, become a ""servant leader,"" one who inspires employees toward the top while turning customers into repeat shoppers.
"
2280,SBUX,"That principle has helped Day shine at Starbucks (SBUX) — where she joined the coffeehouse giant in the mid-1980s as employee No. 3 — and at Lululemon Athletica (LULU), where she served as the company's first woman CEO from July 2008 to the end of 2013 and oversaw a stock rise of 3,700%.
"
2281,SBUX,"Now she's trying to cook up a winner as CEO of food maker Luvo.
"
2282,SBUX,"At Starbucks, Day knew a senior executive who took an expensive limousine car to the airport and meetings, rather than a simple taxi. When the exec went on business trips, he stayed only at five-star hotels.
"
2283,SBUX,"It was obvious to Day that her colleague felt the status of the hotel and other perks properly telegraphed his status within the company. But ""this mattered more than the quality of the work and the quality of the relationships he was generating,"" Day, 52, told IBD. ""He treated it as his due rather than understanding he served the organization and the people.""
"
2284,SBUX,"The Day Way
"
2285,SBUX,"She tried to greet each workday with humility.
"
2286,SBUX,"Her first job: office manager of Howard Schultz's new five-store company. Over a 20-year stint through the mid-2000s, she rose all the way up to president of Starbucks' Asia-Pacific group.
"
2287,SBUX,"By 2007, the company operated several hundred stores across China, Thailand, Australia, Japan and Singapore.
"
2288,SBUX,"Throughout that journey, Day made a point of learning vital skills from mentors.
"
2289,SBUX,"At Starbucks, she had three major ones — current CEO Howard Schultz, former CEO Orin Smith and former Starbucks International head Howard Behar. Day took the first letter of each man's first name and called them her H-2-O.
"
2290,SBUX,"Schultz taught her how to create a vision, how to build a brand and how to develop a product ""that is so good and combining it with a purpose so that it causes market disruption,"" she said while attending the Expo West natural products industry show this past March in Anaheim, Calif.
"
2291,SBUX,"Smith gave Day lessons on how to turn a business model into delivering 20% growth in return on capital and 5% increases in same-store sales quarter after quarter.
"
2292,SBUX,"He taught her how to run business units and maintain disciplined accounting at overseas units.
"
2293,SBUX,"Behar brought Day on board with the concept of the servant leader.
"
2294,SBUX,"Day said that along the way she grasped the importance of becoming an ""effective people coach"" and ""how to develop internal talent by creating mentoring programs.""
"
2295,SBUX,"In 2008, Day made her most dramatic career move when she took over Lululemon. Fulfilling her dream of heading a high-growth company, she helped build the yoga-inspired firm, started by Chip Wilson in 1998 in Vancouver, British Columbia, into a multinational powerhouse in athletic apparel.
"
2296,SBUX,"The company's results were as fit as its products.
"
2297,SBUX,"From fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2014, ended in January, Lululemon's earnings per share jumped 730%. Sales rose 489% over the same time frame, from $270 million to $1.6 billion. Along the way, its stock soared from a 2009 low of 2.17 to as high as 82.50 in June 2013.
"
2298,SBUX,"Born in Northern Ireland, Day moved to Western Canada in 1964 after her father, a former pro soccer player, changed course after a sports injury and pursued a career in mechanical engineering.
"
2299,SBUX,"Going to America for college, Day got a business degree at Central Washington University in 1984 and quickly joined a firm in the Evergreen State that specialized in private placement investments.
"
2300,SBUX,"While working in a state that would turn into America's coffee hub, she met Starbucks' Schultz on the job and joined his fledgling company, then known as Il Giornale, in 1986. A year later, Schultz acquired the Starbucks company.
"
2301,SBUX,"At Lululemon, Day worked hard on brand-building campaigns that inspired professional yoga instructors and world-class athletes to work for the company as product ambassadors.
"
2302,SBUX,"""They have an incredible sponsorship program that radiates their self-improvement culture out into the community and impacts the best athletes' lives in a huge way,"" Chandra Crawford, a Canadian gold medalist in women's cross-country skiing at the 2006 Turin Winter Olympics, told IBD.
"
2303,SBUX,"Crawford met Day in the late 2000s, when the skier became one of what Lululemon calls their elite ambassadors. That tag gave Crawford and fellow athletes a chance to join Lululemon-hosted retreats and share ideas for product innovation.

"
2305,SBUX,"""I learned two things (from Christine): One, we share practices like yoga to balance and sustain our drive. Two, the level of understanding people in order to be successful in business is equivalent to multiple Ph.D.s,"" said Crawford, who now runs Fast and Female, a nonprofit organization based in Alberta that promotes well-being through sport for girls 9 to 19.
"
2306,SBUX,"Day grasps that good store managers have a huge impact on building brand loyalty among customers.
"
2307,SBUX,"With Lululemon, she made sure a store-based community was more than where staff talked with customers or gave free yoga lessons.
"
2308,SBUX,"She wanted managers to have unparalleled knowledge about the product — be it yoga pants featuring high-tech fibers, a tank top for exercise or a cold-weather running jacket — and customer needs.
"
2309,SBUX,"Day resisted excessive shifting of store managers among locations, as it would undermine continuity at a store. So she created rules:
"
2310,SBUX,"• 1. A store manager had to work at Lululemon at least six months before opening a new store on his own at a different location.
"
2311,SBUX,"• 2. Assistant managers should be promoted in their store if the top gun moves to a new store.
"
2312,SBUX,"Homey
"
2313,SBUX,"""Your store is a community,"" Day said. ""When a manager moves too often, it breaks down the relationships with the community, the staff and the operating results of the store."" The firm's in-house studies showed that having the same manager for two years increased profitability by 20% on average.
"
2314,SBUX,"Two weeks ago, on June 12, Lululemon shares dropped 16% in heavy volume after the company reported quarterly earnings and sales that reflected an ongoing slowdown in growth. Earnings beat the consensus estimate, but rose just 6% year over year.
"
2315,SBUX,"The stock has rebounded in recent days, but analysts have shaved their full-year profit estimates.
"
2316,SBUX,"When Day announced she would leave Lululemon in 2013, Stephen Sidwell, the founder of Luvo, pounced. He contacted Day and asked her to take the CEO post. His goal: Find the right person to take the young firm to the next level.
"
2317,SBUX,"""She had had two phenomenal brand-building experiences,"" he said. ""At Starbucks, she really helped Howard (Schultz) build the organization to what it is today. What she did for beverages is what we're doing for food.""
"
2318,SBUX,"Sidwell, a former investment banker, says it was easy to convince Day about his company's mission. The harder part: asking Day to give up plans to take a year off from the corporate grind. She signed up, taking the new CEO post on a full-time basis this past April 1.
"
2319,SBUX,"""She is an incredibly collaborative leader and has a really wonderful demeanor when it comes to leadership,"" Sidwell said. ""She really gets the vision of what we're trying to do, and has been able to put that vision into plans and organize it in an efficient way. People can see it and understand it.""

2324,SBUX,"Growth stocks show strength in a down market in many different ways.They can show tight weekly closes after a breakout, refusing to give up much ground.Or, when they do pull back, they show supporting action at their 10-week moving average.Another way great stocks show strength, either in a weakening market or in a bull market, is by forming a flat base.The price structure has been seen for decades in model-book studies of past stock market winners by IBD. Hilton (HLT) formed one in 1967 before a 232% advance in little more than a year. And Starbucks (SBUX) formed one in the second half of 2003 in the early stages of a new bull market. It more than doubled in 70 weeks.If you miss an initial breakout, watch for a potential flat base to form. It often appears after a stock breaks out of a cup with handle or a double bottom. In a flat base, the stock moves sideways in a tight price range for at least five weeks, showing a pullback of no more than 10% to 15%.Flat bases that show wide-and-loose, erratic swings should generally be avoided. Some might work, but plenty of others won't. If institutional support is truly strong for a stock, trading should be tight and orderly.The buy point in the flat base is 10 cents above the high of the left side of the base. A future Investor's Corner column will teach you how to identify earlier buy points in a flat base.Current Sector Leader Gilead Sciences (GILD) formed a flat base in 2012 that spawned a bullish upward move. It first cleared a consolidation in late July. The flat base that followed formed in five weeks and showed tight trading with a pullback of 9%.As the base formed, it paid a visit to its 10-week moving average (1).Gilead gapped out of the base at 35.25 (adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in early 2013) in the week ended Nov. 16, helped by news that a combination of its experimental hepatitis C therapies cleared the virus in all patients in a trial.Weekly volume in the breakout week totaled about 166 million shares (2), nearly double its average at the time.Buying a stock when it gaps out of a base is counterintuitive, but those who bought Gilead on the Nov. 12 breakaway gap up in price have been rewarded nicely. Gilead is up 163% from the 2012 breakout.

2325,SBUX,"Developing trust is a vital building block of any relationship, whether it's with an organization, family or marriage, says Rodger Dean Duncan, a Liberty, Mo.-based executive coach.""I tell my clients that trust is the operating system of any culture,"" he told IBD. ""You can have wonderful software programs, but if the operating system is flaky, you're going to have a lot of problems.""Here's how to build that trust:• Get familiar. When Paul Hiltz took over as CEO of Mercy Hospital in Cincinnati in 2006, it was struggling financially and having problems retaining employees. Hiltz told Shawn Hunter, author of  ""Out Think,"" that he got to know each employee and got his to-do list from their suggestions. Some ideas weren't expensive, like fixing equipment and replacing carpet.""Instead of delivering edicts from on high, he asked people who had been there for 10 years,"" said Hunter, vice president of leadership matters at online education software provider Skillsoft. ""It gave them a sense of hope and aspiration.""• Be genuine. Howard Behar, former president of Starbucks' (SBUX) North America unit, once worked for a struggling company and had to fire a batch of people.He told Hunter that someone left a memo on the copier outlining the move, and employees found it. Some of his executives suggested he say the memo wasn't true. But his assistant said, ""Howard, only the truth sounds like the truth.""Behar came clean with employees, telling them about the firm's woes. They quickly pitched in with solutions. ""Truth and transparency build trust,"" Hunter said.• Be clear. Talking around a topic or giving selective facts — like saying you led a project without mentioning that six others helped lead it too — causes others to lose faith in you. ""Clear the fog,"" said Duncan, author of ""Change-Friendly Leadership."" ""Talk to people the way you want them to talk to you.""• Give useful feedback. People tend to tell people ""good job"" without explaining. Duncan suggests telling them what they did well, such as: They were attentive to the audience's needs and gave good examples during a presentation.• Show the way. Do what you've said you would. ""Otherwise, your credibility will be eroded immediately,"" Hunter said. One study showed kids were likelier to share candy with others when adults did so rather than told them to do it.• Listen. Campbell Jones, chief operating officer of auto auctioneer Manheim Australia, regularly gets out of the office to meet with customers, listen to employees' issues and back them up, Hunter says. That's important.• Seek dissent. Duncan worked at Campbell Soup (CPB) years ago when Gordon McGovern was CEO. When someone argued with him, McGovern would say, ""Oh, terrific, you disagree. Help me understand how you see it.""Said Duncan: ""You can use resistance as a springboard to dialogue.""• Display the result. Show your people the effect of their work. A study found that University of Michigan students were more effective in raising scholarship money when they met the potential recipients than if they didn't know who would get the money.""It gets people deeply vested in the process,"" Hunter said.• Emphasize the good. Duncan met a Scotland Yard expert in counterfeit currency who concentrated on what the real thing looked like. An NFL coach often stopped practice to tell a receiver what he did right. ""That's a wonderful leadership principle, to focus on the behavior we want,"" Duncan said.

2329,SBUX,"If there's one thing officials at Chipotle Mexican Grill want you to know, it's that it is not like other restaurant companies.Sure, Chipotle's (CMG) fast-casual Mexican eateries prepare food in kitchens and serve it to guests who pay money for the privilege, just like at other restaurants.And yes, business tends to pick up around lunch and dinner, when folks queue up to order the company's freshly prepared burritos, tacos and salads.And yes, Chipotle needs to keep food, labor and other costs in line if it wants to hit its margins and deliver the kind of profits that make investors tingle with joy.But that's where the similarities end — at least from Chipotle's point of view.""Our business is pretty different than others in the category in that we don't rely on some of the things others depend on, such as limited-time offers, merchandise ties and new menu items,"" said Chris Arnold, the company's communications director.No Smoke And MirrorsChipotle doesn't depend on ""gimmicks"" to drive customers through its doors, Arnold says. Instead, it relies on the company's ""food culture and people culture.""On the food side, Chipotle focuses on ""finding the best ingredients we can and preparing them using classic cooking techniques,"" Arnold told IBD.On the people side, the company looks to hire the right workers and develop them into managers.Ninety-eight percent of Chipotle's managers are hired internally from the company's rank-and-file crew, Arnold says. Last year it promoted more than 9,000 people into management positions.""This leads to a better customer-service experience and more operational efficiency,"" Arnold said.It's hard to argue with the results. Chipotle almost always churns out double-digit sales and profit growth and consistently ranks among the top stocks in the restaurant sector.Its financial might was on display during the second quarter, which Chipotle reported after the close on July 21.The company stomped all over earnings and sales estimates despite implementing its first price increase in three years to help cover higher food costs.The next day, Chipotle's stock price soared nearly 12% to 659.77 for the biggest single-day gain since last fall. Shares currently trade near 678.Chipotle logged earnings of $3.50 a share for the quarter, up 24% from the prior year and well ahead of estimates for $3.08 a share.Overall sales gained 29% to $1.05 billion, beating views for $989.55 million. It was the third straight quarter of accelerated top-line growth.Same-store sales climbed 17.3% vs. expectations for a 10.5% gain. Chipotle also raised its full-year same-store sales guidance to the midteens from its prior guidance of growth in the high single digits.""It's the best traffic number in the industry,"" Sterne Agee analyst Lynne Collier said after the earnings report. ""Rarely do you see numbers this high. Most of the companies we follow have recently put up flattish to slightly negative traffic numbers.""In a report, Citigroup analyst Gregory Badishkanian said there was ""no single driver"" of Chipotle's strong same-store sales performance, though he did point to a few key drivers.One was a bigger (though still small) contribution from Chipotle's catering business. It represented 1.6% of sales during the second quarter, up from 0.3% the prior year.Badishkanian also says Chipotle benefited from improved marketing during the quarter.Compared with other restaurant operators in the fast-casual and fast-food sectors, Chipotle doesn't spend a whole lot of money on marketing. While most companies spend 3% to 5% of their revenue on advertising, Chipotle spends 1.75%, Arnold says.""We are not pursuing the kinds of gimmicks that fast-food companies pursue, such as new products,"" he said. ""Those are very expensive; a lot of R&D goes into developing new menu items, then you have to spend a lot of money on marketing.""Instead, Chipotle focuses on non-traditional marketing efforts that range from producing Web videos and sponsoring food and music festivals to partnering with local farmer's markets.While marketing helps drive top-line growth, Chipotle looked to bolster its bottom line with a rare price increase during the second quarter to help offset rising costs of beef, avocados and cheese.""We generally try to hold the line on pricing and raise prices as a last resort,"" Arnold said. ""We just felt like we had to do it.""Badishkanian, who recently met with Chipotle management, noted after the meeting that the company is not seeing ""any impact"" from raising prices, and added that Chipotle still feels that its prices are too low in the Northeast.One reason customers aren't terribly concerned about the higher prices is they are confident in the quality and freshness of Chipotle's food, analysts say. That holds true not just for Chipotle, but also for other fast-casual chains such as Panera Bread (PNRA), Qdoba Mexican Grill — a division of Jack in the Box (JACK) — and Baja Fresh, according to a recent report from analysts at research firm Trefis.Top Of The LineFast-casual restaurants provide more ""freshly prepared and high-quality food than traditional quick-service restaurants (QSR), all in an upscale and inviting ambiance with meals ranging from $8 to $15,"" Trefis said, adding, ""Big QSR brands such as McDonald's (MCD), Subway and Starbucks (SBUX) have been facing a huge threat by the leading fast-casual restaurants, as the traffic growth in the latter segment surpassed that of every other segment for the fifth consecutive year (in 2013).""To help meet rising customer demand, Chipotle opened 45 new restaurants during the second quarter to bring the total to more than 1,600. That total includes 17 Chipotle restaurants outside the U.S. and seven ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen restaurants.The company also has a stake in one Pizzeria Locale in Denver.In any given year, about 80% of its expansion is in existing markets, Arnold says.""We have a pretty good idea of what the returns will be in those markets,"" he said.

""Digital continues to be an important growth driver.""Troy Alstead is no stranger to the old joke about there being a Starbucks on every corner — not after spending 22 years at the coffee retailer, where he now serves as its chief operating officer.There's not really a Starbucks on every corner, of course. But the fact that people talk about it all the time speaks volumes about how the company has imprinted its brand into the American consciousness.Alstead doesn't mind the joke. In fact, he takes it a step further, saying ""there's even a Starbucks inside every Starbucks.""""There's no question physical expansion in both the U.S. and around the world has been an important component of our story over the last five years,"" he told IBD. ""And it will be an even bigger part over the next five years.""If so, there may well be a Starbucks on every corner some day.Since its founding as a single gourmet coffee shop in Seattle in 1971, Starbucks (SBUX) has grown into one of the biggest and most recognizable brands in the world and one of the top stocks of the past 30 years.The company, which went public in 1992, has more than 20,000 stores in 60-plus countries worldwide. It boasts about $15 billion in annual sales. Around 70 million customers walk into its stores every week.Among restaurant stocks, Starbucks ranks behind only McDonald's (MCD) in market cap. For that, it can thank a share price that has rocketed 12,771% from the low point after its 1992 IPO.The No. 1 BaristaStarbucks' success through the years is the result of a vision, led by founder and CEO Howard Schultz, that combines innovation, execution and an aggressive growth plan that seems limitless in its scale.The company has flexed its financial muscles by gobbling up competitors and carving out great swaths of market share both here and overseas.It has embraced technology by offering high-speed Internet service in its stores and mobile payment apps. It incorporated music retailing into its coffee shops with its Hear Music brand. It developed ancillary products that include everything from coffee makers and bean grinders to flavored syrups.Starbucks has also been a leader in providing access to as many customers as possible. It has placed coffee bars in big-box retailers such as Target (TGT) and bookstores such as Barnes & Noble (BKS). It has experimented with different designs and formats, opened drive-through and walk-up locations, put a Starbucks on a passenger train and even opened a ski-up location at the Squaw Valley resort in California.""If you look back, Starbucks clearly innovated the specialty coffee retail market,"" said Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy. ""The whole idea of a coffee bar had never really existed before Starbucks, and nobody's done it as successfully or in the volumes they do.""For all the company's innovation, however, it was something basic that helped Starbucks reinvigorate its brand — and stock price — over the last half decade: a renewed focus on customer service and core beverages.After the 1992 IPO, Starbucks stock made its first big run into 2006 with a 6,142% advance. Then with decelerating earnings growth, the stock hit the kind of slump from which most big leaders never recover.By November 2008, shares had plunged to a nearly seven-year low of 7.06 — down 82% from 40.01 two years earlier.The company remained profitable. But growth was slowing, and many on Wall Street considered it a mature company that had run out of fresh ideas.Schultz, who had stepped down as CEO in 2000, retook the helm in January 2008. Eighteen months later, profits began to grow again as they would for 17 out of the next 18 quarters.""At the time, they were very good at opening new units and creating a brand, but they had problems operating them and innovating them,"" said Andy Barish, analyst at Jefferies. ""So they made a back-to-basics strategic shift.""That shift worked. Starbucks stock recovered dramatically, by 1,069% from its 2008 bottom.Partners In ProfitRather than try to reinvent itself, Starbucks committed itself to improving the experience for its employees — which it calls ""partners"" — and the people they serve.""When our market cap was way low we closed some stores to retrain our partners on excellent beverage execution,"" Alstead said. ""We wanted to make sure that when customers came in the next day or the next five years there was that deep focus.""While that was going on, Starbucks also looked to innovate its product line. At the time, the company's innovation had become ""a little stagnant,"" Alstead says.""Innovation was not as creative, not as dynamic, and certainly not as profit-driving as it needed to be,"" he said.

2606,SBUX,"Diehard growth investors must be thinking: Why is IBD profiling income stocks when growth has always been its top priority?Growth is still priority No. 1, but these days, even stocks that pay dividends can go on to become serious winners. The Income Investor column can help uncover these stocks.There's nothing wrong with earning a few percentage points on the side, as long as this is a secondary consideration. Think of the dividend as just the icing on the cake.For many other investors, income stocks are an essential part of their portfolios.The landscape of dividend stocks has changed over the years. No longer are utilities, tobacco and other defensive issues the only ones that return cash to shareholders through dividends.These days, companies such as chip designer Avago Technologies (AVGO) and even Chinese online real estate information provider SouFun Holdings (SFUN) pay stockholders cash dividends.The Income Investor normally doesn't discuss bonds (a traditional vehicle for income investors). Instead, it focuses on stocks with some growth characteristics that also pay shareholder dividends. Most of the time, these companies will have yields of at least 1% or 2%. The stocks featured often are forming a base or setting up in a secondary buy area when they are discussed.Sometimes, the column will profile real estate investment trusts (REITs) and master limited partnerships (MLPs). The page displays three lists — dividend leaders, utility leaders and REIT leaders — of potential income plays for investors.One common mistake is choosing companies that pay the fattest dividend yield. But such stocks can have lackluster fundamentals. Also, understand that one bad day or week can easily wipe out a year's worth of dividends.Another risk is that companies can lower or stop paying dividends when times are bad.Starbucks (SBUX) was featured in the July 23 edition of the Income Investor. The coffee retailing giant had solid earnings and sales growth rates for a mature big cap. It offered a 1.2% dividend yield.At the time, the stock was in a buying range from a 65.03 buy point in a three-weeks-tight pattern. Starbucks would go on to form a flat base with a 74.37 buy point.The stock broke out in the week ended Sept. 13, rising 6%. Starbucks has gone on to a 10-week win streak (1) .

2633,SBUX,"One thing that attracts investors to big companies such as Facebook (FB), MasterCard (MA), Nike (NKE), Starbucks (SBUX) and Biogen Idec (BIIB) is the safety and security of having the stock of a company with a large market capitalization and lots of resources — while also offering solid growth.Today's Screen Of The Day is Big Cap Leaders, hot companies with a market value topping $9 billion. A second sort of the Big Cap list yields the largest companies on the list — the biggest of the big caps.Facebook, the No. 1 social network, sits atop many ""best companies"" lists. With a $113 billion market cap, Facebook has fully recovered from a weak IPO in May 2012. Its earnings per share growth this year has risen from 0% in the first quarter to 58% then 108% last quarter. Facebook is enjoying booming wireless user and revenue growth, but the company admitted that young teens are losing interest.Shares took off on July 24, rising 107% to a 54.83 high in mid-October before consolidating. Facebook rose 1% Tuesday in stock market trading, but remains below its 50-day moving average.MasterCard, with a nearly $90 billion market cap, like its larger sibling Visa (V), is benefiting from the economic recovery as more confident consumers feel freer to spend.A Nilson Report earlier this month said after 20 years of losing market share to debit cards, credit cards are making a comeback. Nilson projected the trend will continue.MasterCard shares fell 1% Tuesday after hitting a new high Monday.Athletic shoe and apparel maker Nike — whose swoosh is recognized worldwide — has a $69.2 billion market cap. According to Morningstar data, Nike has an operating margin of about 13.8%, well above the average for apparel and shoe makers. For the holidays, Nike is rolling out Lunar-ENDOR QS snowboarding boots, featuring a 30-LED light swoosh on the side.Nike hit a new high last week but has fallen modestly on both Monday and Tuesday.Starbucks has racked up 14 quarters in a row of higher than 5% global sales growth. Buying La Boulange Bakery, Evolution Fresh juice company and Teavana tea company in recent years is expected to further boost sales of the No. 1 coffeehouse operator. Like Facebook, Starbucks is on the proprietary IBD Leaderboard list, which includes detailed technical analysis of top-rated stocks.Starbucks shares peaked in early November, and have since moved sideways with a slight negative bias.Drugmaker Biogen Idec has developed treatments for multiple sclerosis, cancer and autoinflammatory diseases. It has about $6.4 billion in annual sales and a market cap of $57.9 billion. Six months ago, Biogen launched Tecfidera, an oral MS treatment that looks to be a blockbuster. Tecfidera sales last quarter alone totaled $286 million.Biogen Idec shares spiked to a new high Oct. 28 on its latest quarterly results, hitting an intraday peak of 262. The stock pulled back for the next couple of weeks but has moved higher again in recent days.

"
2670,SBUX,"""It took people by surprise,"" said S&P Capital IQ analyst Scott Kessler. ""People thought the stock would be sold by Icahn and then there would be excess supply. But by buying its own shares, the company suggests they see value in the shares.""
"
2671,SBUX,"This year's all-new top management does indeed see value. Chief Executive David Schlanger is the third person put into that job since January 2012. He and the new president and chief financial officer are not new to the firm, however; they've worked in other management posts there for years.

2711,SBUX,"He hired a team of bright, creative managers and in the next 13 years built Starbucks into a global coffeehouse giant.
"
2712,SBUX,"He felt sure the chain would continue to prosper.
"
2713,SBUX,"So he stepped down as CEO in 2000, staying on as chairman and focusing on global expansion.
"
2714,SBUX,"But by 2007 — even before the Great Recession — Schultz could see that the company was cooling at a troubling rate. He saw right.
"
2715,SBUX,"""When I came back (as CEO) in 2008, the company and the country were in crisis,"" Schultz, 59, told IBD.
"
2716,SBUX,"By 2009, annual sales had fallen for the first time in the company's history. Ahead of that downfall was Starbucks' stock, which plunged 467% from 2006 to 2008.
"
2717,SBUX,"Schultz says the company sank because it became obsessed with growth. It grew distracted from its core business of providing a comfortable place for people to enjoy a great cup of coffee.
"
2718,SBUX,"He knew returning Starbucks to its old upward trajectory would require steady leadership.
"
2719,SBUX,"""At the same time, you have to make decisions in a crisis without perfect information,"" Schultz said. ""But it's important to be decisive and own your mistakes, not to place blame but recognize we're in this together.""
"
2720,SBUX,"He immediately closed down 600 poorly performing coffee shops and began traveling to Starbucks outlets across the country. He asked customers what they wanted, then added coffee varieties and other products to the menu.
"
2721,SBUX,"The most dramatic move came in February 2008, when Schultz shut down all 7,100 U.S. Starbucks shops for three hours. Why? Trainers came in to show baristas how to make the perfect espresso drink.
"
2722,SBUX,"It worked.
"
2723,SBUX,"Lightning was striking again, with Starbucks about to rejoin the top-rated companies.
"
2724,SBUX,"Sales grew from $9.8 billion in 2009 to what analysts estimate will be a record $12.6 billion this year.
"
2725,SBUX,"Starbucks shares have also heated up — by a scorching 6,600% since their first day of trading in 1992. Yet the stock flopped 9.4% on July 27 because of a lowered profit forecast for the fourth quarter, leading Schultz to say on his conference call with analysts, ""We're dealing with significant global economic and consumer challenges.""
"
2726,SBUX,"As for America, Schultz sees much of the country struggling with a jobless rate of 8.3%.
"
2727,SBUX,"""I think America finds itself today in a situation where there is an alarmingly high rate of unemployment and low rate of confidence,"" he told IBD. ""We can't wait for Washington; we have to have a collective response"" to create jobs.
"
2728,SBUX,"Schultz's response was launching Create Jobs for USA last fall. He says Starbucks is donating all proceeds from sales of packages of coffee, coffee mugs and wristbands marked with the word ""Indivisible"" to his brainchild.
"
2729,SBUX,"On The Job
"
2730,SBUX,"Starbucks says that as of June 12, more than $11.5 million had been raised for Create Jobs for USA — $5 million from the Starbucks Foundation, the rest from individuals and other companies, which will create more than 3,800 jobs.
"
2731,SBUX,"Some of the money went to Hope Enterprise Corp. to hire people to rebuild a small company called Dupont Building in Bell City, La. The private firm, which makes portable buildings, lost everything in 2005's Hurricane Katrina.
"
2732,SBUX,"Other funds went to Butte, Mont., where Nick Kujawa turned the boarded-up Sears Building into Hennessy Market, a grocery store that now employs 30 people.
"
2733,SBUX,"It's a start, says Schultz.
"
2734,SBUX,"In an open letter on the Fourth of July, he mentioned the millions unemployed and issued a call to arms to get them jobs: ""In 2012, America needs to win the election more than either party does. It is time now to join together as Americans. It is time, whatever our differences, for us to strive and succeed as one nation — indivisible.""
"
2735,SBUX,"Schultz knows about doing without. He grew up in a hardscrabble, working-class neighborhood in New York City while living in federally subsidized housing in the Canarsie area of Brooklyn.
"
2736,SBUX,"His father, Fred, was an honest, hardworking man who didn't graduate from high school. Sometimes he worked two or three jobs at once to support his family.
"
2737,SBUX,"Schultz saw that for all that sweat, his dad didn't progress much professionally. That's when young Howard promised that if he ever reached a position where he could make a difference, he wouldn't leave people behind.
"
2738,SBUX,"""Although I didn't consciously plan it that way, Starbucks has become a living legacy of my dad,"" Schultz said in ""Pour Your Heart Into It,"" which he co-wrote with Dori Jones Yang in 1997.
"
2739,SBUX,"Schultz makes sure Starbucks treats its employees well, offering full medical and other benefits to all eligible workers. Every employee has the title ""partner."" All other titles, including ""ceo,"" avoid capitalization, he says.
"
2740,SBUX,"Nancy Koehn, a historian at Harvard's business school, has talked with Schultz several times over the years and is working on her fifth case study on Starbucks. She says the CEO learned from the hard knocks of his childhood. ""Unlike some people who rise and take a place at a much higher level of income, Howard has the ability to relate to people at all levels,"" she said. ""He shows up as a full person no matter who he's talking to.""
"
2741,SBUX,"She praises his vision, noting: ""Whether we're talking about coffee bars or long-term unemployment in America, Howard sees the larger picture.""
"
2742,SBUX,"Maril Gagen MacDonald, who runs a consulting firm, met with Schultz for one of a series of executive interviews. A top trait she saw in the coffee magnate? Guts.
"
2743,SBUX,"""I say he's fearless because he has an incredible sense of self,"" MacDonald said. ""He's very grounded. In talking with him, one not only hears it, but you can feel it.""
"
2744,SBUX,"Schultz says his mother, Elaine, instilled that strong sense of self, drumming into him that he could achieve the American dream.
"
2745,SBUX,"""I've been very fortunate and blessed to have a number of people who believed in me, starting with my mother,"" he said.
"
2746,SBUX,"Tall, thin and athletic, Schultz was good at sports, so good he landed an athletic scholarship to Northern Michigan University. By 1975 he had a bachelor's degree in communications. After working several jobs, he joined Starbucks as head of marketing in 1982.
"
2747,SBUX,"The next year the company sent him to Milan for a trade show. The minute he stepped off the plane, Italy's spirit — especially the aroma of coffee — washed over him.
"
2748,SBUX,"He smelled it while walking to the show the next morning.
"
2749,SBUX,"He saw it on every street corner, where espresso bars drew crowds.
"
2750,SBUX,"Properly jolted, Schultz had his caffeine moment: Americans were prime for a third place between work and home — to relax, read, talk and enjoy a cup of coffee.
"
2751,SBUX,"He brought that idea back to Starbucks, but the owners said no — they wanted to stick with selling whole coffee beans.
"
2752,SBUX,"Schultz believed so strongly in his dream, he left Starbucks and founded the Il Giornale coffeehouse in 1985.

2763,SBUX,"A small list of new highs Monday was followed by an even a smaller list Tuesday as another wave of selling hit the major indexes and leading growth stocks.The vast majority of 52-week highs Tuesday reversed after early strength.U.S. Silica Holdings (SLCA), a provider of commercial silica used in fracking, rose 21 cents to 28.88. Its winning streak now stands at six sessions. The stock recently clearing a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 26.68, 10 cents above its Sept. 23 intraday high.Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is the process of extracting natural gas from shale rock layers. Highly pressurized fracking fluids (water, sand and other chemicals) are injected into the shale area, creating fractures in the rock that let gas flow more freely.Elsewhere, two retailers also reversed. Starbucks (SBUX) hit an all-time high of 78.03 but closed near its session low. Shares lost 1.33 to 75.53. It's still holding above a flat-base buy point of 74.37 and its 10-week moving average around 74.Last year, Starbucks acquired San Francisco-based La Boulange Bakery & Cafe for $100 million. La Boulange is best known for its pastries and sandwiches. Several analysts applauded the acquisition, citing the possibility of increased same-store sales growth in 2014. Another growth driver for Starbucks could be the carbonated drink market. Last month, the company filed a trademark application for the term Fizzio. Starbucks said the trademark would be for machines that make beverages, including soft drinks.Meanwhile, Whole Foods Market (WFM) held up well after hitting an all-time high earlier in the session. Shares fell 6 cents to 59.09. The stock reset its base count earlier this year when it hit a low of 40.70 in April. The pullback wiped the slate clean of sellers.

2764,SBUX,"Moving average lines are some of the most widely used tools in technical analysis. While price and volume action are the main elements of chart analysis, moving averages should also be in your toolbox.The 200-day line is one of the more popular moving averages used by retail and professional investors. It can be used for spotting trends and as a sell signal. The line can also act as support or resistance levels.As a refresher, a moving average shows a stock's average price over a certain period of time.For example, if you want a 20-day simple moving average, simply add the closing prices of the last 20 sessions and divide by 20. As a stock makes a new close each day, the oldest value in the calculation gets dropped and the newest one is added. That's why it's called a moving-average line.The 200-day moving average gives you a bigger picture of a stock trend and is useful in identifying longer-term support.Leading stocks in your hit list should be trading above their 200-day moving averages, even before they break out. A stock's handle should form above its 200-day line.A break of the 200-day line, especially in high volume, can be a sell signal. But this is often a late signal. By the time a stock goes all the way back below its 200-day line, it would have likely erased a large chunk of gains.The 200-day moving average can also be used to sell while the going is still good. Investors may want to start locking in profits if a stock surges 70% to 100% above its 200-day moving average. This is best when accompanied by other climax sell signals.Some stocks, after going on a long run, can also be sold when its 200-day line flattens out or turns down.Starbucks (SBUX) found support at its 200-day moving average in early October. 1 The stock then went on to clear a 41.21 buy point in a 10-week consolidation.  2It rallied 50% by April 2012.Investors can find the 200-day moving average on the free IBD Charts at Investors.com. The line is labeled in black. The line is also available on the charts in MarketSmith, which requires a separate subscription.

2783,SBUX,"In the pre-Internet days, companies rarely partnered with rivals. But in the post-Internet days, striking alliances with competitors has become a trend. Increasingly, competitors have become business partners rather than foes.
"
2784,SBUX,"MasterCard (MA), for example, joined with foreign exchange provider Travelex in August to create a multi-currency prepaid overseas credit card in a win-win tie-up for both companies. Consumers can travel overseas with a credit card available in five currencies including euros, British pounds, Australian dollars and Japanese yen.

Customers arrive at an airport, deposit value on their prepaid cards in specific currencies, and get the ability to buy goods and services overseas.
"
2791,SBUX,"Weitzman says that these prepaid cards operate like traveler's checks and yield security and peace of mind. They carry anywhere from $25 to a maximum of $8,500. The card can be reloaded, and consumers can add up to $5,000 in any 24-hour time period.

Foreign exchange conversion fees still apply with the new prepaid cards, but fees are lower. Consumers, moreover, don't have to pay reload or transaction fees, though there are ATM fees.
"
2793,SBUX,"For MasterCard, the prepaid card strengthens the brand globally. ""Our secret sauce is to authorize, clear and settle transactions between 23,000 financial institutions and 35.9 million merchants,"" Weitzman said.

2794,SBUX,"Travelex declined to answer questions about the benefits it reaps from the partnership. But Weitzman says it extends MasterCard's reach to more customers overseas. And the alliance enables Travelex to extend revenue on conversions and partner with a global brand like MasterCard.
"
2795,SBUX,"MasterCard not only strengthens bonds with customers through the partnership, it also boosts revenue. It earns fees from these transactions and spikes overseas revenue.
"
2796,SBUX,"While some experts point out how these partnerships can go awry when parties try to end them, Weitzman doesn't see many pitfalls in these agreements. MasterCard operates in a thriving business-to-business network, and this deal is one of many, he says.
"
2797,SBUX,"MasterCard encourages alliances with a variety of partners. ""By definition, we're not a credit card, we're not a debit card, we're a network and we do valued-added processing.

2800,SBUX,"The Internet is spurring these partnerships with rivals. ""It's hard to keep things secret and easier to know what competitors are doing,"" Segil said. Hence, business alliances make more sense.
"
2801,SBUX,"One partnership that worked effectively from 1998 until 2011 was Kraft Foods (KRFT) and Starbucks (SBUX). In 1998, Kraft, which sells Maxwell House coffee, agreed to distribute Starbucks' premium blend in grocery aisles.

"
2804,SBUX,"Segil describes MasterCard's alliance with Travelex as another win-win. If customers face hurdles using their MasterCard overseas, it can damage its reputation and erode market share. Travelex, by smoothing the way for MasterCard users, boosts its cachet by its association with a larger competitor and expands revenue as well.
"
2805,SBUX,"MasterCard's customers also benefit by having an easier time using their credit card overseas. For customers, ""It's a seamless transaction; no denial of service and they can charge in francs,"" said Segil.
"
2806,SBUX,"But these alliances also carry some traps. Partners need to be fully explicit about what is being agreed to, what is being shared, and whether any information must be withheld. ""If there are unmet expectations, it's a formula for failure,"" Segil said.
"
2807,SBUX,"Hence, these agreements need to include a clear exit strategy describing when and how the partnership will end.In the pre-Internet days, companies rarely partnered with rivals. But in the post-Internet days, striking alliances with competitors has become a trend. Increasingly, competitors have become business partners rather than foes.MasterCard (MA), for example, joined with foreign exchange provider Travelex in August to create a multi-currency prepaid overseas credit card in a win-win tie-up for both companies. Consumers can travel overseas with a credit card available in five currencies including euros, British pounds, Australian dollars and Japanese yen.In the past, not all retailers accepted credit cards globally and sometimes clients were charged high conversion fees. But the new cards are easily reloadable and replaceable overseas, says MasterCard.Travelex serves as the retail outlet selling the travel cards to consumers while MasterCard is the network where the transactions for these cards flow, says Seth Eisen, a MasterCard spokesperson.In the fast-changing markets created by the Internet and digital technology, forming alliances with competitors can increasingly boost revenue and help lure clients. However, players must sidestep certain traps to ensure these deals don't fall apart and terminate abruptly.Partnerships for MasterCard make good business sense because ""we believe financially it can be greater than the sum of its parts,"" said Michael Weitzman, group executive of products and solutions for U.S. markets at Purchase, N.Y.-based MasterCard. ""MasterCard wouldn't have the reach, and Travelex wouldn't have the access"" without the team-up, he said.A Bigger WholeBy combining forces, it strengthens the product and benefits customers.

2814,SBUX,"When you drink a cup of coffee, you can avoid getting burned badly by taking sips instead of just gulping it down.It's much the same in investing. If you find a stock with top-notch fundamentals and technicals, don't jump in all at once. Start by using a portion of your allotted capital for the trade and build up into a full position as the stock rises.This process of pyramiding a position is a way to enter a trade and at the same time reduce risk. Investors can use all of their allocated capital and buy their entire position at one time. But just be aware that while you can make more money this way, you can also lose more money by going all-in.For example, if you use $10,000 to buy 200 shares of a $50 stock, all of your initial investment is at risk. If the stock falls 8%, you'd lose $800. If you started with half of a position, you'd lose less.Pyramiding involves making multiple purchases to build your position. You can divide your purchases into three installments.For your first buy, use half of your allocated capital. So if you have $10,000 to invest, use $5,000 for your initial position. Start things off right by buying a leader once it goes through the buy point of a proper base in volume that's at least 40% above average.Only buy more shares if the stock moves 2% to 2.5% above your initial purchase price. If it does, use 30% of your allotted capital for your second buy. Now you're 80% invested.If the stock goes up another 2% to 2.5% from your second buy point, use the remaining 20% of your allocated capital for your final buy. Now you're fully invested and the stock is acting right.Pyramiding is smarter, as you're only putting more money to work after a stock has proven that it can go higher. What you are essentially doing is averaging up, the opposite of average down. The latter is a losing proposition.On Oct. 12, 2010, Starbucks (SBUX) bolted past a 26.67 entry from a cup-with-handle base in about twice its average trade 1. An initial position could have been put on there.A second buy could also have been established Oct. 12 as shares rose more than 2% past the 26.67 trigger. A final buy in Starbucks could have been made Oct. 14 as it rallied 4% past the initial 26.67 buy point 2. The stock rose 25% by early January 2011 before pulling back to its 50-day moving average.

2843,SBUX,"After the opening bell strikes this morning, we expect new economic results for metrics such as PMI (Purchasing Managers Index), ISM Manufacturing and Job Openings for April. (The PMI and ISM reads will be for May.) Yesterday we saw a big drop in April Factory Orders — -0.8% from the expected -0.5%, and well down from the +1.7% posted in March. It’s the first piece of notably negative news we’ve seen in economic headlines since Q1 earnings season began to wind down.Tomorrow morning we see new Trade Deficit, Productivity and Unit Labor Costs, all ahead of regular trading hours. These might be considered second-tier metrics to inform economic decision making, both among publicly traded companies and the U.S. government — federal, state and even local, especially after last week’s Q1 GDP revision and payroll/unemployment numbers. Those numbers were almost perfectly Goldilocks — growing, but not too hot — so analysts will be keeping tabs to see if those bigger headlines’ finding are borne out.Big Tech has been roaring to start this week (and even going back to last week’s favorable jobs numbers), with Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) rising to new all-time highs and pushing even higher (+$192/share) in today’s pre-market. Apparently, concerns over a U.S.-China trade war are masking no impact on the world’s biggest gadget-maker, considering how much business it does in China. But even the Russell 2000 small-cap index, which contains plenty of tech-based niche companies, has been outperforming for the past couple weeks. So it’s not just the biggest names in Tech taking advantage at the moment.Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) will at last become part of the S&P 500. While still selling well below its initial cost per share back when the company IPO’d five years ago, the social media mainstay looks to be on the upswing of its initial parabolic curve as a publicly traded entity. Currently, Twitter shares are rated a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with 10 upward estimate revisions for this quarter and next. The company has an average earnings beat over the past four quarters of nearly 50%.Finally, long-time CEO Howard Schultz has at last decided to end his tenure as the head of Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report). After taking the coffee giant from a small Seattle-based company to an international powerhouse, speculation is that Schultz may be considering a run for president. While he would not concretely acknowledge this trajectory in an interview this morning on CNBC with Andrew Ross Sorkin, neither did he rule it out. In fact, there was plenty in his rhetoric that seemed massaged toward political pursuits.If you’re interested in finding out whether Schultz is a Republican or Democrat, he considers himself an independent, as well as a self-styled centrist. That said, Schultz was a noted supporter of President Obama and his keystone accomplishment, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), aka Obamacare. Yet as a corporate head with a net worth of more than $2 billion, Wall Street interests would appear to be of Schultz’s main concerns. He has also received an award in his support of the state of Israel, which has been run by far-right conservatives for as long as Starbucks has been a household name.

2845,SBUX,"Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report) announced that it will break ground on the second phase of Dania Pointe on Jul 12. Encouragingly, this mixed-use development project in Southern Broward County, FL, has grabbed much attention and the initial 325,000 square feet of space is already 93% leased.Notably, the project on 102 acres of land is situated just next to I-95 and will serve as the central location for residents going north and south on I-95. Moreover, it is situated less than 10 minutes from the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and Port Everglades.The strategic location of the project has likely enabled the company to rope well-known tenants like TJ Maxx, Ulta Beauty (ULTA  -  Free Report), Five Below (FIVE  -  Free Report), YouFit, Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) and Verizon, among others in its first phase, that is scheduled to open in August.  The second phase of Dania Pointe will take place in multiple stages. Per management, strong demand for retail space in the first phase has encouraged the company to proceed with the second phase. The second phase will add 300,000 square feet of retail space that is already 50% pre-leased, as well as another 125,000-square-foot area which will be included later.Further, management announced that it will break ground on the first 300 apartments at Dania Pointe this summer. Also, the site has received approval for 500,000 square feet of office space. This could mark the first office space and will likely stir interest from Class A office tenants.Notably, healthy leasing activity for retail space in the development is in stark contrast to the lackluster retail environment prevailing in the United States. Importantly, the predominance of e-retailers over brick-and-mortar sales has emerged as a serious concern for retail REITs. In fact, a number of retail landlords have been affected due to online channels increasingly gaining popularity. This has also resulted in widespread store closures and bankruptcy filing by the retailers.Hence, positive response for retail space in the development gives us confidence that the site will enjoy high occupancy. Moreover, open-air retail centers have performed better than enclosed malls.Although Kimco owns premium properties in high-growth areas, it is not completely immune to the wrath of rising online sales, store closures and tenant bankruptcy.Kimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In addition, shares of Kimco have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months. During this time frame, the stock has gained 17.4%, whereas the industry has rallied 10.3%. The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2846,SBUX,"Dividends have been the consistent source of income for investors seeking regular returns during both bull and bear markets. According to a study, dividends accounted for an average 52% of the total returns over the past seven decades.This is especially true as these stocks offer the best of both these worlds — safety in the form of payouts and stability in the form of mature companies that are less volatile to large swings in stock prices. The companies that offer dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provide downside protection by offering outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis (see: all the Large Cap ETFs here).Q2 Dividends Payout Hits Record Overall, the S&P 500 companies declared a record $124 billion in dividend payouts during the second quarter, up 11% from $112 billion in the year-ago quarter. About 89 firms hiked their payouts versus 67 firms a year ago, while 332 have maintained their dividends versus 347 in the same period last year. Notably, 43 companies have retained the ‘aristocrat’ status of 25 years of consecutive dividend raises. This is primarily thanks to a strong economy, solid earnings, historic tax cuts and results from the second round of Federal Reserve stress tests.Among the special attractions were Citrix Systems (CTXS  -  Free Report), which declared a dividend for the first time with a payout of 35 cents, and Dr Pepper Snapple , which announced a special dividend of $103.75 due to merger activity. Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report), Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report), Ralph Lauren (RL  -  Free Report) and Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) were among the firms that hiked dividend payouts (read: 4 Dividend Growth ETFs to Watch as Global Dividends Top).The trend is expected to continue in the coming months as most large companies have huge cash piles on their balance sheet and are in a position to increase payouts to shareholders. Additionally, the new tax law encourages the companies to bring their overseas cash back home at much more reduced rates and distribute parts of it to their shareholders. Per Bloomberg, an additional 75 companies will boost dividend payouts this quarter.Investors should also note that a company which consistently increases its dividend has stronger fundamentals, suggesting rising cash flows, good liquidity and a strong balance sheet.How to PlayGiven this, investors could tap growing dividends in the form of ETFs. Below, we have highlighted five popular dividend ETFs that offer excellent dividend growth potential, any of which could be a solid pick for investor in the long term: Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG  -  Free Report)This is the largest and most popular ETF in the dividend space with AUM of $27.8 billion and average daily volume of about 797,000 shares. The fund follows the NASDAQ US Dividend Achievers Select Index, which is composed of high quality stocks that have a record of raising dividend every year. It holds 182 securities in the basket, with none accounting for more than 4.3% share. The fund charges 8 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook (read: Tariff Threats Become Reality, Add 6 ETFs to Your Arsenal).iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY  -  Free Report)This fund provides exposure to the high dividend-paying U.S. equities with a 5-year history of dividend growth. It follows the Dow Jones U.S. Select Dividend Index and holds 99 securities in its basket with each accounting for less than 2.4% of assets. The ETF has AUM of $17.1 billion and average daily volume of more than 716,000 shares. It charges 39 bps in fees per year from investors and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a Medium risk outlook.SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (SDY  -  Free Report) With AUM of $15.6 billion and average daily volume of 548,000 shares, this fund provides a well-diversified exposure to 112 U.S. stocks that have been consistently increasing their dividends every year for at least 20 years. This can be done by tracking the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. Each firm accounts for less than 2.3% of assets. The fund charges 35 bps in fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a Medium risk outlook.Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD  -  Free Report)With AUM of $7.5 billion, this product offers exposure to the 105 high-dividend yielding U.S. companies that have a record of consistent dividend payments supported by fundamental strength based on financial ratios and ample liquidity. This can be easily done by tracking the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. The fund is well spread across components, with none holding more than 4.81% of assets. It charges 7 bps in annual fees and trades in solid volume of more than 1 million shares a day. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (DGRO  -  Free Report)This fund provides exposure to companies having a history of consistently growing dividends by tracking the Morningstar US Dividend Growth Index.

2847,SBUX,"Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) slipped 0.7% in after-market trading on Jun 5 after it announced that executive chairman Howard Schultz will step down. Schultz will be succeeded by former J.C. Penney chief executive Myron E. ""Mike"" Ullman. Schultz will resign from the board and be named chairman emeritus on Jun 26, the company said.The visionary steadily built the world's largest coffee business, which now boasts 28,000 stores across 77 countries. The company’s stock has come a long way since the initial 1992 public offering, scaling a massive 19,000%. Schultz joined Starbucks in the 1980s and had resigned from the company’s top position in 2000. This dampened investor sentiments to an extent that the stock lost a whopping 28% over seven weeks. Schultz returned to his position in 2008 when the coffee giant was grappling with the challenges posed by the 2008 financial crisis.Schultz resigned as CEO for the second time at Starbucks last year to focus on innovation and social-impact projects as executive chairman. Following his departure at the end of June, Schultz will oversee the opening of the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries in Milan and New York City. He is also writing a book on the company’s social impact work.Schultz had endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election and is rumored to be making a run for the position in 2020. Schultz, at 64, is considering ""a range of options for myself, from philanthropy to public service."" A Look at Starbucks’ PerformanceStarbucks’ shares lost more than 11% in the past year, comparing unfavorably with its industry’s decline of 0.9%. Shares of the company were also down 0.7% so far this year.Meanwhile, incumbent CEO Kevin Johnson faces a range of challenges, starting from subdued growth in the dominant U.S. market and intense competition from rivals to a huge expansion project in China.That said, the company’s fundamentals remain strong as is evident from the 3-5 year expected EPS growth rate of 14%. In the last reported second-quarter fiscal 2018, Starbucks’ adjusted earnings per share of 53 cents showed an improvement of 17.8% year over year. The results benefited from improved performance in the Americas (mainly in the United States), the ongoing positive momentum in China (following the takeover of East China) and strongest comps growth in Japan in five quarters.Importantly, Starbucks and Swiss-based food giant Nestle SA recently teamed up to revitalize their coffee domains. Starbucks and Nestle announced a global marketing deal that gives the latter ""perpetual rights"" to market Starbucks’ products globally. This alliance will expand the global reach of Starbucks brands in the consumer packaged goods and foodservice categories to nearly 190 countries from the present count of 28.Again, as marketplaces across the globe are changing radically, the increasing use of Mobile Order and Pay has been a key propeller for Starbucks. The company’s mobile app is also undoubtedly one of the most widely used mobile payment app in the United States. Mobile payments represented 12% of U.S. transactions in the fiscal second quarter, reflecting an increase from 8% a year ago.Additionally, factors like better job prospects and increasing consumer confidence are likely to play an important role in boosting the restaurant industry, to which this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock belongs.Other Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are Wingstop Inc. (WING  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Dine Brands Global, Inc. (DIN  -  Free Report) and Denny's Corporation (DENN  -  Free Report), both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2848,SBUX,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 2.9% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is SBUX due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Second-Quarter Fiscal 2018 ResultsStarbucks reported in-line earnings but exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the second-quarter of fiscal 2018. The company’s results benefited from an improved performance in the Americas segment (mainly in the United States), the ongoing momentum in China (following the takeover of East China) and strongest comps growth in Japan in the last five quarters.Earnings, Sales & Comps DiscussionAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 53 cents met the consensus mark but grew 17.8% year over year.Total sales of $6.03 billion surpassed the consensus estimate of $5.9 billion by 2.3% and increased 13.9% from the year-ago level. Notably, the acquisition of the East China business as well as other portfolio reshuffling activities lent a 3% net benefit to its top line. These activities include the closure of the Teavana mall store in the quarter, Tazo divestiture in December and conversion of certain international retail operations from company-owned to licensed models. Meanwhile, currency translation had a 2% positive impact on the revenues.The year-over-year performance was also driven by higher revenues from the opening of 2,103 net new stores over the past 12 months and higher global comps growth.Global same-store sales increased 2%, same as first-quarter fiscal 2018. Global traffic increased 3%, better than 2% increase witnessed in the first quarter. Transactions were down 1% versus no growth recorded in the preceding quarter. The company opened 468 net new stores globally, bringing the total store count to 28,209 across 76 markets. It also closed 298 Teavana stores in the quarter.Margin DownOperating margin decreased 490 bps year over year to 12.8% in the quarter, due to a product mix shift largely toward food and restructuring costs associated with the company's ongoing efforts of streamlining business operations. Again, higher spending in its store partners (employees) along with the impact of its ownership change in East China added to the woes.On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin declined 170 bps to 16.2%.Quarterly Segment DetailsAmericas: Net revenues in this flagship segment were up 8% year over year to $4 billion.Comps growth of 2% in the quarter (same as the first quarter of fiscal 2018) comprised a 3% increase in average ticket. U.S. comps also grew 2% albeit less than the 3% increase during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.Importantly, this is the second consecutive quarter of 2% comps growth in Americas, mirroring concerns that its increased promotions somehow failed to attract a huge number of customers.Food comps were more than 1% and food has consistently contributed in the 1-2% comps range for many years now. This momentum continued in the quarter as well with food's share of total U.S. sales being 22%, up 100 bps from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, iced beverages contributed almost 40% to overall revenue growth.Membership increased 12% year over year to 14.9 million in the My Starbucks Rewards (MSR) program. Customers in the United States are using the chain's mobile app to order and pay for their drinks, and are joining the company's rewards program. Mobile payments represented 12% of the U.S. transactions, reflecting an increase from 8% a year ago.Operating margin in the segment, however, contracted 220 bps to 20% as a strong sales leverage was more than offset by the impact of a food-related mix shift and higher spending in its store partners.China-Asia-Pacific (CAP): Net revenues increased 54% to $1.2 billion on the back of higher revenues from the acquisition of East China operations, new store openings and comps growth.Comps grew 3%, higher than 1% growth recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. China continued to post impressive comps growth, with 4% improvement witnessed in the quarter (softer than 6% in fiscal first quarter). The softer sequential growth was attributed to a shift in the timing of the Lunar New Year. Meanwhile, Japan delivered its first quarter of positive comps since the first quarter of fiscal 2017, buoyed by a strong beverage lineup.However, operating margin at the CAP segment contracted 570 bps year over year to 17.2% in the quarter, owing to the impact of its ownership change in East China.Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA): The segment’s net revenues were up 15% from the prior-year quarter at $266.1 million. The improvement was prompted by higher revenues from the addition of new stores and a positive currency effect.That said, comps declined 1% (compared with a 2% decline in fiscal first quarter).Operating margin declined 1,360 bps due to a partial impairment of goodwill related to the Switzerland retail business and sales deleverage on company-operated stores.Channel Development: Net revenues improved 8% to $500.2 million. The growth was driven by higher sales of premium single-serve products.Operating margin improved 100 bps to 43%.All-Other: The segment comprises Seattle's Best Coffee, Starbucks Reserve Coffee and Roastery businesses, and Teavana-branded stores. Revenues at the segment decreased 32% to $75.6 million.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceStarbucks expects global comps growth at the lower end of its earlier projected guidance of 3-5%. The company still expects to add approximately 2,300 net new stores globally. Consolidated revenue growth is expected in high single digits.The company expects its GAAP EPS in the range of $3.32-$3.36.Starbucks expects non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.48-$2.53 compared with $2.30-$2.33 expected earlier. Although the guidance is consistent with the company’s earlier projection, it excludes the impact of its previously announced plan to close more than 8,000 company-owned stores in the United States on May 29, 2018 to conduct racial-bias training for all partners (employees) in the United States.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter compared to four lower.Starbucks Corporation Price and Consensus  Starbucks Corporation Price and Consensus | Starbucks Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, SBUX has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F. The stock was also allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for value and growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, SBUX has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

2849,SBUX,"Wall Street witnessed broad-based declines on Tuesday with all three major indexes closing in the red. This was primarily attributable to the yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury Note which hit a seven year high. Jump is bond yield is possibly due to U.S. retail sales which rose two consecutive months of March and April raising fear of inflationary pressures. Moreover, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad commented that trade tensions between United States and China are far from over.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 24,706.41, decreased 0.8% or 193 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) decreased 0.7% to close at 2,711.45. The Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,351.63, decreased 0.8%. A total of 6.60 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6.67 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1.87 -to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners had an edge over advancers by 1.14 to -1 ratio. The CBOE VIX increased 13.2% and closed at 14.63. This was Wall Street’s fear gauge’s largest gain in one day since Apr 2.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow lost 0.8% ending its eighth straight positive session. This was the blue-chip index’s biggest decline in three weeks. Notably, 26 of the 30-stocks in the index closing in the red while 3 traded in the green and 1 remains unchanged.  The S&P 500 decreased 0.7% led by 1.7% decline of the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) and 1.3% decline of Healthcare Select Sector SPDR (XLV). Notably, 10 out of 11 sectors of the benchmark index ended in negative territory.The Nasdaq Composite also decreased 0.8% led by fall in large tech stock’s prices.  Surge in U.S. Government Bond YieldsOn Tuesday, yield on 10-year Treasury note surged 7.5 basis points to 3.070%, its highest since July 2011. This was the biggest jump of the 10-year U.S. Treasury Note in a single day since Mar 1, 2018. Likewise, the 30-year bond yield spiked to 3.210% after gaining 8.1 basis points.Since bond price and yield are negatively correlated, investors opted for safe haven bonds instead of risky equities. One possible reason for hike in treasury notes yield is strong retail sales data for the month of April as well as March which was revised upwardly. This indicates strong fundamentals of the U.S. economy.Higher consumer spending may generate inflationary pressure prompting the central bank to pursue aggressive interest rate policy to cooldown the economy. Consequently, hike in interest rate will raise cost of funds for both corporates and individuals resulting in stock market volatility.Surge in U.S. government bond yields had another negative effect on the economy. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. dollar against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.7% to 93.22. During Tuesday, the index was up overnight at 93.457, its highest since Dec 22, 2017. A strong dollar will hurt U.S. export.Trade Tensions Lingers The ongoing trade conflict between United States and China is showing no sign of abating. The trade tensions which began in March after President Trump imposed tariffs on a large number of Chinses imports have only escalated thereafter. On Tuesday, U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad said that the countries are ""very far apart"" on trade issues.On Monday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross failed to give any specific reason for resolving the U.S--China trade conflict and hoped that good personal relationship between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping may pave the way for a possible solution.Any escalation of trade conflict will result in imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs between two countries. This will raise general price level of the economy resulting into inflation. Consequently, the Fed will have to raise interest rates more aggressively.Economic DataThe Commerce Department reported that U.S. retail sales rose 0.3% for the month of April, at par with the consensus estimate. Retail sales are up for two straight months and also rose 4.7% year over year. Notably, the March reading was revised to an increase of 0.8% from the previous figure of 0.6%. Notably, 9 out of a total of 13 industries witnessed an increase in sales in April.The National Association of Home Builders reported that their sentiment index for the month of May rose 2 points to touch 70. April's reading was revised down 1 point to 68. The index stood at 69 in May 2017. Notably, any reading above 50 is considered positive for home builders.Stock That Made HeadlineStarbucks Reveals New Expansion Plan to Boost China BusinessStarbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) has chalked out an ambitious plan to open a new store in every 15 hours (or 600 net new Starbucks a year) in China.

2850,SBUX,"Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) has chalked out an ambitious plan to open a new store in every 15 hours (or 600 net new Starbucks a year) in China for the next five years, during its first-ever China Investor Conference in Shanghai on Tuesday, May 15.The Seattle-based coffee giant announced its plans to build 600 net new stores annually over the next five years in Mainland China, which will double the market's store count from the end of fiscal 2017 to 6,000 across 230 cities. Currently, the company operates approximately 3,300 stores in 141 cities in China. This intended speedy expansion in China is likely to triple its revenues and double its operating profit by the end of fiscal 2022 from fiscal 2017.Starbucks’ China StoryChina has been the fastest-growing market for Starbucks. Management has a strong belief that China will drive more meaningful business growth over the next five years supported by rapid unit expansion, wider brand awareness and increased usage of digital/mobile/loyalty platforms, while respecting local heritage.Starbucks has been an integral part of the local community in China for nearly 20 years and expects “to mindfully evolve a coffee culture in China where the reward will be healthy, long-term, profitable growth for decades to come”. The coffee-chain giant built its first Starbucks Reserve Bar in 2014 to deepen customer coffee engagement. With more than 150 locations currently, the company aims to reach 200 Reserve Bar stores by the end of fiscal 2018.Earlier this month, Starbucks and the Swiss-based food giant Nestle SA have joined hands to revitalize their coffee domains. Starbucks and Nestle announced a global marketing deal that gives the latter ""perpetual rights"" to market Starbucks’ products globally outside its coffee shops. The deal is aimed at expanding the global reach of Starbucks brands in the consumer packaged goods (“CPG’) and foodservice categories to nearly 190 countries around the world from the present count of 28.The deal requires Nestle to pay Starbucks $7.15 billion (€5.97 billion) upfront in cash for the rights to sell Starbucks coffee products in retail and food-service channels. Meanwhile, as part of the deal, around 500 Starbucks staff will join Nestle. The agreement is subject to customary regulatory approval and expected to close by the end of 2018.Meanwhile, the company intends to expand the Starbucks Ready-to-Drink (RTD) business in the country to more than 400 major cities, across more than 125,000 premium points of distribution over the next five years. This is intended to be in alliance with Tingyi, a leader in China’s RTD beverage category.Starbucks also has plans to launch the Starbucks chilled cup platform with four flavors in June, introducing a new beverage platform mainly for on-the-go consumers of coffee and tea in China.A Look at Starbucks’ China-Asia-Pacific (CAP) PerformanceNet revenues increased 54% year over year to $1.2 billion in the last reported quarter on the back of higher revenues from the acquisition of East China operations, new store openings and comps growth. Starbucks' business in China is rapidly growing due to innovative store designs, local product innovations and the success of My Starbucks Rewards program.In comparison, net revenues in the company’s flagship Americas segment were up 8% from the prior-year quarter to $4 billion in the fiscal second quarter.Share Price PerformanceStarbucks’ shares have gained 0.3% in the past three months, while its industry has gained 3.5%. Recently, the company reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues surpassed the same. Notably, Starbucks reported in-line earnings in three of the last four quarters. That said, adjusted earnings per share of 53 cents grew 17.8% year over year. The company’s results benefited from an improved performance in the Americas segment (mainly in the United States), the ongoing positive momentum in China (following the takeover of East China) and strongest comps growth in Japan in five quarters.Meanwhile, earnings estimates remained unchanged for the current fiscal, while the same moved 0.4% north for fiscal 2019, over the past seven days, depicting analysts’ confidence on the this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s earnings prospect. Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are Wingstop Inc.

2851,SBUX,"Yum China Holdings, Inc. (YUMC  -  Free Report) is caught in the crosshairs of a possible US-China trade war. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) has sold off in the last month as jitters about trade increased.Yum China is the largest restaurant chain in mainland China. It started as a single restaurant in 1987 and now operates over 8,100 restaurants in over 1,200 cities and towns.Formerly a division of Yum! Brands, Yum China was spun off into its own independent company in 2016.It has the exclusive rights to operate and sub-license the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands in China. It also owns the East Dawning and Little Sheep restaurant concepts outright and acquired a controlling interest in the holding company of DAOJIA.com.cn in 2017.Another Beat in Q1On May 1, Yum China reported its first quarter 2018 results and beat the Zacks Consensus by 4 cents. It reported $0.53 versus the consensus of $0.49.It was the third beat in the last four quarters.Revenue rose 15% to 2.2 billion from $1.9 billion.Same-store-sales, one of the most important metrics in the restaurant industry, rose 3%, with KFC seeing a 5% increase which was partially offset by weakness at Pizza Hut, which declined 5%, excluding F/X.Restaurant margins also fell to 17.9% from 20.4% in the prior year primarily due to the investment in product upgrades and promotions at Pizza Hut and its sales deleveraging.Still GrowingBut Yum China's sheer size in China is impressive. It has 120 million loyalty program members for KFC, up 50 million year over year.

2852,SBUX,"Shares of Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) surged over 2% on Monday following two significant pieces of news regarding the recently-struggling coffee powerhouse, including a possible Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) partnership to help boost growth in China.ChinaDeparting Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz told reporters at a roundtable discussion at the company’s flagship roastery store in Shanghai on Monday that a potential Chinese slowdown is a ""false narrative."" Schultz made it clear that Starbucks would continue its growth in the world’s second-largest economy after the company said last month that same-store sales in China would be flat to slightly negative in the June quarter, compared to impressive 7% comps growth in the year-ago period.""It's a very short-term number that Wall Street uses, it's not a number we're concerned about,"" Schultz said. ""I will say, unequivocally, that anyone who is betting against Starbucks in China is dead wrong.""Investors should note that Chinese comps climbed 4% last quarter, with overall revenues for the China/Asia Pacific segment up 54% to $1.19 billion. The company also opened 216 new stores in the region. Meanwhile, same-store sales grew by 2% in the Americas and the U.S.—which still accounts for roughly 70% of total revenues.Schultz then went on to discuss the possibility of joining forces with Chinese e-commerce giant and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) rival Alibaba in order to bolster sales. The outgoing Starbucks chief executive also spoke openly about his relationship with Alibaba's billionaire founder Jack Ma.“There's no doubt that no brick-and-mortar retailer anywhere in the world, let alone China, can exist as a stand-alone business without having a significant, integrated e-commerce mobile application,"" Schultz said. “I have been very dear and close friends with Jack Ma for many, many years... and suffice to say there will be news coming that will relate to our plans for accelerating and integrating mobile commerce at a higher level into our core business.”Looking ahead, Starbucks thinks that China can overtake the U.S. as its top market. Starbucks plans to add 600 new stores per year in Mainland China through 2022 in order to double its locations to 6,000 total stores in 230 cities. Straw WarsInvestors should also note that Starbucks announced that it plans to stop using plastic straws at all of its locations within two years, pointing directly to the environmental threat to the oceans. Starbucks’ move comes amid increased coverage about how much plastic waste—with straws playing a significant role—ends up in oceans.The company also became the largest food and beverage company to make such a commitment, which comes a week after its home base of Seattle banned plastic drinking straws and utensils. Going forward, Starbucks will begin to use straws made from biodegradable materials such as paper and specially designed lids, some of which are already offered in Seattle.Starbucks' announcement could put more pressure on fellow coffee giant Dunkin' Donuts (DNKN  -  Free Report) to make more environmentally friendly moves. Dunkin' did announce in February that it plans to eliminate polystyrene foam cups from its stores by 2020.Meanwhile, McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report) recently said that it would switch to paper straws in the UK and test alternatives to plastic straws at some U.S. locations.*A previous version of this article mentioned that investors were present when CEO Howard Schultz spoke in China. This has been corrected becuase only Starbucks partners (employees) and media were in attendance *Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2853,SBUX,"Shares of Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) have declined over the last few trading sessions due to the second high profile departure in a month. Recently, the company announced the retirement of its chief financial officer (CFO), Scott Maw, effective Nov 30, 2018. Notably, Maw has been associated with Starbucks for seven years before assuming the role of CFO in February 2014.In the past three months, the stock has declined 17.2% compared with the industry’s 1.7% decrease. However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company seems to be well placed for long-term growth, courtesy of its robust fundamentals to counter intense competition from rivals. Let’s delve deeper.Banks on InnovationStarbucks is strengthening its product portfolio with significant innovation around beverages, refreshment, health and wellness, tea and core food offerings. In fact, beverage innovations have been a significant contributor to the company’s comps growth over the years. Seasonal offerings like pumpkin spice latte have been in the market for 10 years now and are quite popular now. Starbucks is also leaning toward fast-growing categories like Cold Brew, Draft Nitro beverages, and plant-based modifiers including almond, coconut, and soy milk alternatives.Additionally, Starbucks is fast expanding its food offerings in the United States to complement its drinks. Notably, food has become a key growth driver and contributes more than 21% to the company’s U.S. revenues. The company plans to expand its lunch menu and offer locally popular snacks around the world. Starbucks’ much talked about evening program —  food, wine and beer offerings — available at 100 stores is expected to be rolled out in 20–25% of its outlets in the United States by fiscal 2019. This evening program is expected to add $1 billion in revenues by the end of fiscal 2019.Immense Growth Potential in China & Asia-PacificManagement believes that China and the Asia-Pacific region will drive much more meaningful business growth over the next five years supported by rapid unit growth, growing brand awareness, and increased usage of the digital/mobile/loyalty platforms. Starbucks currently (as of Apr 1, 2018) operates 7,995 stores across China-Asia-Pacific (CAP). Starbucks' business in China is rapidly growing due to innovative store designs, local product innovations and the success of MSR program. It has plans to launch certain features in China loyalty program this year and full digital capabilities over time. Over the next five years, this Seattle-based coffee giant has plans to build 600 net new stores annually in Mainland China, which in turn will double the market's store count to 6,000 across 230 cities. Currently, the company operates approximately 3,300 stores in 141 cities in China. This rapid expansion is likely to triple its revenues and double its operating profit by the end of fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2017 number.Loyalty Program & DigitalizationStarbucks holds a leading position in digital, card, loyalty and mobile capabilities. Evidently, the company’s loyalty cards are gaining popularity. In the United States, its membership increased 11% year over year under the My Starbucks Rewards (MSR) program in fiscal 2017. This positive trend continued in fiscal first quarter 2018 with the membership growing 11% year over year to 14.2 million active members. Customers in the country are using the chain’s mobile app to order and pay for drinks. They are joining the Starbucks’ rewards program as well. We note that MSR is one of the key catalysts of Starbucks.Furthermore, the popularity of Starbucks’ mobile app in the United States cannot be ignored. Mobile payments represented 12% of U.S. transactions in the fiscal second quarter, up from 8% a year ago.ConcernsThe company’s Americas segment (accounting for 70% of the total revenues) posted 3% comps growth in fiscal 2017, down considerably from 6% in the year-ago period. In fact, transactions remained unchanged year over year and ticket grew 4%. This compares unfavorably with 5% growth in transaction and 1% increase in ticket in the year-ago period. In the first six months of fiscal 2018, the Americas segment posted 2% comps growth, down from 3% in the year-ago period.Moreover, decline in operating margin over the past few quarters is an added concern for the company. The non-GAAP operating margin contracted 170 bps and 80 bps in second- and first-quarter fiscal 2018, respectively. Management expects a moderate decline in operating margin in fiscal 2018, reflecting additional partner and digital investments.Key PicksBetter-ranked stocks in the same space are Brinker International, Inc. (EAT  -  Free Report), Denny's Corporation (DENN  -  Free Report) and Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN  -  Free Report). All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Brinker International, Denny's and Dunkin' Brands have an impressive earnings growth rate of 10.3%, 15.5% and 12.8%, respectively, for fiscal 2018.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

2854,SBUX,"Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) announced on Thursday that CFO Scott Maw would retire, effective November 30th of this year, and serve in a senior consultant role through March of 2019. Maw, who has been in the CFO role for the last four years, did not offer any explanation as to the timing of the announcement. Considering Maw’s relatively young age and short tenure at the firm, analysts were caught off-guard by the news.During Maw’s first two years as CFO Starbucks performed very well, with its stock value seeing nearly 73% in growth compared to an industry average of 14.3%. But since then things have slowed down, with the stock seeing a 20.7% decrease in value in from February of 2016 to the present. The news comes just weeks after Executive Chairman Howard Schultz, who oversaw the global expansion of the firm, said that he would step down from his position later this month.The FactsThis slump is largely due to recent sluggishness in comparable store sales numbers. The firm’s Americas segment (accounting for 70% of total revenues) posted 3% comps growth in fiscal 2017, representing a notable decrease from the 6% growth of the previous year. Another concern stems from the company’s announcement earlier this month that it would close 150 poorly performing company-operated stores next year, about three more than its typical annual numbers.In its Q2 FY18 earnings report, Starbucks reported in-line earnings and exceeded revenue estimates, posting $0.53 in earnings per share on $6.03 billion in revenues. These numbers represent 17.8% and 13.9% year-over-year growth, respectively.Still, the company’s 490 basis point decrease to 12.8% in GAAP operating margin is a source of concern, as this is not the first decrease in recent memory. However, according to the report, the decrease is part of the firm’s larger “restructuring and impairment charges.” The company is developing a product mix shift largely toward food as well as spending on efforts to streamline business operations.Plenty of Reason for OptimismWhile investor weariness is justified, there are still some shining points for Starbucks. Specifically, the firm is seeing large payoff on its investments in Asia. It continues to see benefits from its $1.4 billion purchase of East China JV at the end of last year. Starbucks initially operated in Eastern China, its most urban and populous region, through a 50-50 joint venture with local franchiser Uni-President group. By the deal’s close, this brought its total number of stores in China to 3,100 (in late December).As of FY17, the China-Asia-Pacific segment of SBUX’s operations account for only 14% of its total revenues. In its earnings report, it also highlighted a 54% revenue increase in China to nearly $1.2 billion in revenue and the construction of 216 new stores. Being that China’s middle class is set to double from 300 million to 600 million by 2030, there is a significant amount of earnings potential in the region. Starbucks currently operates nearly 3,300 stores in 141 cities in China (compared to over 13,000 in the US). The firm plans to build 600 net new stores per year over the next five years in the region.Another significant initiative is its global coffee licensing deal with Nestle, under which it will receive $7.15 billion in return for giving it the exclusive rights to sell Starbucks packaged coffee and teas around the world. SBUX currently reaches consumers in about 28 countries, and through Nestle will reach consumers in nearly 190 nations.OutlookStarbucks is one of the most recognized coffee brands in the world. For the 12th consecutive year, it was named one of the world’s most ethical companies by the Ethisphere Institute. The ability to get consumers to quickly recognize the brand has already proven quite useful as the firm continues to expand its reach globally. Furthermore, it is a brand that inspires loyalty. Last quarter, it announced an 11% year-over-year increase in membership of its loyalty program to 14.2 million active members in the US.It will face numerous challenges moving forward, including the need to replace its CFO and competition from other large coffee brands such as Dunkin’ Donuts (DNKN  -  Free Report). Yet, while it has recently fallen on hard times with sluggish growth in the US, Starbucks is positioning itself well to capture the trends of an ever-changing global consumer climate. Because of its resources and brand recognition, it is uniquely tooled to continue its rapid expansion abroad, which given recent trends, serves as a positive indicator. Starbucks currently sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), and will be an interesting stock for investors to keep an eye on moving forward. Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

2857,SBUX,"Investors in Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 22, 2018 $57 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Starbucks shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Starbucks is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Retail - Restaurants industry that ranks in the Bottom 40% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while five have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 66 cents per share to 65 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Starbucks right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

It’s the oldest member of the index.Starbucks warned on its guidance for the second quarter and questions were raised about where future growth may come from.Both are the type of stocks that investors like to hold for long periods, meaning 5 to 20 years.But should you own them for that long? And when do you know to sell?Value Investing and Buy and HoldValue investing and long term buy and hold investing can often go hand-in-hand because value investors like to buy stocks that are being rejected by the rest of Wall Street, and then they hold until there is a turnaround.Value investors usually have the patience to stay in a stock for years.Warren Buffett, the most famous value investor in the world, also buys and holds, often for decades.But even Buffett would agree that not all stocks are meant to be held for a long time period. For example, Buffett just sold out of his recent IBM position even though he had only owned it a few years.How long should investors hold a stock?There are 4 criteria investors might want to consider.Criteria for Long Term Buy and Hold Investors1.       Have the company fundamentals changed? Is it still in the same business as when you originally bought the stock?2.       Do you trust current management? If you own a stock for decades, management should change.3.       Are the hardships easy to turn around? Some companies seem to be on a permanent turnaround.4.       Think about how the company fits into your long-term investing plan. Does it still have a place?Former Long Term Holds: Are They Buys Now?These 3 companies have been in many investor portfolios over the years. Some investors have likely owned them for decades.But should they be going forward?1.       Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) was one of the most popular stocks of the 1990s. From Jan 1, 1990 until Jan 1, 2000, the stock rose over 1000%. The other big cap drug stocks weren’t too shabby either. But over the last 18 years, it’s been a different story. Still, the shares look cheap now. Pfizer has a forward P/E of just 12. Should you look at Pfizer if you’re a long-term investor?2.       ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) will now be the oldest component in the Dow once GE is removed. It looks pretty cheap, with a forward P/E of 16.9 and earnings growth expected of 33%. How did you do if you held it the last 18 years though?3.       Tootsie Roll  is known as a “secret company” as it won’t talk with analysts and holds no investor conference calls. Yet the stock was one of the best performers in the last bull rally of 1982 to 2000. One family owns 51% of the shares, however, and the succession plan is unknown. A long-term hold in the 80s and 90s worked with Tootsie Roll, but what about now?Find out all of Tracey’s long-term investor tips on this week’s podcast.[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of SBUX in her personal portfolio.]Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2859,SBUX,"Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) announced three strategic initiatives in order to accelerate growth and drive its shareholders’ value in the long run, which are also expected to favor both the top and bottom lines of the company.However, shares declined 1.3% in after-hours trading as the company revealed plans of shutting down a few stores in the United States. The company’s U.S. market is currently over-penetrated and stores are cannibalizing each other. Hence, Starbucks is trying to optimize its store in the United States.Let’s take a detailed look at the company’s announced streamline strategies.Strengthening Brand FootprintUnder these initiatives, the company is primarily focusing on increasing its growth rate in the United States and China. Additionally, through Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle, Starbucks plans to expand its footprint in Consumer-Packaged Goods (“CPG”) and Foodservice, adding opportunity for another 5 million points in 189 countries. The company is also focusing on increasing its shareholders’ value.Restructuration of U.S. Store PortfolioGauging its recent decelerating performance in the United States, the company has decided to augment its U.S. store portfolio in fiscal 2019. Management’s strategies will include shifting of new company-operated stores to underpenetrated markets and a slowdown in licensed store growth. Starbucks announced that it would close 150 U.S. stores in the densely penetrated markets in fiscal 2019. This would be nearly triple the number it usually shutters annually. The overall number of stores will continue to increase, but their growth will somewhat slow down.  Moreover, the company’s Americas segment (accounting for 70% of total revenues), posted 3% comps growth in fiscal 2017, down considerably from 6% in the year-ago period. In the first six months of fiscal 2018, the Americas segment posted 2% comps growth, down from 3% in the year-ago period. Consequently, over the past year, the company’s shares have lost 4.6% against the industry’s rally of 5.3%.Innovation in Product & Digital Capabilities to Drive Top-Line GrowthStarbucks continues to prioritize product innovation across core beverages while leveraging the strength of its tea and refreshment category, demanded by health-conscious customers. Additionally, under its strategic priorities, the company is digging deeper into its digital capabilities to connect with existing and new customers. The company announced the addition of 5 million new digitally registered customers since April 2018 and 2 million active Starbucks Rewards members. The company’s loyalty membership had reached 15 million in April, up 13% year over year.As it is, Starbucks holds a leading position in digital, card, loyalty and mobile capabilities. The company’s mobile app is undoubtedly one of the most widely used means of mobile payment in the United States. Strengthening of such digital initiatives is expected to quicken service, increase convenience and enhance customer loyalty, thereby driving mobile payment transactions and spurring traffic.In fact, the company mentioned that it expects digital initiatives to contribute one to two points of comps growth in the United States in fiscal 2019. Also, the company expects 1% comps growth globally in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.Efforts to Enhance Profitability & Shareholders’ ReturnThe company believes that the above-mentioned initiatives would help it generate enhanced returns. Management expects to return roughly $25 billion in cash to its shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends through fiscal 2020, up $10 billion from the previously announced cash return in November 2017.Starbucks’ Board of Directors approved a 20% increase in the company’s regular quarterly dividend and declared a cash dividend of 36 cents per share payable on Aug 24, 2018, to its shareholders of record as of Aug 9, 2018. This represents the eighth annual increase in the company’s regular quarterly dividend.The company is also trying to improve G&A efficiency by consulting third parties to figure out the growing areas of opportunity.Our TakeWhile Starbucks’ increased focus on innovation and shareholder-friendly approach encourages us, it is yet to be seen if the company’s decision of shutting down stores will bring any long-term synergies or not. Moreover, increasing competition from both upscale coffee houses, and lower-priced fast-food chains like McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report) and Dunkin' Brands (DNKN  -  Free Report) has been a potential threat to the company’s top line.Also, Starbucks is highly vulnerable to the inconsistent nature of consumer discretionary spending. Therefore, the company’s strategic priorities are the need of the hour so that it can tread back on growth trajectory.Starbucks currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the restaurant space include Domino’s (DPZ  -  Free Report). Carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Domino’s earnings for 2018 are expected to grow 52.2%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

2860,SBUX,"Nestlé is paying Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) $7.15 billion plus royalties for the global distribution rights to several Starbucks brands including Starbucks Reserve and Seattle’s Best Coffee packaged coffees, and Teavana packaged teas, with combined annual sales of around $2 billion. The Starbucks brands join Nestlé’s portfolio that also includes the Nescafé and Nespresso brands.Nestlé expects the deal to be accretive to its 2019 earnings. Starbucks will use the $7 billion cash infusion to increase its share buyback authorization. It will now return $20 billion to shareholders over the next three years through buybacks and dividends. The deal is expected to be accretive to its earnings by 2021.Direct Benefits For BothThe deal also includes Starbucks-branded capsules for Nestlé’s Nespresso and Dolce Gusto single-serve brewers that have only been available for Keurig cups thus far. But Europe’s JAB Holdings, with a view to strengthen its global coffee business, recently picked up both Keurig Green Mountain and Peet’s Coffee & Tea, potentially increasing competition for both Nestlé and Starbucks. While the Keurig deal will likely continue, it makes sense for Starbucks to expand to a competitor’s offerings as well.According to Euromonitor, the Nescafe and Nespresso brands commanded 15.0% and 4.5% market share globally in 2017 compared to Starbucks’ global market share of 2.4%. However, in the U.S., the two Nestle brands were limited to 2.2% and 2.5% shares with Starbucks accounting for 12.8%. So being able to sell Starbucks can help Nestle increase sales here while Nestle’s huge distribution network can help Starbucks grow sales internationally.And that’s exactly how the arrangement is being worked out: Nestlé is not buying equipment from Starbucks, but is taking over 500 employees as part of the deal. It will be in charge of producing Starbucks packaged coffees from beans sourced by Starbucks outside the U.S. in accordance with the terms of the license, while Starbucks continues to produce packaged coffee and other goods in North America. All sales will be booked by Nestle.The deal is even sweeter for Nestlé because its Nescafe brand of instant coffee has been losing market share over the past few years (Euromonitor).Feeds Starbucks’ Broader Growth StrategyStarbucks needs to strengthen its position in the domestic market and quickly expand in emerging international markets.DomesticSo as far as the domestic market is concerned, the coffee drinking culture (starting from teens hanging out at a coffee shop because it’s cool to an old timer taking it at home) helps the company a lot. In fact, according to the National Coffee Association’s (NCA) National Coffee Drinking Trends (NCDT) report for 2017, coffee consumption, especially of gourmet varieties, is increasing across all age groups.Gourmet is especially popular in the two youngest age groups of 13-18 year olds (29% consume daily) and 18-24 year-olds (39% consume daily). Even among older adults, gourmet consumption is growing much faster than overall consumption, making it a very important category.Gourmet is a loosely-defined term based on consumer perceptions in which the NCA includes any sort of non-instant arabica or arabica blend coffee product, including certain K-cups, premium arabica roasts from local roasters, bagged grocery coffee, or filter coffee and espresso drinks served in independent and chain coffee shops.So it basically requires specialty coffees served in unique and innovative ways. Since specialty coffee is dependent on soil and climate conditions, fermentation and roasting techniques, and other processes, now more than ever before, there is the need for a connection between the farmer and the end consumer.The coffee chain can be that important link, as it also experiments with innovative ways of serving up coffee. In addition to cold brews, these innovations could include the kind of water/tonic being used for rendering different textures, the health aspect (using mushrooms) and appealing to the younger demographic with sweeter and creamier options.As Starbucks turns its entire focus to its chains (that have taken a slight hit from lower mall footfall due to the shift online), it can do a better job of focusing on these customers.InternationalCoffee-drinking is a cultural thing, so there are parts of the world, like the Nordic region, which consumes the most, to places like North America, most of Europe and parts of South America and Africa, which follows. But the coffee drinking culture is practically absent in Asia, where tea consumption is customary. So the ability to sell the social aspect to the upwardly mobile middle class in countries like China presents an attractive growth opportunity. China is all the more attractive because of its huge and growing middle class.Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson has said that the two biggest growth engines for the company are the U.S. (where it focuses on premium sales) and China, where it is introducing the coffee culture to tea drinkers. So it is opening 500 stores a year in China with the goal of getting to 5,000 stores by 2021. Because it is easier to cater to customers that are learning about coffee, this is the company’s fastest growing market.In December last year, the company opened a 30,000-square-foot Reserve Roastery in Shanghai that is even bigger than its flagship roastery in Seattle. A third roastery is set to launch in New York this year. A Starbucks roastery showcases the processes through which various coffee beans pass to reach the customer. It’s a huge branding and marketing exercise designed to build a premium clientele over time.   Starbucks also bought out the 50% interest of its China JV partners Uni-President Enterprises Corp and President Chain Store Corp. for $1.3 billion in cash, making all its Chinese stores company-owned. Concurrent with the store expansion, it is racing to build customer relationships to ensure that people keep coming in.Summing UpLicensing the retail operations out to Nestle will allow the company to focus better on its key growth engines while helping to build brand awareness in other tea drinking populations like India where the Nestle brand is strong.While strained U.S.-China relations are an overhang on all companies dependent on China, Starbucks has spent 18 years building relationships with its Chinese partners and its stores create a good employment opportunity for Chinese people. So, because of the positive commercial effect of its operations and the non-threatening nature of its business, it’s likely that the Chinese government will take a more pragmatic view of its operations in the country. RecommendationsStarbucks has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2861,SBUX,"Markets finished sharply higher on Friday boosted by a broader tech rally. The rally was lead by Apple after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway announced that it has increased its stake in the iPhone maker. Moreover, weaker-than-expected U.S. wage growth also somewhat eased fears inflationary fears. These positives overshadowed the uncertainty over U.S.-China trade talks. This saw all three major indexes ended the day in positive territory on Friday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) gained 1.4%, to close at 24,262.51. The S&P 500 gained 1.3% to close at 2,663.42. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,209.62, increasing 1.7%. A total of 6.37 billion shares were traded on Friday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6.57 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 3.22-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 3.10-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.How did the Benchmark Perform?The Dow gained 332.36 points as shares of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) rallied after investor Warren Buffett disclosed that his company Berkshire Hathaway bought a large number of shares of the iPhone marker in recent months. Shares of other tech giants Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Facebook too gained on this news. Amazon has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The S&P 500 gained 33.69 points, with all 11 major sectors ending in positive territory. The Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) gained 2%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 121.47 points.Apple Helps Tech Stocks Rally Tech stocks rallied on Friday, led by Apple, after market guru Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway announced that it has bought 75 million of shares of the iPhone maker in the first quarter. This saw shares of Apple rally 3.9%. Apple’s shares had taken a hit a couple of weeks ago after Morgan Stanley predicted that sales of iPhone in the June quarter will be low. However, Friday saw Apple register its highest weekly gain since October 2011.Apple’s rally gave a boost to the broader technology sectors. Shares of Alphabet gained 2.4%, while Amazon and Facebook increased 0.6% and 1.5%, respectively.  Lower-Than-Expected Wage & Job Growth The Department of Labor announced that wage growth increased lower than expected in April. Average hourly wages increased a meager 0.15% against expectations of 0.2%. This somewhat eased inflationary fears fueled by concerns of rising rates. Hourly earnings have been rising at the pace of 2.7%. This is above the recovery pace but still below Fed’s target.Moreover, job additions also came in lower than expected. U.S. added 164,000 jobs in April against expectations of 195,000. However, unemployment rate dropped to 3.9%, hitting a near 18-year low. That said, the low unemployment rate, which indicates at inflationary pressure on wages, was countered by the lower-than-expected rise in payroll. This gave investors’ confidence a boost, thus helping the market rally.U.S-China Trade War FearsThe two-day U.S.-China trade negotiations concluded on Friday but no deal could be reached. The United States continued to press its demands for China to reduce the trade gap by $200 billion over the next two years. This created initial fears of a trade war that saw the market opening low on Friday.Weekly RoundupIt was a mixed week for all the three major indexes. Market declined on the first two days of the week after healthcare and industrial stocks took a hit, followed by poor economic data. According to the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), U.S. manufacturing index declined to 57.3 in April from 59.3 in March. The reading was also below the consensus estimate of 58.4.The middle of the week started on a high after Fed announced that it will keep its monetary policy unchanged. However, as fears of U.S.-China trade war escalated once again, markets took a hit. Even Apple’s robust earnings results failed to cheer up markets, as inflationary fears once again gripped markets, resulting in panic selling in the late hours on Wednesday.However, markets finally bounced back on Friday with tech stocks rallying, led by Apple, which somewhat erased inflationary and trade war fears.Stocks That Made HeadlinesStarbucks to Receive $7.15B From Nestle in Coffee AllianceStarbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) and Swiss-based food giant Nestle SA are joining forces to revitalize their coffee domains. (Read More)More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2862,SBUX,"Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) and Swiss-based food giant Nestle SA are joining forces to revitalize their coffee domains. Starbucks and Nestle announced a global marketing deal that gives the latter ""perpetual rights"" to market Starbucks’ products globally outside of its coffee shops. This is aimed at expanding the global reach of Starbucks brands in the consumer packaged goods (“CPG’) and foodservice categories.The deal requires Nestle to pay Starbucks $7.15 billion (€5.97 billion) upfront in cash for the rights to sell Starbucks coffee products in retail and food-service channels. Meanwhile, as part of the deal, around 500 Starbucks staff will join Nestle. The agreement is subject to customary regulatory approval and expected to close by the end of 2018.Tie-Up BenefitsThe agreement with Nestle, which already owns the Nescafe and Nespresso brands, will boost the global presence of the Starbucks, creating new growth opportunities in the established North American markets while unlocking expansion in international markets as well. Notably, Nestle has lately been spreading its footprint in the United States. In 2017, it added niche brands like Blue Bottle Coffee and Chameleon Cold-Brew to its portfolio.""This global coffee alliance will bring the Starbucks experience to the homes of millions more around the world through the reach and reputation of Nestle,"" said Kevin Johnson, president and chief executive officer of Starbucks.Starbucks has plans to use the proceeds to mainly accelerate share buybacks. The coffee chain giant now expects to return approximately $20 billion in cash to its shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends through fiscal year 2020.Moreover, the Seattle-based coffee giant expects the transaction to add to earnings per share (EPS) by the end of fiscal year 2021 or sooner. However, it does not expect any change to its long-term financial targets.Notably, the deal is in sync with Starbucks’ strategy to boost its top line with a focus toward operations where growth prospects and returns are the greatest.Meanwhile, the deal is Nestle’s first alliance with a major contender in coffee. Nestlé said that it expects the business to contribute positively to its EPS and organic growth targets from 2019. Notably, its ongoing share buyback program would remain unchanged.Overall, the latest tie-up enhances Nestlé’s retail and foodservice presence in coffee, complementing its position in instant coffee and super-premium single serve with Starbucks solid presence in K-cup pods in the United States.A Look At Starbucks Share Price PerformanceStarbucks’ shares have lost 0.3% in the past six months, while its industry has gained 2%. Recently, the company reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein its earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues surpassed the same. Notably, Starbucks reported in-line earnings in three of the last four quarters.Nonetheless, adjusted EPS of 53 cents in the fiscal second quarter grew 17.8% year over year. Total sales of $6.03 billion also increased 13.9% from the year-ago level. Notably, the acquisition of the East China business as well as other portfolio reshuffling activities lent a 3% net benefit to Starbucks’ top line. These activities include the closure of the Teavana mall store in the quarter, the Tazo divestiture in December, and the conversion of certain international retail operations from company-owned to licensed models.The company is leaving no stone unturned to boost its comparable store sales or comps growth in the United States that has been soft for the last few quarters. In the recently reported quarter, the Americas segment (accounting for 70% of total revenues) registered 2% comps growth, same as the preceding quarter, mirroring concerns that its increased promotions have somehow failed to attract customers in huge numbers.Meanwhile, earnings estimates have remained unchanged for the current fiscal year over the past 30 days. That said, Starbucks’ portfolio reshuffling strategies along with major marketing programs are expected to lend much support to its top and bottom lines going forward. Zacks Rank & Key PicksStarbucks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. (ARCO  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Dine Brands Global, Inc.

2863,SBUX,"Shares of Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) were down more than 9% through morning trading hours Wednesday after the coffee retailer issued sluggish comps guidance and said it would close more than 150 U.S. stores in fiscal 2019.Kevin Johnson, Starbucks president and CEO, revealed the store closure details during an Oppenheimer conference on Tuesday. Starbucks has historically closed about 50 stores per year on average, so its new plan marks a significant uptick from the norm.The affected stores are located primarily in urban areas that are already densely populated with other Starbucks locations.The ramped-up closures are one piece of a larger shift for Starbucks stores, with the company focusing on underpenetrated markets, slowing licensed store growth, doubling down on its Roastery and Reserve concepts, and investing more in U.S. digital efforts.Starbucks will also look to expand its international influence through the Global Coffee Alliance, a partnership with Nestle (NSRGY  -  Free Report).While some might view these initiatives as a necessary trimming of the fat, investors have not reacted positively to the news so far today. After closing at $57.43 per share on Tuesday, Starbucks opened in the red and eventually sunk to an intraday low of $51.87, down about 9.7%, in morning trading.Today’s selling is likely coming on the back of Starbucks also mentioning that it now sees comps growth at just 1% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018.Johnson brought up the company’s decision to close thousands of stores for one day to host racial bias training for its employees while discussing this comps guidance, although he did say the event was “not an excuse.”Still, sluggish near-term guidance clearly has plenty of investors worried today—despite management’s efforts to assure shareholder value.In a press release, Starbucks said it was raising its target for cash returned to shareholders to $25 billion through fiscal 2020, including a 20% increase in its regularly scheduled quarterly dividend. The company also said that new digital initiatives will contribute approximately 1% to 2% attributable comps in 2019.It will be interesting to see what this guidance does to analyst sentiment for the coffee behemoth’s fiscal 2019, which has not been very positive recently. Starbucks has seen eight downward revisions to its 2019 earnings estimates within the past 60 days, compared to just one upward revision in that time.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SBUX’s 2019 earnings has slumped about three cents thanks to this revision activity. Prior to the release of its new guidance, analysts were expecting Starbucks to see EPS growth about 11% from its projected 2018 totals.Mixed revision activity for the remainder of 2018 has kept SBUX at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but its analyst outlook is likely to see some adjustments soon.Want more market analysis from this author?

2864,SBUX,"Today’s big pre-market news involves a new bid from The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) to take over assets from 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), for $38 per share, or $71.3 billion. Reports are the offer would split the payout 50/50 between cash and stock. This outbids Comcast’s (CMCSA  -  Free Report) offer last week to pay $35 per share for Fox assets, all cash.This deal has been in the making for more than half a year now, with the previous bid from Disney amounting to $28 per share. Seems a pittance now, especially considering that Comcast may come back with an even better offer, perhaps even bringing a new deal into the $40 per share range or higher. “Content is king,” of course, and in the timeless words of Mel Brooks, “It’s good to be the king.”FOXA shares jumped 6% almost immediately on the news, and after selling off a tad subsequently, has now ratcheted up nearly 8% currently. Year over year, Fox is up roughly 73% — and if a bidding war is indeed in the offing, we’re not done with these increases yet. Disney stock is also up at this hour, about 2.25%, and even Comcast is up by 4 cents right now.Disney and Fox have a longer relationship in place regarding content development, but no one seems to think this deal is over. Even representatives at Disney — and even after hearing news that Disney CEO Bob Iger and Fox CEP Rupert Murdoch dined together last night, according to CNBC’s David Faber — don’t believe Comcast is finished pursuing these assets. Stay tuned!Elsewhere, reports that Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) is cutting sales forecasts has sent shares falling more than 3.5% in today’s pre-market. The retail coffee giant is also planning to shutter 150 stores in the next year, in what appears to be a plan to increase comps in existing stores. Starbucks stock is down 7% year over year, and has only met earnings estimates in three of its last four quarters.Also, Starbucks is one of the companies most often cited as potential collateral in a trade war between the U.S. and China. As China cannot match us tariff for tariff because they import less than 4x the goods from the U.S. than we import from their country, companies that do significant business in China — Yum China (YUMC  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and General Motors (GM  -  Free Report), for instance — may face boycotts or other, shall we say, “anti-growth” measures.Some potentially good news on global trade?

2867,SBUX,"Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) reported in-line earnings but exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the second-quarter of fiscal 2018. The company’s results benefited from an improved performance in the Americas segment (mainly in the United States), the ongoing momentum in China (following the takeover of East China) and strongest comps growth in Japan in five quarters.However, Starbucks’ shares declined 2.2% in the after-hour trading session following the earnings release on Apr 26, possibly in response to stagnant comps growth in the Americas division that constitutes 70% of total revenues.Earnings, Sales & Comps DiscussionAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 53 cents met the consensus mark but grew 17.8% year over year.Total sales of $6.03 billion surpassed the consensus mark of $5.9 billion by 2.3% and increased 13.9% from the year-ago level. Notably, the acquisition of the East China business as well as other portfolio reshuffling activities lent a 3% net benefit to its top line. These activities include the closure of the Teavana mall store in the quarter, the Tazo divestiture in December, and the conversion of certain international retail operations from company-owned to licensed models. Meanwhile, currency translation had a 2% positive impact on revenues.The year-over-year performance was also driven by higher revenues from the opening of 2,103 net new stores over the past 12 months and higher global comps growth.Global same-store sales increased 2%, same as the preceding quarter. Global traffic increased 3%, better than the 2% increase in the fourth quarter. Transactions were down by 1% against no growth in the preceding quarter. The company opened 468 net new stores globally, bringing the total store count to 28,209 across 76 markets. It also closed 298 Teavana stores in the quarter.Starbucks Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Starbucks Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Starbucks Corporation QuoteMargin DownOperating margin decreased 490 basis points (bps) year over year to 12.8% in the quarter due to a product mix shift, largely toward food and restructuring costs associated with the company's ongoing efforts of streamlining business operations. Again, higher spending in its store partners (employees) along with the impact of its ownership change in East China added to the woes.On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin declined 170 bps to 16.2%.Quarterly Segment DetailsAmericas: Net revenues in this flagship segment were up 8% year over year to $4 billion.Comps rise of 2% in the quarter (same as the preceding quarter) comprised a 3% increase in average ticket. U.S. comps also grew 2% albeit less than the 3% increase during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.Importantly, this is second consecutive quarter of 2% comps growth in Americas, mirroring concerns that its increased promotions somehow failed to attract a huge number of customers.Food comps were more than 1% and food has consistently contributed in the 1% to 2% comps range for many years now. This momentum continued in the quarter with food's share of total U.S. sales being 22%, up 100 bps from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, iced beverages contributed almost 40% to overall revenue growth.Membership increased 12% year over year to 14.9 million in the My Starbucks Rewards (MSR) program. Customers in the United States are using the chain's mobile app to order and pay for their drinks and are joining the company's rewards program. Mobile payments represented 12% of U.S. transactions, reflecting an increase from 8% a year ago.Operating margin in the segment, however, contracted 220 bps to 20% as a strong sales leverage was more than offset by the impact of a food-related mix shift and higher spending in its store partners.China-Asia-Pacific (CAP): Net revenues increased 54% to $1.2 billion on the back of higher revenues from the acquisition of east China operations, new store openings and comps growth.Comps grew 3%, higher than 1% in the previous quarter. China continued to post impressive comps growth, with 4% improvement in the quarter (softer than 6% in the preceding quarter). The softer sequential growth was attributed to a shift in the timing of the Lunar New Year. Meanwhile, Japan delivered its first quarter of positive comps since the first quarter of fiscal 2017, buoyed by a strong beverage lineup.However, operating margin at the CAP segment contracted 570 bps year over year to 17.2% in the quarter, owing to the impact of its ownership change in East China.Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA): Net revenues were up 15% year over year at $266.1 million in the segment. The improvement was prompted by higher revenues from the addition of new stores and a positive currency effect.That said, comps declined 1% (against a 2% decline in the preceding quarter).Operating margin declined 1,360 bps due to a partial impairment of goodwill related to the Switzerland retail business and sales deleverage on company-operated stores.Channel Development: Net revenues improved 8% to $500.2 million. The growth was driven by higher sales of premium single-serve products.Operating margin improved 100 bps to 43%.All-Other: The segment comprises Seattle's Best Coffee, Starbucks Reserve Coffee and Roastery businesses, and Teavana-branded stores. Revenues at the segment decreased 32% to $75.6 million.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceStarbucks expects global comps growth at the lower end of its earlier projected guidance of 3-5%. The company still expects to add approximately 2,300 net new stores globally. Consolidated revenue growth is expected in in the high single digits.The company expects its GAAP EPS in the range of $3.32-$3.36.Starbucks expects non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.48-$2.53 compared with $2.30-$2.33 expected earlier. Although the guidance is consistent with the company’s earlier projection, it excludes the impact of its previously announced plan to close more than 8,000 company-owned stores in the United States on May 29, 2018 to conduct racial-bias training for all partners (employees) in the United States.Zacks RankStarbucks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2868,SBUX,"Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) highlighted its key strategies to drive growth over the next decade, at its recent 26th Annual Meeting of Shareholders. One of the primary focuses will be on expanding digital relationships, with more than 60 million U.S. customers per month currently, who are not yet members of Starbucks Rewards Program. The company will allow non-Starbucks Rewards members to use the App’s Mobile-Order-and-Pay or MOP facility for ordering. Earlier, the service was only available to loyalty members.Starbucks’ MOP service represented nearly 11% of the total U.S. transactions in the fiscal first quarter 2018, up from 10% in the prior quarter and 7% in the year-ago quarter. This initiative allows customers to order before arriving at a Starbucks café and pick up the items at their selected store, thus saving time. The service is witnessing increased usage and can prove to be a key growth driver as adoption increases.The company will be introducing a number of indoor and outdoor campaigns, designed to build personalized digital relationships with customers.As retail companies are witnessing a shift in consumer shopping behavior from bricks-and-mortar stores to online shopping, efforts to enhance digital capabilities can significantly boost revenues. Starbucks has been continuously enhancing digital assets, loyalty and e-commerce programs to capitalize on this trend.Starbucks’ mobile app is undoubtedly one of the most widely used mobile payment app in the United States. Nearly 31% of all U.S. transactions took place through mobile devices at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2018, increasing from 27% in the year-ago quarter. Therefore, it makes sense for the company to increase focus on enhancing digital capabilities.Starbucks’ membership in the United States increased 11% year over year under the My Starbucks Rewards (MSR) program in the fiscal 2017. The positive trend continued in first-quarter fiscal 2018 with active members rising 11% year over year to 14.2 million. MSR is one of the most important business drivers of Starbucks.Other new digital initiatives include My Starbucks Barista ordering system and Digital Order Manager — a high-value, low-cost technology to optimize store operations and elevate customer experience.These digital initiatives are expected to quicken service, increase convenience and enhance customer loyalty, which will boost mobile payment transactions and spur traffic.Expanding China Business & Reserve BrandApart from increasing digital engagement, the company will be focusing on the expansion of its China business and the Starbucks Reserve brand.The company plans on opening 5,000 stores in China by 2021 and introduce innovation in coffee, store design and digital engagement, in line with the Chinese lifestyle. Notably, the number of stores in China has risen from 800 to 3,200 in the past five years, with an average of a new store opening every 15 hours.Starbucks plans to open Italian artisan food by Princi stores in Seattle, Chicago, New York and Shanghai. It plans to open Roasteries in Milan and New York later in 2018 and in Tokyo and Chicago in 2019. In the long run, the company’s premium store segmentation will include more Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, up to 1,000 Reserve stores and 20% of the Starbucks store portfolio will become Starbucks Reserve bar locations.Such initiatives are expected to improve customer experience and boost demand. Meanwhile, Starbucks’ shares have gained 2.1% in the last three months against the industry’s decline of 2%. Also, earnings estimates for fiscal 2018 have moved up 4.6% in the last 60 days, reflecting analysts’ optimism on the stock.  Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderStarbucks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Dine Brands Global, Inc.

Also, in the first two quarters of fiscal 2018, Darden witnessed year-over-year sales growth of 13.7%.Olive Garden is likely to grow from the prior-year quarter on Brand Renaissance Plan and the To Go business that offer online ordering at selected locations. The brand is particularly focusing on remodeling and bar refreshes. The revamped restaurants are already generating high same-restaurant sales and returns.In fact, supported by these initiatives, Olive Garden posted the 13th consecutive quarter of positive comps in second-quarter fiscal 2018. Expecting this forward trend to continue, the consensus estimate projects comps growth of 0.02% in the to-be-reported quarter.Comps at LongHorn are expected to grow year over year owing to culinary innovation in the segment. Darden is also working on a marketing strategy to improve execution, customer relationship management and digital advertising. Further, the company continues to focus on strengthening its in-restaurant execution through strategic investments in quality.Owing to these efforts, segment comps have been growing since the past 19 consecutive quarters and are likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well. The consensus estimate for the segment’s third-quarter comps is projected to grow 0.3%.Meanwhile, the acquisition of Cheddar’s seems to be a great fit in the company’s portfolio as it not only complements its existing brands but is also expected to aid in attracting customers, given its extensive appeal. In the fiscal second quarter, total sales were favored by the addition of 153 Cheddar’s and 28 other new restaurants.Segmental sales also improved owing to Cheddar’s integration in the Other Business segment. Synergies from the buyout of Cheddar’s are expected to continue favoring the segment’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Cost-Saving Efforts to Favor Bottom LineDarden has an aggressive cost management plan, under which it has significantly cut operating costs. In fact, for fiscal 2018, the company expects 10-40 basis points year-over-year margin expansion as a result of cost savings.The company’s cost cutting is likely to favor earnings growth in the to-be-reported quarter. The consensus estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.64, mirroring 24.2% year-over-year growth.Our Quantitative Model Suggests a BeatAccording to our quantitative model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has a fair chance of beating estimates.

2870,SBUX,"Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) announced the retirement of its chief financial officer, Scott Maw, effective Nov 30, 2018. Notably, Maw has been associated with the company for seven years before taking on the role of CFO in February 2014.The move came as a surprise for the market. In fact, shares of the company declined by 2.6% yesterday, reflecting the apprehensive stance of investors. Retirement of Maw marks the second high profile departure in the company’s hierarchy in a month. Earlier this month, Howard Schultz stepped down from the position of executive chairman and was succeeded by former J.C. Penney chief executive Myron E. ""Mike"" Ullman.In the first-half of Maw’s tenure, the company reported robust sales growth. However, sales growth has decelerated of late. The company’s Americas segment (accounting for 70% of the total revenues) posted 3% comps growth in fiscal 2017, down considerably from 6% in the year-ago period.Starbucks’ Stock PerformanceStarbucks’ shares lost nearly 17% in the past year, against its industry’s growth of 0.7%. Meanwhile, the company’s new CEO Kevin Johnson faces a range of challenges, starting from subdued growth in the dominant U.S. market and intense competition from rivals to a huge expansion project in China.That said the company’s fundamentals remain strong as is evident from the 3-5 year expected EPS growth rate of 14%. In the last reported second-quarter fiscal 2018, Starbucks’ adjusted earnings per share of 53 cents showed an improvement of 17.8% year over year. The results benefited from improved performance in the Americas (mainly in the United States), the ongoing positive momentum in China (following the takeover of East China) and strongest comps growth in Japan in five quarters.Importantly, Starbucks and Swiss-based food giant Nestle SA recently teamed up to revitalize their coffee domains. Starbucks and Nestle announced a global marketing deal that gives the latter ""perpetual rights"" to market Starbucks’ products globally. This alliance will expand the global reach of Starbucks brands in the consumer packaged goods and foodservice categories to nearly 190 countries from the present count of 28.Additionally, factors like better job prospects and increasing consumer confidence are likely to play an important role in boosting the restaurant industry, to which this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock belongs.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the restaurant space include Wingstop (WING  -  Free Report), Dine Brands (DIN  -  Free Report) and Domino’s (DPZ  -  Free Report).

2871,SBUX,"Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN  -  Free Report) is benefiting from the use of digital technology through DD card, DD mobile app, DD Perks rewards program, On-the-Go ordering and delivery.In fourth-quarter 2017, the company posted solid results having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both earnings and revenues front.Notably, Dunkin' Brands has also outpaced the consensus mark in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 3.5%. Over the past 30 days, the consensus mark for the current quarter has moved up 2% to 52 cents.In the past six months, shares of Dunkin' Brands have rallied 12.1%, significantly outperforming the 5.2% gain of the industry it belongs to.Loyalty Program and Refranchising Boosting GrowthDunkin' Brands DD Perks Loyalty Program continues to be a major sales driver, primarily backed by the company’s brand recognition. Currently, the program has 8 million members including 2 million that were added in 2017.Also, it is encouraging customers to use the DD Card and enroll as Perks members so that they can benefit from the convenience offered by the On-the-Go platform. This makes it easier for the company to retain customers. It is using speed of service as a key differentiator against competition to ensure comps growth and store level profitability.Moreover, re-franchising a large chunk of its system reduces Dunkin' Brands’ capital requirements and facilitates earnings per share growth and ROE expansion. Meanwhile, free cash flow continues to grow, facilitating reinvestment to increase brand recognition and shareholders’ return. Notably, since a major portion of its business is re-franchised, Dunkin’ Brands is less affected by food cost inflation compared to its peers.Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. QuoteCompetition and Soft Consumer Spending Remain WoesDunkin' Brands is facing competition from larger fast-casual companies, which offer healthier menu options and are gaining popularity. Further, the company’s coffee offerings face intense competition from one of the coffee giants like Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) that boasts a much larger scale of operations. In addition, companies like Jack in the Box (JACK  -  Free Report) and McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report) are gaining traction with their breakfast platter, which in turn is weighing on Dunkin' Brands breakfast segment revenues.Over the past few quarters, weak traffic due to soft consumer demand and sluggish comps growth in restaurants have also affected the company’s performance.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

2872,SBUX,"Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) has inked an agreement with SouthRock, a leading multi-brand restaurant operator in Brazil, to fully license Starbucks’ retail operations in the country. This move will enable SouthRock to develop and operate Starbucks stores in Brazil, thereby giving the coffee giant an opportunity to pursue its long-term growth agenda for Brazil.The company has been serving Brazilian customers since December 2006 with a consistent and authentic in-store experience. Starbucks serves customers in 113 stores in 17 cities across the states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro with more than 1,450 employees.Starbucks currently serves several Latin America and the Caribbean markets namely Argentina, Aruba and Curacao, Bahamas, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, Trinidad and Tobago. With the transition of ownership in Brazil, Starbucks’ retail operations across all the 17 markets in Latin America and the Caribbean will become wholly licensed. The company has plans to open stores in Uruguay later this year.Global Expansion on TrackExpansion has been one of the important growth strategies for this coffee giant. Management focuses on increasing its global market share by judiciously opening stores in new and prevailing markets, remodeling existing stores, deploying technology, controlling costs, and aggressive product innovation and brand building.In fiscal 2018, Starbucks expects to expand globally by adding 2,300 net new locations (excluding Teavana closures), marking an increase from roughly 2,250 net new locations in fiscal 2017.Expanding beyond the United States has been one of Starbucks’ key growth strategies. Last December, Starbucks opened its 25th store in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In November 2017, the company opened its first store in Jamaica, marking the 76th market for the company. The company plans to launch 14 more stores over a period of five years.

2873,SBUX,"Shares of several major Chinese internet companies—including Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report), JD.com (JD  -  Free Report), and Tencent (TCEHY  -  Free Report)—surged in early morning trading Tuesday after a better-than-expected earnings report underscored the strength of the budding industry.Baozun (BZUN  -  Free Report), a smaller firm that helps Western brands like Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) adapt their e-commerce strategies for China, posted its latest quarterly financial results on Tuesday morning. Total revenues reached $241 million, up about 23% from the year-ago period. Non-GAAP net income skyrocketed 128% to $24.7 million.The digital solutions company also noted that services revenues climbed 56% on a year-over-year basis. Baozun shares surged 20% to touch an all-time intraday high of $43.94 in early trading Tuesday.BZUN helped lift other Chinese internet stocks because of its tight-knit relationships with the industry’s major players. Alibaba is the company’s biggest investor, while JD.com is considered a close business partner.Baozun’s health also proves the strength of China’s internet marketplace. If its clients—including Nike, Starbucks, Coach , and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU  -  Free Report)—are finding value in developing online sales strategies specifically for the country, it probably spells good news for other businesses in the space.Chinese internet stocks are also rising on the back of reports that the nation’s regulators are working on a plan to allow foreign-listed tech giants to trade on domestic exchanges. Companies like Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu originally listed on foreign exchanges in an attempt to gain international recognition back when Beijing heavily regulated outsiders’ exposure to Chinese A-shares.According to a recent report from The Wall Street Journal, the world’s most-populous nation is now considering a structure that would allow investors to buy and sell shares of these companies indirectly.The KraneShares CSI China Internet Fund (KWEB  -  Free Report) gained more than 1% in morning trading Tuesday and is now up more than 3% since the WSJ’s story.Want more market analysis from this author?

2874,SBUX,"Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)-based Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) posted perhaps the most impressive earnings report of the entire (extremely robust) Q1 earnings season thus far: earnings of $3.27 per share trounced the estimated $1.22, on revenues of $51.04 billion which outpaced the $50.17 billion in the Zacks consensus, up 43% year over year.

2876,SBUX,"Shares of Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) battled into the green on Wednesday afternoon amid up-and-down trading throughout the market, with investors juggling between solid earnings growth and concerns about rising Treasury yields as bullish and bearish catalysts. Nevertheless, with a consumer company the size of Starbucks set to report its latest quarterly results on Thursday, investors will want to be prepared.Starbucks grabbed headlines recently when its CEO decided to close all U.S. locations for mandatory racial bias training after a troubling profiling incident at one of its stores. But that closure will not happen until May, and investors will want to be ready for the coffee giant’s second quarter fiscal 2018 report this week.So what should investors expect when Starbucks announces its Q2 results on Thursday afternoon? Let’s take a closer look.Latest Outlook and ValuationAccording to our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, analysts are expecting Starbucks to report earnings of $0.53 per share and revenue of $5.90 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth rates of 17.8% and 11.4%, respectively. As we near its report date, Starbucks is trading at about 21.7x forward 12-month earnings. Over the past year, its Forward P/E has been as high as 25.1 and as low as 20.7. It has traded with a median forward earnings multiple of 23.2x in that time. The company’s industry peers are currently sporting an average Forward P/E of 21.0. Investors might conclude that SBUX is trading at a slight premium to its industry but remains on the low end of its recent valuation range.Earnings ESP WhispersInvestors will also want to anticipate the likelihood that Starbucks surprises investors with better-than-anticipated earnings results. For this, we turn to our Earnings ESP figure.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Starbucks is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of -0.3%. This means that the most recent estimates have been lower than the consensus. In other words, our model is not conclusively calling for a beat.Surprise HistoryAnother important thing to consider ahead of Starbucks’ report is the company’s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices. The coffee retailer is a respectable earnings performer, having met or surpassed estimates in each of the trailing nine quarters.However, we prefer to judge the price effect of earnings announcements by comparing the closing price of the stock two days before the report and two days after the report. Over the course of its recent streak, Starbucks has moved higher in just three of these windows.Bottom LineStarbucks is a bit pricier than the broader market, although its ability to witness double-digit growth on the top and bottom line this year might warrant that premium. Either way, earnings season tends to be a volatile time for the stock, and investors will be interested in the company’s guidance more so than anything else.Want more market analysis from this author?

2878,SBUX,"Darden Restaurants, Inc. (DRI  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 21, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, Darden posted impressive earnings and revenues resulting from the company’s relentless efforts in improving the basic operating factors of business — food, service and atmosphere. Also, addition of 154 Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen and 34 other new restaurants significantly boosted the top line.We believe that synergies from Cheddar’s acquisition and various sales-boosting initiatives across brands are expected to benefit Darden’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues. Also, efficient cost-containment efforts are likely to improve margins and the company’s bottom line.Notably, Darden’s shares have gained 3.9% in the past year, in line with the industry’s growth. Let’s find out how the company’s to-be-reported quarter results will turn out.Top Line to Gain from Acquisition & Sales-Building EffortsDarden’s revenues are expected to increase year over year in the to-be-reported quarter, driven by various initiatives that include simplifying kitchen systems, operational excellence to enhance guest experience, menu innovation and other technology-driven moves. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s net sales is pegged at $2.12 billion, reflecting 9.8% year-over-year growth. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2018, Darden witnessed year-over-year sales growth of 13.6%.Olive Garden is likely to grow from the prior-year quarter on Brand Renaissance Plan and the To Go business that offer online ordering at selected locations. The brand is particularly focusing on remodeling and bar refreshes.The revamped restaurants are already generating high same-restaurant sales and returns. In fact, supported by these initiatives, Olive Garden posted the 14th consecutive quarter of positive comps in third-quarter fiscal 2018. Expecting this forward trend to continue, the consensus estimate for comps growth is pegged at 0.01% in the to-be-reported quarter.Comps at LongHorn are expected to grow year over year, owing to culinary innovation in the segment. Darden is also working on a marketing strategy to improve execution, customer-relationship management and digital advertising. Further, the company continues to focus on strengthening its in-restaurant execution through strategic investments in quality.Owing to these efforts, segment comps have been growing since the past 20 consecutive quarters and the trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well. The consensus estimate for the segment’s fourth-quarter comps is projected to grow 0.01%.Meanwhile, the acquisition of Cheddar’s seems to be a great fit in the company’s portfolio, as it not only complements its existing brands but is also expected to aid in attracting more customers, given its extensive appeal. Synergies from the buyout of Cheddar’s are expected to continue favoring the segment’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Cost-Saving Efforts to Favor Bottom LineDarden has an aggressive cost-management plan, under which it has significantly cut operating costs. In fact, for fiscal 2018, the company expects 10-40 basis points year-over-year margin expansion as a result of cost savings.The company’s cost cutting is likely to favor earnings growth in the to-be-reported quarter. The consensus estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.35, mirroring 14.4% year-over-year growth.Our Quantitative Model Suggests a BeatAccording to our quantitative model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has a fair chance of beating estimates.

2879,SBUX,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 7.3% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is SBUX due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.First-Quarter Fiscal 2018 ResultsStarbucks reported better-than-expected earnings but failed to meet the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in first-quarter fiscal 2018 results. The company also lifted its full-year profit outlook considering the new U.S. corporate tax cut.Earnings, Sales & Comps DiscussionAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 65 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents by 14% and grew 25% year over year.Total sales of $6.07 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.14 billion by a small percentage but increased 6% from the year-ago level. Notably, Q1 revenues mark Starbucks’ first ever $6 billion quarterly revenues. The year-over-year performance was driven by higher revenues from the opening of 2,305 net new stores over the past 12 months and higher comps growth.Global same-store sales increased 2%, same as the preceding quarter. Global traffic increased 2% in the quarter, same as the previous quarter. Transactions remain flat during the quarter against 1% growth in the preceding quarter. The company opened 700 net new stores globally, bringing the total store count to 28,039 across 76 markets.Margins DownOperating margin decreased 140 basis points (bps) year over year to 18.4% in the quarter due to product mix shift, largely toward food and restructuring cost associated with the company's ongoing efforts of streamlining business operations.On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin declined 80 bps to 19.2%.Quarterly Segment DetailsAmericas: Net revenues in this flagship segment were up 7% year over year to $4.3 billion. Comps rise of 2% in the quarter was softer compared with an increase of 3% in the last quarter. U.S. comps grew 2%, comprising 2% increase in average ticket.Food comps were 2% and the company’s core beverage comp (excluding holiday limited time offerings) was 1%.Membership increased 11% year over year in the My Starbucks Rewards (MSR) program. Customers in the United States are using the chain's mobile app to order and pay for their drinks and are joining the company's rewards program. Mobile payments represented 31% of U.S. transactions, reflecting an increase from 27% a year ago.Operating margin in the segment, however, contracted 100 bps to 23% as strong sales leverage was more than offset by the impact of food-related mix shift.China-Asia-Pacific (CAP): Net revenues increased 9% to $843.7 million on the back of higher revenues from new store opening and comp store sales growth.Comps grew 1%, softer than 2% in the previous quarter. China continued to post stellar comps growth, delivering 6% in the quarter (softer than 8% in the preceding quarter). Japan’s comp growth continues to be negatively impacted by softness in limited time offerings and Frappuccino limited-time offerings, in particular.Operating margin at the CAP segment expanded 210 bps year over year to 23.3% in the quarter, buoyed by strong sales leverage and positive currency effect.Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA): Net revenues were up 8% year over year at $283.9 million in the segment, as higher revenues from addition of new stores and positive currency effect.That said, comps declined 2% (against 1% growth in the preceding quarter).Operating margin declined 300 bps to 13.8% due to softer performance in its company-owned stores.Channel Development: Channel Development's net revenues improved 1% to $560.3 million. The growth was driven by its foodservice, international and packaged coffee channels.Operating margin contracted 50 bps to 43.4%.All-Other: The segment comprises Seattle's Best Coffee, Starbucks Reserve and Roastery businesses. Revenues at the segment decreased 22% to $120 million.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceStarbucks now expects global comp growth at the lower end of its earlier projected guidance at 3-5%. The company still expects to add approximately 2,300 net new stores globally. Consolidated revenue growth is expected in the high single digits. The company expects revenue growth of approximately 9-11% after including approximately 4 points of favorable impact from the East China acquisition and approximately 2 points of unfavorable impact from other streamlining activities.Consolidated operating margin is expected to decrease slightly (before additional partner and digital investments related to changes in U.S. tax law). Including these investments, operating margin is anticipated to decline moderately from the fiscal 2017 level of 19.7%.The company expects its GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.32-$3.36. Starbucks now expects non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.48-$2.53 compared with $2.30-$2.33 expected earlier with growth in the second half to be a shade higher than the first half. Although the guidance is consistent with the company’s earlier projection, the raised view reflects net impact of the new U.S. tax law's federal statutory tax rate and related reinvestments.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to one lower.Starbucks Corporation Price and Consensus  Starbucks Corporation Price and Consensus | Starbucks Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, SBUX has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with an A.

2880,SBUX,"With markets in correction mode, it’s very difficult to select stocks that will offer steady returns going forward. Investors may apply complex investment strategies with an aim to book higher returns but may not be rewarded with the desired returns.Thus, at present, investors should use conventional strategies, based on key fundamentals, to select stocks. One such strategy is focus on sales growth.Why Sales Growth?Investors often fail to keep an eye on sales growth while picking stocks, as a company’s share price is usually sensitive to its earnings momentum. Nonetheless, earnings are not the be-all and end-all in the sense that books can be easily manipulated. That’s why sales should always be taken into consideration.Sales growth is actually an important indicator of a company's health and ability to sustain its business. It offers investors an insight into product demand and pricing power. The main advantage is that the sales figure is generally not manipulated and is less volatile than earnings.Without some revenue growth, bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable in the longer term. While a company can show earnings strength by reducing expenses, a sustainable bottom-line recovery usually requires sales growth.Focusing exclusively on sales growth is not enough though. A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks, but it does not ensure profits. So, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy.Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns. Most importantly, a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Seattle, WA, Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) operates as a roaster, marketer, and retailer of specialty coffee.

2881,SBUX,"In a bid to capitalize on the growing demand for sparkling beverages, Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) has launched Teavana Sparkling Craft Iced Tea — one of the first premium sparkling ready-to-drink iced tea drink.Sparling Beverage enthusiasts can choose from two varieties — Blackberry Lime Green Tea and Unsweetened Peach Nectarine Green Tea. This product is the latest addition to the Teavana Craft Iced Tea portfolio which already consists of six sweetened and unsweetened still flavors. It will now be available in select Northeast and Midwest grocery stores and made available nationwide in 2019.Sparkling Beverage Market StrongThe sparkling beverage market is growing as an increasing number of Americans are becoming health conscious and refraining from carbonated and sugary drinks. Starbucks has been gaining significantly from beverage innovation over the years. With this new product, Starbucks is likely to cash in on the growing demand.According to IRI data, the sparkling water category revenues grew 16.1% over the course of a year. The sparkling water category surged 70% between 2011 and 2016 and is expected to touch $3.1 billion by 2022, according to Euromonitor. Per Beverage Market Corporation, per capita consumption of bottled water will cross 50 gallons in the next few years.Therefore, expanding into the sparkling beverage space can prove to be beneficial for Starbucks. The company is focused on pursuing a single tea brand strategy. It also aims to put emphasis on its Teavana super-premium tea brand by making investments toward growth, innovation and development of Teavana brand teas in Starbucks stores.Also, given the decelerating performance in the United States, introducing products in line with consumers’ preference is pertinent for driving revenues. The  Americas segment (accounting for 70% of total revenues) posted 3% comps growth in fiscal 2017, down from 6% growth in fiscal 2016. In the first six months of fiscal 2018, the segment delivered 2% comps growth, down from 3% in the year-ago period.Price PerformanceStarbucks’ shares have lost 6.3% in the past year, against the 4.3% rally of its industry. Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s fiscal 2018 earnings estimate revisions is not impressive, as it remained stable over the past 60 days.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the same space are BJ's Restaurants, Inc (BJRI  -  Free Report), Dine Brands Global, Inc (DIN  -  Free Report) and Domino's Pizza Inc (DPZ  -  Free Report). BJ's Restaurants sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while the other two companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2883,SBUX,"After witnessing declining comps for seven quarters, the U.S. restaurant industry saw a turnaround in the fourth quarter of 2017. According to TDn2K’s The Restaurant Industry Snapshot, fourth-quarter comps were up 0.4%, comparing favorably with the third quarter’s decline of 1%. Moreover, March 2018 marked the highest sales growth since October 2017, with comps rising 0.8%. However, comps in the first quarter rose only 0.1% year over year. Nonetheless, the industry saw two successive quarters of positive comps which reflects slow yet steady growth.Per the National Restaurant Association (NRA), the industry generated $799 billion in revenues in 2017, up 4.3% from 2016. Restaurant operators are resorting to various sales-building efforts, cost cuts, franchisee-based business models, loyalty programs and increased usage of technology to enhance guest experience and drive traffic as well as comps.Also, they are rapidly adapting to the changing tastes and preferences of their guests to keep them engaged. To do so, restaurant operators are consistently trying to bring innovations on the menu front to cater to the ever-changing taste of customers.Recent gains in the labor market on the back of a steady rise in wages are likely to encourage consumers to dine out more. U.S. consumer confidence touched a new 14-year high in March. The consumer sentiment index was 102.0 in March compared with 99.7 in February.Q1 ExpectationsAs we take a closer look at the earnings season, we see a steady improvement over the past few quarters. So far, this earnings season has seen releases from 87 S&P 500 members, with 82.8% beating EPS estimates and 67.8% beating revenue estimates.According to the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings in first-quarter 2018 are expected to be up 18.3% from the prior-year quarter on 7.7% higher revenues compared with 13.4% earnings growth in the fourth quarter of 2017 on 8.6% rise in revenues.Earnings for the Retail-Wholesale sector, to which the restaurant industry belongs, are expected to increase 11.7% compared with 3% in the prior quarter. Revenues are expected to improve 7.6% in the quarter.Now let us take a look at how the following restaurant companies are placed ahead of their quarterly release on Apr 26.Our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock has a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high.

This compares unfavorably with 5% growth in transaction and an increase of 1% in ticket in fiscal 2016.In Q1, membership increased 11% year over year in the My Starbucks Rewards (MSR) program. Customers in the United States are using the chain's mobile app to order and pay for their drinks, and are joining the company's rewards program. Mobile payments represented 31% of U.S. transactions, reflecting an increase from 27% a year ago.Operating margin in the segment, however, contracted 100 basis points to 23%, as strong sales leverage was more than offset by food-related mix shift.Q2 ExpectationsStarbucks’ Americas segment revenues (inclusive of the United States, Canada and Latin America, comprising 70% of its total revenues) are expected to witness 6.9% growth year over year but 6.9% decline sequentially, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Meanwhile, the company expects the first half of the year in Americas comps to be a little below the average for the year, and the second half to be a little bit above.The company’s segment is likely to experience higher revenues year over year courtesy of additional store openings, Starbucks’ mobile order/pay along with significant innovation in beverages, refreshment, health and wellness, tea and core food offerings. Starbucks has secured a leading position in leveraging its mobile and digital assets and loyalty, and e-Commerce platforms to capitalize on these trends and create more revenue streams to boost its top line.Apart from the Americas segment, Starbucks’ Channel Development business also needs special mention. Although the business is small (in terms of its revenue contribution), it generates impressive operating margins owing to its cost structure. Hence, the Channel Development segment represents a significant profitable growth opportunity. Channel Development is expected to report revenues of $479 million, higher than $461 million in the year-ago quarter but lower than $560 million in the preceding one.Revenues in the China-Asia-Pacific segment are likely to witness 47% year-over-year and 34.1% sequential growth. Additionally, the consensus estimate for Europe, Middle East and Africa or EMEA segment revenues of $254 million indicates an increase from $232 million in the year-ago quarter but a decrease from $284 million in the prior quarter.Overall Earnings & Revenue ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 53 cents reflects 17.8% growth from the prior-year quarter’s profit of 45 cents. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $5.91 billion indicates a 11.5% increase on a year-over-year basis.Starbucks’ operating fundamentals such as solid global retail footprint, successful innovations, best-in-class loyalty program and digital offerings remain strong. Again, digital initiatives like mobile order/pay, delivery services and third-party loyalty partnerships can stimulate stronger sales trends in the Americas. Internationally, the company’s focus on China/Asia expansion is another positive.Meanwhile, change in the product mix (as food, tea and cold beverages will become an increasing part of the product mix), focus on the use of loyalty cards and mobile order, and pay technology to boost sales and profits are added tailwinds. Finally, Starbucks’ endeavor to boost its presence in premium coffee consumed at home through K-cups and with ready-to-drink beverages needs special attention.Overall, apart from higher revenues, lower tax rate along with share repurchases will help Starbucks to post higher earnings. That said, headwinds, especially in the labor front, are a cause of concern for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

2885,SBUX,"Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 26, after the closing bell.In the preceding quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14.04%. However, the coffee-chain giant reported in-line results on earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, resulting in a positive surprise of 3.51%. Nonetheless, we expect Starbucks’ earnings to increase in the to-be-reported quarter banking on higher revenues, lower tax rate and share repurchases.A Look at Starbucks’ Top-Line ScenarioFor the fiscal second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $5.91 billion, implying 11.5% year-over-year growth. Starbucks’ top line is likely to witness a noticeable boost in the to-be-reported quarter on the back of higher revenues from new store additions, expansion in China, positive global comparable store sales or simply comps growth and higher revenues from business segments.That said, the company is expected to experience softer comps growth in Q2, given multiple challenges. Last quarter, the company’s global comps increased 2% (same as the preceding quarter) as limited-time holiday beverages, holiday gift-cards and holiday merchandise available for purchase in its stores' lobby underperformed in the quarter.Addition of Stores, Innovations & Digital Push: The company opened 700 net new stores globally last quarter, bringing the total store count to 28,039 across 76 markets. Of the total count, 14,999 units are company owned and 13,040 franchised. If we compare with the second quarter of fiscal 2018 figure, the company operated 1,987 more company-owned restaurants at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2018. However, the upside will be partly offset by the company’s lesser number of franchised units.In fiscal 2018, Starbucks expects to expand globally by adding 2,300 net new locations (excluding Teavana closures), marking an increase from roughly 2,250 net new locations in fiscal 2017. Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s total stores of 28,384 (as of Apr 2018) reflects 8.5% year-over-year growth.Again, in order to boost its comps growth, Starbucks is strengthening its product portfolio with significant innovation in beverages, refreshment, health and wellness, tea and core food offerings. The company holds a leading position in digital, card, loyalty and mobile capabilities. Starbucks has secured a leading position to leverage its mobile and digital assets, and loyalty and e-Commerce platforms, to capitalize on these trends and create more revenue streams. Starbucks expects global comps growth at the lower end of the guided range of 3-5% for fiscal 2018.Addition of East China Business: China has been Starbucks' fastest-growing market. To enhance its footprint in the country, Starbucks acquired the remaining 50% of its East China operations last December from long-term joint venture partners, Uni-President Enterprises and President Chain Store Corporation. With the closure of the deal, Starbucks assumed 100% ownership of more than 1,400 restaurants in Shanghai and the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces, bringing the total to more than 3,100 corporate stores in China at the time of closing.The East China business will be fully consolidated and reflected in its financial statements beginning with the fiscal second quarter. The company expects the transaction to be neutral to slightly accretive to earnings in 2018, with a more positive impact in 2019.Other Factors That Might Influence Q2 Earnings:Apart from higher revenues, lower tax rate along with share repurchases will help Starbucks to post higher earnings. Starbucks expects its non-GAAP effective tax rate for 2018 to be approximately 26%. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 was 33.2%.Again, the company has 52 million of shares remaining authorized for repurchase, as of Dec 31, 2017, under its ongoing share repurchase program. Hence, share repurchases will help earnings per share to grow more each quarter. However, these positives are likely to be partly offset by lower margins, owing to the costs associated with restructuring its operation. Overall, for the fiscal second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 53 cents, reflecting a 17.8% year-over-year increase.All these positive factors have aided the company to post higher earnings despite tepid comps and are also reflected in the price movement of the company. Shares of the company have rallied more than 7.4%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 3.5% in the last six months.Quantitative Model PredictionHere is what our quantitative model predicts:Starbucks does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Starbucks has an Earnings ESP of -0.09%.Zacks Rank: Starbucks carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

2886,SBUX,"Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) has announced its plan to close more than 8,000 company-owned U.S. stores for several hours next month, to conduct anti-bias training for nearly 175,000 workers. This move of the coffee-chain giant is mainly aimed to address the recent uproar over the arrest of two black men at one of its stores in Philadelphia.The company’s CEO Kevin Johnson called the incident ""reprehensible"" and apologized to the two men face-to-face. Johnson said, “Closing our stores for racial-bias training is just one step in a journey that requires dedication from every level of our company and partnerships in our local communities.”Starbucks, being one of the most high-profile brands, announced that it will also provide training materials for non-company workers at roughly 6,000 licensed Starbucks cafes that will remain open in locations such as grocery stores and airports.The incident is one of the major trials for Johnson, who has already been struggling to increase the company’s traffic. The coffee-chain giant has been posting weak sales growth amid persistent decline in the country’s restaurant sales. Starbucks reported tepid 2% comps growth in fiscal first quarter in the Americas segment compared with 3% in the year-ago period. Again, competition from other coffee sellers comprising hipster cafes or fast-food chains and convenience stores are added concerns.Now, apart from tepid sales growth, Starbucks will likely miss revenues owing to store closures. Per MarketWatch calculations, the latest store closures will cost the company about $12 million in lost revenues. Starbucks had earlier closed stores for training in 2008 that cost the company about $6 million.Although the company will have to bear the burnt of revenue loss owing to store closures, the company’s move in offering company-wide training is the right thing for Starbucks’ business to sustain its reputation.Share Price PerformanceStarbucks’ shares have gained 8.4% in the last six months compared with the industry’s growth of 2.7%. The company is strengthening its portfolio with major innovations, best-in-class loyalty program and digital offerings to counter tepid sales growth. Meanwhile, earnings estimates for the current quarter have moved down one cent while remaining unchanged for the current fiscal year over the last 30 days. Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderStarbucks carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are Dine Brands Global, Inc.

2888,SBUX,"Shares of Dr Pepper Snapple Group  skyrocketed to a new all-time high on Monday after it was announced that coffee giant Keurig Green Mountain is set to purchase the beverage maker.The deal will see Dr Pepper shareholders receive $103.75 per share in a special cash dividend and retain 13% of the combined company. Dr Pepper Snapple shares closed Friday at $95.65 and surged over 30% on Monday to hit $126.63 following the announcement.The new company, Keurig Dr Pepper, hopes to better compete against the likes of PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Dunkin' Brands (DNKN  -  Free Report), and Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report). This merger also comes at a time when soda companies are trying to diversify their portfolios as consumers shift away from sugary drinks.European investment fund JAB Holding helped take Keurig private for $13.9 billion in 2016. This merger will see JAB become the controlling shareholder of Keurig Dr Pepper, while snack giant Mondelez International (MDLZ) will hold a roughly 13% to 14% stake in the new company.The companies posted $11 billion in combined sales during 2017. Management from both firms hope that Keurig Dr Pepper, with its portfolio of brands including 7UP, A&W root beer, and the widely-popular single-serve coffee systems, will be able to offer “unrivaled distribution capability to reach virtually every point-of-sale in North America.”“Our view of the industry through the lens of consumer needs, versus traditional manufacturer-defined segments, unlocks the opportunity to combine hot and cold beverages and create a platform to increase exposure to high-growth formats,” Keurig CEO Bob Gamgort said in a statement.The companies noted that they expect to create $600 million of annual savings by 2021. This merger comes as soda companies face more pressure to offer healthier options. Before this deal, Dr Pepper had been one of the slowest soda companies to begin to diversify its offerings. Soft drinks still accounted for about 80% of its annual revenue in 2016.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

2891,SBUX,"Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected earnings but failed to meet the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in first-quarter fiscal 2018 results. The company also lifted its full-year profit outlook considering the new U.S. corporate tax cut.However, Starbucks’ shares declined 4.3% in the after-hour trading session following the news release on Jan 25, possibly in response to the weak comparable store sale or comps performance that overshadowed the raised profit guidance expected from a U.S. corporate tax cut. ""Holiday (limited-time offers) and merchandise did not resonate with our customers as planned,"" chief executive Kevin Johnson said on a conference call.Earnings, Sales & Comps DiscussionAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 65 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents by 14.5% and grew 25% year over year.Total sales of $6.07 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.14 billion by a small percentage but increased 6% from the year-ago level. Notably, Q1 revenues mark Starbucks’ first ever $6 billion quarterly revenues. The year-over-year performance was driven by higher revenues from the opening of 2,305 net new stores over the past 12 months and higher comps growth.Global same-store sales increased 2%, same as the preceding quarter. Global traffic increased 2% in the quarter, same as the previous quarter. Transactions were even during the quarter against 1% growth in the preceding quarter. The company opened 700 net new stores globally, bringing the total store count to 28,039 across 76 markets.Margin DownOperating margin decreased 140 basis points (bps) year over year to 18.4% in the quarter due to product mix shift, largely toward food and restructuring cost associated with the company's ongoing efforts of streamlining business operations.On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin declined 80 bps to 19.2%.Starbucks Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Starbucks Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Starbucks Corporation QuoteQuarterly Segment DetailsAmericas: Net revenues in this flagship segment were up 7% year over year to $4.3 billion.Comps rise of 2% in the quarter was softer compared with an increase of 3% in the last quarter. U.S. comps grew 2%, comprising 2% increase in average ticket.Food comps were 2% and the company’s core beverage comp (excluding holiday limited time offerings) was 1%.Membership increased 11% year over year in the My Starbucks Rewards (MSR) program. Customers in the United States are using the chain's mobile app to order and pay for their drinks and are joining the company's rewards program. Mobile payments represented 31% of U.S. transactions, reflecting an increase from 27% a year ago.Operating margin in the segment, however, contracted 100 bps to 23% as strong sales leverage was more than offset by the impact of food-related mix shift.China-Asia-Pacific (CAP): Net revenues increased 9% to $843.7 million on the back of higher revenues from new store opening and comp store sales growth.Comps grew 1%, softer than 2% in the previous quarter. China continued to post stellar comps growth, delivering 6% in the quarter (softer than 8% in the preceding quarter). Japan’s comp growth continues to be negatively impacted by softness in limited time offerings and Frappuccino limited-time offerings, in particular.Operating margin at the CAP segment expanded 210 bps year over year to 23.3% in the quarter, buoyed by strong sales leverage and positive currency effect.Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA): Net revenues were up 8% year over year at $283.9 million in the segment, as higher revenues from addition of new stores and positive currency effect.That said, comps declined 2% (against 1% growth in the preceding quarter).Operating margin declined 300 bps to 13.8% due to softer performance in its company-owned stores.Channel Development (CPG): Channel Development's net revenues improved 1% to $560.3 million. The growth was driven by its foodservice, international and packaged coffee channels.Operating margin contracted 50 bps to 43.4%.All-Other: The segment comprises Seattle's Best Coffee, Starbucks Reserve and Roastery businesses. Revenues at the segment decreased 22% to $120 million.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceStarbucks now expects global comp growth at the lower end of its earlier projected guidance at 3-5%. The company still expects to add approximately 2,300 net new stores globally. Consolidated revenue growth is expected in in the high single digits.The company expects its GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.32-$3.36.Starbucks now expects non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.48-$2.53 compared with $2.30-$2.33 expected earlier. Although the guidance is consistent with the company’s earlier projection, the raised view reflects net impact of the new U.S. tax law's federal statutory tax rate and related reinvestments.Zacks RankStarbucks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2892,SBUX,"Two household-name stocks, Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report), reported Q4 and fiscal Q1 earnings reports, respectively, after the closing bell today. While Intel crushed estimates on both top- and bottom-lines on slightly more modest guidance, Starbucks slightly missed revenue estimates, and its stock is down 3% in late trading.For Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Intel, it posted $1.08 per share — a 25% positive surprise over the Zacks consensus 86 cents. This also accounts for a 15 cent-per-share charge on the new tax laws, and still was a blowout headline. Revenues of $17.05 billion also beat the $16.31 billion we had been expecting, and represent 8% growth year over year.Yet Q1 guidance was modest: 70 cents per share on $15.0 billion in revenues are both below Zacks consensus, as are the fiscal year projections of $3.55 and $65.0 billion.

2895,SBUX,"Starbucks’ (SBUX  -  Free Report) Americas segment revenues, comprising 70% of its total revenues, are expected to witness improvement in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. This could aid the company in reporting higher quarterly revenues when it reports on Thursday, Jan 25.A Look at Starbucks’ Americas Performance in Q4Net revenues in this flagship segment (inclusive of the United States, Canada and Latin America) were down 0.5% year over year to $3.9 billion in the preceding quarter. Comps grew 3% in the quarter, softer than the 5% growth witnessed in Q3. U.S. comps grew 2%, comprising 1% increase in average ticket. In fiscal 2017, Starbucks’ Americas segment posted 3% comps growth, down considerably from 6% in the year-ago period. In fact, transactions remained unchanged year over year and ticket grew 4%. This compares unfavorably with 5% growth in transaction and an increase of 1% in ticket in fiscal 2016.In Q4, membership increased 11% year over year in the My Starbucks Rewards (MSR) program. Customers in the United States are using the chain's mobile app to order and pay for their drinks and are joining the company's rewards program. Mobile payments represented 30% of U.S. transactions, reflecting an increase from 25% a year ago.Operating margin in the segment, however, contracted 390 basis points to 24%, as strong sales leverage was more than offset by hurricanes, higher investments in store partners and the impact of product sales mix.Q1 ExpectationThe company’s segment is likely to experience higher revenues with comps growth in the mid-single digits or more. The improvement is expected to be driven by additional store openings, Starbucks’ mobile order/pay along with significant innovation around beverages, refreshment, health and wellness, tea and core food offerings. Starbucks has secured a leading position in leveraging its mobile and digital assets and loyalty, and e-Commerce platforms to capitalize on these trends and create more revenue streams to boost its top line.Overall, Starbucks’ Americas segment revenues are expected to witness 8.3% growth year over year and 9.4% sequentially, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Again, operating margin will be driven by strong sales leverage that will be partly offset by higher investments in store partners and the impact of product sales mix.Apart from the Americas segment, Starbucks’ Channel Development business needs special mention. Although the business is small (in terms of its revenue contribution), it generates impressive operating margins, owing to its cost structure. Hence, the Channel Development segment represents a significant profitable growth opportunity.Overall Earnings & Revenues ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 57 cents reflects a 9.6% growth from the prior-year quarter profit of 52 cents. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $6.15 billion indicates a 7.2% increase on a year-over-year basis.Starbucks’s operating fundamentals such as solid global retail footprint, successful innovations, best-in-class loyalty program and digital offerings remain strong. Again, digital initiatives like mobile order/pay, delivery services and third-party loyalty partnerships can stimulate stronger sales trends in the Americas. Internationally, the company’s focus on China/Asia expansion is another positive.Meanwhile, change in the product mix (as food, tea and cold beverages will become an increasing part of the product mix), focus on the use of loyalty cards and mobile order and pay technology to boost sales and profits are added tailwinds. Finally, Starbucks’ endeavor to boost its presence in premium coffee consumed at home through K-cups and with ready-to-drink beverages needs special attention.Overall, apart from higher revenues, lower tax rate along with share repurchases will help Starbucks to post higher earnings. That said, headwinds, especially in the labor front is a cause for concern for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

2897,SBUX,"Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 25, after the closing bell.In the preceding quarter, the company’s earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In fact, the coffee chain giant reported in-line results on earnings in the trailing four quarters. However, the company failed to meet the consensus estimate for revenues in each of the trailing four quarters.Nonetheless, we expect Starbucks’ earnings to increase in the to-be-reported quarter banking on higher revenues, lower tax rate and share repurchases. Starbucks Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Starbucks Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Starbucks Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayThe company’s top line is likely to experience a noticeable boost in the to-be-reported quarter on the back of higher revenues from new store additions, expansion in China, positive global comparable store sales or simply comps growth and higher revenues from its business segments.In fiscal 2018, Starbucks expects to expand globally by adding 2,300 net new locations (excluding Teavana closures), marking an increase from roughly 2,250 net new locations in fiscal 2017. Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s total stores of 27,821 (as of Dec 2017) reflects 8.1% year-over-year growth.Again, in order to boost its comps growth, Starbucks is strengthening its product portfolio with significant innovation around beverages, refreshment, health and wellness, tea and core food offerings. The company holds a leading position in digital, card, loyalty and mobile capabilities. Starbucks has secured a leading position in leveraging its mobile and digital assets and loyalty and e-Commerce platforms to capitalize on these trends and create more revenue streams. Starbucks projected global comp growth at 3-5% for fiscal 2018.The company has also been streamlining its business and directing investments toward operations where growth prospects and returns are the greatest. For this, Starbucks will acquire the remaining 50% of its East China operations, refranchise 700 company-owned restaurants in Singapore, Germany, and Taiwan, and close Teavana stores and its e-commerce platform. Although these efforts will benefit the company in the long run, it will likely impact Starbucks’ revenues in fiscal first quarter.Overall, for the fiscal first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $6.15 billion, implying 7.2% year-over-year growth.Segment Wise: Starbucks’ Americas segment revenues (inclusive of the United States, Canada and Latin America; comprising 70% of its total revenues) is expected to witness 8.3% growth year over year and 9.4% sequentially, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues in the China-Asia-Pacific segment are likely to witness 12.8% year over year and 1.2% growth sequentially. Channel Development is projected to report revenues of $588 million, higher than $554 million in the year-ago quarter and $515 million in the preceding one. Additionally, the consensus estimate for Europe, Middle East and Africa or EMEA segment revenues of $283 million indicates an increase from $262 million in the year-ago quarter and $270 million in the prior quarter.Meanwhile, apart from higher revenues, lower tax rate along with share repurchases will help Starbucks to post higher earnings. Starbucks expects effective tax rate for 2018 to be approximately 27%, including approximately 6 points of favorable impact from the planned acquisition of East China. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 33.2%.Again, the company has 80.3 million of shares remaining authorized for repurchase, as of Oct 1, 2017, under its ongoing share repurchase program. Hence, share repurchases will help earnings per share to grow more each quarter. However, these positives are likely to be partly offset by lower margins owing to the costs associated with restructuring its operation. Overall, for the fiscal first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 57 cents, reflecting a 9.6% year-over-year increase.All these positive factors have aided the company to post higher earnings despite the tepid comps and are also reflected in the price movement of the company. Shares of the company have rallied almost 13%, outperforming the broader industry’s growth of 9.2% in the last three months.Quantitative Model PredictionHere is what our quantitative model predicts:Starbucks does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Starbucks has an Earnings ESP of -0.24%.Zacks Rank: Starbucks carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

2898,SBUX,"Fourth-quarter earnings season is finally underway, and investors are already getting excited about the upcoming reports from market-moving tech companies like Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report). Nevertheless, we will see many major reports from noteworthy consumer-facing brands in other industries, so investors will want to be paying attention to all the news.In the coming weeks, we will see reports from the world’s biggest and most relevant companies, meaning that investors need to be prepared for the ensuing movement that is likely to occur throughout the market.According to the latest report from Sheraz Mian, the head of the Zacks Equity Research department and an acknowledged earnings expert, earnings growth is expected to be positive for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors—and growth rates are projected to hit the double digits for our Energy, Technology, Construction, Industrial Products, Basic Materials, and Automotive groups.Investors should remember that they can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.Today, we’ve made that task even easier for you. Using the Earnings Calendar, we looked ahead to next week and selected some of the biggest reports to watch. Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of January 22.Johnson & Johnson, Inc. (JNJ  -  Free Report)Personal healthcare and pharmaceuticals behemoth Johnson & Johnson is scheduled to release its latest quarterly results before the market opens on January 23. The company basically never missed earnings estimates, and shares have gained a respectable 29% over the past year. JNJ is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) as it approaches its report date.Based on our latest consensus estimates, we expect to see Johnson & Johnson report earnings of $1.72 per share and revenues of $20.22 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth of 9% and 12%, respectively. We believe that new products in all segments, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex, and contributions from recent acquisitions should support the company's top line. Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report)Automotive manufacturing giant Ford is slated to announce its latest quarterly earnings results after the market closes on January 24. The company has met or surpassed estimates in three consecutive quarters, but the stock has dropped in the wake of management's warning that 2018 profits will be softer than expected. Still, Ford is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), primarily because of favorable near-term outlook.Based on our current consensus estimates, Ford is expected to post earnings of $0.44 per share and revenues of $37.15 billion, which would mark growth of 47% and 3%, respectively, from the year-ago period. Nevertheless, an update on the company's forward-looking guidance will likely be what drives the stock in the wake of the report. Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report)Coffee king Starbucks is scheduled to release its latest quarterly earnings report after the closing bell on January 25. Starbucks is a pretty consistent earnings performer, but year-over-year comparisons have tightened and the stock has gained just 6% over the past 52 weeks. SBUX is sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) as we approach the release of its report.According to our latest consensus estimates, Starbucks is projected to post earnings of $0.57 per share and revenues of $6.15 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth of 10% and 7%, respectively. Digital initiatives like mobile pay, delivery services, and third-party loyalty partnerships can stimulate stronger sales trends in the Americas, while China will remain a key growth market for the company. Want more stock market analysis from this author?

2900,SBUX,"Retail REIT Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) and Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) have reached a settlement over a lawsuit to refrain the latter from proceeding with its plan to close Teavana stores in Simon’s malls, per a report from American City Business Journals.An email from Starbucks, that was cited in the report, read, “We are thankful to our customers who have enjoyed Teavana tea at these specialty retail locations and will continue to emphasize Teavana tea in new and different ways at Starbucks.” The terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but the move removes the litigation overhang issue from Simon.In July 2017, Starbucks had made an announcement of store closures involving a shutter down of all 379 of its Teavana stores in 2018, with majority expected to close by this spring. While some of the stores in Simon malls have leases slated for expiry before this spring, majority of the leases run through January 2027. Starbucks cited lackluster traffic in malls for the decision to close these stores.However, Simon fought back and alleged that Starbucks’ Teavana store closures in its malls would result in a breach of lease obligations. Further, it claimed that this is just a lame excuse by Starbucks to refract the blame from itself.  The mall landlord pointed out that while the decision of store closures from several retailers like Sports Authority, Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report), Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report) among others was an outcome of either bankruptcy or financial ruin that was not the case with Starbucks. Rather, going by Simon’s allegations, the Teavana store-closure move came as the business failed to expand at Starbucks’ anticipated pace.Later in 2017, according to the New York Post, Starbucks was temporarily restrained by an Indiana judge from shutting down its 77 Teavana stores in Simon’s malls. Per the order, Starbucks can better absorb the financial loss by keeping its stores open than Simon bearing the brunt of withering vacancies. Although Starbucks planned to make an appeal, this week the company announced reaching a settlement. Notably, retail REITs have continued to bear the brunt as mall traffic continues to suffer amid a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preference through the online channel, resulting in an increasing number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent years, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.Such an environment has led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions but mall landlords are finding these unjustified. In addition, when there are substantial store closures in the middle of the lease term, not only are mall landlords hurt, but tenants occupying space in that mall are equally affected because their shop visits depend on the mix of specific types of retailers.Shares of Simon Property have underperformed the industry it belongs to, over the past year. This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s shares have dropped 11.6%, while the industry has recorded growth of 5.1% during the same time frame.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2901,SBUX,"Dunkin’ Donuts, which is part of Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN  -  Free Report), opened its first next generation concept store in Quincy, MA. The company plans on opening 30 or more new and remodeled Dunkin' Donuts restaurants that will test variations of this new concept in 2018.The latest store is modeled in a modern way, equipped with innovative technologies and designs. To make the ambience more approachable and energetic, the interiors flaunt light-color materials, natural lighting and an open layout.Re-imaging stores has been a key strategy for the company to attract customers. This helps create an appealing and differentiated concept that boost the brand value and enhance client experience.Focus on Digital OrderingTechnological innovation at restaurants has become imperative to counter the troubles plaguing this space over the past few quarters. In fact, the company has been increasing its usage of digital technology through DD card, DD mobile app, DD Perks rewards program, On-the-Go ordering and delivery.The company has deployed an exclusive On-the-Go drive-through facility in the concept store. This allows Dunkin' Donuts’ DD Perks Rewards Program members, who order in advance using Dunkin's Mobile App, to skip queues and head straight to the pickup lane.On-the-Go, which is available nationwide, allows the company to drive customer loyalty, efficiency as well as speed of service at its restaurants. The company believes that getting customers to use the DD Card, then enrolling them as Perks members will make customers accustomed to the convenience, thereby making it easier to retain customers.Moreover, to enhance the digital experience, the company will be offering fully-integrated digital kiosks, wherein customers will be able to order with or without the assistance of a restaurant member. Also, the company has kept aside an area for mobile pickups, a facility to allow members of the DD Perks Rewards program placing advance orders through Dunkin's Mobile App, to get in and out of the restaurant faster than before. Customers will also be able to track their order status through a new digital order status board.Innovation to Tackle Challenging SalesIn order to navigate a challenging sales environment, Dunkin is continually striving to innovate on the menu front to cater to the ever-changing palates of customers.The new store will serve the company’s signature cold beverage through an innovative tap system, serving eight consistently cold beverages such as coffees, iced teas, cold brew coffee and nitro infused cold brew coffee. There will also be a single-cup machine to provide the option of grinding and brewing select coffee varieties, one cup at a time.Also, as consumers are increasingly showing their preference for fresh, organic and nutritious, the store will have a “Grab & Go unit,” which will consist of healthy food items that complement the new store’s menu.Bottom LineDunkin' Brands is one of the well-established global quick service restaurant brands. Notably, its shares have outperformed its industry over the past year. While the stock has returned 25.3%, the industry gained 19.9%.Dunkin' Brands’ focus on re-imaging stores, strong digital initiatives and aggressive expansion strategies are expected to drive the company’s performance.However, the company faces tough competition from food & beverages giants like McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report), Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) and YUM!

2902,SBUX,"In a bid to capitalize on the growing demand for espresso beverages, Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) has launched a mild version of espresso — Starbucks Blonde Espresso. This is the first core espresso alternative to be launched by the company in the United States in more than 40 years.Coffee lovers can now choose from two espresso varieties — Signature or Blonde. The Signature espresso is essentially dark and rich while the latest Blonde espresso is citrusy and mild. The coffee beans for Blonde Espresso are sourced from Latin America and East Africa.The company has already been offering a second espresso option in few international markets since 2013 and has also introduced it in Canada last year. Owing to the success of this method of offering an alternative option, this Seattle-based coffee chain giant has decided to add this to its core espresso menu in the United States. The item will be a permanent one on the menu.Blonde Espresso is also available in pods for the Verismo System of Starbucks and joins its portfolio of lighter roast offerings, which were introduced as whole bean packaged coffee and brewed options in 2012.Starbucks has been strengthening its portfolio with innovation in beverages and core food offerings. Beverage innovation has been a significant contributor to comps for Starbucks over the years. According to National Coffee Association, demand for espresso beverages is on the rise with nearly 25% of past-day daily coffee drinkers choosing espresso in 2017. With this new espresso alternative, Starbucks is expected to cash in on this growing demand and entice coffee drinkers who are not familiar to strong and bold coffee flavors.Also, given the decelerating performance in the United States, menu innovation becomes pertinent for driving comps. The company’s Americas segment (accounting for 70% of total revenues) posted 3% comps growth in fiscal 2017, considerably down from 6% growth in fiscal 2016. In fact, transactions remained unchanged year over year and ticket grew 4%. This compares unfavorably with 5% growth in transaction and 1% increase in ticket in fiscal 2016.Meanwhile, Starbucks’ shares have gained only 1.9% in the last year, comparing unfavorably with 19.7% growth of its industry. However, the trend in fiscal 2018 earnings estimate revisions is encouraging, as it moved 2.2% north over the past 60 days. This signals at analyst optimism surrounding this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s performance in the near term.  Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Famous Dave's of America, Inc. , McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Good Times Restaurants Inc.

2904,SBUX,"Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) reported in-line earnings but failed to meet the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results.Apart from the earnings release, Starbucks made other major announcements. First, Starbucks lowered long-term financial targets, cutting the annual earnings growth forecast to 12% versus the prior guidance for 15%-20%. The company expects global same-store sales or comps of 3-5% and high single-digit net revenue growth (versus prior expectation of 10% or greater).Second, the premium coffee giant has entered into an agreement to sell Tazo tea to Unilever for $384 million. The deal includes the Tazo brand, signature recipes, intellectual property and inventory and allows Starbucks to focus its tea strategy on Teavana.Starbucks shares dipped more than 3% following the news release on Nov 2, possibly in response to the lowered long-term targets and weak fourth-quarter results.Earnings, Sales & Comps DiscussionAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 55 cents came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but grew 10% year over year.Total fourth-quarter sales of $5.7 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.73 billion by 0.6% and remained unchanged from the year-ago level. The underperformance was due to the impact of hurricanes Irma and Harvey, which affected the company’s overall top line as well as U.S. comp growth by 1%. This was because more than 1,000 stores had to be temporarily closed due to storm-related reasons.Global same-store sales increased 2%, lower than 4% growth in the preceding quarter. Global traffic increased 2% in the quarter compared with 4% in the previous quarter. Transactions increased 1%.Margin DownOperating margin decreased 360 basis points (bps) year over year to 17.9% in the quarter due to higher partner investments, primarily in the Americas segment, and the lapping of the 53rd week in the year ago quarter. Again, product mix shift, largely towards food, a higher donation to The Starbucks Foundation, and restructuring and impairments cost added to the woes.On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin declined 90 bps to 20%.Quarterly Segment DetailsAmericas: Net revenues in this flagship segment were down 0.5% year over year to $3.9 billion.Comps rise of 3% in the quarter was softer compared with an increase of 5% in the last quarter. U.S. comps grew 2%, comprising 1% increase in average ticket.The company's core espresso, tea and refreshment beverages contributed 2% to comps growth in the U.S. Food sales contributed 2%.Membership increased 11% year over year in the My Starbucks Rewards (MSR) program. Customers in the U.S. are using the chain's mobile app to order and pay for their drinks and are joining the company's rewards program. Mobile payments represented 30% of U.S. transactions, reflecting an increase of from 25% a year ago.Operating margin in the segment, however, contracted 390 bps to 24% as strong sales leverage was more than offset by hurricanes, higher investments in store partners and the impact of product sales mix.China-Asia-Pacific (CAP): Net revenues increased 2.5% to $859.9 million on the back of higher revenues from new store opening and comp store sales growth.Comps grew 2%, higher than 1% in the previous quarter. China continued to post stellar comps growth delivering 8% in the quarter, its strongest in nine quarters. Japan’s comp growth improved sequentially. Store and market profitability in Japan were robust, with comp growth in core food, tea, and espresso categories.Starbucks' licensed joint venture markets, including East China and South Korea, continue to contribute to CAP's performance in the quarter. Again, South Korea marks its fifth-largest global market, with system sales exceeding $1 billion in fiscal 2017, with double-digit comp growth in the year, underscoring the broad success Starbucks is having across the region.Operating margin at the CAP segment expanded 60 bps year over year to 23.5% in the quarter buoyed by strong sales leverage and higher JV income. These are partly offset by an extra week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA): Net revenues were down 0.1% year over year at $269.9 million in the segment as higher revenues from addition of new stores were offset by an extra week in the year-ago period.That said, comps grew 1% (against 2% growth in the preceding quarter).Operating margin declined 330 bps to 12.9% due to softer performance in its company-owned markets and a 210-basis-point impact from a tax settlement in the quarter.Channel Development (CPG): This segment includes roasted whole bean and ground coffees, premium Tazo teas, a variety of ready-to-drink beverages (like Frappuccino and Starbucks Refreshers) and Starbucks and Tazo-branded K-Cup packs sold through channels such as grocery, specialty retailers, and foodservice, to name a few.Channel Development's net revenues declined 0.7% to $514.9 million.Operating margin expanded 80 bps to 47.9%.All-Other: The segment comprises emerging brands like Teavana (acquired in Dec 2012), Seattle's Best Coffee, Starbucks Reserve and Roastery businesses. Revenues at the segment decreased 9.2% to $104.6 million.Fiscal 2017 HighlightsThe company’s non-GAAP earnings came in at $2.06 per share, increasing 11.4% year over year. Net revenues were $22.4 billion, up 5% on 3% global comps growth.The company’s non-GAAP operating income increased 7.8% to $4.4 billion in the year and corresponding margin expanded 10 bps.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceStarbucks projected global comp growth at 3-5% based on the addition of approximately 2,300 net new stores globally.Consolidated operating margin is likely to be slightly up, excluding the impact of the change in ownership structure in East China on operating margin.The company expects its GAAP EPS to grow more than 40%.Starbucks expects non-GAAP EPS growth of 12-13%, or $2.30-$2.33 per share in fiscal 2018 with growth in the second half to be a shade higher than the first half.Zacks RankStarbucks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2905,SBUX,"The restaurant industry exhibited a moderate growth rate in 2017. Per the National Restaurant Association (NRA), the industry is expected to have generated $799 billion in revenues in the year, up 4.3% from 2016. However, this translates into a growth rate of just 1.7% when accounted for inflation.The year saw the space grappling with rising costs, weak comps, higher restaurant prices, consumer spending uncertainty on dining out, decline in at-home food costs, market saturation and shifting preference of consumers.However, the industry remains steady, thanks to strategies in order to counter the abovementioned headwinds. These include various sales building and cost cutting efforts, franchisee-based business models, loyalty programs and the most important increased usage of technology.Digital Enhancement: Key Ingredient in the Recipe for SuccessTechnology plays a pivotal role in determining customer experience as they increasingly look for convenience. And restaurant industry is no exception in this regard.Major restaurant operators are all guns blazing, with their online and digital marketing activities, to meet consumers’ increasing dependence on and penchant for online and mobile web technology and consequently attract them.While smartphone apps attract consumers, video menu boards in quick-service restaurants and tabletop devices speed up sales and ensure convenience. Further, restaurant operators rely on social media for promotions and incorporate Facebook, online review sites, Twitter and blogs aggressively into their marketing mix. In fact, mobile ordering is fast becoming a crucial part of many restaurants' plans, as it can bring enhanced sales to the table.Pizza giants Domino's (DPZ  -  Free Report) and Papa John's International Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) have been the industry bellwethers in the digital ordering space. The world’s largest coffee shop operator, Starbucks Corp. (SBUX  -  Free Report) has secured a leading position in leveraging its mobile and digital assets and loyalty and e-commerce platforms to create more revenue streams. In fact, Starbucks’ mobile app is undoubtedly one of the most widely used mobile payment app in the United States. Apart from Starbucks, Buffalo Wild Wings , Brinker International (EAT  -  Free Report) and Red Robin also offer loyalty programs at their outlets to enhance value dining.The list of restaurants making investments and enhancements in digital and mobile offerings is growing and will surely continue to grow.Our PicksWe believe Domino's, Darden (DRI  -  Free Report) and McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) are well poised to grow on this evolving digital trend. Further, they are innovative operators with strong fundamentals that make them suitable for investments.  Let's delve deeper into how they're leading the restaurant industry's digital and mobile revolution.Domino's Pizza is investing heavily in technology-driven initiatives like digital ordering to boost sales. The company’s digital loyalty program -- Piece of the Pie Rewards -- continues to contribute significantly to traffic.Moreover, the company is adding to its digital capabilities with the launch of various ordering apps and platforms. Particularly, Domino's world-class digital ordering platforms like Google Home, Facebook Messenger, Apple Watch, Amazon Echo, Twitter and ordering via a Pizza emoji on text are expected to further boost digital orders. The extended ways to order a pizza has thus kept the company at the forefront of digital ordering and customer convenience.Meanwhile, the company continues to ramp up its worldwide digital participation with 25 markets now utilizing its global online ordering platform and more than 70% of stores outside the United States using its proprietary point-of-sale system – Domino's PULSE.Notably, digital leadership is helping the company expand its brand in the domestic market as well as overseas. In fact, emphasis on technology innovation helped Domino's reach an estimated $5.6 billion in global digital sales in 2016. At the end of 2016, the company generated over 60% digital sales in the United States. More than half of the national television campaign topics were directly related to digital initiatives. Further, nearly 50% of its international sales come from digital channels.Domino'scurrently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Price Domino's Pizza Inc Price | Domino's Pizza Inc QuoteMeanwhile, Darden Restaurants is also focusing on technology-driven initiatives like the system wide rollout of tablets in order to capitalize on the digital wave that has hit the U.S. fast casual restaurant sector. This initiative has boosted sales for the past few quarters. Sales of the company have also picked up since the launch of mobile ordering in 2014.Meanwhile, Olive Garden’s To Go business, which offers online ordering at selected locations, is also growing rapidly (increasing 12% year over year in the fiscal second quarter). The company has also launched catering in the United States, which is expected to add to its top line.Further, the company’s digital advertising efforts at LongHorn are contributing significantly in attracting guests. Owing to these efforts, segment comps have grown for the past 19 consecutive quarters.Darden carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Its earnings in fiscal 2018 are expected to improve 13.2%.Darden Restaurants, Inc. Price Darden Restaurants, Inc. Price | Darden Restaurants, Inc. QuoteMcDonald's is undertaking several digital initiatives to better serve customers, with nearly all of its U.S. restaurants now using digital menu boards. Also, McDonald’s is set to launch mobile order-and-pay capabilities at nearly all its 14,000 U.S. restaurants and 6,000 of its restaurants outside the United States. Having witnessed continual traffic declines, the company considers mobile ordering a way to win back customers.At the same time, the company is accelerating Experience of the Future (EOTF) deployment in the United States, building on its success in markets around the world. The rollout of self-order kiosks, digital menu boards, table service, and the mobile app offer customers more choices and flexibility.By enhancing customer experience at McDonald's, this initiative represents one of the greatest opportunities to build on business momentum and increase guest count. Currently, the company has Experience of the Future deployed at 13% of its restaurants and that number is expected to increase significantly in the next couple of years.  The company targets to convert most of the traditional restaurants in the U.S. system by 2020.McDonald's carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2906,SBUX,"Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) has been struggling with tepid comparable-store sales or comps growth in the United States for quite some time now. This is primarily due to persistent decline in the country’s restaurant sales. Soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space along with rising costs continue to haunt restaurant chains.This is evident from the company’s 2.9% increase in share price in the last year compared with 19.9% growth of the industry. Also, the trend in fiscal 2018 earnings estimate revisions is not satisfactory as it has moved down 0.4% in the last 60 days.Nonetheless, innovative operators like Starbucks with strong fundamentals are continuing to exhibit strength even in a not-so-favorable environment. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s strong operating fundamentals that includes successful innovations, best-in-class loyalty program and digital offerings are somewhat helping the company to offset the headwinds. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Driving FactorsIn order to counter the soft consumption trend in the United States, management has successfully focused on expansion with plans of adding 900 net new stores in its Americas segment in fiscal 2018, split evenly between company owned and licensed.Apart from multiplying store count, the company is improving customer experience through innovative store designs, up-leveling product offerings and growing margins through process and supply chain efficiencies.Starbucks’ operating fundamentals such as solid global retail footprint, successful innovations, best-in-class loyalty program and digital offerings remain strong. The company’s digital initiatives like mobile order/pay, delivery services and third-party loyalty partnerships can stimulate stronger sales trends in the Americas. These initiatives should further drive profit in the long run.The company is also deploying money in the fastest growing market, China. Starbucks is testing its upscale and super-sized cafe concept in its fastest-growing market of China. Recently, it opened its largest shop ever with the new Reserve Roastery in Shanghai, in a bid to counter sluggish U.S. sales.Management believes that China and the Asia-Pacific region will drive more meaningful business growth over the next five years. supported by rapid unit growth, growing brand awareness, and increased usage of the digital/mobile/loyalty platforms. Starbucks currently (as of Oct 1, 2017) operates 7,479 stores across China-Asia-Pacific or CAP. The company remains on track to have roughly 11,000 locations in CAP (600 in China alone) in fiscal 2018.The company also practices investor-friendly moves. In its recently released earnings call, the company highlighted that dividends over the last six-year period increased an average 24% annually and earnings payout ratio was nearly 50%. They also promised to return $15 billion to shareholders over the next three years.Indeed, weak comps growth is a cause for concern for the coffee chain giant. In the wake of soft global comps growth, Starbucks lowered long-term financial targets during the fiscal fourth quarter conference call, cutting the annual earnings growth forecast to 12% versus the prior guidance for 15-20%. The company expects global comps of 3-5% and high single-digit net revenue growth (versus prior expectation of 10% or greater).That said, the company’s strong operating fundamental, successful innovations along with focus on the fastest growing market will help it in maintaining its stature in the coffee world.Other Key PicksInvestors can also consider stocks like Famous Dave's of America, Inc. , Good Times Restaurants Inc.

2908,SBUX,"In line with its strategy to bolster global presence, Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) opened its 25th store in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The cafe is located in the Metropolitan University campus in Cupey, which is part of the Ana G. Méndez University System. This marks the first Starbucks cafe in a higher education institution in Puerto Rico.Starbucks expects this new location at the Metropolitan University to be a busy place on the campus, while providing job opportunities to local students and contributing to the economy.This is also the first Starbucks store opening in the island since Hurricane Maria struck in September, causing damage to live and property. The hurricane had compelled Starbucks to shut down its stores in Puerto Rico. Along with the launch of the cafe, the company is slowly reopening the other stores in Puerto Rico.Starbucks and the company’s local business partner Baristas del Caribe have contributed significantly to the island’s rebuilding efforts. The company is constantly working toward creating local jobs, serving customers and supporting the region’s coffee producers. Also, another Starbucks store is likely to open in Santa Isabel in early 2018.Global Expansion Plan on TrackIn fiscal 2018, Starbucks expects to add 2,300 new locations globally (excluding Teavana closures), reflecting an increase from roughly 2,250 new locations in fiscal 2017.Expanding beyond the United States has been one of Starbucks’ key growth strategies. Earlier this month, the coffee giant opened its largest Reserve Roastery in Shanghai. The 30,000-square-feet store has more than 100 beverages on the menu and provides an AR (augmented reality) experience for customers. This is the second Starbucks Roastery after the launch of the first one in Seattle in 2014. The company plans to bring the Roastery concept to New York in 2018 and Chicago in 2019.In November, the company opened its first store in Jamaica, which marked the 76th market for the company. The company plans to launch 14 more stores over a period of five years. These stores will offer a range of Starbucks beverages and food, including its signature handcrafted hot and cold espresso beverages made with 100% arabica coffee.Meanwhile, Starbucks’ shares have gained 4.5% so far this year compared with 14.6% growth of the industry. Also, the trend in earnings estimate revisions is not satisfactory as it moved 3.4% down for the current quarter and 1.3% for fiscal 2018 over the past 60 days. The company's tepid comps growth in the United States, owing to soft retail and consumer spending environment, weighs on the company’s performance.  Nevertheless, Starbucks’ focus on increasing its global market share by opening stores in new and existing markets along with remodeling existing stores, deploying technology, controlling costs, aggressive product innovation and brand building can boost its top line.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderStarbucks carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Famous Dave's of America, Inc. , Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc.

2909,SBUX,"Shareholders of Simon Property Group (SPG  -  Free Report) have reasons to cheer. The company recently clinched a victory over Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) in a lawsuit to refrain the latter from proceeding with its plan to close Teavana stores in Simon’s malls.Specifically, according to the New York Post, Starbucks has been temporarily barred by an Indiana judge from shutting down its 77 Teavana stores in Simon’s malls. Per the order, the company can better absorb the financial loss by keeping the stores open than Simon bearing the brunt of withering vacancies.Notably, in July, Starbucks had made an announcement of store closures involving a shutter down of all 379 of its Teavana stores in the next year, with majority expected to close by spring. Though some of the Teavana stores in Simon malls have leases slated for expiry before the spring of 2018, majority of the leases run through January 2027. Starbucks cited disappointing traffic in malls for its decision to close the stores.Simon fought back and alleged that Starbucks’ Teavana store closures in its malls would result in a breach of lease obligations. However, there were no specifications in the lawsuit about the amount of financial relief or damage sought by Simon, per the Indianapolis Business Journal news.Simon further alleged that this was just a lame excuse by Starbucks to refract the blame from itself. In fact, the mall landlord pointed out that the decision of store closures from several retailers like Sports Authority, Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) and Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report), among others, was an outcome of either bankruptcy or financial ruin.However, this is not the case with Starbucks, which has earned reputation for being “one of the largest and most recognized companies in the world.” Rather, the Teavana store-closure move came as the business failed to expand at Starbucks’ anticipated pace, going by Simon’s allegations.As a matter of fact, mall traffic continues to suffer amid rapid shift in consumers’ shopping preferences shifting to online retail. This has made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures over the last several quarters.Further, retailers unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies. This comes as a pressing concern for retail REITs, as this trend has been considerably curtailing demand for the retail real estate space.Moreover, the choppy retail real estate market situation is said to have led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which is considered unjustified by landlords. Also, significant store closures in the middle of the lease term not only harm mall landlords, but also the tenants occupying space in the mall because their shop visits also depend on the mix of specific type of retailers.Shares of Simon Property have underperformed the industry it belongs to, in the year so far.

The cold-pressed espresso menu at the Seattle Roastery will include a Sparkling Cold-Pressed Americano, Cold-Pressed Americano Exploration Flight as well as Cold-Pressed Ginger Fizz.Starbucks has been strengthening its portfolio with innovation in beverages and core food offerings.

Specifically, Starbucks has been focused on iced beverages in recent times to cash in on the growing iced coffee consumption. According to Starbucks and the market intelligence firm Mintel, iced coffee consumption has grown 75% over the past decade.Earlier this year, Starbucks launched Teavana Shaken Iced Tea Infusions apart from adding the Nitro brew last year.As revealed earlier, the company expects to quadruple its Cold Brew business by 2021.

2912,SBUX,"Dunkin’ Donuts, which is part of Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN  -  Free Report), is geared up to expand further in Sacramento, CA. To this end, the company has inked multi-unit store development agreements with two franchisees to build nine restaurants in the region over the next several years.The first agreement is with existing franchisee, Shiva Developments, which is expected to develop four new Dunkin' Donuts restaurants. The second agreement is with a new franchisee group, NorCal Grub, which plans to develop five new outlets. Notably, the first restaurant under each of these agreements is slated to open in 2019.Currently, Dunkin’ Donuts possesses more than 50 locations in California and is continuing to recruit franchisees in the Sacramento area. These agreements are thus in sync with the company’s plan to drive growth in the region.Apart from foraying into domestic markets, the company is also looking to expand its footprint internationally, especially in the emerging markets of Asia and the Middle East. Globally, the company has more than 12,400 Dunkin’ Donuts restaurants in 46 countries and is on track to achieve its long-term goal of opening 17,000 restaurants in the United States.In the last three months, Dunkin’ Brands’ shares have outperformed its industry. While the stock rallied 16.7%, the industry gained 8.1% in the same period.However, Dunkin' Brands’ international comps growth has been weak over the last few years at both its Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin Robbins divisions. Furthermore, a soft consumer spending environment in the domestic restaurants space along with intense competition from food & beverages companies like Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report), McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Jack in the Box Inc. (JACK  -  Free Report) might continue to exert pressure on revenues.Nevertheless, we are positive on the company’s continued expansion strategies along with various sales and digital initiatives. These initiatives include product launches, increased focus on its beverage portfolio, the ongoing loyalty program and mobile ordering service that are expected to draw customers and drive earnings as well as revenue growth.Dunkin' Brands carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2913,SBUX,"Following the heaviest inflow of Q3 earnings reports of the entire quarter yesterday after the closing bell, we see new economic data reads and news from across the pond. There will also be a long-awaited unveiling of the GOP tax reform plan today. And this is all aside from a new group of Q3 earnings reports coming out before the opening bell this morning.Initial Jobless Claims fell again, to 229K last week from a slightly upwardly revised 234K the previous week. Continuing claims have sunk to multi-quarter lows beneath 1.9 million to 1.884 million specifically. This is more positive news, following yesterday’s ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) strong 235K new private-sector jobs results for October. Tomorrow’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) non-farm payroll report is expected to bring in north of 300K new jobs last month. All of these numbers speak to an unwaveringly strong U.S. labor market.Productivity and Labor Costs reads were also released early today. Preliminary productivity hit 3.0%, a bit higher than the 2.8% analysts had been expecting. The last time this metric registered this high was back in 2014. Labor costs were close to in-line with expectations at 0.5%, following a 0.3% read last time around. A surge in productivity with slight wage increases would seem to be music to the ears of economists and market participants alike; solid growth without unruly inflation creating headwinds is likely as Goldilocks as it gets.Which brings us to the tax reform proposal key to the Republican-run Congress today and its success in next year’s mid-term elections, and my question is one that is almost never asked by market analysts these days: with 3% growth, still-cheap borrowing costs and solid employment numbers, what do we need a tax cut for?These types of measures are typically used to pry an economy out of being stuck in the mud; if we’re already at or near our goals currently, wouldn’t a tax cut at this stage be simply borrowing against future gains, with the possible additional problems of blowing a hole the the national deficit, which would create longer-term economic issues?This aside for now, the Bank of England today has decided to ratchet up its interest rates 0.5%, amounting to its first rate hike in 10 years. This announcement comes as inflation in the U.K. remains at 3% while economic growth is slowing, not speeding up.The Bank also stayed pat with an asset buyback program worth U.S. $574 million. It’s far from a typical move for a central bank to raise rates while the country’s economy slows; starting new businesses, obtaining mortgages, etc. will now be more difficult. Perhaps the logic is that giving commercial and investment bank in England a leg up will spur the economy indirectly in the months ahead.Q3 Earnings RoundupWe will hear from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) after the closing bell. Yesterday afternoon we saw a big beat from Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) augmented by remarks from CEO Mark Zuckerberg that security measures will add to costs at the social media leader at the expense of future profits. Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report), on the other hand, missed expectations on a Model 3 “bottleneck,” but future projections for auto deliveries in 2018 remained hopefully robust.Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) shares have tumbled more than 20% this morning following its disappointing Q3 earnings results, where by the consumer plastics maker missed the 92 cent Zacks consensus and posted just 86 cents per share. This was still 10% growth year over year. Revenues in the quarter narrowly missed the 3.7 billion expected, and the company lowered earnings estimates for full-year 2017.Global quick-service restaurant major Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) beat estimates by 2 cents per share to 68 cents in its most recent quarter, with $1.44 billion in revenues topping the $1.40 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. Comps at KFC of +4% assisted the positive results in the quarter. Shares are trading up 2% in today’s pre-market.Hyatt Hotels (H  -  Free Report) surpassed expectations greatly on the bottom line, posting earnings of 26 cents per share compared with the 17 cents expected. Revenues of $1.12 billion topped the $1.09 billion we had been looking for. RevPAR rose 1.6% quarter over quarter, slightly offset by adjusted EBITDA down year over year.

2914,SBUX,"The Dow outperformed the two other benchmarks to close at a record high riding on a rally in shares of Chevron. Amazon’s disappointing second quarter results weighed on both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.The FDA’s decision to cut nicotine content in cigarettes weighed on the shares of tobacco maker Altria Group, which in turn dragged the S&P 500 lower Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s failure to repeal Obamacare also weighed down broader markets, following concerns about its ability to push through crucial policy changes. Meanwhile, second quarter GDP came in below expectations.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) touched all-time intraday high and rose 0.2% or 33.76 points, closing at 21,830.31. The S&P 500 Index (INX) declined 0.1%, dwindling 3.32 points to close at 2,472.10. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,374.68, declining 45 points or 0.2%. A total of around 6.1 billion shares were traded on Monday, above the last 20-session average of 6.0 billion shares. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.16-to-1 ratio .On the Nasdaq, a 1.17-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Dow Breaches Record, Recovers from 40-Point DeclineThe Dow matched an all-time intraday high on Friday, closing at a record level of 21,830.31. The blue-chip index was boosted by splendid earnings from Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) . This enabled the Dow to recover from the 40 point decline it suffered earlier in the session. U.S. energy giant Chevron Corp. reported strong second-quarter results amid the recovery in commodity prices, production gains and the success of its cost savings initiatives. The company reported earnings per share (excluding special items) of 91 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 89 cents and the year-ago profit of 48 cents. These helped shares of the oil giant gain an impressive 1.9%. (Read More: Chevron Q2 Earnings Beat on Oil Rally, Output Rise).On the other hand, Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report) posted a dismal performance, losing1.5%. Energy giant Exxon Mobil Corporation posted an earnings miss in second-quarter 2017 owing to a decline in liquid volumes and lower margin from chemical businesses. This was partially offset by increased price realizations from liquids and gas and improved refinery volumes. The company reported earnings of 78 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents. However, the bottom line improved from the year-ago quarter level of 41 cents. (Read More: Exxon Mobil Q2 Earnings Miss on Lower Volumes). However, Exxon’s losses were negated by Chevron’s excellent earnings performance and the blue-chip index posted a weekly gain.Amazon Posts Disappointing Earnings Amidst Speculations On OvervaluationAmazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) posted dismal earnings in the second quarter. Its second-quarter 2017 earnings per share (EPS) of 40 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.40. (Read More: Amazon Q2 Earnings Hurt by Higher Spending, AWS Solid). Amazon’s dismal performance led to losses for both the Dow and the S&P 500.Investors have been worried regarding the now familiar overvaluation of tech stocks as they fear a potential market crash and cautious investors have started taking profits off the table. This has affected the broader market and has pulled down the Nasdaq composite which closed at 6,374.68, declining 0.1%. The earnings season continues as Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) is expected to report this week.FDA Announces a Cut In Nicotine Content, S&P 500 Slips The S&P 500 finished 3.32 points lower, closing at 2,472.10. Although, the index recovered from its early 10- point deficit, it still closed the day 0.1% lower. Apart from Amazon’s dismal earnings, the Food and Drug Administration’s call to reduce the nicotine content in cigarettes hurt investor sentiment. The Select Consumer Staples SPDR (XLP) declined 0.8%, emerging as the worst performer out of eleven sectors of the S&P. Eight of the eleven sectors of the S&P ended in negative territory. The FDA’s decision also had negative ramifications for tobacco maker Altria Group Inc. MO as its shares slid 9.5%.On a broader scale, disappointing earnings from Amazon, Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) and Exxon Mobil also dented investor sentiment. Starbucks met analysts’ expectations on earnings, but failed to meet the same on revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.74 billion by 1.4%. (Read More: Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) Q3 Earnings in Line, Signals Soft US Market)Trump’s Failure to Repeal Obamacare Dampens Investor SentimentThe Trump –led Republican Government has failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act yet again. This has dampened investor sentiment with market watchers losing their faith in the promises made by President Trump in the run up to the presidential elections. Trump's failure to keep his campaign trail promises has made investors doubtful of his ability to bring about tax reforms and increasing spending on infrastructural growth among other items on his pro-growth agenda. These concerns also contributed toward losses for the broader markets.Economic DataThe gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annual rate of 2.6% in the second quarter which came in lower than the expected rate of 2.8%. This was 1.2% higher than the first quarter. Consumer spending remained the major engine of growth. Personal consumption rose 2.8%, up from 1.1% in the first quarter. This was buoyed by a vibrant labor market which also meant increased spending in new homes.Weekly ResultsFor the week, the Dow gained 1.2% whereas the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 fell 0.2% and 0.1% respectively. The Dow’s great run has been supported by excellent earnings for the week. The companies which reported better-than-expected earnings were AT&T (T  -  Free Report), McDonalds MCD, Boeing (B  -  Free Report), Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report), Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report).The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 turned in mixed performances over the week. Despite splendid earnings from Facebook and the tech rally, disappointing performance from Amazon and the swoon in the shares of Apple, led the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq to close in the red. Moreover, a slump in healthcare sector also weighed on the S&P 500.Stocks That Made HeadlinesTelefonica Q2 Earnings Up Y/Y, Revenues Lag EstimatesSpanish telecom giant, Telefonica S.A.

2915,SBUX,"Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) met analysts’ expectations on earnings, but failed to meet the same on revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2017 results.Apart from impressive third-quarter earnings, Starbucks made another major announcement. First, Starbucks announced plans of buying the remaining 50% stake in its East China business for $1.3 billion in cash, the company’s largest ever acquisition, as it continues to look to China as one of the main growth area. The addition gives Starbucks full ownership of about 1,300 Starbucks locations in Shanghai as well as Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces.However, the premium coffee giant also shared plans of closing its Teavana outlets (379 stores, 3,300 employees) after buying it in 2012.Despite Starbucks’ expansion plans, its shares fell 5.8% in after-hours trading session on Jul 27. The pessimism was possibly due to the soft guidance for fiscal 2017.Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw, said, “The combination of trends in the quarter and ongoing macro pressures impacting the retail and restaurant sectors has us a bit more cautious.”Earnings, Sales & Comps DiscussionAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 55 cents was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but grew 12.2% year over year.Total second-quarter sales of $5.66 billion increased 8.1% year over year, driven by higher store openings and global comps growth. The upside was driven by robust sales in the U.S. and the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) divisions.Revenues, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.74 billion by 1.4%.Global same-store sales (comps) grew 4%, better than the 3% growth witnessed in the preceding quarter. Global traffic increased 4% in the quarter against 3% decline in traffic in the previous quarter. Margin JumpsOperating margin decreased 110 basis points (bps) year over year to 18.4% in the quarter due to goodwill and store asset impairments.

Customers in the U.S. are using the chain’s mobile app to order and pay for their drinks and are joining the company’s rewards program. Mobile payments represented 30% of U.S. transactions, increasing from 9% a year ago.Operating margin in the segment, however, contracted 20 bps to 24.4% as strong sales leverage were more than offset by higher investments in store partners, the impact of product sales mix and higher commodity costs.China-Asia-Pacific (CAP): Net revenue increased 9% to $840.6 million on the back of higher revenues from new store opening and comp store sales growth.Comps grew 1%, softer than 3% growth seen in the previous quarter. Stellar 7% comps growth in China were partly offset by softness in Japan.Starbucks’ licensed joint venture markets, including East China and South Korea, continue to contribute to CAP's performance in the quarter, as evidenced by a 30% increase in income from joint ventures.Operating margin at the CAP segment rose 280 bps year over year to 26.6% buoyed by strong sales leverage and higher JV income.Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA): Net revenue declined 9% year over year to $249.9 million due to portfolio shift to licensed stores, including the sale of the Germany outlet as well as due to currency headwind.That said, comps grew 2% (against 1% decline in the preceding quarter), marking the strongest growth in seven quarters, banking on solid U.K. performance.Operating margin declined 700 bps to 3.9%, owing to a shift in the portfolio toward more licensed stores and partial impairment of goodwill for its Switzerland market.Channel Development (CPG): This segment includes roasted whole bean and ground coffees, premium Tazo teas, a variety of ready-to-drink beverages (like Frappuccino and Starbucks Refreshers) and Starbucks and Tazo branded K-Cup packs sold through channels such as grocery, specialty retailers, and foodservice, to name a few.Channel Development’s net revenues were up 9% to $478.7 million.Operating margin rose 130 bps to 43.9% driven by higher profits from the North American Coffee Partnership (NCAP) with PepsiCo, Inc, (PEP) and lower coffee costs.All-Other: The segment comprises emerging brands like Teavana (acquired in Dec 2012), Seattle's Best Coffee, Starbucks Reserve and Roastery businesses. Revenues at the segment decreased 9% to $100.4 million.Q4 GuidanceFor the fourth quarter, Starbucks projected global comp growth at 3% to 4%.GAAP EPS will be in the range of 53–54 cents and non-GAAP EPS will be in the range of 54–55 cents.Fiscal 2017 GuidanceGiven the “choppiness” it witnessed in the fiscal third quarter as well as in the initial fourth quarter, Starbucks now is somewhat bearish for the remainder of fiscal 2017.The company now expects revenue growth to be at the low end of its prior guidance range of 8–10%. This excludes 1% from Fx and 2% of impact for the extra week in fiscal 2016.For fiscal 2017, the company cut its non-GAAP earnings target to the range of $1.96???$1.97 from $2.08–$2.12 per share expected earlier.

2918,SBUX,"We are in the thick of the Q3 earnings season with results seemingly on solid ground given the positive momentum on the revenue front. Apart from maintaining the above-average proportion of positive earnings surprises, the estimate revision trend for the December quarter is quite palpable.According to our latest Earnings Preview, 64.2% of the total market capitalization of S&P 500 is already out. As of Oct 27, 2017, total earnings for the 272 S&P 500 members are up 8.7% year over year on 6.7% higher revenues. Of these, 75.7% surpassed earnings estimates, while 66.2% beat revenue expectations.A Look at the Restaurant IndustryWe note that the performance of the restaurant industry, under the broader Retail-Wholesale sector, has been mixed so far this earnings season. Among the restaurant stocks that have reported, Domino’s Pizza Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) posted robust results, beating earnings and revenue estimates.McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) posted mixed third-quarter 2017 results. While earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues fell short of the same. However, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) lagged on both fronts.Soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space along with rising costs continue to haunt restaurant chains. Also, the recent hurricanes seem to have negatively impacted results of a number of restaurant companies this earnings season, which includes the likes of BJ’s Restaurants, Inc. (BJRI  -  Free Report)    that reported lower-than-expected results in third-quarter fiscal 2017.Nonetheless, innovative operators with strong fundamentals are continuing to exhibit strength even in a not-so-favorable environment.Let’s have a sneak peek at two major restaurant stocks scheduled to report earnings tomorrow to see how things are shaping before the announcement.Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results.We expect Starbucks’ revenues to increase on the back of an addition of new restaurants and positive global comparable store sales or simply comps growth. Starbucks also projected global comps growth at 3-4% for the quarter. Comps in the fiscal fourth quarter are likely to be driven by significant menu innovations like new and improved Bistro Boxes, Seared Steak and Egg Wrap.Starbucks’ digital offering, Mobile Order and Pay, is also witnessing increased usage and could prove to be a key growth driver in the to-be-reported quarter as well as in 2017. Again, growth in Starbucks reward members is expected to contribute to its revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The company had earlier revealed that it expects stronger revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by mid-single digit comps including accelerating comps in the United States. Overall, for the fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $5.73 billion, implying 0.4% year-over-year growth.With respect to the company’s bottom line, Starbucks’ EPS is likely to witness a decline in the third quarter due to a rise in cost of sales and higher goodwill and other asset impairment expenses for the closing of 379 Teavana stores. Hence, despite a revenue-growth expectation, the coffee giant’s margins are likely to narrow due to higher cost of sales as a result of commodity inflation. These headwinds, however, are likely to be offset by lower general and administrative (G&A) expenses.That said, a challenging environment in the United States restaurant space might be a cause for concern for investors in the near term.For the fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 55 cents a share, reflecting a decrease of 2.5% year over year.Meanwhile, our proven model does not conclusively show that Starbucks is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components.For the impending quarter, the company has an Earnings ESP of -0.08%. Starbucks currently has Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), making an earnings prediction uncertain. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 for a likely earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.(Read: Will Higher Costs Impact Starbucks' Q4 Earnings?) Starbucks Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Starbucks Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Starbucks Corporation QuoteYum! Brands, Inc. (YUM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 numbers before the opening bell.Post China business separation, Yum! Brands endeavors to drive growth by employing greater focus on the development of its three iconic global brands, increasing its franchise ownership, and creating a leaner and more efficient cost structure bodes well. This, in turn, is likely to bolster third-quarter results.Particularly, augmented pace of unit development along with increased investments in technology-driven initiatives is anticipated to somewhat drive top-line growth in the quarter.Coming to the Pizza Hut brand, while the international division might continue doing well, Pizza Hut U.S. is expected to post soft results for the quarter despite numerous strategic efforts similar to the last few quarters. Notably, a soft consumer-spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space is likely to continue restricting revenue growth.Meanwhile, KFC’s efforts to revamp outlets, focus on its operational excellence, delivery services, innovation and convenience, are expected to continue boosting comps.However, Yum! Brands is likely to witness a decline in company sales due to the impact of its strategic refranchising initiative, which, in turn, will lower the company’s revenues in the third quarter. A slowdown in emerging markets is likely to further hamper the quarter’s performance.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings of 66 cents implies a year-over-year decline of 39.5%. The same for revenues is pegged at $1.39 billion, 58.2% lower than the prior-year quarter figure.Meanwhile, our proven model does not conclusively show that Yum! Brands is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. For the impending quarter, the company has an Earnings ESP of -1.37%.

Brands have delivered positive surprises in the trailing four quarters. However, Yum! Brands’ average beat of 7.01% steers past Starbucks’ level of 0.46%.From the sales growth perspective, Starbucks is well positioned to report better quarterly results.Meanwhile, both the companies are expected to report a decline in earnings. However, Yum! Brands’ rate of decline of earnings is more than the Starbucks’ (-39.5% Vs. -2.5%).Stay tuned!

2919,SBUX,"Fast food giant Dunkin’ Donuts, which is part of Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN  -  Free Report), is geared up to expand in the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina. The company has inked a multi-unit store development agreement with its long-time franchisee Awale Networks, Inc., whereby it plans to build four new restaurants. The first restaurant under this deal is slated to open in 2018.Awale Networks currently owns 12 locations in Atlanta and Raleigh-Durham. The addition of these restaurants will strengthen the position of this long-term franchisee of Dunkin’ Donuts.Notably, Dunkin’ Donuts possesses more than 90 locations in the Greater Raleigh-Durham area and over 300 in North Carolina. This agreement is thus in sync with the company’s plan to drive growth in the region. Meanwhile, in order to fortify its presence, the company is continuously recruiting franchisees in the Greensboro and High Point areas as well.Dunkin' Brands is also looking to expand its footprint in the emerging markets of Asia and the Middle East. Also, it considers the untapped market of South Africa a great opportunity. In fact, the company has made a franchise agreement to develop more than 250 Dunkin' Donuts restaurants and over 70 Baskin-Robbins shops in the continent over the next few years.At the end of the third quarter, Dunkin' Brands opened 137 new restaurants worldwide. These include 67 Dunkin' Donuts U.S. locations, 18 Dunkin' Donuts International locations, 11 Baskin-Robbins U.S. locations and 41 Baskin-Robbins International outlets. Additionally, Dunkin' Donuts U.S. franchisees remodeled 88 restaurants, while Baskin-Robbins U.S. franchisees renovated 24 outlets.Notably, Dunkin’ Brands’ shares have outperformed its industry in the last year. While the stock rallied 18.1%, the industry gained 16.2%. However, Dunkin' Brands’ international comps growth has been weak over the last few years. Furthermore, a soft consumer spending environment in the domestic restaurants space along with intense competition from food & beverages companies like Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report), McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Jack in the Box Inc. (JACK  -  Free Report) might continue to exert pressure on revenues.Nevertheless, we are positive on the company’s continued expansion strategies along with various sales and digital initiatives. These initiatives include product launches, increased focus on its beverage portfolio, the ongoing loyalty program and mobile ordering service that are expected to draw customers and drive earnings as well as revenue growth.Currently, Dunkin’ Brands has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2921,SBUX,"In this digital era, as consumers increasingly look for convenience, technology has begun to play an important role in determining customer experience. This digital wave has hit the U.S. restaurant space too as an increasing number of restaurant chains are deploying technology to enhance guest experience.In fact, technology at restaurants has become essential — more than ever before — given the troubles plaguing the U.S. restaurant space over the past few quarters.Hence, restaurant operators are going all guns blazing, with their online and digital marketing activities, to meet consumers’ increasing dependence on and penchant for online and mobile web technology and consequently lure them back.Age of Mobile OrderingWhile smartphone apps attract consumers, video menu boards in quick-service restaurants and tabletop devices speed up sales and ensure convenience. Further, restaurant operators rely on social media for promotions and incorporate Facebook, Twitter, online review sites and blogs aggressively into their marketing mix.In fact, mobile ordering in particular is fast becoming a crucial part of many restaurants' plans, given what it can bring in enhanced sales. This is because when using a phone to order their food, customers, on an average, tend to spend more and visit more often. Going forward, mobile ordering is thus set to be the core to the customer’s experience, rather than just being a point of differentiation.Notably, pizza giants Domino's Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) and Papa John's International Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report) have been the industry bellwethers in the digital ordering space.  Both the companies hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Domino’s continues adding to its digital capabilities with the launch of various ordering apps and platforms. The extended ways to order a pizza has thus kept this company in the forefront of digital ordering and customer convenience. Moreover, digital leadership is helping the pizza giant to expand its brand in the domestic market as well as overseas. In fact, at the end of 2016, the company generated over 60% digital sales in the United States.Papa John’s too continues to reinforce its commitment toward providing a better customer experience with enhancements to its digital ordering process. Markedly, the company’s mobile ordering applications support category-leading five simple, secure, and mobile-friendly ways to pay online orders without using cash or credit card. In the second quarter of 2017, Papa John’s recorded more than 60% online sales mix, of which around 70% was from its mobile channels, and has a long-term target of eventually reaching 80%.Though few restaurants have managed to come as far along as the pizza chains but still there are many who have advanced their own apps by leaps and bounds to arrest more customers on the go.It is to be noted that coffee chain giant Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) has secured a leading position in leveraging its mobile and digital assets and loyalty and e-Commerce platforms to create more revenue streams. In fact, Starbucks’ mobile app is undoubtedly one of the most widely used mobile payment app in the United States.Nearly 30% of all U.S. transactions took place through mobile devices at the end of third-quarter fiscal 2017, up 9% from the year-ago quarter. Currently, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company is introducing many technology innovations to further strengthen its brand, improve efficiency and in-store execution and increase profitability.Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN  -  Free Report) is also growing in terms of its usage of digital technology. Dunkin’ Donuts’ mobile ordering service — On-the-Go — is available nationwide exclusively for Dunkin' Donuts DD Perks Rewards Program members. This ordering service gives the company the power to drive customer loyalty and boost efficiency as well as speed of service at its restaurants. Again, in August 2016, Baskin-Robbins' launched a mobile app with a variety of interactive features.Meanwhile, in order to catch up with established mobile ordering offerings from competitors, burger giant McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report) has also begun testing mobile order-and-pay capabilities on its app in the United States. The company is thus set to launch the option in nearly all 14,000 U.S. restaurants and 6,000 others in the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Australia and China by the end of this year.Both Dunkin' Brands and McDonald’s currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Bottom LineThe restaurant industry’s sales trends in recent quarters have been strained given the soft consumer spending environment.However, often a rising tide lifts all boats in an industry as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that drive securities across the board. This could happen in the restaurants space as well. Increasing focus of operators on mobile ordering to cater to ever-changing wants and needs of time-crunched customers could lift the industry from its current position at the bottom 14% out of the over 250 Zacks categorized industries.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2922,SBUX,"Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) is opening its largest shop ever with the new Reserve Roastery in Shanghai, on Dec 5, in a bid to counter sluggish U.S. sales. Starbucks is testing its upscale and super-sized cafe concept in its fastest-growing market of China.The 30,000-square-feet store has more than 100 beverages on the menu, and allows customers to participate in the first AR (augmented reality) experience from Starbucks. This is the second-ever Starbucks Roastery while its first was opened in Seattle in 2014. The coffee chain giant also has plans to bring this Roastery concept to New York in 2018 and another to Chicago in 2019.Expansion in ChinaThe Starbucks brand is gaining popularity across Asia with increasing investments in Asian markets. Particularly, China is the fastest-growing market for Starbucks. Management believes that China and the Asia-Pacific region will drive more meaningful business growth over the next five years supported by rapid unit expansion, wider brand awareness, and increased usage of digital/mobile/loyalty platforms. Starbucks currently (as of Oct 1, 2017) operates 7,479 stores across China-Asia-Pacific or CAP. The company remains on track to have roughly 11,000 locations in CAP (600 in China alone) in fiscal 2018.Revenues from the CAP region, accounting for 14% of Starbucks’ revenues for fiscal 2017, were up 10% in fiscal 2017. Same-store sales grew 8% in China during the last-reported quarter (its strongest in nine quarters), compared with 2% globally.Even in July 2017, the company announced its plans of acquiring the remaining 50% share of its East China business from Uni-President Enterprises Corporation and President Chain Store Corporation. The deal, which is the largest acquisition made by Starbucks to date, is valued at $1.3 billion.Following the deal, the company will own 1,300 stores in three Chinese provinces. The transaction, which is slated to close by early calendar year 2018, is expected to add $1 billion to the top line in the first year and see a breakeven to slightly accretive earnings in the first year. Importantly, the company believes that joining its China business will lead to acceleration in its East China business.Starbucks' business in China is growing rapidly due to innovative store designs, local product innovations and the success of the My Starbucks Rewards program. Beyond China, the company is facilitating growth in countries like Japan, Korea, Thailand and Indonesia. Starbucks expects to triple its profits in the CAP and Europe, Middle East and Africa business over the next five years.Increasing revenues in the Americas segment (accounting for 70% of total revenues) have been a big challenge for Starbucks for the last few quarters. The company has been experiencing tepid comps growth in the United States for quite a while now amid persistent decline in the country’s restaurant sales. Starbucks reported only 3% comps growth in fiscal 2017 against 6% in the year-ago period in the Americas segment.Evidently, the company’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Restaurant Industry on a year-to-date basis. The stock has returned 5.8% while its industry has gained 13.5%.Nonetheless, increased investments in the company’s fastest growing market, successful innovations, best-in-class loyalty program and digital offerings will likely help this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company to offset the soft sales trend in the United States.Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. (ARCO  -  Free Report), The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) and RH (RH  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Arcos Dorados is expected to register 16.2% EPS growth this year.Current-year earnings for Home Depot are expected to grow 14.2%.RH’s current-year earnings are projected to grow 130.2%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2923,SBUX,"McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report) is leaving no stone unturned to revitalize its McCafe brand. In this regard, the company is focusing on new cafe-quality espresso beverages, extended retail offerings and a branding overhaul to gain ground in the battle for the nation's coffee drinkers.Inside the HeadlinesIn addition to recrafted lattes and mochas, the company has added a new set of espresso-based beverages to the McCafe lineup that are made with freshly-ground espresso and US-sourced whole or nonfat milk. The three new beverages include caramel macchiato, cappuccino and americano.Notably, these new offerings along with all McCafe specialty beverages will be available for $2 for a limited time at the participating restaurants.  Also, the company recently inked a deal with The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) to bring a line of ready-to-drink McCafe Frappe beverges to groceries across the United States in early 2018. The bottled drinks will come in three flavors that include caramel, vanilla and mocha.Currently, the fast food chain maintains a line of whole bean, ground and single-serve coffee in retail stores. Therefore, this will be McDonalds’ first foray into the nearly $2 billion ready-to-drink coffee category.Apart from the coffee upgrades, McDonald's also announced a McCafe brand revamp with the introduction of a new brand logo and packaging that will change with the seasons. In fact, as part of its evolving Experience of the Future initiative, the company also plans to transform its in-restaurant McCafe presence with a sleek and contemporary look in 2018.Furthermore, the company has brought in new coffee makers into its stores so that the new espresso-based beverages are handcrafted with a steady, appetizing flavor. The rollout to nearly all of McDonald's 14,000 restaurants is accompanied by new training for crew members.Rationale BehindWith its refined new beverages and updated branding, the company aims to capitalize on the growing coffee culture among customers and meet their demand in terms of taste, convenience and value. In October 2016, the company had stated that it would be buying all of its coffee from sustainable sources by 2020. Elevating its coffee business has thus become an essential part of its growth strategy amid escalating demand for the same and continual pressure on the food sales.Markedly, McDonald's launched the coffee brand McCafe in the United States in 2009. Though McCafe generates nearly $4 billion in sales annually in the country, it has the scope to fare much better. In fact, this is just the start to its McCafe commitment with more transformations in store.Moreover, by bringing bottled McCafe drinks to store shelves, the company aims to keep up with rival Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.’s (DNKN  -  Free Report) Dunkin’ Donuts that signed similar deal with Coca Cola last year, and coffee giant Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report), which sells its bottled Frappuccinos in partnership with Pepsico, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and has for long dominated the ready-to-drink coffee space.Bottom LineMcDonald’s shares have gained 23.5% over the past six months, outpacing 9% growth of the industry it belongs to.In fact, growing guest count remains McDonald’s top priority and it is undertaking various sales and digital initiatives to this end. The company has thus been simplifying menus, offering value meals, rolling out all-day breakfast in the United States, focusing on delivery to provide increased convenience and taking steps to meet consumer preference for quality food.By elevating and leveraging the McCafe coffee brand, the company aims to further raise the bar for guests and convert casual diners to loyal customers.Additionally, we note that ever since jumping into the coffee fray, McDonald's has gained from pricing its beverages far lower than its direct coffee competitors. Thus, the new drinks and expansion into retail is likely to add to McDonald’s top line and may perhaps prove to be challenging for its close competitors.McDonald's currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2924,SBUX,"Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 2, after the closing bell.Starbucks’ operating fundamentals remain strong with a solid global retail footprint, successful innovations, best-in-class loyalty program and digital offerings. Particularly, Starbucks is on track to strengthen its portfolio with significant innovation in beverages and core food offerings.We expect Starbucks’ revenues to rise on the back of an addition of new restaurants and positive global comparable store sales or simply comps growth. Starbucks also projected global comps at 3-4% growth for the quarter. Comps in the fiscal fourth quarter are likely to be driven by significant menu innovations like new and improved Bistro Boxes, Seared Steak and Egg Wrap.In beverages, the launch of the Iced Cascara Coconut Milk Latte, the Iced Coconut Milk Mocha Macchiato, Nitro Freddo and the Whiskey Barrel-Aged Sulawesi cold brew are also likely to boost the company’s revenue. In its Channel Development segment, Starbucks’ introduction of Teavana Infusions, a platform of flavored food made from real fruits and botanicals is also a positive factor.Starbucks’ digital offering, Mobile Order and Pay, is also witnessing increased usage and could prove to be a key growth driver in the to-be-reported quarter as well as in 2017. Addition of new restaurants, along with growth in Starbucks reward members, is expected to contribute to Starbucks’ revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The company had earlier revealed that it expects stronger revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by mid-single digit comps including accelerating comps in the United States. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s total stores of 16,510 reflects 5.8% year-over-year growth.Segment wise: Starbucks’ Americas segment (inclusive of the United States, Canada and Latin America; comprising 70.5% of its total revenue) is expected to witness 0.6% growth in revenues, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate. China-Asia-Pacific and Channel Development segments are likely to witness 4.4% and 3.1% growth in revenues, respectively. Additionally, the consensus estimate for Europe, Middle East and Africa or EMEA segment revenues of $253 million indicates a decrease of 6.3% from the prior quarter.Starbucks has been shifting certain EMEA markets toward a licensed model. Hence, the portfolio shifts and FX headwind are likely to leave an adverse impact on its EMEA revenues. That said, this effort has contributed to EMEA, delivering solid mid-single digit system sales growth and double-digit non-GAAP operating margins for 12 consecutive quarters.Overall, for the fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $5.73 billion, implying 0.4% year-over-year growth.With respect to the company’s bottom line, Starbucks’ EPS will likely witness a decline in the third quarter due to a rise in cost of sales and higher goodwill and other asset impairment expenses for the closing of 379 Teavana stores. Hence, despite a revenue-growth expectation, the coffee giant’s margins are likely to fall due to higher cost of sales as a result of commodity inflation. However, these headwinds are likely to be offset by lower general and administrative (G&A) expenses.The company remains focused on growing total G&A below the rate of revenue growth and core G&A at half the rate of revenue growth in the long run. This trend is expected to follow in the fiscal fourth quarter as well.However, a challenging environment in the United States restaurant space might be a cause for concern for investors in the near term.For the fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 55 cents a share, reflecting a decrease of 2.5% year over year.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Starbucks does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Starbucks has an Earnings ESP of -0.08%.Zacks Rank: Starbucks carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

2925,SBUX,"Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report), commonly known as AB InBev has been doing well, backed by its impressive brand portfolio, solid geographical reach and focus on business expansion. Though the company is battling hurdles related to stiff competition, consumers’ changing preferences and slow North American growth, the aforementioned initiatives remain this AB InBev’s growth drivers.So, let’s take a closer look into the world largest brewer’s growth story and see if it can be sustained amid the industry hurdles.What’s Driving AB InBev?AB InBev remains focused on portfolio diversification to resonate with consumers’ evolving drinking patterns. Given the accelerated shift toward low-and no-alcohol products, AB InBev keeps introducing near beer alternatives, along with no- and low-alcohol beers to provide greater choices to consumers. This is evident from the company’s plans to acquire Hiball — manufacturer of healthy, clean and premium energy drinks as well as a provider of organic sparkling water and juices under its Alta Palla brand. Another evidence of AB InBev’s commitment toward portfolio diversification is its contract with Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) to provide Teavana, a ready-to-drink tea. Notably, management expects the low and no-alcohol beer category to account for about 20% of global beer volumes by 2025.AB InBev’s expansion in the craft beer space further highlights its practice of exploiting all possible growth avenues. To make the most of this lucrative market, this Belgium-based brewer made numerous acquisitions to strengthen its position in the competitive craft beer space. The company’s strong craft beer portfolio includes well-known names like Karbach, Devils Backbone, Four Peaks, Goose Island and Golden Road among others.Apart from AB InBev, other alcohol players like The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) and Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report) are also expanding in the craft beer category. Thus, expansion in this space is likely to help AB InBev combat competition and cater to the rising demand.Well, AB InBev is also gaining from its buyout of SABMiller, which augmented its presence in the brewing space. Notably, the combined entity has a dominant share in the global beer market. Incidentally, AB InBev has operations spread across North America, Latin America (North, South & West), Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Asia Pacific. Moreover, SABMiller’s buyout seems to have lowered AB InBev’s exposure to the troubles looming over North America. The company is also likely to gain from solid sales in the emerging market, expected in fiscal 2017.What’s Troubling AB InBev?While all is well with AB InBev, the company delivered its sixth consecutive negative earnings surprise in second-quarter 2017, wherein the bottom line fell year over year. This resulted from persistent weakness in Brazil, negative impact of mark-to-market adjustment and increased finance costs. In fact, the company stated that Brazilian economy is recuperating at a slow rate. Further, going forward, the company continues to expect witnessing increased cost of sales due to the lingering currency woes and growth of premium brands. Management also expects a more volatile scenario in some of its core regions.Nonetheless, the company remains optimistic about Brazil’s long-run outcome. It also projects 2017 sales to be backed by growth of global brands and its commercial plans, including revenue-management initiatives. All said, we believe that AB InBev’s strategic initiatives are likely to keep it going despite the hurdles.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

2926,SBUX,"BJ’s Restaurants, Inc. (BJRI  -  Free Report) is expected to report third-quarter 2017 earnings results on Oct 18.  The recent hurricanes are likely to impact results for restaurant companies in the third quarter. Shares of a number restaurant companies including BJ’s Restaurants plummeted after the storms hit the United States. In the third quarter of 2017, the company’s shares lost 18.3%.Apart from recent hurricane woes, consumer behavior has been volatile and their willingness to spend on most goods, especially eating out, is showing signs of decline over the past few quarters. Most of the restaurateurs are thus bearing the brunt of soft comps and traffic trends. Particularly, negative comps, given sluggish traffic along with rising costs, are taking the sheen out of restaurateurs.BJ’s Restaurants’ comp sales have also been down for quite some time now. Comps in the second quarter declined 1.4%, a wider decline than the prior quarter’s 1.3% and the year-ago quarter’s 0.2%. The company expects a 30-basis point negative impact on comp sales in the third quarter.Again, higher labor costs and expenses involved with the execution of the initiatives are expected to keep profits under pressure. In fact, per BJ’s Restaurants’ second-quarter 2017 conference call, management expects increased food and labor costs in the to-be-reported quarter, resulting in cost of sales of around 26% or below.Moreover, pre-opening costs, higher marketing expenses as well as costs related to sales-boosting initiatives might dent margins. Particularly, additional training on slow roasting ovens and handheld tablets will add to labor costs. BJ’s Restaurants has recorded a trailing 12-month net margin of just 3.8%. Given the continual rise in expenses, the trend is not expected to reverse any time soon.Notably, in the last reported quarter, earnings declined 12.5% from the year-ago figure, primarily due to increased expenses. For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 26 cents, reflecting a decline of 14.8% year over year.BJ’s Restaurants expects G&A expenses for the third quarter to be around $14 million owing to lower incentive compensation for the rest of the year. This is more than $12.9 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:BJ’s Restaurants does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BJ’s Restaurants is -2.18%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.  BJ's Restaurants, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise BJ's Restaurants, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | BJ's Restaurants, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: BJ’s Restaurants carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Nevertheless, the company’s major sales-building initiatives implemented this year can be expected to somewhat offset the weak comps trajectory, in the to-be-reported quarter. Through these, the company aims to differentiate its food quality, improve speed of service as well as leverage its broad menu in the takeout and delivery channel. Furthermore, the company is committed toward raising its operating margins through cost-containment initiatives.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $249.8 million, reflecting an increase of 6.9% year over year.

2927,SBUX,"Fast food giant Dunkin' Donuts, belonging to Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN  -  Free Report), had announced a partnership with Amtrak Corporation in the first quarter of 2017. Per the agreement, Dunkin’ Donuts’ hot coffee was offered to 3.4 million annual customers on Amtrak’s high-speed train – Acela Express.The partnership has now been expanded to offer Dunkin' Donuts Original Blend and Dunkin' Decaf hot coffee on Amtrak Northeast Regional trains as well. This will make Dunkin’ Donuts' signature beverage line available to a combined 12 million customers travelling on the trains each year. Dunkin’ Brands enjoys significant customer trust and brand loyalty which makes it easier for Dunkin’ Donuts to launch various innovative product lines.Notably, growing sales of the company’s Cold Brew coffee has opened up substantial opportunity for Dunkin' Brands in the beverage space. In fact, owing to its relentless focus on strengthening its beverage portfolio, the company launched ready-to-drink bottled iced coffee in February 2017 which was manufactured, distributed, marketed and sold by The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) nationwide.In addition to these sales initiatives, Dunkin' Brands is trying to drive revenues through a focused expansion strategy, both domestically and internationally.However, Dunkin' Brands’ international comps growth has been suffering over the last few years at both the Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin Robbins divisions. Further, a soft consumer spending environment in the domestic restaurants space along with intense competition from food and beverage companies like Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) and McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) might impede revenue growth for the company.Meanwhile, Dunkin' Brands’ shares have underperformed its industry year-to-date. While the stock has gained 1.1%, the industry witnessed a rally of 7.9%.Nonetheless, the company is expected to sustain its momentum on a solid product pipeline and diligent expansion efforts.Dunkin' Brands currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2928,SBUX,"World’s largest brewer, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report) or AB InBev has gained 16.9% so far this year, outperforming the Zacks Consumer Staples sector’s growth of 13%. While the beer space has been grappling with intense competition, consumers’ changing preferences and sluggish North American growth, AB InBev has been riding on its robust geographical reach and diversified brand portfolio.That said, let’s delve deeper into this Belgium brewer’s growth drivers and see if they can boost the stock further.Diversified Portfolio Remains a CushionGiven the accelerated shift toward low-and no-alcohol products, AB InBev keeps introducing near beer alternatives, along with no- and low-alcohol beers to provide greater choices to consumers. Evidently, the company recently announced plans to acquire Hiball — manufacturer of healthy, clean and premium energy drinks as well as a provider of organic sparkling water and juices under its Alta Palla brand.

In order to make the most of this lucrative market, AB InBev has made numerous acquisitions to strengthen its position in the competitive craft beer space. The company’s strong craft beer portfolio includes well-known names like Karbach, Devils Backbone, Four Peaks, Goose Island and Golden Road among others. Given the heightened competition from craft brewers and increasing consumer demand, we believe that AB InBev is likely to benefit from its strategy of exploring the craft beer space.SABMiller’s Buyout Fortifies AB InBev’s Market ReachAB InBev has a strong geographical reach, with its operations spread across North America, Latin America (North, South & West), Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Asia Pacific. Further, AB InBev’s buyout of SABMiller has augmented its presence in the brewing space, thus creating the ‘first truly global beer company’. Notably, the combined entity has a dominant share in the global beer market. Also, media sources reveal that this buyout has lowered AB InBev’s exposure to the troubles looming over North America. The company is also likely to gain from solid sales at the emerging market, expected in fiscal 2017.Dismal Earnings Surprise History a ConcernAB InBev’s earnings surprise history has been a disappointment, as the company delivered its sixth consecutive negative earnings surprise in second-quarter 2017. Moreover, the bottom line fell year over year owing to persistent weakness in Brazil, negative impact of mark-to-market adjustment and increased finance costs. In fact, the company stated that Brazilian economy is recuperating at a slow rate.

2929,SBUX,"Shares of several restaurant chains—including Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG  -  Free Report), Shake Shack (SHAK  -  Free Report), and Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report)—surged on Monday as investors began to dive into companies and industries that stand to benefit from a potential GOP tax plan.Both the Senate and House versions of the GOP tax plan call for the corporate tax rate to be cut from 35% to 20%. This massive reduction could lead to greater profits at almost every U.S. company.The U.S. Senate passed a tax bill over the weekend, helping Republicans inch closer to sending a bill to President Donald Trump’s desk—one he hopes to sign before Christmas.Now, after the Senate’s 51-49 vote across party lines—with just one Republican voting against it—the GOP’s plan to cut roughly $1.4 trillion in taxes has once again spurred market movement.Last week, Chipotle stock popped after the fast-casual burrito chain announced it would begin a search for a new CEO. On Monday, shares of Chipotle climbed over 5.5% as investors began to take into account how a new U.S. tax code could help bolster the Colorado-based chain’s bottom line.Investors jumped on Chipotle stock after the weekend Senate vote because the company currently pays one of the highest effective tax rates, according to a Credit Suisse report. This has many Chipotle investors cautiously optimistic about the possibility that a GOP tax overhaul could help raise the struggling company’s profits.Smaller companies with a lot of U.S. sales tend to pay higher effective tax rates than much bigger multinational firms.Investors began to buy shares of companies throughout the U.S. restaurant industry with the hopes that a Republican tax plan—if passed—could help boost profits. On top of that, a decreased tax burden could lead to further investments and strategic business initiatives amid the quickly shifting food industry landscape.Shares of domestic burger chain Shake Shack Inc. climbed over 2.55% to hit a new 52-week high. Yum! Brands, which owns KFC, Taco Bell, and others, also saw its stock price touch a new high on Monday.The Wendy's Company (WEN  -  Free Report) shares surged 3.78%, while shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ  -  Free Report) and Jack in the Box Inc. (JACK  -  Free Report) both jumped by around 1.75%.Shares of U.S. coffee powerhouse Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN  -  Free Report) also rose more than 3% to hit a new 52-week high.

2930,SBUX,"Bitcoin is steadily gaining popularity, as reflected by its rising user base. Interestingly, the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization of $160.8 billion, per coinmarketcap.com, is nearly double the valuation of Goldman Sachs, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), at a respective $89.2 billion and $88.8 billion.Investors should know that the surge in online retail transactions, especially in the holiday season, is driving bitcoin beyond the $9000 mark. This primarily reflects bitcoin’s growing acceptance in diverse businesses.A Note on BitcoinBitcoin is not a physical coin and no central authority creates the virtual currency. Instead, computers create bitcoin through mining. A special software is being used by the miners for solving critical mathematical problems, and thereby keeps the bitcoin network secure by verifying payments. In exchange, the miners receive a small amount of the digital currency as rewards.Record Customers Open Bitcoin AccountsAround Thanksgiving, the virtual currency market witnessed a record number of accounts for bitcoin traders. From Nov 22 to Nov 24, Coinbase — the United States’ largest bitcoin exchange — added roughly 100,000 new users willing to buy or sell the digital currency.Per Coinbase data and Alistair Milne, the bitcoin exchange currently has as many as 13.1 million users, way higher than the 4.9 million users recorded last November. The digital currency also touched an all-time high of $9,682.10 on Nov 27.It is to be noted that with an increasing number of bitcoin buyers and sellers, we expect more transactions that will need more mining. New businesses associated with mining have emerged and companies like NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) offer digital mining equipment are in high demand. NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Holiday Retail Transaction Drives BitcoinCNBC stated that retail transactions this holiday session supported the cryptocurrency’s year-to-date increase of more than 850%. CME Group Inc.’s (CME  -  Free Report) plan to launch bitcoin futures also supported the rally. CME Group — the operator of the largest options and futures exchange in the world — announced plans to introduce bitcoin futures by the second week of December, media reports claim.Apart from holiday retail-centric growth, many investors prefer bitcoin, given that no more than 21 million of the virtual currency can be mined. The finite resource base of the cryptocurrency could help investors increase their wealth over time.Companies Going the Bitcoin WayMany businesses across countries are opting for bitcoin as a mode of transaction, driving the popularity of the currency. Here we discuss four companies that allow their customers to pay in bitcoin in exchange for goods and services.Headquartered in Bellevue, WA, Expedia, Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report) is among the leading online travel players in the world. Per media report, since June 2014, the travel agency has been offering its customers the option to pay in bitcoins for booking hotels.We expect Expedia, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 4.1% in 2017.DISH Network (DISH  -  Free Report), headquartered in Englewood, CO, operates the DISH Network direct broadcast satellite (DBS) subscription television service in the United States. In August 2014, the company received bitcoin payment from customers for the first time.The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 1.3% for the last four quarters. Presently, DISH carries a Zacks Rank #3.Based in Seattle, WA, Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) is the leading roaster and retailer of specialty coffee in the world. The company is accepting payments in bitcoin.We expect this Zacks #3 Ranked company to post year-over-year earnings growth of 12.1% in fiscal 2018.Based in Midvale, UT, Overstock.com, Inc. (OSTK  -  Free Report) is a leading online retail player. Since January 2014, the company has been accepting bitcoin for its wide range of products, including laptops and televisions.Overstock.com carries a Zacks Rank #3.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2931,SBUX,"In a bid to bolster its global market share, Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) has been aggressively opening stores in new and existing markets. In line with this trend, the coffee chain giant recently opened its first store in Jamaica. This is the 76th market to have been entered by the company.The new café is located at the famous Doctor's Cave Beach on the 'Hip Strip'. The company plans to launch 14 more stores over a period of five years. These stores will offer a range of Starbucks beverages and food, including its signature handcrafted hot and cold espresso beverages made with 100% arabica coffee.Management remains focused on increasing its global market share to boost its top line by opening new stores in new and existing markets, remodeling existing stores, deploying technology, controlling costs and aggressive product innovation and brand building. The company aims to open approximately 12,000 new stores globally by fiscal 2021, taking the total store count to an estimated 37,000. During fiscal 2017, Starbucks opened 603 net new stores globally, bringing total store count to 27,339 across 75 countries.The company has been registering tepid comparable-store sales or comps growth in the Americas segment (particularly United States), owing to soft retail and consumer spending environment. The segment’s comps rose 3% in the last quarter, softer than the 5% increase witnessed in the preceding quarter. The company’s global comps in the last four quarters remained in the 2-4% range. Specifically, the company registered 2% global comps growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, lower than 4% growth recorded in the preceding quarter. The soft performance was due to the impact of hurricanes Irma and Harvey, which affected the company’s top line as well as U.S. comp growth by 1%.Overall, in the wake of soft global comps growth, Starbucks lowered long-term financial targets during the fiscal fourth quarter conference call, cutting the annual earnings growth forecast to 12% versus the prior guidance for 15-20%. The company expects global comps of 3-5% and high single-digit net revenue growth (versus prior expectation of 10% or greater).Hence, in order to counter the soft consumption trend in the United States, management has successfully focused on expansion with plans to add 900 net new stores in its Americas segment during fiscal 2018, split roughly evenly between company owned and licensed.Apart from boosting the store count, the company is improving customer experience through innovative new store designs, up-leveling product offerings and growing margins through process and supply chain efficiencies.Starbucks’ shares have moved up 2.9% so far this year, comparing unfavorably with the 11.2% growth of the industry. Also, the trend in current-year earnings estimate revisions is not satisfactory as it moved down by 1.7% over the past 60 days.Zacks Rank & Key PicksStarbucks currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the same sector are Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc.

2932,SBUX,"Shares of Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report) climbed on Wednesday, just one day after Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) introduced its newest Apple Watch, the Series 3. Investors have seemingly jumped on Fitbit stock despite, or perhaps because, Apple’s newest smartwatch and software are so fitness-focused.Fitbit slowly lost some of its market share as a plethora of other fitness wearables entered the picture over the last few years, and the company’s stock price fell accordingly. But that downward spiral all happened before the San Francisco-based company introduced its inaugural, full-scale smartwatch.The Ionic Fitbit announced its sleek new Ionic smartwatch at the end of August. The Ionic will feature Fitbit’s signature fitness tracking capabilities, including the ability to record exercises such as running, biking, and swimming, and much more.The new watch has revamped GPS capabilities and an average battery life of more than four days. The smartwatch can provide personalized coaching and guidance for workouts, including weight lifting, which adapt based on the user’s feedback.All new. All for you. Say hello to your ultimate health & fitness companions. See what’s #NewFromFitbit: https://t.co/5ut3le9AEm pic.twitter.com/OwnW9eydT7— Fitbit (@fitbit) August 28, 2017The Ionic will also feature improved heart rate monitoring to include resting heart rate that can help users understand their ideal heart rate zones. Users will also be able to track their sleep more precisely by viewing how long they spend in light, deep, and REM sleep. A relative SpO2 sensor is also built in that can enable the watch to diagnose sleep apnea.But what might have Fitbit investors’ hearts pumping, even more, are all of the other features that make the Ionic a true, smartwatch.Users can now listen to music through Pandora (P) or save and store over 300 songs to Ionic, and the watch pairs with Bluetooth-connected headphones. Ionic users will also be able to pair the smartwatch with smartphones in order to receive call, text, and other basic notifications when their phones are nearby.On top of that, the Ionic can alert users to notifications from Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Instagram, and Snapchat (SNAP  -  Free Report). Contactless payments can be made via users’ credit and debit cards, as well as the Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) mobile app. Ionic wearers will also be able to connect to the popular social fitness platform Strava.The smartwatch, with a Corning Gorilla Glass face, is available in charcoal/smoke grey, slate blue/burnt orange, and blue grey/silver grey—with a few different strap options as well. Fitbit’s first foray into the smartwatch market comes with a $299.95 price tag. It is available for pre-order now and is set to ship and sell starting in October.Apple Watch Series 3On Tuesday, Apple’s Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams introduced Apple Watch’s new operating system, the watchOS 4, which continues Apple’s trend towards more health-based features.Like Fitbit, it boasts a redesigned workout app, as well as new features for swimmers and gym goers. WatchOS 4 can also track flights of stairs climbed. Apple Watch will now track heart rate metrics on the home screen, including resting heart rate and recovery heart rate. The watch can also notify a user if their heart rate is elevated when they don’t appear to be active.Williams also introduced the brand new Apple Watch Series 3. The watch will feature built-in cellular to allow users the freedom to leave their phones behind and still receive calls (also read: What You Need To Know About The New Apple Watch Series 3).On top of being able to take calls on the Apple Watch Series 3, users can receive messages and use Siri—which will be able to talk to users for the first time in Apple Watch history. Apple’s new smartwatch also allows people to use maps and WeChat. Series 3 users can stream over 40 million songs with Apple Music.The Apple Watch Series 3 costs $399. Orders can be placed on Sept. 15 and will be ready as soon as Sept. 22. Apple will also sell a $329 version of the smartwatch that does not include cellular.Bottom LineApple and Fitbit introduced their newest wearable offerings ahead of the all-important holiday season. And Fitbit’s first ever smartwatch seems to have the company headed back in the right direction. What's more, since the Ionic is so much cheaper than the Apple Watch Series 3 and also includes a major focus on health, it could be the first choice for fitness-focused wearables this year.Right now, it looks like investors are making that connection too. Shares of the fitness wearable giant jumped over 6.23% on Wednesday and its stock price experienced gains in after-hours trading as well. Fitbit shares reached their highest price since January.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2933,SBUX,"The world's largest retailer, Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) was selling off 3% immediately following its Q2 earnings report after the bell Thursday, missing its EPS estimates badly: 40 cents per share compared to $1.40 expected. Revenues outperformed, bringing in $38.00 billion as opposed to the $37.21 billion expected, and up 25% year over year. Of course, CEO Jeff Bezos -- the newly minted ""richest person in the world"" -- does not care about Amazon's bottom line; growing revenues and taking market share remain key.Operating income missed expectations of $1.1 billion, taking in $916 million instead. Amazon Web Services (AWS), a main growth segment of the company, reported an in-line $4.1 billion in revenues, but less profitable than in recent quarters. Revenue guidance, however, was raised considerably from $35.25-37.75 billion to $39.25-41.75 billion. Operating cash flow rose 37% in the quarter to $17.9 billion.Let's not forget the $13.7 billion buyout of Whole Foods Market, although the deal is not expected to formally close until the second half of the year. Otherwise, its Prime Day again outperformed expectations as well as both Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

Analysts had been looking for $5.74 billion. The company also reported its fourth straight miss of same-store sales, though U.S. comps were better than expected at +5%.For Starbucks, the future is in China, and although it's not an easy road to hoe, it is clearly where new CEO Kevin Johnson feels the future of Starbucks is.

All its main segments were up in Q2, and Intel also raised its fiscal 2017 revenue guidance to around $61.3 billion. Shares blossomed 3% in late trading. following the release.

2934,SBUX,"On Thursday, global coffee giant Starbucks Corp. (SBUX  -  Free Report) announced that it will purchase the remaining 50% stake in its East China joint venture for about $1.3 billion, marking the company’s biggest ever acquisition.Starbucks is purchasing its remaining share from its long time joint venture partners Uni-President Enterprises and President Chain Store. And in a separate deal, the coffee company will sell its 50% stake in its Taiwanese joint venture to Uni-President and President Chain for roughly $175 million; the Taiwan joint venture operates about 410 Starbucks store locations.If you take into account number of stores, China is Starbucks’ fastest-growing market outside of the United States. The city of Shanghai, for instance, has almost 600 Starbucks outlets, the largest number in any city, notes Reuters. It will also be the first city beyond the U.S. to have a coffee roastery and tasting, which will open this December.The company said the deal will give them 100% ownership of 1,300 Starbucks stores in the Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang Provinces, though Starbucks is still committed to operating over 5,000 stores in Mainland China by 2021.""Full ownership will give us the opportunity to fully leverage our robust business infrastructure to deliver an elevated coffee, in-store third place experience and digital innovation to our customers, and further strengthen the career development opportunities for our people,"" said Belinda Wong, chief executive, Starbucks China, in a statement. Both deals are expected to close by early next year.

2936,SBUX,"With more consumers inclining toward healthy offerings, companies in the Consumer Staples sector are gradually widening their organic product assortments. Sources revealed that Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report) is on track to acquire Hiball – manufacturer of healthy, clean and premium energy drinks as well as a provider of organic sparkling water and juices under its Alta Palla brand.Terms of the transaction, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2017, remained under covers. Notably, the organic food space has witnessed compound annual growth rate of 15.3% in the last four years, and currently boasts a market worth over $11 billion in the country.  How will Hiball’s Buyout Impact BUD?Based in San Francisco, Hiball was founded a little over a decade back. With a perfect mix of guarana, ginseng, caffeine and certain important vitamins, the company’s energy drinks and sparkling water fall in line with today’s changing trends. As consumers’ demand for healthy, natural and energy-boosting products is growing considerably, Hiball has generated sales worth roughly $40 million over the past one year, as reported by The Wall Street Journal.The introduction of Hiball’s brands is likely to enhance AB InBev’s products portfolio and solidify its network by offering innovative products. Thus, we believe that Hiball’s addition to AB InBev’s will augment the latter’s top line. On the other hand, the move will benefit Hiball by solidifying its customer base, while maintaining its brand culture and focus on organic ingredients.AB InBev’s Portfolio Diversification On TrackHiball’s acquisition marks another milestone in AB InBev’s commitment toward portfolio diversification. Given the accelerated shift toward low and no alcohol products, the company remains focused on undertaking new ventures to meet changing consumer demand. Incidentally, this world’s largest brewer teamed up with Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) last year to provide Teavana, a ready-to-drink tea. Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.’s  deal with Bai Brands (low-calorie, coffee-fruit drinks maker) and Pepsico, Inc. ’s (PEP  -  Free Report) buyout of KeVita Inc. (producer of fermented probiotic and kombucha beverages) are evidence of other beverage players expanding into the fast-growing healthy and wellness categories.Coming back to AB InBev, this Belgian brewer keeps coming up with near beer alternatives along with no- and low-alcohol beers to provide greater choices to consumers. In fact, management expects the low and no-alcohol beer category to account for about 20% of its global beer volumes by 2025. Also, AB InBev is expanding its presence in the craft beer space, which further underscores its practice of exploiting all possible growth opportunities.These endeavors have helped this Budweiser owner to carve an impressive niche, thus emerging as the strongest player in the beer space. Also, these factors have led this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock to rise 9.6% so far this year, falling in line with the sector it belongs to. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

2937,SBUX,"On Sep 6, we issued an updated research report on the coffee chain giant Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report).Starbucks’ shares have lost 0.7% so far this year, comparing unfavorably with 6.5% growth of the industry. In fact, after hitting a 52-week high of $64.87 on Jun 5, the company’s shares have been trending a bit off, with the stock declining 14.2%. Investors have become more cautious lately despite the spotlight on growth prospects in China and revenue growth in the United States.What is Making Starbucks Tumble?It goes without saying that Starbucks has been experiencing tepid comps growth in the U.S. for quite some time now amid persistent decline in the country’s restaurant sales. However, the company showed signs of growth in its third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein its global same-store sales (comps) increased 4% compared with 3% in the preceding quarter.Even its flagship Americas segment witnessed 5% comps growth compared with 3% in the preceding quarter. Importantly, its U.S. comps grew 5%, comprising 5% increase in average ticket. The company’s top and bottom lines grew 8.1% and 12.2%, respectively, year over year in the quarter.Despite Americas comps showing decent growth, softer trends in April and July due to broader industry dynamics, prompted Starbucks to have a more cautious view for the next quarter. Slower sales trend and higher investments in digital and Siren Retail (Roastery and Reserve locations) have led to lowered earnings projections for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year.A Buy Opportunity?Nevertheless, we are encouraged by Starbucks’s operating fundamentals as solid global retail footprint, successful innovations, best-in-class loyalty program and digital offerings remain strong. The company’s digital initiatives like mobile order/pay, delivery services and third-party loyalty partnerships can stimulate stronger sales trends in the Americas. These initiatives should further drive profit in the long term.Importantly, the company remains focused on strong growth potential in China. In July, Starbucks announced plans of buying the remaining 50% stake in its East China business for $1.3 billion in cash, the company’s largest ever acquisition, as it continues to look at China as one of the main growth area. The addition will give Starbucks full ownership of about 1,300 Starbucks locations in Shanghai as well as Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces.With these growth drivers, we believe Starbucks' recent pullback is most probably a long-term opportunity for investors.Meanwhile, Starbucks’ solid Growth Style Score of A substantiates our view. For the current fiscal year, sales growth is pegged at 5.6%, while EPS is likely to grow 7.9%. For the fiscal 2018, the company is expected to witness 9.2% sales growth and 14% EPS growth. Further, the stock has a solid long-term expected EPS growth rate of 17.6%.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksStarbucks holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Investors can also consider stocks like Bob Evans Farms, Inc. , Bravo Brio Restaurant Group, Inc.  and Papa John's International, Inc. (PZZA  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2938,SBUX,"Fast food giant, Dunkin’ Donuts, which is part of Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN  -  Free Report), is geared up to expand further throughout Georgia. The company has signed store development agreements with QSR Group, LLC, and Guzaratti LLC, whereby it plans to build six new restaurants.QSR Group will develop five Dunkin' Donuts restaurants in Macon, GA, including two multi-brand locations with Baskin-Robbins. The first of these is expected to open in 2018. Meanwhile, Guzaratti will open one Dunkin' Donuts location in a gas and convenience store in the Buckhead suburb of Atlanta, GA.Notably, these agreements are in sync with the company’s plan to fuel growth in the Greater Atlanta and Macon regions, which are home to more than 190 Dunkin’ Donuts outlets. In fact, the company is offering special development incentives in order to continue recruiting more franchisees.Apart from foraying into domestic markets, Dunkin' Brands is also looking to expand its footprint internationally in the emerging markets of Asia and the Middle East. Also, it considers the untapped market of South Africa a great potential.At the end of second-quarter 2017, there were in excess of 12,300 Dunkin' Donuts points of distribution and over 7,800 Baskin-Robbins points of distribution, across more than 60 countries worldwide in Dunkin’ Brands’ fully-franchised system.In fact, in 2017, the company expects Dunkin’ Donuts franchisees to add 330-350 net new restaurants and Baskin-Robbins franchisees to add 10 net new restaurants in the United States. Moreover, this fast food chain anticipates franchisees and licensees to add 50-100 net new restaurants, internationally.However, Dunkin’ Brands’ shares have underperformed its industry in the last year. While the stock was up 3.7%, the industry witnessed a gain of 5%.We note that Dunkin' Brands’ international comps growth has been suffering for the last few years at both its Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin Robbins divisions. Also, Dunkin’ Donuts admits facing tough competition from McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Restaurant Brands International, Inc.’s (QSR  -  Free Report) Burger King that have been cutting into its afternoon traffic. Competition arises from other well-established coffee makers like Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) as well.Additionally, a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurants space remains a concern.Although the company is certainly not immune to certain headwinds, we expect it to sustain the momentum, going forward, backed by the continued expansion strategies, along with various sales and digital initiatives. These initiatives include curbside delivery, increased focus on its beverage portfolio, loyalty program and mobile ordering service that are expected to attract customers and support earnings, as well as revenue growth.Dunkin’ Brands’ currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2939,SBUX,"Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) recently sued Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) to refrain the latter from going in for its plan to close the Teavana stores in Simon’s malls. The move comes amid a wave of store closure announcements in recent times which have served a severe blow to the retail real estate market.The AllegationsSimon’s lawsuit alleged that Starbucks’ 78 Teavana store closures in its malls would result in a breach of its lease obligations. Further, the company claimed that this store closure announcement by Starbucks has led to an adverse impact on the value of Simon’s properties. However, there were no specifications in the lawsuit about the amount of financial relief or damage sought by Simon, per the Indianapolis Business Journal news.Notably, the Starbucks’ July announcement of store closures involves a shutter down of all 379 of its Teavana stores in the next year, with majority occurring by spring 2018. However, only two of the Teavana stores in Simon malls have leases slated for expiry before the spring of 2018, but the leases for the rest 76 stores run through January 2027.Starbucks cited lackluster traffic in malls for the decision to close the stores. However, Simon alleged that this is just a lame excuse by Starbucks to refract the blame from itself. In fact, the mall landlord pointed out that the decision of store closures from several retailers like Sports Authority, Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report), Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report) among others was an outcome of either bankruptcy or financial ruin.But this is not the case with Starbucks, which has earned its reputation for being “one of the largest and most recognized companies in the world.” Rather, the Teavana store closure move came as the business failed to expand at Starbucks’ anticipated pace, according to Simon’s allegations.Impact of Store ClosuresAs a matter of fact, mall traffic continues to suffer amid rapid shift in customers’ shopping preferences and patterns, with online purchases growing by leaps and bounds. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent times.Further, retailers unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies. This comes as a pressing concern for retail REITs, as this trend has been considerably curtailing demand for the retail real estate space.In fact, year to date, the REIT Retail industry has underperformed the broader market. This industry has declined 6.5% over this time frame, as against a 9.9% gain of the S&P 500.Amid these, mall landlords have already decided to go to the mattresses. These companies are continuing to make concerted efforts to turn their boring retail hubs into swanky entertainment zones, digitizing their malls and turning into distribution hubs.However, the choppy retail real estate market situation is also said to have led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which the mall landlords are finding it unjustified. Moreover, significant store closures in the middle of the lease term not only hurt the mall landlord, but also the tenants occupying space in that mall because their shop visits also depend on the mix of specific type of retailers.Currently, Simon Property carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2940,SBUX,"After announcing the shutdown of 379 stand-alone Teavana stores last month, Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) plans to close its online operations on Oct 1.Although there was no announcement from the company, a representative confirmed the same to Business Insider. Starbucks’ website currently offers discounts on various products as part of a liquidation sale till the beginning of October.The online store offers products like glasses, mugs, coffee brewers, and espresso makers along with coffee, tea and beverage syrups. The products are still available through third-party sellers like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Starbucks’ other grocery partners. Meanwhile, the company will keep its online customers updated on product availability.Notably, Starbucks has been planning on partnerships with digital companies to expand its brand and global retail footprint to reach more customers. The company also plans to further integrate digital and mobile transaction to its business model as mobile payments constitute 30% of Starbucks orders in the United States.Soft consumer spending and growing popularity of online shopping require the company to strengthen its digital capabilities.However, due to the challenging macroeconomic environment in the U.S. restaurant space, Starbucks, along with many of its peers like Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) and Darden Restaurants, Inc. (DRI  -  Free Report) has been facing a difficult sales environment.--Over the past few months, the U.S. restaurants are witnessing a shift in consumer demand, which has adversely affected the sales performance of the company. Moreover witnessing its fiscal third quarter as well as the initial fourth quarter, Starbucks now is somewhat bearish for the remainder of fiscal 2017. This has partially resulted in a downward revision of the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s earnings. Over the past 60 days, current quarter and year earnings estimates have declined 6.8% and 2.4%, respectively.Additionally, the company’s shares have massively underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has lost 2.5%, as against the 6.3% gain of the industry.Nevertheless, Starbucks is introducing many technological innovations to strengthen its brand.

2941,SBUX,"McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) last-reported results were encouraging with the company bettering our expectations on both top and bottom lines. Shares are also trending up as seen in the chart below:But to understand whether this was just a one-time thing or part of a broader recovery, let’s look for a moment at what was bothering the company in the first place.The way I see it, there were two main problems that led to the decline in its share of the market from 17.5% five years ago to 15.1% last year, according to Euromonitor. The first was an inability to capture an equal share of millennial traffic as it had of earlier generations. The second is related to the persistent weakness in Asian markets, particularly China.Of course, strategic refranchising makes headline numbers erratic and comparisons difficult because closing down company-owned stores is a big hit to revenues that can’t be offset by the 6% commission on sales from franchised stores. But at the end of the day, it makes sense, because both capital and operational expenses are thus taken out, with a resultant positive impact on profitability.In this respect, other fast food chains have already moved to a model where around 95% of the stores are franchised; so McDonald’s, being slightly late to react, will continue to enjoy some near-term positive impact that may not be seen in the others.Targeting MillennialsMillennials are generally more concerned about health, convenience, responsible sourcing and freshness of ingredients. And these are areas the company is doubling down on.In what is a complete reversal of earlier policy, management announced the intention to use fresh beef instead of frozen patties. Being somewhat more difficult to handle, this increases the risk of microbe buildup and food borne disease, but the strategy has given Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG  -  Free Report) an advantage so it’s worth trying out. McDonald’s isn’t taking this to all products at once, which sounds like a good idea.  Other menu changes include a reduction in the use of artificial preservatives, colors and flavors, HFCS-free buns and antibiotics-free chicken, in addition to the Premium Salads refresh, the margarine replacement with butter in Egg McMuffins, milk products from growth hormone-free cows and localized menu options that were announced earlier. In the pipeline is 100% cage-free eggs by 2025 in the U.S. and Canada.On the convenience side, the company is working on putting up digital sign boards, facilitating mobile ordering, tables with serving staff as in fast casual restaurants in some places, curbside service and delivery options both by its own staff and through partnerships with companies like GrubHub (GRUB  -  Free Report). It will also have 2,500 Experience of the Future (EOTF) stores by year-end, meaning that that’s the number of stores that will have Samsung tablets on the table or in kiosks that customers can use to order or communicate with staff.Stealing from the CompetitionMcDonald’s figures that not everyone is that health conscious however, so it seeks to lure in the diet cheaters as well. Not to mention those that would otherwise have gone to a Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) or a Dunkin’ (DNKN  -  Free Report) outlet instead. In the 2-5 PM timeframe that has always been quiet for quick service restaurants, McDonald’s is laying out croissants, muffin tops and a new sundae-topping station for ice cream lovers. It also has special offers on drinks that can be purchased for as low as $1-2.Plus there are seasonal-themed coffees and environmentally friendly coffee beans (a page out of Starbucks). For this purpose, McDonald’s is getting 12,000 new espresso machines, store redesigns and stepping up marketing efforts. The goal is clear: McDonald’s may be looking out for the health conscious, but it isn’t about to dump those wanting to indulge.Looking for Growth in ChinaChina is part of McDonald's “fast growing” segment, but it hasn’t been growing too fast of late. Changing customer perceptions following the stale meat scandal had a notable impact on not only McDonald’s but also on Yum Brands (YUM  -  Free Report). Chinese fast food chains in the meantime have gained some ground. Families in particular have moved on from Brand America to other things like food quality, so they are frequenting the fast casual segment these days. But office goers are reportedly coming back.McDonald’s isn’t taking chances. Just as it has done in other Asian markets like Japan (3,000 outlets), South Korea (600) and Taiwan (400), the company is transferring an 80% interest in 2,000 Chinese outlets to CITIC Limited, CITIC Capital Partners and The Carlyle Group for 10 years. In return, it’s getting a cool $2.08 billion from the largest franchisee outside the U.S.There are ambitious plans afoot, with the group targeting double-digit growth in each of the next five years by increasing the number of restaurants from 2,500 to 4,500. By 2022, it also intends to bring delivery hub coverage to over 75% of restaurants. This therefore looks like a very good deal by which McDonald’s is refranchising the business, acquiring local talent and catering to local preferences in a highly profitable way.  Last WordsTo ensure that all goes smoothly, McDonald’s has brought in Morgan Flatley (formerly CMO of Global Nutrition at Pepsico, responsible for getting Gatorade back to sustained growth), as U.S. Chief Marketing Officer; Farhan Siddiqi, as Head of U.S. Digital (formerly worked at Bank of America, Target and GE); and Linda Van Gosen (formerly VP at Startbucks, responsible for Starbucks Evenings, VP of Brand Strategy, Insights and Menu Innovation at TGI Friday’s and VP of Product Innovation at Chili’s Grill & Bar) as new Head of U.S. Menu.Given the above and the possibility of President Trump’s tax reforms kicking in, Mc Donald’s is set for a rebound. So if results are beginning to look up at McDonald’s it’s very likely an indication of more to come.McDonald’s shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2942,SBUX,"Fast food giant Dunkin’ Donuts, which is part of Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN  -  Free Report), is geared up to expand further in the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina. The company has inked a multi-unit store development agreement with Coastal Franchising, Inc. whereby it plans to build seven new restaurants therein.Franchisee group Coastal Franchising, which is led by George Ross, currently operates 39 outlets throughout the Carolinas, including five in Raleigh-Durham itself. This addition of seven units will more than double the franchisee’s presence in the area. The first of these is expected to open in 2018.Notably, this agreement is in sync with the company’s plan to fuel growth in North Carolina, which is home to over 200 Dunkin’ Donuts outlets.Meanwhile, apart from foraying into domestic markets, Dunkin' Brands is also looking to expand its footprint internationally in the emerging markets of Asia and the Middle East. Also, it considers the untapped market of South Africa a great potential.At the end of second-quarter 2017, there were in excess of 12,300 Dunkin' Donuts points of distribution and over 7,800 Baskin-Robbins points of distribution, across more than 60 countries in Dunkin’ Brands’ fully-franchised system.In fact, in full-year 2017, the company expects Dunkin’ Donuts franchisees to add 330-350 net new restaurants, and Baskin-Robbins franchisees to add 10 net new restaurants in the United States. Moreover, internationally, the company anticipates franchisees and licensees to add 50-100 net new restaurants.Notably, the Dunkin’ Brands’ shares have outperformed its industry in the last year. While the stock rallied 9.7%, the industry witnessed a gain of 4.9% in the same time period.However, Dunkin' Brands’ international comps growth has been suffering for the last few years at both its Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin Robbins divisions. Furthermore, a soft consumer spending environment in the domestic restaurants space along with intense competition from similar food & beverages companies like Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report), McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Jack in the Box Inc. (JACK  -  Free Report) might continue to put pressure on revenues.Although the company is certainly not immune to certain headwinds, we expect it to sustain the momentum going forward on the back of continued expansion strategies along with various sales and digital initiatives. These initiatives include product launches, increased focus on its beverage portfolio, the ongoing loyalty program and mobile ordering service that are expected to attract customers and positively support earnings as well as revenue growth.Currently, Dunkin’ Brands’ has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2943,SBUX,"We have a slew of economic and earnings reports on the docket today,  but the Greek turmoil will likely continue to dominate the headlines. On  the economic front, we got better-than-expected weekly Jobless Claims  numbers, raising hopes for a favorable showing from Friday's non-farm  payroll report.
"
2944,SBUX,"We also have a surprise interest rate cut from the European Central  Bank, likely indicating a new monetary policy course for the central  bank under Mario Draghi, who replaced Jean-Claude Trichet only three  days ago. A little later, we get the September Factory Orders and the  October ISM Service Sector Index reading.
"
2945,SBUX,"The big wait on the U.S. economic front now is for the Friday labor  market report. But irrespective of the quality of that report, the  overall economic picture has improved markedly over the last few weeks.  Had it not been for the re-emergence of the Euro-zone fears following  the Greek referendum gambit, all the major macro worries have started  easing in recent days. The solid October rally reflected this improved  macro backdrop, but the renewed Euro-zone uncertainty threatens to  derail it.
"
2946,SBUX,"European leaders meeting in the French city of Cannes have tightened the  screws on Greece's Prime Minister Papandreou. They have suspended  payment of the next tranche of bailout money till the completion of the  referendum and given him an ultimatum to decide whether his country  wanted to stay within the common currency or not.
"
2947,SBUX,"As a result, the referendum will likely take place on or around December  4, almost a month ahead of what the Greeks had originally indicated.  But the referendum plan needs to get approved by the Greek parliament  before it could take place. And the government may not have the votes in  parliament to get its approval. The question at this stage is whether  the Greek government will survive if its referendum plan fails to get  parliamentary approval. The government's fall would mean fresh general  elections, hardly a solution to the current problem.
"
2948,SBUX,"On the domestic labor market front, we got a better-than-expected read  on weekly Jobless Claims. Initial claims dropped a bigger than expected  9K to 397K, while the prior week's level was revised upwards to 406K  from the original 402K. The four-week average dropped 2K to 404.5K. The  overall trend on the initial Jobless Claims front has been favorable, as  they have fallen in four of the last six weeks. However, the extent of  the decline has been quite anemic, with the initial claims number  stubbornly refusing to fall below the 400K level. This week's drop below  the 400K notwithstanding, initial claims have remained above the 400K  level consistently since March, except for two weeks.
"
2949,SBUX,"On the earnings front, we got a modest EPS beat from CVS Caremark (CVS  -  Free Report) on in-line revenue. We got a similar performance from exchange operator NYSE Euronext (NYX), a modest EPS beat on in-line revenue. Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) reports after the close.
"
2950,SBUX,"In other corporate news, we got weaker-than-expected October same-store  sales numbers from a number of major retailers this morning, including J.C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) and Macy's (M  -  Free Report).RELATED ARTICLESG-20 Left to Pick Up PiecesADP Sees 110K Jobs Gained3 Year-End Trading Strategies

2951,SBUX,"Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR) may not be a household name yet, but its highly successful Keurig Single-Cup Brewing System is quickly becoming one, especially now that it has co-marking deals with coffee juggernauts like Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) and Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN  -  Free Report).    
"
2952,SBUX,"GMCR started this week as a Zacks #1 Rank Top Performer, as shares gained nearly 8.7%. Volume surpassed 10 million shares, compared to the daily average of about 6.9 million.   
"
2953,SBUX,"As was highlighted in this recent Tactical Trading article, last week was tough for Green Mountain Coffee Roasters as its shares took a big hit. So a good amount of todays performance can probably be attributed to making up some lost ground. In addition though, we are only a couple days away from its fiscal fourth quarter report on Oct 26.  
"
2954,SBUX,"At the moment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is 48 cents per share, which is up approximately 14.3% from 3 months ago.  
"
2955,SBUX,"There's a similar pattern for annual earnings estimates as well. Specifically, the company has experienced a little upward movement in the past 30 days, but a much sharper advance over the past 3 months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal year ended last month is $1.66 per share, or nearly 13% higher than 90 days ago.   
"
2956,SBUX,"The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal year ending September 2012 has actually surged more than 20% in that time to $2.63, which also suggests year-over-year profit improvement of 58.4%.   
"
2957,SBUX,"The catalyst for this upward momentum was its fiscal third-quarter report from late July, where earnings per share of 49 cents topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by more than 36%. Net sales soared 127% year over year to $717.2 million, thanks in large part to (you guessed it) the Keurig Single-Cup Brewing System.  
"
2958,SBUX,"Green Mountain Coffee Roasters took a lot of initiative to increase awareness of the system, and it seems to have worked as nearly 82% of sales in the quarter came from Keurig and its recurring portion pack sales. Read more on the quarter here.  
"
2959,SBUX,"As the linked articles above describe, GMCR is not without its challenges in this highly competitive, coffee crazy world. For example, last week's drop in share price can be traced to concerns of patent expirations and accounting issues.  
"
2960,SBUX,"For the moment though, the company seems to have the wind at its back, which drove it toward the apex of the Zacks #1 Rank Top Performers List on Monday. 
"
2961,SBUX,"Have you looked at darling high-flyer Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR) lately? The stock has been thrashed this week, losing over 20% while the broad market has continued its steady rally.
"
2962,SBUX,"The reason? A bear raid after hedge fund manager and activist investor David Einhorn gave a lengthy and detailed presentation on October 17 at the Value Investing Conference about why the maker of the Keurig single-cup coffee wizard was a short.
"
2963,SBUX,"His main points in the 110-slide PowerPoint attack revolved around patent expirations and accounting issues -- to say nothing of a 50+ P/E multiple, using 2011 EPS of $1.60 and a stock price of $90, about where GMCR was the day of Einhorn's eulogy.
"
2964,SBUX,"A Bear Case
"
2965,SBUX,"I will relate a little of Einhorn's perspective. Obviously I can't begin to do justice to his massive research here, which you can find links to on The Wall Street Journal's Deal Journal blog.
"
2966,SBUX,"Basically he sees that once GMCR's patents for it's K-Cup coffee system start to fall away in September 2012, other bigger competitors like Kraft (KFT) and Sara Lee (SLE) will enter the market. 
"
2967,SBUX,"The accounting issues are, as you would expect, more complicated and subject to interpretation. I didn't look into the details in Einhorn's slides, but I'm guessing he does since the cover slide is titled ""GAAP-uccino"" with a picture of some foamy (frothy?) caffeinated brew. There's gotta be some choice bean-counting jokes in there too somewhere, right?
"
2968,SBUX,"A Bull Case
"
2969,SBUX,"Green Mountain has been preparing for these patent expirations for years. First, they made deep penetration into American homes and, second, they just inked deals with Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) and Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) for co-marketing of all things K-Cup.
"
2970,SBUX,"Rick Aristotle Munarriz, writing for The Motley Fool the day after Einhorn's roasting of the bean roaster, notes that the company estimates there's a Keurig in 8% to 10% of US homes. He then lays out this logic...
"
2971,SBUX,"""Green Mountain estimates that 25% of the coffee makers sold in this country were K-Cup brewers. In other words, Green Mountain will continue to gobble up more than 10% of the home market as older coffee machines break down or simply get replaced.
"
2972,SBUX,"It gets better.
"
2973,SBUX,"Green Mountain's java brewer sales are growing considerably faster than the other 75%, so it would be premature to even call 25% the ceiling here.""
"
2974,SBUX,"Munarriz is making the case that could sustain GMCR's optimistic earnings outlook. Speaking of said future earnings power, GMCR is a Zacks #1 Rank stock (strong buy) because of the following growth picture...
"
2975,SBUX,"Based on the above earnings growth and momentum, GMCR has a 25 forward P/E multiple. Not bad for a high-growth company with unique and popular brands.
"
2976,SBUX,"Einhorn argues that the Starbucks deal is better for the mermaid than the K-Cup. He thinks the company is fairly valued at $35 to $40.
"
2977,SBUX,"I'm arguing that until this fundamental battle is sorted out, you can buy the stock anywhere below its 200-day moving average at $75 down to support at $65 (my black line) and make some money on short-term bounces. This bull/bear battle spells lots of swing trade opportunities to me. 
"
2978,SBUX,"Big Macs and Burritos Aren't Trivial Fast Food
"
2979,SBUX,"While we are looking at essential food groups like coffee, I can't help but mention the earnings monsters Chipolte Mexican Grill (CMG  -  Free Report) and McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report). Mickey Dee's came out with a solid EPS and revenue beat on the back of better than expected same-store sales growth. Stock marked a new 52-week high above $92.
"
2980,SBUX,"And CMG was able to offset the rise in input costs through increased traffic and price increases, helping it come ahead of earnings and revenue expectations. That gave it a $20+ (7%) pop that put some pain on the bears who sold it down all week.
"
2981,SBUX,"Here's a fun trivia question about these two that I was curious about: Does MCD still own any of CMG? Take a guess without looking it up. It surprised me to see when they full divested and at what price.

"
2983,SBUX,"The restaurant industry is finally showing improvements and seems poised for long-term growth. Riding on the back of a slowly reviving U.S. economy and the consequent rise in comparable-store sales, restaurant operators have managed to post improved results in recent months. We expect restaurant companies to continue delivering better numbers in the upcoming quarter over the year-earlier period.
"
2984,SBUX,"In second quarter 2011, most big names in the industry outperformed the Zacks Consensus estimates. More good news came from the NPD foodservice market research report, which stated that annual visits to restaurants are expected to increase by 8% over the next ten years.
"
2985,SBUX,"A recent survey by the National Restaurant Association revealed that the Restaurant Performance Index (RPI), measuring the health and outlook on the U.S. restaurant industry, was 99.9 in May, down 1.0% from April. The slowdown in May was temporary.
"
2986,SBUX,"For the first time in six months, the RPI stood below 100 in the month. The RPI run-rate in the last six months connotes improvements in same-store sales and customer traffic.
"
2987,SBUX,"The Current Situation Index, which measures comparable-store sales, traffic counts, labor costs and capital expenditures in the restaurant industry was 99.2 in May, down 1.1% from April. The Expectations Index, which measures restaurant operators’ six-month outlook on the above indicators, stood at 100.6, down from 101.5 in the prior month. Restaurant operators’ capital spending plans are also on the rise, reaffirming their optimistic outlook on the industry.Going Forward
"
2988,SBUX,"Looking ahead, we see solid top-line trends. We believe well-positioned companies will drive above-average traffic trends and enjoy pricing power, leading to same-store sales increases in 2011. The economy is continuing to improve, albeit at a modestly lower rate, but a sluggish labor market, over-supply of restaurants in the industry, higher gasoline prices and food cost inflation may weigh on industry profitability.
"
2989,SBUX,"Restaurants have been trying to win back cash-conscious guests by revamping promotions, offering discounts and focusing on value-for-meal menus. However, the tendency to offer discounts has been moderating. We remain cautiously optimistic over the near-to-medium term, with consumers continuing to look for value, distinct dining experiences, as well as convenience and enhanced menu deals in a gradually improving economic backdrop.Drivers of the Restaurant Industry
"
2990,SBUX,"The U.S. restaurant industry consists of Quick Service Restaurants (QSR), Midscale Restaurants, Casual Dining, Non-Commercial and Fine Dining/Upscale restaurants.
"
2991,SBUX,"In the midst of what is considered to be a moderate recovery, there are three potential drivers of net income growth for the restaurant industry: unit expansion, same-store sales, cost-containment efforts and marketing tools.Unit Expansion: Emerging from a lackluster economy, most of the companies have accelerated their pace of restaurant openings. With the expected recovery in consumer confidence, companies are turning back to unit expansion, though not aggressively.BJ's Restaurants Inc. ([url=https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/bjri]BJRI[/url]) plans to open 12 to 13 restaurants in fiscal 2011 compared with 10 restaurants in fiscal 2010. In the long run, there still exists room to open at least 300 outlets. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. ([url=https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/cmg]CMG[/url]) plans to open 135–145 new restaurants in 2011, maintaining a growth rate of 13%.
"
2992,SBUX,"In fact, the companies are set to explore international markets. While Chipotle is primarily concentrating on European countries including U.K., Germany and France, Buffalo Wild Wings Inc. ([url=https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/bwld]BWLD[/url]) will expand its overseas footprint by opening more than 50 company-owned and franchised restaurants in Canada over the next 5 years. Another restaurant, P.F. Chang's China Bistro Inc. ([url=https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/pfcb]PFCB[/url]) has also eyed the Canadian market.Darden Restaurants Inc. ([url=https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/dri]DRI[/url]) announced a formal area development agreement with Americana Group to spread its operations in the Middle East. Several food chains including Denny's Corp. ([url=https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/denn]DENN[/url]), Pollo Tropical of Carrols Restaurant ([url=https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/tast]TAST[/url]) and Starbucks Corporation ([url=https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/sbux]SBUX[/url]) intend to tap the fast-growing Indian market.McDonald’s Corp. ([url=https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/mcd]MCD[/url]) and Yum! Brands Inc. ([url=https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/yum]YUM[/url]) already have considerable coverage in India. Companies like Yum! Brands and McDonald’s are aggressively expanding in China to capitalize on the fast-paced economic growth in Asia.Same-Store Sales: The second driver consists of menu price increases and traffic counts. Restaurant operators reported positive same-store sales and customer traffic growth in recent months. Growth in menu price has accelerated, as per figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Cost-Containment Efforts: Some cost cuts have been achieved through integrated information systems, including point-of-sale, automated kitchen display, labor-scheduling and theoretical food cost systems.Marketing Tools: Social media as a marketing tool has created ripples in the industry. As per National Restaurant Association, 8 out of 10 operators support the view that social media will become an important marketing tool in the future. Hence, they are likely to incorporate Facebook, online review sites, Twitter and blogs into their marketing mix over the next two years.
"
2993,SBUX,"OPPORTUNITIES
"
2994,SBUX,"With the economic outlook improving, the fortunes of a number of industry players have turned around. These companies promise long-term growth opportunities:Buffalo Wild Wings ([url=https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/bwld]BWLD[/url]) offers investors one of the strongest growth stories in this space. Buffalo Wild Wings had also been able to consistently deliver positive comps during the height of market turmoil.
"
2995,SBUX,"With consistent earnings and a healthy balance sheet, McDonald’s ([url=https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/mcd]MCD[/url]) provides relative safety and moderate growth opportunities in the current scenario, as well as exposure to faster-growing international markets. McDonald’s U.S. comparable-store sales have been showing continued uptrend since the last few months on strong sales of beverage as well as core menu products.
"
2996,SBUX,"Boasting a unique position in the hyper-competitive bar and grill segment, yet another stock, BJ’s Restaurants ([url=https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/bjri]BJRI[/url]) offers investors a strong growth story with a viable business strategy and debt-free balance sheet. The company delivered impressive second quarter results in terms of earnings per share and same-store sales growth.Improved Californian Market
"
2997,SBUX,"The core California market, which was badly hit by the recession resulted in a high rate of unemployment and weak consumer confidence, has started to turn around. We see plenty of growth opportunities in the California and Texas markets. BJ’s Restaurants and Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc. ([url=https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/rrgb]RRGB[/url]) are expanding rapidly in California.Job Growth in the Sector
"
2998,SBUX,"The restaurant industry is the major contributor to job growth in the U.S. According to the National Restaurant Association, Texas and Florida will likely show the strongest job growth over the next 10 years.Remodels and Menu Innovations Remain Key to Success
"
2999,SBUX,"Additionally, restaurants are accessing different means to plug the problems of heightened competition in a somewhat over-supplied domestic market. Companies continue to reduce their energy consumption and are remodeling their restaurants to give an up-market feel. They are rolling out new, smaller prototypes to augment the perception of value and drive traffic thereby reducing construction and occupancy costs to enhance returns on capital.
"
3000,SBUX,"While Darden has embarked on an extensive remodeling plan for its core brands like Olive Garden and Red Lobster to spur their same-store sales, Chipotle Mexican Grill is introducing typical Southeast Asian cuisine coupled with naturally raised food, for which it is well known.
"
3001,SBUX,"The introduction of small plates or individual appetizers by several chains such as California Pizza Kitchen, BJ's Restaurants and Buffalo Wild Wings has already tasted success. Limited Time Offers are also on the rise following the success of Buffalo Wild Wings and Red Robin Gourmet Burgers.Franchise-Driven Business Model
"
3002,SBUX,"Most of the companies are transforming to more a franchise-centric model to reduce the volatility in earnings and increase cash flow generation. However, Panera Bread Co. ([url=https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/pnra]PNRA[/url]) is slightly more inclined toward company-owned unit openings, which speaks to  the company’s fundamental strength and makes us optimistic on the stock.Breakfast Menus a Key Driver
"
3003,SBUX,"Breakfast has accounted for nearly 60% of the U.S. restaurant industry and remains a key driver of traffic growth in recent years. Over the past five years, morning meal traffic has increased at an average rate of 2% per year, while lunch visits were flat, and supper traffic declined 2% per year on average.
"
3004,SBUX,"We can thereby conclude that growth potential remains mainly in the QSR markets. Leveraging the trend, The Wendy's Company ([url=https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/wen]WEN[/url]) has expedited its breakfast menu in different markets. The company targets to have about 1,000 restaurants serving its new breakfast by the end of this year.
"
3005,SBUX,"According to an analysis by NPD, which has a ten-year projection of foodservice trends based on aging, population growth and trend momentum, servings of breakfast sandwiches are projected to outpace the industry’s growth forecast. Annual servings per capita of breakfast sandwiches at foodservice are expected to jump from 11 in 2004 to 14 in 2019.
"
3006,SBUX,"Currently, there are a number of stocks in the restaurant industry universe with a Zacks #2 Rank (short-term Buy rating). These include BJ’s Restaurants, Buffalo Wild Wings, Chipotle, Darden and McDonald’s.WEAKNESSES
"
3007,SBUX,"Higher Food and Gasoline Prices
"
3008,SBUX,"Food costs account for about one-third of restaurant sales. Wholesale food prices have been on the rise this year. Prices of corn, wheat, coffee and other commodities have also trended up, mainly due to a decline in the U.S. and Russian production prospects, compelling many restaurants to raise prices on some of their products.
"
3009,SBUX,"The companies are expecting industry-wide increases in commodity and energy costs for fiscal 2012 as well. Dairy and beef prices witnessed a steep rise on a year-over-year basis.
"
3010,SBUX,"With more expensive food and a spike in gasoline prices, people will have less disposable income and will prefer to dine at home. In our opinion, most of the restaurants will try to safeguard their margins by passing the cost increases to consumers. While big and established chains like McDonald's, Yum! and Starbucks will survive the price increases due to their broad customer base and larger economies of scale, smaller chains will feel the heat of rising commodity costs.Steep Competition and Promotional Offers
"
3011,SBUX,"Competition among casual dining restaurants is expected to remain fierce with respect to price, service, location and concept in order to drive traffic. The environment is still value-sensitive. High discount rates applied to menu prices in order to battle difficult economic conditions are resulting in price wars among competitor companies.
"
3012,SBUX,"Hence, the failure of any promotional offer will put pressure on the company’s same-restaurant sales growth. Dishes featured in the Olive Garden promotion from February to May failed to be accretive to Darden’s growth, for instance.Shutdown of Regional Restaurant Chains
"
3013,SBUX,"A large number of independent U.S. restaurant units fell victims to the downturn, while chain restaurants did relatively better. Large national chains, which attract mainly higher-income visitors, are performing better than regional restaurants as upscale-customers are recovering faster than the lower-income group.Lag in Traffic Growth Barring Fast Casual Restaurants
"
3014,SBUX,"According to a recent NPD foodservice market research report, visits to the leading fast casual restaurant chains grew 17% over the last three years while the rest of the industry experienced its steepest traffic declines. However, fast casual unit availability increased 12% since 2007.
"
3015,SBUX,"Visits to the leading fast casual restaurant chains like Chipotle and Panera were up 6% for the year ending December 2010 versus a year ago. This compares with a 1% decline in total industry visits for the same time period.
"
3016,SBUX,"Given the lack of overall earnings catalysts, it is difficult to be enthusiastic about a number of restaurant stocks. There are still quite a few names that lack the earnings catalysts of their better positioned peers. These include Brinker International Inc. ([url=https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/eat]EAT[/url]), Yum!, The Cheesecake Factory Inc. ([url=https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/cake]CAKE[/url]), Einstein Noah Restaurant Group Inc. ([url=https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/bagl]BAGL[/url]) and Domino's Pizza Inc. ([url=https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/dpz]DPZ[/url]), all of which retain the Zacks #3 Rank (short-term Hold). Jamba Inc. ([url=https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/jmba]JMBA[/url]) and Denny’s ([url=https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/denn]DENN[/url]) retain the Zacks #4 Rank (short-term Sell).Conclusion
"
3017,SBUX,"The restaurant industry is not immune to uncertainties in the macro economy. Companies appear to be in a good position to take advantage of an improved economy as evident from their capital budgets. Easy comparisons from the prior year will likely place this year's performance in a favorable light.
"
3018,SBUX,"On the consumer front, while they were previously struggling to survive in a recessionary environment, they are now grappling with steeply rising commodity costs, a still-high unemployment rate and dreary wage gains. These factors are expected to continue weighing on their spending behavior. In our opinion, a set of focused efforts will help restaurant companies operate with a cautiously optimistic outlook in 2011.
"
3019,SBUX,"Global coffee giant Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) is the latest conglomerate to announce a new business initiative that will utilize one of the hottest technologies of the moment: artificial intelligence (AI). And in this instance, Starbucks hopes to use AI to get you to buy even more coffee.Called the Digital Flywheel Program, Starbucks will implement AI technology in its popular Starbucks Rewards members’ accounts, considering factors like order history, current weather conditions, time of day, whether it’s a weekend or a workday, and even if it’s a customer’s birthday in order to make drink and food suggestions.The technology will also introduce new ways for Starbucks customers to order. According to the company’s global chief strategy officer Matthew Ryan, the Starbucks mobile app will start to integrate ""real-time triggers and push notifications to engage customers more deeply, building on the momentum that is generating the higher spend per members,” he said during an earnings call on July 27. This means that Rewards members could order from a push notification on their smartphone or through a text message if they are near a Starbucks location.In an interview with The Street, Brian Solis, principal analyst and futurist at Altimeter said that, “Starbucks is one of the best companies in the world that connects brand, user and consumer experience between digital mobile and the real world…They are still pushing forward, rolling out their Digital Flywheel strategy to be more dynamic to further integrate digital and real world.""Starbucks’ mobile growth has surged in recent years, and in particular, mobile ordering has been steadily on the rise. Last week, the company reported that in U.S. company-operated stores, Mobile Payment increased to 30% of transactions, while Mobile Order and Pay increased to 9% of transactions. Starbucks Rewards is growing just as fast, and this past quarter membership gained 8% year-over-year to 13.3 million active members; the program represented 36% of U.S. company-operated sales.Coupled with this growth projectory, adding the use of AI technology is a smart move for Starbucks. It’s clear that more and more customers are becoming Rewards members and using their smartphones to pay for their coffee drinks; artificial intelligence and Digital Flywheel could very easily push both divisions even higher, spurring more spontaneous coffee purchases or adding in more food items that customers normally wouldn’t consider.SBUX is hovering just above the flat mark in afternoon trading, and has lost about 2.7% in value year-to-date.More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like RunDid you miss Apple's 9x stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

"
3020,SBUX,"Banks stocks have been unenthusiastic participants in the current market rally, lagging the gains made by the broad market. Shares of the 8 largest financial institutions pulled back 1.7% last week even as the S&P 500 gained roughly 2%. They have gained about a third of what the broader market has gained in the last 12 weeks and are down roughly 4% on the year, compared to a roughly 4% gain for the S&P 500.  
"
3021,SBUX,"What accounts for this underperformance, particularly following the release of the Basel III minimum capital requirements? Despite its decline due to the financial crisis, finance is still a component of the overall market, accounting for roughly a sixth of the S&P 500's earnings next year. It is the second largest sector, behind only tech, in terms of market capitalization. As such, the financials' non-participation puts a question mark over the sustainability of the current rally. Clarity on Capital Requirements
"
3022,SBUX,"The Basel III capital requirements are no doubt a net positive for the group. Not only are the minimum requirements essentially in line with what the market was expecting, but they also follow a much more favorable timeline before coming into effect.  
"
3023,SBUX,"With a long lead time before their full implementation (complete standards don't take effect until 2019), all the financial institutions have plenty of time to meet the requirements through organic capital creation means, without needing to raise fresh capital.  
"
3024,SBUX,"While some issues still remain, particularly for the very large financial institutions, the market has a fairly good baseline view of the group's minimum capital requirements going forward. At current levels, all of the major U.S. financial institutions remain over capitalized. Some estimates put the extent of overcapitalization for the large-cap banks at close to 20% of their current market values. With visibility on the capital requirements being an issue, a key remaining source of uncertainty for the market is clarity on what these companies would do with the excess capital. Returning Excess Capital to Shareholders  
"
3025,SBUX,"Dividends have historically been a key part of the financials' attractiveness  dividend yields for the large-cap banks averaged in excess of 3% for most of the last decade. At present, they remain at less than half of the S&P 500's average of about 2%. As such, the group remains unattractive to its traditional core shareholder base of income investors, for whom dividends were the primary motivation to be in this sector. Historically, financials have been right there with telecom services and utilities as major dividend-paying sectors.  
"
3026,SBUX,"As the market gets comfortable with the idea of financials returning their excess capital to shareholders through dividends and/or share buybacks, these stocks will start getting their much needed appreciation. And we have been hearing that a number of these firms are thinking along those lines. JP Morgan (JPM) and US Bancorp (USB) recently stated that they consider dividends as a priority going forward.  
"
3027,SBUX,"My sense is that we should start hearing more about dividends from these firms in the coming quarters. A lead by someone like JPM would prompt everyone else to follow. How much of a big deal would dividend announcements from these firms be?  
"
3028,SBUX,"I think it will be big catalyst not just for the group, but the entire market. The current average payout ratio (the percentage of earnings paid out as dividend) is 7% for the 8 largest U.S. financial institutions. This compares to a historical average in the 35% to 40% range. So, even a very conservative ramp up to the 25% - 30% range would be a huge payout boost. At a 25% payout ratio of next year's Zacks Consensus Estimates for these 8 large firms, the dividend yield would increase to close to 3%. That type of payout is clearly on the conservative side, given the current profitability expectations for these firms.   Improving Operating Environment 
"
3029,SBUX,"Basel III capital requirements followed the passage of the comprehensive financial overhaul legislation in the U.S. While a number of the details still need to be worked out, the overall fog of uncertainty that weighed on the group following the financial downturn has essentially lifted. We have a fairly good idea of the type of regulatory landscape that these firms will be operating in. And that clarity is a net positive, particularly from where we have been in the recent past.  
"
3030,SBUX,"The outlook for the broader economy has also improved, with the lower odds of a fresh recessionary downturn. Of course, issues related to credit quality haven't fully been worked out, but the worst is behind us and we are in a reconstruction phase now. While the group is certainly not completely out of the woods yet, they are in much better shape at present than has been the case in the last three years. Portfolio Update 
"
3031,SBUX,"We made a total of eight changes to portfolios last week; adding three and deleting five stocks. There were changes to the Timely Buys list as well.  
"
3032,SBUX,"We added two stocks to the Focus List: LDK Solar Company (LDK) and PetSmart (PETM). LDK Solar is a Chinese manufacturer of photovoltaic products, which puts it at the beginning of the supply chain for the solar industry. The stock's eye-popping performance today (up 18%) followed the announcement of a major award by the Chinese government.  
"
3033,SBUX,"PetSmart is a niche retailer with a solid margins and earnings outlook. While we are wary of the consumer sector in general, pet retailing has a number of defensive characteristics going for it.  
"
3034,SBUX,"On the Growth & Income portfolio, we added Telus Corp. (TU  -  Free Report), a Canadian telecom services operator. The company has a solid earnings outlook and pays out a very attractive dividend, currently yielding 5%.   
"
3035,SBUX,"All five deletions were from the Focus List, with three as a result of Zacks Rank downgrades. These three were Amphenol Corp. (APH  -  Free Report), MKS Instruments (MKSI  -  Free Report) and Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report). The discipline of the Zacks Model required us to exit these three stocks, as they dropped to a Zacks #4 Rank ('sell').  
"
3036,SBUX,"As for the other two deletions, we dropped SanDisk (SNDK) to get ahead of what we perceive will be significant estimate revisions in the coming days. All leading indicators show inventory build in the supply chain, which hasn't fully shown up in estimates yet.  
"
3037,SBUX,"And we also exited Dr. Pepper Snapple Group (DPS) to lock in our gains given expectations of a relatively soft environment for the firm. We like the Dr. Pepper story and wouldn't mind revisiting it at a later date. But we had a more than 60% gain in this stock, and we thought that cashing in was a better alternative than potentially endangering it.  
"
3038,SBUX,"The fiscal year of Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) ends this month, and it's been a pretty good time for the coffee staple of late with its turnaround plan really taking hold.  
"
3039,SBUX,"However, earnings estimate revisions have been rather tame for a while, so at the moment SBUX is stuck with a Zacks #3 Rank ('hold').  
"
3040,SBUX,"Actually, 'rather tame' just doesn't cut it. The fact of the matter is that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this fiscal year has improved by a rollicking one cent in the past 2 months to $1.24 per share from $1.23. However, the revisions for next year have doubled that pace, soaring 2 cents to $1.42 per share from $1.40.  
"
3041,SBUX,"There was a lot to like in the company's fiscal third quarter report from July, including year-over-year advances in EPS and revenue, a significant increase in store traffic and, in a separate announcement, an enhancement in its quarterly divided by 30%.  
"
3042,SBUX,"But earnings per share of 29 cents only matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate, which broke a five-quarter streak of positive earnings surprises. Plus, its EPS outlook of $1.22 to $1.23 wasn't good enough for many analysts.  
"
3043,SBUX,"To learn more about this quarter, read Starbucks Meets, Remains Optimistic.  
"
3044,SBUX,"But Starbucks, which has been on the Focus List since May 12, made up a lot of ground in fiscal 2010 and is looking forward to more of the same as it prepares to a new year. Viva VIA!
"
3045,SBUX,"Starbucks VIA® represents the most significant marketing investment in the company's history. The product is only about a year old, but SBUX announced last month that it has already surpassed $100 million in sales in the U.S.  
"
3046,SBUX,"Now, the company is making a move to increase its market share in the global instant coffee market by expanding distribution of Starbucks VIA Ready Brew into Japan, Canada and the U.K., adding 13,000 distribution points and making it available at 55,000 locations globally. 
"
3047,SBUX,"Out of those three countries, Japan may be considered the most significant. More than 60% of all coffee sold in that country is of the instant variety. Starbucks VIA Coffee Essence has been available in Japan through Starbucks stores since April, where it has sold 10 million sticks. Now it will be available in more than 11,000 grocery and convenience stores.   
"
3048,SBUX,"Starbucks has been doing a number of things lately to improve its position in an increasingly competition industry, including offering Wi-Fi access across its stores. Also, its Seattle's Best brand, which it bought in 2003, is now available in 30,000 locations. Fiscal 2011 
"
3049,SBUX,"During its fiscal third quarter report, Starbucks initiated an EPS outlook of between $1.36 and $1.41 for fiscal 2011. As mentioned above, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the period is $1.42 right now, a couple pennies better than 2 months ago but 14.5% ahead of what's expected for this fiscal year. 
"
3050,SBUX,"SBUX reiterated that outlook in mid August when commenting on coffee commodity fluctuation. As you probably already know, coffee commodity prices are higher than they've been in more than a decade, and several coffee companies have decided to raise their prices to compensate.  
"
3051,SBUX,"For the moment though, Starbucks has no plans to hike its prices. In fact, it will take 4 cents per share in additional commodity costs during the fiscal year ending September 2011, due mainly to these higher prices.

3053,SBUX,"Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) has decided to close all 379 stores of its Teavana chain over the coming year. Shares of Starbucks were falling 9% in morning trading on Friday.CEO Kevin Johnson cited declining foot traffic in malls as the reason for the closure, which are the main location for Teavana stores. “We felt it was an appropriate time to take the decision and begin shutting down those stores,” he said.The coffee giant acquired the U.S. tea chain in 2012 for $620 million, when then-CEO Howard Schultz cited the expanding tea market as an appealing place for growth. However, Starbucks reported disappointing revenue and comparable sales growth on Thursday in its third quarter earnings report with the Teavana chain partially to blame.“Following a strategic review of the Teavana store business, the company concluded that despite efforts to reverse the trend through creative merchandising and new store designs, the underperformance was likely to continue,” Starbucks said in a press release.The popular tea retailer DavidsTea (DTEA  -  Free Report) is up 9% in morning trading following Teavana closures. The Canadian company has come out strong since its IPO two years ago, with a total of 232 stores in the U.S. and Canada.While DavidsTea does have mall-based locations, the company doesn’t restrict itself like Teavana does. This versatile strategy may have helped the company increase its sales by 9.4% during its first quarter of 2017.Teavana has also had little success competing with Argo Tea for the last few years. Since 2003, when the company opened its first store in Chicago, Argo Tea has operated dozens of tea cafes across the U.S. When Starbucks bought Teavana, the company planned to open similar tea bars across the country.While Argo Tea initially worried, Starbucks’ experiment failed. It opened its first of five Teavana tea bars in 2013. However, by early 2016, Starbucks gave up on developing its smaller brand stores, deciding to focus its tea products into its existing Starbucks locations.The Teavana store closures follow news that Starbucks will purchase the remaining 50% stake in its East China joint venture for about $1.3 billion. The company is committed to operating 5,000 Starbucks stores in Mainland China by 2021, cementing Starbucks’ future as a mainly coffee-based business.Most Teavana stores will close by spring 2018. Starbucks will continue to sell Teavana drinks in its Starbucks stores as well as bottled Teavana drinks in grocery stores.

3055,SBUX,"Starbucks Corp. (SBUX  -  Free Report) continues to pressure its 52-week high as shares move into a consolidating pattern that frequently leads to a breakout. The key area has been tested twice in the last month, but shares have been unable to muster the strength to push higher. The MACD below the chart is bullish too, with the short-term moving average recently jumping ahead of its longer-term counterpart. Take a look below.

"
3057,SBUX,"Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 27, after the closing bell.The coffee chain giant’s earnings were in line with the analysts’ expectations in the last reported quarter. Starbucks met expectation in three of the trailing four quarters and delivered a positive earnings surprise in the quarter ending Sep 2016, with an average beat of 0.46%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderStarbucks’s operating fundamentals remain strong with solid global retail footprint, successful innovations, best-in-class loyalty program and digital offerings. Particularly, Starbucks is strengthening its portfolio with significant innovation in beverages and core food offerings.We expect Starbucks’ global comparable store sales or simply comps in the fiscal third quarter to be driven by significant menu innovations like introduction of a new fresh food concept, Mercato, in Chicago in April. The launch of the Midnight Mint Mocha Frappuccino, Emerald City Mule, Unicorn Frappuccino, and Cascara Lemon Sour is also likely to boost its revenue.Starbucks’ digital offering, Mobile Order and Pay, is also witnessing increased usage and could prove to be a key growth driver in the to-be-reported quarter as well as in 2017. Again, Starbucks introduced a new digital order manager or DOM in order to reduce traffic congestion during peak time. Addition of new restaurants, along with growth in Starbucks reward members, is expected to contribute to Starbucks’s revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter. The company had earlier revealed that it expects stronger revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by mid-single digit comps including accelerating comps in the U.S.The company remains focused on growing total G&A below the rate of revenue growth and core G&A at half the rate of revenue growth in the long run. In the last reported quarter, Starbucks had already achieved both targets. The trend is expected to follow in the fiscal third quarter as well.However, a challenging environment in the U.S. restaurant space might be a cause of worry for investors in the near term.That said, sales leverage from positive comps growth, with lower selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) and depreciation and amortization (D&A) expenses, is expected to boost Starbucks’s operating margins, thereby driving EPS growth.For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 55 cents a share, reflecting an increase of 12.2% year over year, while the consensus for revenues stands at $5.74 billion, implying 9.7% year-over-year growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Starbucks is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -1.82%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 54 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 55 cents.Zacks Rank: Starbucks currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Although a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Starbucks Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Starbucks Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Starbucks Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies you may want to consider from the Retail-Wholesale sector, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Tempur Sealy International, Inc.

3058,SBUX,"By now, we’ve probably all used some sort of mobile payment technology. Whether it’s using our smartphone to pay for coffee at Starbucks (SBUX) or transferring money through an app, this kind of monetary technology using our phone has fully integrated our lives.While tech giants like Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report)—PayPal owns the incredible popular app Venmo, which lets you easily send or request money—certainly dominate the industry here in the U.S., Chinese juggernauts Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) and Tencent (TCEHY  -  Free Report) are investing hundreds of millions of dollars into the space to help mobile payment technology grow and expand internationally, particularly in India.The mobile payments industry is quickly changing, and investors have taken notice. With this in mind, check out these three mobile payment technology stocks that show promise in this expanding industry.Square (SQ  -  Free Report)Helmed by Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) chief executive Jack Dorsey, Square provides payments and point-of-sale devices including hardware and software. The payments company began with its flagship white credit card reader, but has since expanded into chip cards and NFC payments as well as its Cash app that lets people pay each other back instantly.Square is a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, and its industry, Internet-Software, rests in the top 44% of all industries ranked on the Zacks Industry Rank. Square’s earnings growth for the rest of 2017 looks very promising. For the current quarter, the company expects year-over-year earnings growth of more than 164%. Revenues are projected to grow over about 31% in the same time period.For the current year, Square anticipates earnings growth of 161.25%. SQ has an average earnings surprise of nearly 59%, and beaten estimates for the past 4 consecutive quarters. Square reports its next quarterly earnings November 8 after the bell.Visa (V  -  Free Report)Visa operates the world’s largest retail electronic payments network, and is one of the most recognized global financial services brands. The company serves banks, merchants, consumers, businesses, and government entities, and helps facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information. Visa has been rapidly boosting its mobile payment offerings, and it’s easier than ever to add your Visa card to your payment-enabled mobile phone or device.Visa is a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank. Its Industry, Financial Transaction Services, sits in the top 37% of all industries ranked on the Zacks Industry Rank. Last quarter, Visa reported solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, with beats on both the top and bottom lines.Looking ahead, Visa’s earnings growth estimates look pretty promising, too.

3059,SBUX,"This morning's October non-farm payroll report was a tad weaker than expected on the headline basis, but the report's internals confirm the positive momentum that we have been seeing lately in a number of other economic readings.I view this report as modestly positive as it adds to the growing list of favorable economic readings that have effectively pushed recession fears to the sidelines. Beyond the U.S. shores, some light appears to have come out of the dark European clouds as well, with the Greek referendum apparently off the table and last week's Euro-zone deal back in play. All of this combined should put the market back on the October trend line before the Greece-inspired fears took hold.The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the creation of 80K jobs in October, modestly lower than the roughly 90K expectation. Private sector jobs totaled 104K, below the expected 120K level. We also have positive revisions to the prior two months, with 102K in net additions to the originally reported September and August numbers. The unemployment rate ticked down to 9% from 9.1%. Average work week remained unchanged, while average hourly earnings increased 0.2% after increasing at the 0.3% in September.If we step back from today's October jobs report and scan the broader economic landscape, we see a clear improving trend in economic readings over the last two months after a period of sub-par performance in the summer months. It is becoming obvious now that the U.S. economy lost momentum in the middle part of the year as it faced high oil prices and disruptions resulting from the Japan disaster. The acrimonious debt debate in the summer and the subsequent rating downgrade further damaged confidence in the recovery.But the economy made a decent turnaround in the third quarter as the restraining effects of those headwinds started to ease. We saw evidence of that not only in the third quarter GDP report, but also in the relatively high frequency measures of industrial production, consumer spending and labor market trends. Today's October jobs report builds on last month's positive reading and is broadly confirmatory of what we have been seeing lately in the weekly Jobless Claims data.The big-picture takeaway is that the economic recovery is back on track. This is a big improvement relatively to the double-dip recession fears that were so prevalent in August and September. But the reality is that this growth pace will do little to bring down the nation's very high unemployment rate. As welcome as monthly job gains in the 120K vicinity are, they are barely enough to meet the incremental additions to the labor market every month. We need significantly more monthly job additions to bring down the unemployment rate.In corporate news, Groupon (GRPN) shares make their public debut today after the company successfully priced its IPO at $20 a share late Thursday, above the expected $16-$18 range of just a few days back. This gives the company a market value of approximately $13 billion. On the earnings front, we had better-than-expected results from Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) after the close on Thursday. The company also announced a 31% dividend hike and added to its existing buyback program.RELATED ARTICLESISM Service Index DisappointsInitial Claims Fall Below Key 400K LevelADP Sees 110K Jobs Gained

"
3093,SBUX,"Given the popularity of coffee and coffee-related drinks today, it's sometimes hard to imagine that Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) ever fell on hard times. But a location on every other street corner doesn't always lead to success, especially in a difficult environment. In fact, the scaling-back of new store openings was one of the factors in the company's turnaround plan, and it seems to have worked.  
"
3094,SBUX,"SBUX was added to the Focus List on May 12, as it appears that this coffee giant has turned the corner. In its fiscal second-quarter report, the company announced a positive earnings surprise of practically 21% with revenue growth of 9%.

"
3095,SBUX,"This Zacks #2 Rank ('buy') company has experienced a few upward revisions of late, but with 21 total estimates for this fiscal year and next each, there has been little movement in the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, earnings estimates remain well above levels from 2 months ago in response to that quarterly announcement. Expectations for this fiscal year and next are at $1.23 and $1.40 per share, respectively, accounting for gains of 10.8% and 10.2%. (The company's fiscal year ends in September.)  
"

The move is designed to compete with McDonald's, which not only offers free Wi-Fi at many of its locations, but is also now a big player in coffee and direct competitor with SBUX due to its successful McCafe line. Starbucks will also be offering content exclusively for its customers through its own wireless network. Perrigo Company (PRGO  -  Free Report) is often mentioned in the various Targeted Recommendations articles that we produce every week. Well, that's going to happen when a company gains approximately 60% since joining the Focus List, which is exactly what this global healthcare supplier of over-the-counter and generic drugs has done since being added on Oct 14, 2009. That's the third highest positive change on the entire list. 
"
3097,SBUX,"The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this fiscal year, ending this month, is $2.78 per share, which is up nearly 7% from 2 months ago. Meanwhile, the outlook for next fiscal year, ending June 2011, has advanced by 8% in that time to $3.25 per share. PRGO is a Zacks #2 Rank ('buy') company.
