26,MKC,"Amid falling demand in their home market, U.S. automakers face a slowdown in the world's biggest automotive market, China, where General Motors (GM) sells more cars than it does in North America.XGeneral Motors has seen China sales slip 1.3% in the first seven months of 2017 compared with the same time a year ago. Ford's (F) sales in China have fallen 7% over the same period.Car sales are losing momentum in China, as in the U.S., following a torrid 2016 for both countries. The Chinese auto market is forecast to grow at a 7% compound annual growth rate through 2018 vs. 12% between 2009 and 2013, according to Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), which cited IHS Markit data. Stimulus measures in the form of tax incentives from the Chinese government have been pared back, denting demand.Among the Big Three U.S. automakers, GM has the most sales in China, where retail sales surged 7.1% last year to 3.9 million vehicles, accounting for nearly 39% of its total global sales of 10 million units, according to company filings.The auto giant established an early lead in the roaring Asian nation and recently marked 20 years in China through its joint ventures. Ford and Fiat Chrysler are far smaller players in that key emerging market, but are playing catch-up with some success.Ford grew wholesale deliveries in China 9.2% last year, to 1.27 million vehicles. That was 19% of its global total. Fiat Chrysler grew Chinese shipments 26.6% in 2016 to 176,000 vehicles, although China contributed a relatively modest 3.7% to total global shipments.Meanwhile, Tesla (TSLA) grew its Chinese revenues a whopping 234.4% in 2016 to $1.07 billion. That helped Chinese revenues rebound to 15.2% of total global revenues, after a big dip the previous year.For automakers, Chinese middle-class consumers' growing affluence and stronger demand for bigger and more expensive vehicles is helping to offset softer sales volumes. Hot demand for higher-margin SUVs is seeing them strengthen portfolios in that segment.The Cadillac XT5 luxury SUV and Buick Envision SUV are top sellers in China for GM this year. For Ford, the Edge, Lincoln MKC and Lincoln Navigator have been key for sales growth. Fiat Chrysler is pumping out three Jeep SUV models: the Cherokee, Renegade and all-new Compass.RELATED:Tesla, China Are Driving An 'Epic' Revolution In Auto Engineering

28,MKC,"McCormick (MKC) agreed to acquire Reckitt Benckiser Group's food business for $4.2 billion, adding French's mustard and Frank's RedHot sauce to its lineup of spices and seasonings.XThe deal brings a stable of well-known condiments to Sparks, Maryland-based McCormick. For Reckitt Benckiser, unloading the products continues an overhaul that began with an expansion into baby formula through the British company's acquisition of Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. for $16.6 billion.The transaction price equates to 20 times the division's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, ""which feels to us like a very high price for a U.S.-oriented ambient food business,"" James Edwardes Jones, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note. He expects the transaction to dilute RB's earnings per share by about 1%.The deal comes as speculation swirls about the next round of consolidation in the packaged-food business. In February, Kraft Heinz (KHC) was spurned in a blockbuster bid to take over Unilever (UL), the British-Dutch maker of Hellmann's mayonnaise and Knorr soup. In the aftermath, Unilever was cited by analysts as a possible bidder for the Reckitt business.Nestle SA, the world's largest food company, is also shaking up its portfolio. Under activist pressure to improve results, it's considering selling its U.S. candy operations. Investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management this week set its sights on Procter & Gamble (PG), the U.S. giant that competes with Unilever in personal care.Led by Chief Executive Officer Rakesh Kapoor, Reckitt said it was looking to unload its food business in April, when the Slough, England-based company described the division as ""non-core."" With 411 million pounds ($536 million) in sales last year, French's Foods accounted for 4% of Reckitt's total revenue.French's and Frank's RedHot will become McCormick's second- and third-largest brands, respectively, CEO Lawrence E. Kurzius said in a statement late Tuesday. McCormick's pro forma 2017 annual net sales are expected to be approximately $5 billion, with significant margin growth, according to the statement.In acquiring Reckitt's food business, McCormick faced a large group of potential rivals. Bloomberg reported in May that the sale was expected to draw interest from Post Holdings (POST) and Conagra Brands (CAG). Other possible bidders included JM Smucker (SJM), Campbell Soup (CPB), Pinnacle Foods (PF) and Ajinomoto, people familiar with the situation said at the time.In addition to selling yellow mustard and hot sauce, the division makes ketchup, onion flavorings and other products. Hot sauce will continue to see robust growth, with opportunities for expansion, McCormick said. The company said it plans to expand the global presence of Frank's RedHot and French's products, whose sales are now concentrated in the U.S.McCormick dates to 1889, when founder Willoughby McCormick began selling flavors and extracts door to door. The company went after another U.K. business in 2016, when it considered buying Premier Foods. But the suitor walked away from takeover talks in April of that year, saying that Premier was demanding too high a price. McCormick's Kurzius said at the time that Premier was just one of the company's M&A ideas.Credit Suisse Group AG is serving as the financial adviser to McCormick on the RB Foods transaction, and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP is legal counsel. Morgan Stanley acted as lead financial adviser to Reckitt and the company also received advice from Robey Warshaw.The deal is expected to be completed in the third or fourth quarter of McCormick's fiscal 2017, pending regulatory approvals. McCormick plans to fund the deal with a combination of equity and debt, and said it has obtained committed bridge financing.

30,MKC,"Stocks clocked out with healthy gains Tuesday, in a second session cut from the bullish weak-start/strong-finish pattern.The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.7% and broke an eight-session pullback, its longest string of daily declines in a half-decade. The S&P 500 chiseled a 0.7% gain and the Nasdaq climbed 0.6%. Small caps kept pace with the general action, leaving the Russell 2000 up 0.7%.Tuesday's moves showed the Dow and the S&P 500 finding support at their 50-day moving averages, although trading volume in both cases was weak. The Nasdaq rebounded from its 50-day line Monday and extended that gain Tuesday.Shipping fleets took the day's largest gain among industries, with Star Bulk Carriers (SBLK), Safe Bulkers (SB) and Golden Ocean Group (GOGL) all surging more than 9% on upgrades to overweight from Morgan Stanley.Seven Dow industrial stocks booked gains better than 1%. Apple (AAPL) led the group, popping 2% to a new high but remaining in a buy range above a 141.12 buy point in a three-weeks-tight pattern. Caterpillar (CAT), JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) were next in line.Amazon.com (AMZN) rose more than 1% during the session, as Stifel Nicolaus raised the stock's price target, to 1025, from 912, after the company reached a deal to buy Souq.com, reportedly one of the largest e-commerce operations in the Middle East.

31,MKC,"The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index surged to a 10-year high in December, as confidence in the outlook got a jolt from the presidential election and the subsequent stock-market rally.Economic Optimism rose 3.4 points to 54.8, the highest since November 2006, remaining above the neutral 50 level for the third straight month.While confidence in the economy had been on the upswing before the election, the surprise victory of Donald Trump, part of a clean sweep for Republicans, had a huge effect on Americans' economic expectations. The effect was far more positive than negative, but economic sentiment tends to be partisan, and that's never been more clear than in this month's poll.Optimism about the six-month economic outlook rocketed to 86.6 among Republicans from 50.9 just before the election, hitting the highest level since the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index was launched in 2001. Independents' view of the six-month outlook jumped 12.7 points to 58.5, highest since January 2004. But sentiment among Democrats plunged 32.1 points to 28.2, lowest since October 2008, just before Barack Obama was elected.Economic data have been trending positive, with the jobless rate sinking to 4.6% in November as the economy added 178,000 jobs. But no economic news has gotten as much attention as Trump's intervention last week that caused Carrier, a unit of United Technologies (UTX), to cancel plans to move an Indiana factory to Mexico.On Tuesday, Trump tweeted that he wants a Boeing (BA) order for new Air Force One planes canceled. Boeing shares fell 1.5% intraday, but closed up 8 cents at 152.24 on the stock market today.Before those events, Ford Motor (F) said it was calling off plans to shift production of the Lincoln MKC to Mexico from Louisville, Ky.IBD'S TAKE: Optimism is running high over Donald Trump's agenda of lower taxes and more infrastructure spending, yet there are three big factors that could limit what he can accomplish: 1) High deficits and strict budget rules; 2) A tight job market; and 3) A possibility of rising trade tensions that could backfire on U.S. employers.The Economic Optimism Index is a composite of three major subindexes that track views of near-term economic prospects, the outlook for personal finances over the coming six months and views of how well government economic policies are working.All three major subindexes rose this month.The six-month optimism gauge climbed 4.1 points to 56.3, a big recovery after sinking as low as 36.7 in July.The personal financial outlook index rose a modest 0.9 point to 59.8, but remained the highest of the three subindexes.The measure of confidence in federal economic policies got the biggest lift from the election, jumping 5.2 points to 48.3, highest since August 2007.Overall, economic optimism jumped 3.6 points to 55.6 among self-described investors, the highest since January 2007. Trump's agenda of cutting personal and corporate taxes, along with a burst of infrastructure spending, have helped fuel a stock market rally since Nov. 9. That rally, which has aided infrastructure-related firms over big-cap techs such as Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB), is both a reflection of and fuel for positive investor sentiment. Among non-investors, optimism rose 3.5 points to 54.1.Beyond the divergence in optimism along political lines, there were also clear differences along racial and geographic lines.Optimism fell 7.2 points to 51.2 among urban dwellers, while jumping 5.1 points to 54.9 among suburbanites and surging 11.7 points to 58.4 among rural dwellers.Optimism jumped 7.5 points to 56.3 among whites, while falling 8.8 points to 50.1 among blacks and Hispanics.The IBD/TIPP Poll of 902 Americans was conducted from Nov. 28-Dec. 4 via live interviews of people with landlines and cellphones. It has a margin of error of +/- 3.3 percentage points.RELATED:IBD/TIPP Poll: Economic Optimism IndexTrump Tweets: Japan's SoftBank To Invest $50 Billion In U.S.Trump Touts Carrier Deal, Says Companies Leaving U.S. Face 'Consequences'Tax Reform May Pit GOP Vs.

32,MKC,"President-elect Donald Trump reached a deal  late Tuesday with United Technologies (UTX) unit Carrier to keep nearly 1,000 jobs at an Indiana plant that had been scheduled to shift the work to Mexico.But it appears that Trump, who had made threats during the campaign, used a combination of carrots and sticks in his team's negotiations with United Tech.Carrier said late Wednesday that state incentives were an ""important consideration"":""Today's announcement is possible because the incoming Trump-Pence administration has emphasized to us its commitment to support the business community and create an improved, more competitive U.S. business climate. The incentives offered by the state were an important consideration.""The quasi-public Indiana Economic Development Corporation reportedly is offering modest tax breaks to Carrier. Tax breaks are an old staple for states and cities to attract and retain businesses and jobs, though critics say they often are not economically or fiscally sound.However, John Mutz, an ex-Indiana lieutenant governor who's on the IEDC, told Politico that Carrier had rejected a similar offer before. Mutz think that parent United Technologies is worried about losing big federal contracts. United Technologies' Pratt & Whitney jet engine unit has several defense-related pacts, for instance.Carrier tweeted late Tuesday that it would keep nearly 1,000 of the 1,400 jobs scheduled to be cut at itsIndianapolis plant. Carrier also is shifting some 600 jobs to Mexico from another Indiana plant.We are pleased to have reached a deal with President-elect Trump & VP-elect Pence to keep close to 1,000 jobs in Indy. More details soon.— Carrier (@Carrier) November 30, 2016Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is still Indiana governor and led the negotiations, will travel to the state Thursday to announce the deal, according to various reports. Trump alluded to a Thursday announcement in his own late Tuesday tweet.Big day on Thursday for Indiana and the great workers of that wonderful state.We will keep our companies and jobs in the U.S. Thanks Carrier— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2016Trump and Democratic contender Bernie Sanders made the Carrier plant a campaign theme after a smartphone video showed Carrier executives telling dismayed workers that they would lose their jobs. Trump said in April that he would threaten to slap a tax Carrier's Mexican goods and that would get instant results.United Technologies shares Wednesdsay briefly rose to 110, a 16-month high and breaking past a 109.52 buy point. But United Tech pulled back to close down 1% to 107.72 on the stock market today. United Tech rose fractionally in late trade following its after-hours disclosure.Trump had used his Twitter (TWTR) pulpit on Thanksgiving to announce that he was ""making progress"" on keeping the Carrier jobs in the U.S. The United Technologies unit said in response that it was in talks with the incoming administration.IBD'S TAKE: Donald Trump made a lot of promises during the campaign. Here's what President Trump could accomplish in his first 100 days.Earlier this month, Trump claimed on Twitter that he had persuaded Ford Motor (F) not to close a Kentucky plant. Ford later clarified that it had told Trump that it would not shift production of the MKC compact SUV from Kentucky to Mexico, but stressed that there were never any plans to shut the entire plant.Trump had singled out Ford during the campaign for its plans to move small car production to Mexico, though General Motors (GM) also has outsourced significant work south of the border.Could Apple (AAPL) be next? Trump has said he'll force Apple to make products at home. Foxconn, which makes millions of Apple iPhones in Asia, reportedly is exploring moving some iPhone production to the U.S. Apple may decide that shifting some assembly work to the U.S. may be worth getting out of Trump's cross hairs.Even before he takes office Trump is showing that he will personally target specific companies for praise or criticism over trade and jobs. That may worry big businesses in the public eye and raises concerns of crony capitalism and poorly designed tax breaks to win positive coverage. But if Trump can tout minor or symbolic wins to his supporters, he may not feel the need to rip up trade deals and engage in wholesale protectionism.RELATED:Trump Makes 'Progress' On Indiana Carrier Plant, Using Twitter Bully PulpitTax Reform May Pit GOP Vs.

EPS minus one-time items rose 11% to 49 cents, matching estimates and reversing from a miss the prior quarter.Paychex projects that total service revenue will increase 7% to 8% for the current fiscal year, and that net income will increase about 8%. Both forecasts topped analyst consensus.Shares climbed 6% to 59.50, shooting beyond buy range. Earlier this month, the stock broke out of a base with a 54.88 buy point.The spice maker's second-quarter adjusted earnings were flat, year over year, at 75 cents a share, topping analyst estimates by a penny. Meanwhile revenue grew 4% to $1.06 billion, more or less in line with views.For the year, McCormick expects $3.68-$3.75 in adjusted per-share profit and sales growth of 1%-3%, or 4%-6% minus foreign exchange rates.

67,MKC,"Luxury cars have been a spearhead in the auto industry's recent resurgence. That trend will continue, and sales of luxury cars in the U.S. will hit an all-time high this year, a new report said.Sales of pricey luxury vehicles were up 7.1% to 1.15 million vehicles for the year to date through the end of July, Ward's Auto said Monday.General Motors' (GM) Cadillac, Ford Motor's (F) Lincoln, and foreign brands like Tata Motors (TTM) Jaguar, BMW and Daimler's (DDAIF) Mercedes-Benz are expected to do well in the U.S. this year.

80,MKC,"McCormick & Co. (MKC), a maker of spices and other food products, has seen profits and revenue grow slowly but steadily in recent years, thanks mainly to overseas acquisitions.The stock has risen 26% this year, about double the S&P 500's increase. The company also offers a quarterly dividend of 34 cents a share, good for an annual dividend yield of 2.1%, in line with the S&P 500 average. McCormick has tripled the payout over 10 years.A check of the stock's chart shows that it's working on a flat base with a potential buy point at 66.47. It has been trading in a tight fashion and is just 4% below its all-time high as it gets support at its 50-day line.Profit for the fiscal third quarter that ended in November rose a better-than-expected 13% from a year earlier, improving on the prior quarter's 9% gain. Revenue rose 6%, the smallest increase in six quarters.While those figures are weak, the company's four-year earnings stability factor is 2 on a scale of 0 (most stable) to 99 (least stable). Profit continued to grow, on a quarterly and annual basis, through the 2008-09 recession.McCormick, whose many brands include Lawry's and Thai Kitchen, has been growing mainly through acquisitions in Europe and Asia. In August, the company said it would buy Chinese bouillon maker Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiments to expand in China. The deal is expected to close in 2013.Despite the acquisition spree, the company's debt-to-equity ratio stands at a manageable 64%.Zacks Equity Research said Dec. 19 that it's ""encouraged by the company's strong brand portfolio"" and its focus on ""enhancing its products to remain competitive."" It has a ""neutral"" rating on the stock.McCormick has raised prices and cut costs to help offset higher costs for wheat, onion and other raw materials. Its pretax margin of 13.5% last year was second highest in the 16-member Food-Miscellaneous Preparation industry group.McCormick's Accumulation-Distribution Rating is C+ and its up-down volume ratio is 1.4, indicating net positive demand for the shares.On the downside, McCormick's 79 Composite Rating ranks it third in a weak industry group.
"
81,MKC,"McCormick (MKC) hasn't missed a beat in its long, steady advance, even with the market locked in correction mode.The spice maker jumped to fresh all-time highs this week. You could interpret its move as a breakout past a 64.01 buy point from a flat base. It remains near that trigger, putting it in a potential buying range, though it's best not to buy during a correction.Daily turnover has been merely average so far this week, which isn't what you want to see with a breakout. But it's encouraging to see big upside volume for several sessions last week, as well as in the week ended Nov. 9.The Sparks, Md., company provides an annual dividend of $1.24 a share, which works out to an annualized yield of about 2%. McCormick has said it's in its 88th year of consecutive dividend payments.In the third quarter, McCormick lifted EPS 13%, ramping up from a 9% gain in Q2 and a 4% decline in Q1. Revenue grew 6%, decelerating from increases of 11% in Q2 and 16% in Q1.The stock doesn't offer powerful growth, but it does provide stability. The three-year and five-year EPS Stability Factors are both 2, close to the calmest-possible level of 0.McCormick has focused on innovation as a way to grow in a soft global economy, according to a September research note from Credit Suisse analysts.But how do you innovate in the centuries-old spice business? Well, the analysts point to new products like the Recipe Inspirations line.The analysts argue that in a tough economy, shoppers would rather not buy a half-dozen different large spice bottles to make one meal. They'd rather buy smaller amounts of the six spices needed, and that's what McCormick offers with its Chicken Tikka Masala product and other Recipe Inspirations offerings.""This product is the size of an index card and has blister packs for each spice,"" the analysts wrote. The company launched it in the U.S. in 2010, expanded to the U.K. and Canada last year, and has been rolling it out in 2012 in Australia, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal, according to Credit Suisse.

82,MKC,"Midcap stock McCormick's (MKC) chart is showing good action.In recent weeks, the stock has sketched a flat, base-on-base pattern. The potential buy point is 61.89.McCormick's base count remains first stage, according to MarketSmith's pattern recognition technology.And the stock has outperformed the market so far this year, gaining 22% vs. about 12% for the S&P 500.The good price performance developed despite a less-than-stellar fiscal 2011.In fiscal 2011 ended in November, spice maker McCormick had somewhat of a bipolar year.Earnings grew only 7%, the slowest in five years. However, revenue leapt 11%, the most in seven years.What happened?The company experienced a double-digit increase in raw material and packaging costs, which put downward pressure on profit as a percentage of sales.The product and segment mix also hurt earnings. Demand for lower-margin ingredients rose as demand for higher-margin branded food service products fell. Meanwhile, the lower-margin industrial segment expanded faster while the higher-margin consumer segment expanded more slowly.On the sales side, price increases were the chief drivers of the step-up in revenue.However, that was last year. How are things shaping up now?In fiscal Q2 ended in May, earnings advanced 9% as sales grew 11%.The 11% revenue growth came despite a 1.5% hit from foreign currency exchange rates. Acquisitions drove about half of the sales growth.Earnings benefited from the higher sales and cost savings.McCormick's long-term goals are to increase sales 4% to 6% and grow earnings per share 9% to 11%.The three- and five-year earnings stability factors are near perfect. Both are 2 on a scale of 0 (calm) to 99 (wild).The company has raised its dividend for 26 years in a row. During the past five years through 2011, the compounded annual growth rate in the dividend payout was 9.1%.McCormick's current yield is 2%.

83,MKC,"McCormick & Company Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report) posted solid second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, with earnings and revenues outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate, and improving year over year. The quarterly performance gained from the company’s effective product strategies leading to growth in the consumer business and flavor solutions segments.The company’s shares are up 2.4% in the pre-market trading session. However, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has declined almost 0.4% in the past three months against the industry’s growth of 2.3%. Coming back to results, adjusted earnings of $1.02 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents. Adjusted earnings were 24% higher year over year, owing to increased adjusted operating income and favorable impacts of currency rates.Revenues & ProfitsIn the quarter under review, McCormick, the global leader in flavors and spices, generated revenues of approximately $1,327.3 million, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,315 million. Revenues grew about 19% from the prior-year quarter, including a favorable 3% impact from currency. Encouragingly, the acquisition of Frank’s and French’s brand drove sales by 13%. On a constant currency basis, sales grew 16%.Gross profits in the second quarter surged 29.4% to $575.2 million.

On a constant currency basis, operating income increased 48%.McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | McCormick & Company, Incorporated QuoteSegment DetailsConsumer Business: Revenues grew 20% to $785.4 million. On a constant currency basis, sales improved almost 16%, primarily driven by growth in the Americas, the EMEA and the Asia/Pacific regions.Sales in the Americas, on a constant currency basis, was mainly driven by strong pricing actions and favorable impacts of volume/mix. On a constant currency basis, sales in the EMEA region also gained from growth in Frank's and French's, while sales in the Asia/Pacific region were driven by growth in China.Adjusted operating income in the consumer business segment grew 39.6% at constant currency, buoyed by increased sales, cost savings and favorable mix, which more than offset the negative impact of higher freight and brand marketing expenses.Flavor Solutions: Sales in the segment grew 18% from the prior-year quarter to $541.9 million. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 15% on improved performance in the Americas and the EMEA regions.Sales in the Americas on a constant currency basis gained from higher sales of flavors and continued growth momentum in branded foodservice. Sales in the EMEA region were partly driven by Frank's and French's brands. It was also backed by the impact from a global realignment of a major customer's sales from the Americas, partially offset by lower pricing. Sales in the Asia/Pacific region declined, due to the exit of lower margin business and lower pricing.Adjusted operating income at the flavor solutions segment surged 64% year over year on a constant currency basis, driven by favorable impact of higher sales, product mix and savings initiatives.Financial UpdateMcCormick exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalent of $202.6 million, long-term debt of $4,456.2 million and shareholders’ equity of $3,040.3 million.During the quarter, net cash provided by operating activities were $234.9 million, up 32.6% from $177.2 million in the prior-year quarter.

Moreover, the company is on track with its cost-savings initiatives under its CCI program and plans to achieve a target of $105 million in fiscal 2018.That said, the company expects sales to grow approximately 13-15% in fiscal 2018 from the previous projection of an increase of 12-14%. The raised view takes into consideration favorable impacts of 2 percentage points from currency fluctuations. Further, management expects sales during the fiscal year to gain from acquisitions, new products, expanded distribution network and brand marketing.Earnings for fiscal 2018 are expected in the range of $4.85-$4.95, reflecting considerable growth from the previous band of $4.80-$4.90 per share. The revised guidance depicts a growth of 14-16% from the prior-year quarter’s adjusted earnings of $4.26. This includes an expected positive impact of nearly one percentage point from currency fluctuations. Favorable currency impacts are projected during the first half of the fiscal.

85,MKC,"McCormick & Company, Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 28. The Midland-based company has a positive earnings surprise record for the trailing four quarters, with a 9.9% beat delivered in the last reported quarter. Let’s see what’s in store for McCormick this time around.What to ExpectThe current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 93 cents, which shows a 13.4% rise from 82 cents recorded in the year-ago period. The estimate has remained unchanged over the past 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.32 billion, up 18.1% from the year-ago reported figure. McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | McCormick & Company, Incorporated Quote Factors Driving the QuarterMcCormick has been gaining from its focus on buyouts, product innovations, cost-containment measures and efficient marketing initiatives. These factors contributed to its robust results, in the last reported quarter, helping the company keep its earnings and sales streak alive for the fifth and fourth consecutive time, respectively. Favorable currency translation drove top-line growth in the previous quarter, which is expected to remain for a while now.The company is on track with its Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program that aims at cost savings and increased efficiency. Savings from the CCI program are being used by the company toward increasing investment that will further drive profits and sales.Further, McCormick remains poised on strategic acquisitions that enhance its portfolio. The addition of Reckitt Benckiser (RBGLY  -  Free Report), including Frank's RedHot, French's Mustard and other well-known condiment brands into McCormick portfolio is likely to fuel the company’s performance.However, the company is exposed to higher raw material cost inflation. The company's profits are under threat due to the stiff competition it faces from its peers, which may compel it to lower prices. High marketing and freight expense are also significant concerns, although increase in brand expense is likely to be cushioned by the CCI program.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t show that McCormick is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

This combined with well-planned buyouts and effective three-year financial strategies have enabled the renowned marketer and distributor of food products to stay competitive and hold a leading market share.Soaring U.S. FoodservicesSysco boasts a strong U.S. Foodservice network, mainly stemming from surge in local case volumes within U.S. Broadline operations.

In this regard, Sysco closed its Kent Foods buyout deal during the third quarter and expects the same to bolster the U.K. and European business bandwagon. During the third quarter, the company concluded the acquisitions pertaining to Hawaii-based HFM FoodService and Louisiana-based Doerle Food Service. Incidentally, the HFM buyout aided the company’s U.S. Broadline operations in the said period.In prior developments, Sysco’s acquisition of London-based Brakes Group in July 2016 is noteworthy and management is well on track with its integration process.  Apart from these, the company’s buyout efforts include Supplies on the Fly, North Star Seafood, Gilchrist & Soames, as well as stakes in Mayca Distribuidores and Pacific Star Foodservice.  Strategies for 2020 Bode WellSysco is on track with its three-year financial goals which mainly focuses on enhancing consumers’ experience, optimizing business, stimulating power of its people and achieving operational efficiency. In this regard, the company is focused on enhancing assortments, making constant innovations, ensuring food safety and revitalizing brands. Further, to evolve with the changing consumers’ preferences, Sysco is committed toward investing in technology and enhancing e-commerce operations. Moreover, it plans to improve supply chain, increase transparency, enhance deliveries and manage product costs effectively.Driven by these strategies, the company witnessed local case growth and improved gross profit in the third quarter. Further, management believes that the company is well placed to achieve adjusted operating income improvement in the higher end of its targeted range of $600-$650 million.Final ThoughtsIn spite of the aforementioned growth drivers, Sysco has been witnessing year-over-year contraction in gross margin since the past three quarters, thanks to higher inbound freight costs. Driver availability challenges in the industry have led to increase in freight costs. Further, during the third quarter, the company’s U.S. Broadline operations were hurt by food cost inflation, while rising prices stemming from product costs and currency translations in the U.K. marred international segment performance. Persistence of such headwinds continues to be a threat to Sysco’s performance in the forthcoming periods. Notably, other consumer staples companies such as McCormick & Company (MKC  -  Free Report), Church & Dwight Co. (CHD  -  Free Report) and TreeHouse Foods (THS  -  Free Report) have also been struggling with higher commodity costs.On the bright side, we are impressed with Sysco’s acquisition and efficiency boosting strategies that have been yielding favorably. In fact, such aspects have raised investors’ optimism on this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, evident from its 16.4% rally in a year, while the industry fell 16%. Moreover, we are hopeful that Sysco’s cost-management strategies will offset the negative impacts stemming from cost-related hurdles in the forthcoming periods. With such positives embedded, Sysco is likely to continue in investors good books.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

87,MKC,"McCormick & Company Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report) has been faring well in the industry, buoyed by yielding buyouts and cost-containment efforts. This has aided year-over-year growth in top and bottom lines for more than a year now. Let’s now look into some of the factors that have been supporting this global leader in spices and seasonings, alongside analyzing the hurdles that have been denting performance.Acquisitions Provide Scope for Growth  Buyouts have been aiding McCormick to expand flavors business and reap grater profitability. The buyout of the food division of RB Foods in August 2017, is the largest deal by the company till date. With iconic brands like Frank's RedHot Sauce and French's Mustard, RB Foods is likely to continue as an asset for McCormick’s spices portfolio.The buyouts of RB Foods and Enrico Giotti SpA bolstered performances of consumer and flavor solutions units, driving sales by 12% during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Notably, a number of companies operating in the food industry such as TreeHouse Foods (THS  -  Free Report) and Sysco Corp. (SYY  -  Free Report) have also been resorting to strategic buyouts to widen prospects.Effective Cost ManagementMoving on, McCormick’s Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (“CCI”) program has been an aspect of cheer for a while. The program aids the company to focus on savings and enhance productivity. It has used CCI savings to increase investments, which lead to higher sales and profits.  Notably, cost savings from CCI improved the company’s gross and adjusted operating income margins during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.This also marked the company’s ninth consecutive quarter of adjusted operating income margin expansion. Further, the company projects adjusted operating income growth in the range of 23-25% in fiscal 2018, wherein it plans to achieve cost savings of $100 million.Resorting to cost-saving initiatives to induce efficiency is a common practice in the consumer staples space. For instance, Tyson Foods’ (TSN  -  Free Report) is on track with its Financial Fitness Program with the motive to induce supply-chain efficiencies, reduce overheads and fuel the bottom line. Tax Gains: A Joy HamperDuring the first quarter, McCormick recognized gains of $297.9 million from the recent U.S. Tax Act. This not only boosted the company’s bottom line for the period, but also led management to pass on a portion of its gains to well-deserved employees. Incidentally, McCormick announced bonuses worth $1,000 and plans to increase hourly wage rates for hourly U.S. employees.Improving wage structure is just one part of McCormick’s plans to strategically reap benefits from the tax reform. The company also plans to invest in organizational growth, debt reduction and provide returns to shareholders.Gains from tax cuts have enabled management to raise earnings outlook for fiscal 2018. Earnings are expected in the range of $4.85-$4.95, reflecting growth from the previous projection of $4.80-$4.90. The view also takes into consideration the estimated positive impact of nearly one percentage point from currency fluctuations.Final ThoughtsIn spite of the aforementioned upsides, McCormick’s performance continues to be eclipsed by escalating raw material costs, brand marketing and freight expenses. Incidentally, for fiscal 2018, the company expects material costs to escalate in low-single digits.Nevertheless, we expect this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to easily tide over such hurdles, courtesy of well-chalked savings initiatives. Additionally, positive impacts of buyouts and currency fluctuations are expected to fuel sales growth of approximately 13-15% in fiscal 2018. Indeed, such aspects have been a treat for investors, evident from the stock’s return of 10.9% in the past six months against the industry’s fall of 7.4%.

88,MKC,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report) has been sailing in troubled waters, thanks to the prolonged struggle with rising commodity costs, lower selling prices and increased competition in the diaper segment. These factors have weighed on the company’s shares that have declined 9.4% in the past three months against the industry’s fall of 8.8%.Rising Commodity Costs Higher input costs have been troubling Kimberly-Clark’s performance for a while. Evidently, commodity cost inflation of $175 million, stemming from greater costs of pulp and other raw materials, caused the company’s adjusted operating profit to fall 3% in the first quarter of 2018. Such factors have also been a drag on the gross margin, which contracted roughly 890 basis points (bps) to 28% in first-quarter 2018.Prior to this, gross margin witnessed year-over-year declines of 200 bps, 60 bps and 10 bps in the preceding three quarters, respectively. To make matters worse, management anticipates input cost inflation of about $400-$550 million for 2018. We expect that such aspects will persistently dampen profits.Apart from Kimberly-Clark, other consumer staples companies such as McCormick & Company (MKC  -  Free Report), Church & Dwight Co. (CHD  -  Free Report) and TreeHouse Foods (THS  -  Free Report) have also been struggling with higher commodity costs, which has been marring their profitability.Lower Net PricesLower selling prices are another hurdle faced by this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company. In fact, during first-quarter 2018, this trend lingered and affected results in most segments. Evidently, lower net selling prices dragged sales and operating profits of Kimberly-Clark’s Personal Care as well as K-C Professional (KCP) divisions. Moreover, such deterrents limit the company’s ability to fend-off negative impacts stemming from rising commodity costs. Prolonged Weakness in the Diaper SegmentKimberly-Clark’s diaper segment, that holds a vital place in the Personal Care category, has been bearing the brunt of increased competition across several markets. The segment remains particularly challenged in South Korea, due to lower birth rates. The bleak performance of the diaper unit also puts the company’s market share at risk.Any Rays of Hope Ahead?Considering the constant struggle with rising commodity costs, it only seems natural for Kimberly-Clark to undertake aggressive measures to cut costs. The company’s Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere or FORCE Program has generated higher cost savings each year with record amount of $450 million in 2017. In the first quarter, Kimberly-Clark generated savings of $90 million from this program and projects cost savings of $400 million in 2018.The company estimates more than $1.5 billion to be generated over the four-year period from 2018 to 2021. These savings are expected to be achieved through management’s focus on enhancing productivity at manufacturing facilities, optimizing design and raw material expenses and attaining distribution efficiencies.Speaking of building efficiencies, Kimberly-Clark’s recently embarked 2018 Global Restructuring Program deserves special mention. This plan is likely to enhance the company’s underlying profitability, enable it to compete better and provide greater flexibility to undertake growth-oriented investments. On a combined basis, the company expects cost savings of more than $2 billion from the FORCE program and 2018 Global Restructuring Program, over the next four years.While Kimberly-Clark’s savings efforts seem quite robust, they are yet to fully offset the negative impacts from the aforementioned hurdles. That said, let’s wait and see if such initiatives yield favorable impacts in the forthcoming periods and lift investors’ optimism.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

89,MKC,"U.S. food producers are striving to retain market share as easy-to-prepare and ready-to-eat food items are losing ground. A shift in consumer preference toward healthier options and a higher level of price consciousness are hurting the industry, making it hard for legacy brands to boost sales.In order to combat weak sales, food majors are aggressively trying to improve their products through innovation as well as by pursuing strategic acquisitions and divestitures. They are channeling funds toward product and packaging innovation as well as reformulating a number of existing products to meet the rapidly changing consumer view on health and wellness. Apart from this, companies have adopted multi-year restructuring initiatives with a focus on improving operational efficiency to generate cost savings.Therefore, though the companies’ sales have been relatively soft, cost savings have led to better margins. Again, savings are being re-invested in the business for innovation, brand building and marketing to stimulate top-line growth.Among the food companies, Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) has already reported first-quarter 2018 results, wherein earnings and revenues surpassed the consensus mark. The company posted solid results on the back of strong performance from Asia, Middle East & Africa and Europe. Adjusted earnings grew 9.6% and revenues increased 5.5% from the year-ago level.In March, McCormick & Company Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report) posted solid first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, with earnings and revenues outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improving year over year. The quarterly performance gained from positive acquisitions synergies, which led to growth in the consumer business and flavor solutions segments. General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) delivered in-line earnings and revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Meanwhile, the food giant has lowered its fiscal 2018 profit outlook to reflect higher supply chain costs.Q1 ExpectationsAccording to the latest Earnings Preview, results of 267 S&P 500 members are already out. As of Apr 27, 2018, total earnings for these S&P 500 members were up 25.1% year over year on more than 10% higher revenues. Of these, 76.8% surpassed earnings estimates, while 73.8% beat revenue expectations.Total earnings for the S&P 500 index are likely to increase 22.6% from the same period last year on 8.4% higher revenues. For the Consumer Staples sector (which includes food stocks), the expected earnings and revenue growth is 6.8% and 3.1%, respectively, for the first quarter.Let’s take a look at what’s in store for the following food stocks within the consumer staples sector that are scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 3.Our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock has a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high.You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) is set to report results before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. It surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters, with the average beat being 5.82%.The company’s top line remained subdued since 2014, primarily due to lower demand in North America. Particularly, sluggish performance of its cereal products in the developed markets as well as a soft U.S. snacks business have been affecting the company.Nonetheless, given the tepid sales growth, the company is making aggressive efforts toward improving its food offerings. The company is investing in brand building, in-store capabilities, along with product and packaging innovation. Also, revenues are expected to benefit from Pringles’ improved performance in Europe, the Parati acquisition in Brazil, better shipments, and improvement in pricing and mix in Mexico and Australia.Meanwhile, cost-saving initiatives like Project K and zero-based budgeting program are somewhat compensating for the sales decline.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $3.32 billion indicates a 2% uptick on a year-over-year basis. The consensus estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.08, reflecting a 1.9% year-over-year increase.Our proven model does not show that Kellogg is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

Though net sales in the quarter is expected to gain from early Easter, overall top line looks somewhat under pressure from hurdles like the exit of certain low-margin Aunt Jemima (“AJ”) products, the shutdown of Boulder UK operations and soft underlying sales. Nevertheless, the company’s solid productivity initiatives aimed at generating savings and improving gross margin are commendable.The consensus estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 56 cents, which marks an improvement of 12% from 50 cents recorded in the year-ago period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales currently stands at $763.2 million, reflecting a decline from $766.1 million reported in the year-ago period.Our proven model does not show that Pinnacle Foods is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

90,MKC,"Demand for everyday-use products created by operators in the Consumer Staples space doesn’t tend to fluctuate a lot, but it is nevertheless exposed to macroeconomic forces at the margins. As such, the outlook for this space perks up as the outlook for the U.S. and global economy improves.The outlook for the U.S. economy has been favorable for the last several years, with the recent tax legislation expected to add to the longevity of the current U.S. expansion cycle. In addition to the indirect benefits to Consumer Staples companies from the tax cuts, these companies also stand to benefit directly from the legislation, as reflected in the improving earnings outlook for many companies. That said, Consumer Staples operators tend to be global in their operations and as such don’t benefit to the same extent from U.S. tax law changes as the more domestic companies. With growth hard to come by for companies in this mature space, Consumer Staples players have to remain focused on squeezing more out of their operations and coming out with revenue-boosting initiatives, which mainly include efforts to keep pace with the changing consumer patterns.On that note, let’s delve deeper in some of the major growth-driving strategies of the space.Strengthening Product Portfolio via Strategic Alliances, Buyouts Consumer staples companies are regularly undertaking both domestic and international acquisitions to expand their product lines and gain access to new markets. Some of these are also forming partnerships, mostly with larger and better-known companies, to strengthen their distribution networks, diversify portfolios, expand their reach and enhance market positioning. Notably, leveraging each other’s efficiencies creates significant synergies for companies that go for M&A activities.Mergers of Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report) with packaged meat producer The Hillshire Brands (in August 2014); tobacco giants Reynolds American and Lorillard (in June 2015); food giants Kraft Foods Group, Inc. KHC and H.J. Heinz Company (in July 2015) and consumer goods companies Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Jarden (in 2016) were the most talked about deals. Belgium-based brewer Anheuser Busch InBev’s BUD buyout of SABMiller in October 2016 also created a buzz in the beverage industry. Apart from this, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report) acquired SABMiller plc’s 58% stake in MillerCoors, which made the former the third-largest brewer in the world, after Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken.Cost Cutting and Restructuring InitiativesMost consumer staples companies are implementing cost-reduction initiatives to boost profits. In the latter half of 2017, Tyson Foods announced a Financial Fitness Program, with the objectives of enhancing operating efficiency, reducing overheads and fuelling bottom-line performance. Colgate CL has also been benefiting from its Global Growth and Efficiency Program, which focuses on reducing structural costs in order to improve gross and operating profit, standardizing processes to improve the decision-making procedure and enhance its market share worldwide.Additionally, Sysco’s (SYY  -  Free Report) core strategies for 2020 include plans to optimize business and achieving operational efficacy. We also commend Kimberly Clark’s KMB 2018 Global Restructuring & Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere (FORCE) programs, which are expected to generate cost savings of more than $2 billion over the next four years. Companies like McCormick MKC, Coca-Cola KO, Molson Coors, Mondelez International MDLZ, Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report), Kellogg K and many others have also been benefiting from significant cost savings and restructuring initiatives to boost earnings.Focus on InnovationInnovation remains the guiding principle of consumer staples companies as it enables them to enhance brand appeal through product differentiation and capture market share across all regions and categories. Thus, companies put a lot of thrust on innovation to upgrade their brands and create differentiated value propositions. Notably, constant innovations supported by efficient marketing are essential for consumer staples companies to stay ahead of competition.As evidence, novelty has been a driving force for consumer product giants like The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) and Colgate-Palmolive, and cosmetic majors like Estee Lauder EL. These companies constantly come up with new products that suit changing consumer trends, to tap demand and boost revenues. Also, major food companies like Smucker and Campbell Soup CPB, alcohol stocks like Brown-Forman BF.B and Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report), and even tobacco players like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) have been adding new products to gain competitive edge and augment market share.Exiting Underperforming Units to Enhance OperationsApart from growing their businesses through buyouts, companies also remain focused on improving their product portfolios through divestitures. Offloading underperforming operations enables the companies to concentrate on the core and profitable areas.For example, as part of its strategic business review following its merger with Jarden, Newell Brands announced plans to sell nearly 10% of its current portfolio, including a major chunk of its Tools segment. This highlights the company’s focus on simplifying its operating structure, alongside highlighting its commitment toward making prudent investments in areas with higher growth potential. Similarly, Unilever (UL  -  Free Report) announced plans to sell its shrinking Spreads business to KKR (in December 2017) to shift concentration on fast-growing products.Adopting E-Commerce Mantra: The Need of the HourWith technology having advanced by leaps and bounds, online shopping has become the order of the day. Thanks to various mobile apps and dot.com business lines, shopping for anything is literally on consumers’ finger-tips. Consumers’ rapid shift to e-marketplace has compelled companies to adopt the e-commerce mantra. Companies like United Naturals (UNFI  -  Free Report), SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), Campbell Soup and Estee Lauder among others, are striving to enhance e-commerce space, through investments in technology and infrastructure.Driven by these efforts, United Natural Foods’ e-commerce sales jumped almost 28.9% in the second quarter. As for SUPERVALU, the company’s contract with Instacart, along with endeavors to upgrade website and mobile applications underscore its knack to enhance consumer shopping experiences.Transition to Health and Wellness ProductsAs consumer preference is the life blood of Consumer Staples, companies have to adapt to evolving trends to stay strong in the industry. A key trend over the last few years has been the desire for natural and organic products, prompting many players in the space to come out with health and wellness offerings. This is the case with almost all industries in the sector.Apart from this, tobacco companies like Altria and Reynolds American are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have resorted to less harmful alternatives like electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). To cater to changing consumer preference, Philip Morris launched the much talked about IQOS, a smokeless cigarette in November 2014, aiming to lead the tobacco industry’s push into reduced-risk products. IQOS is anticipated to boost market share and offset declining volumes in traditional cigarette business over the long term.Additionally, rising consumer awareness regarding the harmful impact of toxic chemicals has been driving the market share for organic personal care products too. Consequently, players like Unilever are making solid progress in the natural and organic products category. This is evident from its deal to buy Schmidt’s Naturals that specializes in personal care products such as deodorants, toothpaste and bar soaps. Clearly, these robust efforts are expected to boost the companies’ top line in the future.Clearly, the consumer staples space offers plenty of reasons to be optimistic about it over the long term.

On a constant currency basis, operating income increased 38%.Segment DetailsConsumer Business: Revenues grew 18.6% to $757.4 million. On a constant currency basis, sales improved almost 15%, primarily driven by growth in the Americas, EMEA and the Asia/Pacific regions.Sales in the Americas, on a constant currency basis, was mainly driven by the acquisition of RB Foods as well as strong pricing actions and favorable impacts of volume/mix.

On a constant currency basis, sales in the EMEA region also gained from the RB Foods buyout, while sales in the Asia/Pacific region were driven by growth in India and China.Adjusted operating income in the consumer business segment grew 32% at constant currency, buoyed by sales growth, cost savings and favorable mix which more than offset the negative impact of higher freight and brand marketing expenses.Flavor Solutions: Sales in the segment grew 18.4% from the prior-year quarter to $479.7 million.

Further, management expects sales during the fiscal year to gain from acquisitions, new products, expanded distribution network and brand marketing. Additionally, the company expects low-single digit increase in material costs.

92,MKC,"McCormick & Company Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report), a global leader in spices and seasonings, has been setting quite a treat for investors lately. Apart from well-yielding buyouts, the company’s cost-containment measures and efficient product strategies have been driving performance. Moreover, benefits from the recent tax reforms have led management to undertake plans to improve wage structure and raise earnings view for fiscal 2018.Such aspects have aided shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to surge 8.2% in the past six months, while the industry declined 5.8% in the same time frame. That said, let’s take a closer look at some of the aforementioned drivers and see what hurdles the company has been facing, lately. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Acquisitions Drive GrowthIn order to expand its spices and seasonings portfolio, McCormick has been strategically increasing its presence through acquisitions. The buyout of the food division of RB Foods in August 2017, is the largest deal by the company till date. With iconic brands like Frank's RedHot Sauce and French's Mustard, RB Foods is likely to continue as an asset for McCormick’s spices portfolio. Prior to this, the company completed significant acquisitions, including Italy-based Enrico Giotti SpA as well as Australia-based Botanical Food Company. Markedly, additional sales from buyouts of RB Foods and Enrico Giotti SpA drove sales by 12% during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, benefiting performances of consumer and flavor solutions units.Notably, a number of companies operating in the food industry such as Campbell Soups (CPB  -  Free Report), Kellog (K  -  Free Report) and Conagra Brands (CAG  -  Free Report) have been resorting to strategic buyouts to widen prospects.  Efforts for Containing CostsMcCormick focuses on saving costs and enhancing productivity through its Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program. Cost savings through CCI and streamlining actions amounted to $117 million in fiscal 2017, up from $109 million in fiscal 2016. Notably, cost savings aided in the improvement of the company’s gross and adjusted operating income margins during the first-quarter of fiscal 2018. This marked the company’s ninth consecutive quarter of adjusted operating income margin expansion. The company projects adjusted operating income growth in the range of 23-25% in fiscal 2018, wherein it plans to achieve savings of $100 million.Tax Cuts Aid Improving Wages & OutlookThe recent tax cuts have been a reason for joy to McCormick. Benefits from reduced taxes led management to rewarded employees with plans to provide bonuses and increase wage rates. Further, advantages from tax cuts led management to raise earnings outlook for fiscal 2018. Earnings are expected in the range of $4.85-$4.95, reflecting growth from the previous range of $4.80-$4.90. The raised outlook also takes into consideration the projected positive impact of nearly one percentage point from currency fluctuations.Can Savings Offset Cost Woes?McCormick has been concerned about escalating raw material costs along with increased brand marketing and freight expenses. Moreover, in fiscal 2018, the company expects material costs to escalate in low-single digits. McCormick is also increasing brand marketing expenses to drive sales.Nevertheless, we expect the aforementioned cost-related hurdles to be adequately cushioned by the company’s robust CCI program and efficient pricing strategies. Apart from these, management expects to continue reaping benefits from its acquisitions, product launches, expanded distribution network and brand marketing. With such positives, McCormick has plenty of reasons to stay encouraged and further raise investors’ optimism in the stock.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months. They’re now bigger than Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even Visa! The new asset class may expand even more rapidly in 2018 as new investors continue pouring in and Wall Street becomes increasingly involved.Zacks has just named 4 companies that enable investors to take advantage of the explosive growth of cryptocurrencies via the stock market.Click here to access these stocks>>

95,MKC,"The first day after one of the worst trading weeks in years, markets zoomed back up Monday — the Dow gained 669 points, or nearly 3%, after dropping 1400 points during last week’s tariff scare. Both the Dow and the S&P 500 are looking for their first back-to-back gains in more than 2 weeks. Right now, the Dow is still more than 3% down for the month of March, the S&P -2%.By now, we are pretty used to such wildly volatile turns in the market. These fluctuations also have moved on mere speculation of actualized events — for instance, it was mostly just President Trump saying out loud he wanted to put forth steel and aluminum tariffs that set the markets into a tizzy in the first place; yesterday’s reassurance from Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin that he’s “cautiously hopeful” the U.S. and China will arrive at a new trade deal was also not based on anything particularly concrete.That said, we’ll take it. In one day, the market nearly halved its losses from last week’s barn-burner. Should this positive sentiment continue — and at this stage in Tuesday’s pre-market there’s little in the way; even Chinese Premier Li has expressed a hopefulness for a new trade deal, and some analysts here at home have suggested all this tariff talk is just a blunt negotiation tool — we might find ourselves seeing last week in the rearview mirror. The markets have already dug out of correction territory.January Case-ShillerSome of the stalest — yet most accurate — information on the U.S. housing market comes from the monthly Case-Shiller report, which brought forth gains of 6.2% gains in January, a tick above estimates of 6.1%. Considering we have seen some question marks regarding the housing market looking into the future (and rising interest rates will make mortgages less appealing to obtain), a reassuring number like this might also see favorable treatment in today’s market. At very least, this will rock no boats.McCormick Spices Up Q1 EarningsBaltimore, MD-based McCormick & Co. (MKC  -  Free Report), the ubiquitous leader in spices and herbs in the U.S., beat expectations on both top and bottom lines in its fiscal Q1 earnings report (ended February) released this morning.

98,MKC,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for McCormick & Company, Incorporated (MKC  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 7.5% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.McCormick Q2 Earnings, Revenues Beat on AcquisitionsMcCormick & Co. Inc. posted second-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both the company's earnings and revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Adjusted earnings of 82 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents by 6.5%. We note that the company has delivered positive earnings surprise in 12 of the last 14 straight quarters. In the third quarter, adjusted earnings were also 9% higher year over year owing to higher operating income. Further, the favorable impact of higher sales and cost savings were offset by an increase in brand marketing and material costs and currency headwinds.Revenues and ProfitsIn the reported quarter the global leader in flavors and spices generated revenues of $1.11 billion, which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.09 billion by 1.4%. Revenues grew about 5% from the prior-year quarter, despite currency headwinds of 2%. Sales were driven by strong base business and impressive product portfolio growth. The acquisitions (Gourmet Garden in Apr 2016 and Enrico Giotti SpA in Dec 2016) also contributed to higher sales by 3%.Product innovation, brand marketing support and expanded distribution as well as pricing actions contributed to the growth in sales, offsetting the negative impact of currency. Excluding currency headwinds, revenues grew 7%, driven by both the consumer and industrial segments.The company's adjusted operating income grew 6.2% to $137 million in the second quarter. On a constant currency basis, it increased 9% due to higher sales and cost savings which were offset by increase in brand marketing expenses and currency headwinds. A shift in the portfolio to more value added products also boosted sales.Segment DetailsConsumer Business: Segment revenues grew 2%, primarily driven by strong base business and new product sales compared with the year-ago period. Solid performance in the Americas, strong momentum in China and the incremental impact of Gourmet Garden were partially offset by the impact of challenging environments in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region. Currency also hurt the segment by 2%. Sales rose 2% on a constant currency basis. While Sales increased on a constant currency basis in the Americas and Asia/Pacific, it declined in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) due to weak sales in the U.K. where the retail environment suffers from stiff competition.Adjusted operating income grew 7%, on a constant currency basis, driven by the favorable impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offsetting the impact of higher material costs.Industrial Business: Industrial segment sales grew 9% despite currency headwinds of 3%.  Industrial revenues growth was driven by increased sales across all three of its regions, including the incremental impact of the acquisition of Giotti, acquired in Dec 2016. On a constant currency basis, segment sales increased 12% year-over-year and doubled from the sequential quarter.On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income rose 13% year over year, driven by favorable impact of higher sales, product mix and CCI-led cost savings, more than offset the unfavorable impact of increases in material costs and an increase in brand marketing.Fiscal 2017 GuidanceFor fiscal 2017, the company has lowered its currency impact on sales. The company now expects sales to grow approximately 4-6% in fiscal 2017, in comparison with  approximately 3-5% announced earlier.Excluding currency, McCormick has reaffirmed its sales growth and adjusted earnings outlook. The company continues to expect the projected sales growth rate in the range of 5-7%, on a constant currency basis. The company expects higher brand marketing, increased pricing, new products, expanded distribution and acquisitions to contribute to the growth. Further, the company anticipates pricing actions to offset an anticipated mid-single digit increase in material costs. The company also has plans to achieve approximately $100 million of cost savings.The company expects 2017 adjusted operating income to grow approximately 8-10%, from adjusted operating income of $657 million in 2016. On constant currency basis, adjusted operating income is expected to grow 9-11%.McCormick expects 2017 adjusted earnings in the range of $4.05-$4.13 per share, which marks an increase of 7-9% compared with $3.78 in 2016. The guidance also includes unfavorable currency headwinds of 2 percentage points. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 is $4.08 per share, which is within the guidance range.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?

99,MKC,"McCormick & Company, Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report) recently announced plans to acquire food division of Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, a British consumer products company, for $4.2 billion. The transaction, subjected to regulatory approvals, will be funded through a combination of debt and equity and is expected to be completed either in the third or fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.Per Bloomberg, Reckitt has been looking to divest its food business since April, which invited many potential buyers including Post Holdings Inc. and Conagra Brands Inc. Other bidders included JM Smucker Co., Campbell Soup Co., Pinnacle Foods Inc. and Ajinomoto Co., as per sources. Unilever PLC (UL  -  Free Report) was also reportedly battling with meat producer Hormel Foods Corporation to buy the foods division of Reckitt Benckiser.Why is the Buyout a Strategic Fit for McCormick?McCormick, which is well known for manufacturing and distributing spices, seasonings, specialty foods and flavors to the entire food industry across the globe, has been strategically increasing its presence through acquisitions in order to grow its spices and seasonings portfolio. The acquisitions (Gourmet Garden in Apr 2016 and Enrico Giotti SpA in Dec 2016) contributed toward increasing sales by 3% during the second quarter of 2017, reported last month.The acquisition of Reckitt’s food division is a strategic one as it will significantly boost the company’s robust spices portfolio with iconic brands like Frank's RedHot Hot Sauce, French's Mustard, French's Crispy Vegetables and Cattlemen's BBQ Sauce. Notably, both Frank's RedHot and French's Mustard hold top most positions in their respective categories in the U.S. and Canada. As a result, these brands will position the company in the leading U.S. condiments category and will strengthen and expand McCormick's business presence internationally too.

Currency headwinds of approximately 2% impacted the second-quarter results of the company. Such impacts are likely to persist throughout fiscal 2017.Bottom LineNevertheless, McCormick is expected to overcome these challenges on the back of sustained cost savings efforts and the growth arising out of strategic acquisitions.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the industry are The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) and Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report), both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

100,MKC,"Tuesday, March 27, 2018The first day after one of the worst trading weeks in years, markets zoomed back up Monday — the Dow gained 669 points, or nearly 3%, after dropping 1400 points during last week’s tariff scare. Both the Dow and the S&P 500 are looking for their first back-to-back gains in more than 2 weeks. Right now, the Dow is still more than 3% down for the month of March, the S&P -2%.By now, we are pretty used to such wildly volatile turns in the market.

Considering we have seen some question marks regarding the housing market looking into the future (and rising interest rates will make mortgages less appealing to obtain), a reassuring number like this might also see favorable treatment in today’s market. At very least, this will rock no boats.McCormick Spices Up Q1 EarningsBaltimore, MD-based McCormick & Co.

102,MKC,"McCormick & Company Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 27, before the opening bell. We note that the company’s bottom-line results outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimates in the preceding four quarters, with an average surprise of 4.3%. Incidentally, the company’s well-chalked buyouts, product innovations and efficiency enhancing initiatives have been yielding well.With these in mind, let’s delve into how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement and see if his leading distributor of spices, seasonings and other specialty food products can maintain its positive earnings surprise streak.Expansion Efforts Aid Consumer & Industrial BusinessesAcquisitions have long been favoring McCormick’s performance, aiding the company to develop a robust product portfolio and strengthen its base business. To this end, McCormick’s buyout of the food division of Reckitt Benckiser Group plc in August 2017 deserves special mention. Apart from adding iconic brands to McCormick’s portfolio, the deal has been aiding sales growth in the company’s industrial and consumer business segments for a while.Looking back, the company’s past acquisitions have played a significant role in bolstering its performance. Some of the noteworthy buyouts of the company include Italy-based Enrico Giotti SpA (Dec 2016) and Australia-based Botanical Food Company (April 2016). Markedly, additional sales from buyouts of RB Foods, Giotti and Gourmet Garden contributed 6% to the company’s constant currency sales growth in fiscal 2017. Also, management expects additional sales from RB Foods to contribute 8% to fiscal 2018 sales growth.Apart from acquisitions, McCormick regularly undertakes innovations to add new products to its portfolio, stay competitive and tap the evolving demand for new flavors, spices and herbs.  Notably, the company’s innovation agenda is primarily based on the health and wellness of consumers at large. The company is planning to offer innovative flavors in breakfast platform and ready-to-serve gravies. McCormick is also shaping up portfolio with gluten-free, non-GMO and organic products to cater to the evolving needs of consumers. In 2016, the company renovated its core products with non-GMO labeling on everyday spices and seasonings.Such constant growth endeavors have indeed aided in radically expanding and bolstering the company’s consumer and industrial business segments. To top it, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales related to consumer and industrial business segments for the first quarter i currently pegged at $762 and $480 million, respectively. The consensus mark depicts a growth of approximately 19.2% and 18.5% from the prior-year reported figures.Enhancing Savings Via the CCI ProgramMcCormick focuses on saving costs and enhancing productivity through its ongoing Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program. The program has enabled the company to increase investments, which has been leading to higher sales and profits. Notably, cost savings through CCI and streamlining actions reached $117 million in fiscal 2017, up from $109 million in fiscal 2016. McCormick is on track with its four-year targeted savings of around $400 million by November 2019.Notably, cost savings from CCI helped the company deliver double-digit adjusted operating income growth in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. The adjusted operating margin expanded 220 basis points (bps), marking the eighth consecutive quarter of margin improvement. Further, gross margin increased 180 bps in the fourth quarter and is likely to expand in the range of 150-20 bps in fiscal 2018. The company projects adjusted operating income growth in the range of 23-25% in fiscal 2018, with plans to achieve cost savings of $100 million.  Hurdles Yet to Be CrossedAlthough the company has been progressing well with savings and business expansion plans, higher input costs have been hurting McCormick’s performance of late. In fact, higher raw material costs, along with increased brand marketing and freight expenses also affected the company’s performance in the fourth quarter. In fiscal 2018, the company expects material costs to escalate in low-single digits. Nevertheless, we expect these downsides to adequately be cushioned by the company’s CCI program and efficient pricing strategies.McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | McCormick & Company, Incorporated QuoteWhat Picture Do Estimates Provide?    The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter has been stable over the past thirty days at 91 cents. Expected earnings for the quarter under review depicts a rise of 19.7%, from the prior-year reported figures.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales of $1,235 million for the first quarter, reflecting an improvement of 18.3% from the year-ago period sales figure.A Look at the Zacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively show that McCormick is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Notably, a number of companies operating in the food industry such as Campbell Soups (CPB  -  Free Report), Kellog (K  -  Free Report) and Conagra Brands (CAG  -  Free Report) have been resorting to strategic buyouts and widen their prospects.  In fact, McCormick’s acquisition of the food division of Reckitt Benckiser Group plc (RB Foods) in August 2017, is the largest deal till date. The deal has enabled the addition of iconic brands to McCormick’s portfolio, thereby positioning the company in the leading U.S. condiments category.In the past, the company has made significant acquisitions, including that of Italy-based Enrico Giotti SpA (Dec 2016) and Australia-based Botanical Food Company (April 2016). Markedly, additional sales from buyouts of RB Foods, Giotti and Gourmet Garden contributed 6% to the company’s constant currency sales growth in fiscal 2017. Also, management expects additional sales from RB Foods to contribute 8% to fiscal 2018 sales growth.Cost-Saving EffortsMcCormick focuses on saving costs and enhancing productivity through its ongoing Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program. The program has enabled the company to increase investments, which lead to higher sales and profits. Notably, cost savings through CCI and streamlining actions reached $117 million in fiscal 2017, up from $109 million in fiscal 2016. McCormick is on track with its four-year targeted savings of around $400 million by November 2019.

Further, gross margin increased 180 bps in the fourth quarter and is likely to expand in a range of 150-20 basis points in fiscal 2018. The company projects adjusted operating income growth in the range of 23-25% in fiscal 2018, wherein it plans to achieve cost savings of $100 million.    Innovation & Inclination Toward Healthy Food OfferingsMcCormick regularly enhances products through innovation to stay competitive and tap the evolving demand for new flavors, spices and herbs. Health and wellness continues to bolster the innovation agenda. The company is planning to offer innovative flavors in breakfast platform and ready-to-serve gravies. McCormick is also shaping up its portfolio with gluten-free, non-GMO and organic products to cater to the evolving needs of consumers. In 2016, the company renovated its core products, with non-GMO labeling on everyday spices and seasonings.Escalated Costs a WorryMcCormick continues to incur higher raw material costs and witnesses increased brand marketing and freight expenses. Rising costs affected the company’s performance in the fourth quarter. In fiscal 2018, the company expects material costs to escalate in low-single digits. Further, McCormick is also planning to increase brand marketing expenses to drive sales.Wrapping it UpAlthough McCormick has been struggling against escalated expenses, we expect such downturns to be sufficiently cushioned by the company’s well-planned savings and efficiency building initiatives.

105,MKC,"The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) is proceeding with the implementation of its 2020 Strategy, aimed at improvement of categories and driving overall market share. This, in turn, is likely to boost the company's performance. Notably, the strategy is anticipated to be achieved through key accelerators like investment in brands, development of e-commerce, technological advancements, enhancement of growth culture and focus on the 3Ds — desire, decision and delight.Furthermore, the company’s diversified brand portfolio and commitment toward investing in product and brand differentiation to safeguard value proposition bode well. Not only this, it also remains focused on boosting digital capabilities, which has resulted in strong e-commerce growth lately.These efforts have aided Clorox to deliver fifth straight quarter of earnings beat in second-quarter fiscal 2018. However, shares of the company have lost 2.5% in the last three months, narrower than the industry’s decline of 4.7%.Let’s see whether the company’s solid quarterly earnings and robust strategies will boost its share price performance.Solid Q2 Earnings Push Estimates HigherResults in the fiscal second quarter gained from solid sales and lower tax rate. Though sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate after two consecutive beat, it improved year over year driven by strength in the International, Lifestyle and Cleaning segments on higher prices.For fiscal 2018, the company raised its earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $6.17-$6.37 from $5.47-$5.67 guided earlier.  It expects earnings per share to include 70-75 cents gain from the new tax reform, partly offset by lower gross margin. (Read: Clorox Beats on Q2 Earnings, Raises FY18 EPS View)Consequently, Clorox has witnessed solid upward earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 has moved up 53 cents and 35 cents, respectively, to $6.23 and $6.55 in the said time period.What’s Ahead?Clorox remains keen on using the benefits from the tax reform to support long-term business growth as well as enhance shareholders’ returns. Apparently, it raised its quarterly dividend by nearly 14% to 96 cents per share from 84 cents, payable on May 11, 2018, to shareholders on record as of Apr 25.In addition, the company anticipates the new tax reform to boost its earnings and cash flows going forward. This was well reflected in the aforementioned guidance raise for fiscal 2018 earnings. Clorox also raised its long-term free cash flow target, under the 2020 Strategy. It now expects to generate free cash flow, as a percentage of sales, in the range of 11-13% (on a yearly basis) compared with 10-12% projected earlier.We believe Clorox is well placed for long-term growth backed by its 2020 Strategy, robust e-commerce and brand management initiatives, and maximizing shareholder’s value. These initiatives are likely to drive this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s shares as well.Not Done Yet? Check These Trending Consumer Staples StocksThe Boston Beer Company, Inc.

McCormick has been gaining from its focus on buyouts, product innovations, cost-containment measures and efficient marketing initiatives. Some of these factors also drove the company’s second-quarter results.While earnings were fueled by solid sales, cost savings from Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program, focus on profit realization and portfolio shift to more value-added products, sales gained from robust results at both the segments, especially across Americas. Also, sales were boosted by buyouts, efficient pricing, and improved volumes and product mix. Markedly, the acquisition of Frank’s and French’s brands drove sales by 13%.CCI Program Bodes Well, Savings View UpMcCormick focuses on saving costs and enhancing productivity through its ongoing CCI program. Started in 2009, McCormick’s CCI program has helped the company focus on reducing costs and enhancing productivity. It has used CCI savings to increase its investments, thereby leading to higher sales and profits. Cost savings through CCI and streamlining actions reached $117 million in fiscal 2017, up from $109 million in fiscal 2016, $98 million in 2015 and $69 million in 2014. Notably, cost savings from CCI aided in expanding the company’s gross and adjusted operating income margins during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. This also marked the company’s 10th consecutive quarter of adjusted operating margin expansion. The company projects adjusted operating income growth in the range of 23% to 25% in fiscal 2018, wherein it now plans to achieve cost savings of $105 million compared to the old projection of $100 million. Consequently, management now expects gross margin to expand 175-225 bps in fiscal 2018 compared to the previously expected range of 150-200 bps increase.Buyouts Remain a Major DriverMcCormick has been strategically increasing its presence through acquisitions, in order to grow its spices and seasonings portfolio. McCormick’s acquisition of the food division of RB Foods, a British consumer products company, in August 2017, is the largest deal for the company till date. With iconic brands like Frank's RedHot Hot Sauce and French's Mustard, French's Crispy Vegetables and Cattlemen's BBQ Sauce, RB Foods is likely to continue being an asset for McCormick’s spices portfolio. Encouragingly, the acquisition of Frank’s and French’s brands drove McCormick’s sales by 13% in the second quarter, with gains from the buyout witnessed at both segments. Evidently, Frank’s and French’s brands boosted consumer and flavor solutions segments’ sales by 14% and 12%, respectively. Also, additional sales from these acquired brands are expected to boost the top line by 8% in fiscal 2018.Will Cost Hurdles be Offset?McCormick continues to incur increased brand marketing and freight expenses. These factors had a negative impact on margins in the second quarter. McCormick continues to undertake increased brand marketing to further drive sales. Also, freight costs are expected to remain a headwind for gross margin in fiscal 2018.Nevertheless, we expect the company’s CCI program to provide cushion. Also, McCormick’s impressive sales drivers are likely to help it offset these woes and help the company keep its stellar show on. Markedly, management expects these tailwinds to drive sales growth by approximately 13-15% in fiscal 2018. Further, earnings for fiscal 2018 are expected in the range of $4.85-$4.95, reflecting a growth of 14-16% from the year-ago period’s tally.Check Out These Solid Food StocksMEDIFAST INC (MED  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, has delivered positive earnings surprises in the past three quarters.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc.

110,MKC,"Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) posted second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both earnings and sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise after three consecutive earnings misses while sales returned to positive after four straight misses.However, shares of the company have lost nearly 3.4% in the pre-market trading as management stated that it was a dismal quarter on account of persistent challenges in the U.S. soup category as well as Campbell Fresh division. In fact, this segment delivered lower-than-expected results due to difficulties in the super premium juice category.In the last three months, Campbell’s shares have declined 4.1% against the industry’s gain of 0.3%.Q2 HighlightsAdjusted earnings of $1.00 per share increased 9.9% year over year and also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents. Including one-time items, Campbell reported earnings of 95 cents per share that was significantly up from 33 cents in the year-ago quarter.Net sales of $2,180 million inched up 0.4% and also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,174 million. However, organic sales dipped 2% on account of lower volumes mainly in the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment.Further, the company’s adjusted gross margin contracted 2.2 percentage points to 35.2%. The decline was mainly due to cost inflation, escalated supply chain expenses and adverse mix, somewhat negated by productivity improvements as well as gains from cost savings. Campbell Soup Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Campbell Soup Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Campbell Soup Company QuoteMoreover, adjusted EBIT in the quarter was down 4% to $402 million on lower gross margin, compensated with lower marketing and selling costs as well as a rise in other income.Segment AnalysisThe Latin America business is managed as part of the Global Biscuits and Snacks segment starting from fiscal 2018. Earlier, this formed part of the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment.Campbell reports its results under three segments namely, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, Global Biscuits and Snacks, and Campbell Fresh.Americas Simple Meals and Beverages: In second-quarter fiscal 2018, sales at the division dipped 2% year over year to $1,196 million. Also, the segment’s organic sales were down 4% mainly due to softness in V8 Beverages and soup sales, somewhat mitigated by benefits in the Canada retail business. Excluding gains from the Pacific Foods buyout, sales at the U.S. soup decreased 7% on account of a drop in condensed soups as well as ready-to-serve soups. However, broth sales were comparable to last year.Global Biscuits and Snacks: Sales at this division rose 4% at $726 million. Excluding the impact of currency tailwinds, organic sales grew 3% backed by Pepperidge Farm snacks strength representing growth in Goldfish crackers, cookies and benefits from Kelsen cookies in China. Further, Arnott’s biscuits’ sales were comparable to the previous year, excluding the positive effect from currency.Campbell Fresh: Sales at this segment dipped 1% to $257 million mainly on lower sales at Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages.FinancialsCampbell ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $196 million, long-term debt of $2,247 million and total equity of $1,949 million. Additionally, the company generated $660 million as cash flow from operations, in the first six months of fiscal 2018.Other DevelopmentsIn the quarter under review, management has completed the buyout of Pacific Foods to widen its foothold in the organic soup and broth categories. Further, it agreed to buy the leading snacks maker — Snyder’s-Lance, Inc. — which is likely to strengthen Campbell Soup’s portfolio of snacking brands, thus making it a snacking leader.Meanwhile, Campbell Soup remains on track with its multi-year cost-savings initiative as it achieved $20 million of savings in the fiscal second quarter, bringing the entire program-to-date savings to $365 million. Furthermore, the company has raised the annualized savings target from $450 million to $500 million, which is expected to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2020.Fiscal 2018 OutlookCampbell remains focused on getting its C-Fresh division back on growth track and solving its key customer issue, thereby expecting moderate soup sales in the second half of fiscal 2018. Going into the spring season, the company expects its initiatives to boost beverage results in the second half.  Further, its solid focus on cost savings and core strategic imperatives are likely to drive growth in the long term.Management updated its outlook for fiscal 2018 to include the effects of the Pacific Foods buyout as well as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The company projects sales growth to range from negative 1% to positive 1%. Also, adjusted EBIT is expected to decline in the band of negative 7% to negative 5%. Adjusted earnings are envisioned in the band of $3.10-$3.17 per share, representing increase of 2-4%.

112,MKC,"The food industry has been dealing with a slew of issues of late. Major U.S. food companies are striving to retain market share as easy-to-prepare and ready-to-eat food items are losing ground. A shift in consumer preference toward healthier options and a higher level of price consciousness are hurting the industry, making it hard for legacy brands to boost sales.In order to combat weak sales, food majors are aggressively trying to improve their products through innovation as well as by pursuing strategic acquisitions and divestitures. They are channeling funds toward product and packaging innovation as well as reformulating a number of existing products to meet the rapidly changing consumer view on health and wellness. Apart from this, companies have adopted multi-year restructuring initiatives with focus on improving operational efficiency to generate cost savings.Therefore, though the companies’ sales have been relatively soft, cost savings have led to better margins. Again, savings are being re-invested in the business for innovation, brand building and marketing to stimulate top-line growth.Among the food companies that have already reported their numbers, McCormick & Company (MKC  -  Free Report) posted solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, with earnings and revenues outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improving year over year. Last month, General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) delivered in-line earnings in second-quarter fiscal 2018, after a negative earnings surprise of 7.79% in first-quarter fiscal 2018.Q4 ExpectationsAs we take a closer look at the Q4 earnings season, we see a steady improvement over the past few quarters. According to the latest Earnings Preview, of the 133 S&P 500 members that have reported Q4 results as of Jan 26, 81.2% have surpassed EPS estimates and 78.9% have come up with top-line beats. The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 65.4%.Total Q4 earnings are expected to be up 11.6% from the same period last year on 7.5% higher revenues compared with 6.7% earnings growth in the third quarter of 2017 on 5.9% rise in revenues.For Q4, total earnings for the companies in the Consumers Staples sector (which includes food stocks) are projected to grow 6% year over year, more than 3.9% in the previous quarter. Revenues are expected to increase 2.5% compared with 1.9% in the third quarter. Let’s see what awaits the following food stocks that are queued up for earnings releases on Feb 1.Our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock has a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high.The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell.We expect the top line to remain subdued in the to-be-reported quarter, as has been the case for quite some time now owing to changes in consumer preference in North America and soft international sales.In the fourth quarter, the company had plans of introducing retail-ready packaging at select outlets. Also, Hershey is transitioning the packaging of its core chocolate products. Though these initiatives will improve shelf presence and visibility over the long haul, it is expected to affect fourth-quarter gross margin. Moreover, higher advertising expenses in China and the United States related to product innovation are expected to impact results in the to-be-reported quarter.Overall, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.06, reflecting a 9.4% year-over-year decline. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.98 billion, implying a 0.3% increase.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.9%.

113,MKC,"Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) has been gaining from strategic buyouts, well-chalked growth endeavors and efficient financial strategies. Such efforts have helped this leading distributor and marketer of food products to augment business and develop a robust product portfolio.Portfolio Expansion Through BuyoutsAcquisitions have been a key catalyst for Sysco’s expanding distribution network and customer base. Coming to major buyouts, the company recently inked a deal to buy Kent Frozen Foods, a leading foodservice provider in the United Kingdom. Currently, the deal is subject to approval from the Competition and Markets Authority. Kent Frozen Foods is expected to form a part of Sysco’s U.K. and European business bandwagon, which already includes popular names like M&J Seafood, Fresh Direct and Brakes. Moreover, the deal is likely to help the company effectively combat sluggish business trends in the United Kingdom and induce a turnaround in the region’s performance.In 2017, Sysco acquired HFM FoodService and the remaining 50% stake in Mayca Distribuidores. Apart from that, the acquisition of London-based Brakes Group in 2016 has been benefiting the company significantly and is expected to generate sales of approximately $55 billion annually.Notably, Sysco expects to achieve 0.5-1% sales growth through acquisitions in the long run. Other major food companies such as United Natural Foods Inc (UNFI  -  Free Report) and McCormick & Company (MKC  -  Free Report) have also been strengthening their foothold in the industry through strategic buyouts.Strategic Plans Favor U.S. BusinessSysco has been keenly working on business optimization strategies for inducing growth and improving operations. To this end, the company outlined some important strategies at the New York Investor Day event in December 2017, wherein it highlighted its three-year financial goals. Sysco’s four core strategies include enhancing consumers’ experience, optimizing business, stimulating power of its people and achieving operational efficiency. By evolving with changing consumer preferences, Sysco is committed toward investing in technology and enhancing e-commerce operations. Moreover, it plans to improve supply chain operations, increase transparency and enhance delivery capacity.Driven by these strategies, the company expects gross profit to rise in the band of 55-65%, while it anticipates 20-25% reduction in administrative expenses by 2020. Earnings per share are projected to grow at a double-digit rate on an average by 2020.  Further, we expect such efficient financial plans, supported by strong balance sheet and cash positions, to aid the company in continuing with investments and expansion efforts.Sysco’s focus on product management, efficient pricing and revenue management initiatives have been favoring the company’s domestic business. Notably, sales at the company’s U.S. Foodservice Operations improved 4% to $9,849.9 million, with local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations rising 2.8%. Also, gross profit increased 3.8% at the segment.An Environment-Friendly Approach to Cost ReductionApart from augmenting financial strength and improving existing operations, Sysco has also been adopting an innovative approach toward delivering environment friendly services. In December 2017, the company reserved 50 new fully-electric semi tractors at Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) to introduce alternative-fuel vehicles to its fleet. This move will not only be environment friendly, but is also likely to curtail fuel and transportation expenses considerably.Bottom LineThe company’s dedicated efforts to emerge as a strong contender in the foodservices arena are laudable. Moreover, an impressive surprise history speaks volumes regarding the effectiveness of the company’s growth plans and operational polices. Such efforts are expected to continue strengthening the company’s business and sustain growth.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

118,MKC,"McCormick & Company Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jan 25, before the opening bell. The bottom-line results of this leading distributor of spices, seasonings and other specialty food products outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimates in three out of the preceding four quarters, with an average beat of 4%.Considering this, let’s delve into how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 has been stable over the past 30 days at $1.52 and $4.22, respectively. Expected earnings for the quarter under review and the fiscal 2017 depict a growth of 19.7% and 11.6%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figure. Notably, management expects fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings in the range of $4.20-$4.24 per share.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales of $1,475 million for the fourth quarter, up 20.2% from sales recorded in the year-ago quarter. Also, the consensus mark for fiscal 2017 sales is pegged at $4.82 billion, reflecting a rise of 9.3% from fiscal 2016 sales.McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | McCormick & Company, Incorporated QuoteFactors at PlayAcquisitions have long been favoring McCormick’s performance, aiding the company to develop a robust product portfolio. To this end, McCormick’s buyout of the food division of Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, in August 2017, deserves special mention. Apart from adding iconic brands to McCormick’s portfolio, the deal led to sales growth in the industrial and consumer business segments of the company during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. In fact, the acquisitions of Reckitt Benckiser and Enrico Giotti SpA contributed to sales growth in the third quarter. Further, the company continues to expect positive synergies from the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser Group.Driven by such factors, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales growth for the fourth quarter related to consumer and industrial business segments are currently pegged at 0.18% and 0.25%, respectively.Moreover, the company raised its guidance for fiscal 2017 to reflect the positive impacts from the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser Group and lower currency. The company expects sales to grow approximately 9-10% in fiscal 2017, compared with the previous range of 4-6%. Excluding currency, McCormick expects sales to grow approximately 10-11% in fiscal 2017, compared with the previous band of 5-7%.McCormick’s cost-saving and productivity-enhancing initiatives through the Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program have also been positively impacting performance. Owing to the cost-savings efforts, the company delivered double-digit adjusted operating income growth in the third quarter and expanded adjusted operating income margin by 140 basis points. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of margin expansion. McCormick expects to deliver cost savings of at least $105 million in fiscal 2017, up from the previous expectation at least $100 million expected previously.Although the company has been progressing well with savings and business expansion plans, higher input costs have been hurting McCormick’s margins of late. Prices of majority of the raw materials including cinnamon, oregano and rice along with packaging costs have been rising for a while. Further, in fiscal 2017, the company expects material cost inflation in mid-single digits. McCormick’s increased spending on brand marketing also poses adequate threats of lowering profits. However, we expect the company to offset the impact of such hurdles through efficient pricing strategies.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that McCormick is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Although McCormick carries a Zacks Rank #3, its Earnings ESP of -0.49% makes surprise prediction difficult.

119,MKC,"McCormick & Company Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report) has been bearing the brunt of higher raw material costs and elevated marketing spends. Unfortunately, these hurdles have caused this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company to underperform the industry in the past three months. Incidentally, shares of McCormick dipped 0.5% against the industry’s rally of 6.2%.McCormick Battles Higher Input Costs & Market SpendMcCormick’s operations are vulnerable to raw material price fluctuations. Higher raw material costs, particularly vanilla and garlic, have been hurting McCormick’s margins. Prices of raw materials including cinnamon, oregano and rice as well as packaging costs have also been increasing since fiscal 2012. Moreover, for 2017, the company expects material cost inflation to be in mid-single digits.Fluctuations in input materials are mainly attributable to changes in weather and market demand conditions. Additionally, pricing actions undertaken by the government affects the cost of raw materials.McCormick has been resorting to higher promotional and marketing expenditures to boost its top line. Though the company’s higher spending on marketing will drive brands’ growth, it will also raise the company’s expense structure.  Further, the company expects brand marketing to increase at a high single-digit rate in 2017 compared with the previously estimated mid to high single-digit rate.While such expense related headwinds were more than offset by higher sales and strong brand performances during the third quarter of 2017, their negative impacts are expected to linger in the forthcoming periods and dent results.Actions to Mitigate HeadwindsMcCormick strives to offset price hike through strategic raw material purchases. Further, well-planned pricing actions are expected to aid the company mitigate the negative impacts stemming from increased marketing and raw material costs. Moreover, the company’s constant endeavors to expand business trough acquisitions are expected to continue boosting the top line and offset the aforementioned hurdles.Nervous About McCormick?

The increased dividend is payable on Jan 16, 2018 to shareholders held in record as of Dec 29, 2017.Notably, this represents McCormick’s32nd consecutive year of dividend hike. In November 2016, the company announced a 9.3% increase in its quarterly dividend, up from 7.5% announced in 2015.Dividend hike is a prudent strategy used by companies with a stable cash position and solid prospects. Dividend hike not only enhance shareholder returns but also raise the market value of the stock.

Evidently, the company has a solid share buyback program of $600 million in place. During the third quarter, the company returned $312 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.What’s Driving the Shareholder-Friendly Moves?McCormick strives to increase profits and boost shareholder returns through acquisitions and cost-saving initiatives. The company’s focus on acquisitions is evident from the recent buyout of Reckitt Benckiser’s food division. In the past, the company has acquired Italy-based Enrico Giotti SpA and Australia-based Botanical Food Company.Moreover, McCormick is resorting to saving costs and enhancing productivity through ongoing Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program. Such efforts enabled the company to deliver double-digit growth in adjusted operating income during the third quarter.

121,MKC,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) responds to the rising consumer demand for chicken products by frequently undertaking initiatives to expand poultry production capacity. The company recently announced plans to develop a chicken production complex in the City of Humboldt, in western Tennessee.This facility development project is valued at approximately $300 million. Upon completion of this project in late 2019, it is expected to create approximately 1,500 local jobs. The facility will primarily be engaged in the production of pre-packaged trays of fresh chicken and along with a capacity to process 1.25 million birds per week.In August 2017, the company announced making investments of $84 million for the expansion of the Union City facility in Tennessee.

The company currently has four operational facilities in the state, with around 5,000 workers.Rising Demand for Chicken & Protein-Packed Products Bodes Well Increasing consumer preference for chicken products is well reflected in the company’s fourth-quarter 2017 results. Sales from the Chicken segment improved 8% year over year to reach $3,035 million, while sales volume expanded 4.1%. The company’s ongoing capacity expansion initiatives in Tennessee are expected to further augment the Chicken segment’s performance in the upcoming quarters.Further, Tyson Foods’ Prepared Foods segment also benefits from increased consumer demand for protein-packed and fresh food offerings.

For fiscal 2018 the USDA expects overall domestic protein production (chicken, beef, pork and turkey) to increase roughly 3-4% year over year.

122,MKC,"Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) posted first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both earnings and sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined year over year. This marks the third consecutive quarter of negative earnings surprise with fourth straight revenue miss.Per management, the underperformance was due to a volatile operating environment along with intense competition and fast evolving retail landscape. These have been pressuring the company’s top line for a while now.Consequently, shares of the company are down 8.8% in the pre-market trading, owing to dismal first-quarter results and unimpressive outlook for fiscal 2018. Overall, Campbell’s shares have lost 7.5% in the last three months, wider than the industry’s decline of 2.2%.Q1 HighlightsAdjusted earnings of 92 cents per share dropped 8% year over year and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents. Including one-time items, Campbell reported earnings of 91 cents per share that decreased 3% from the year-ago quarter.Net sales of $2,161 million slipped 1.9% and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,179.6 million, mainly owing to soft organic sales. Organic sales dipped 2% on account of lower volumes, mainly in the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment.Further, the company’s adjusted gross margin contracted 2.1 percentage points to 36.5%. The decline was mainly due to cost inflation, escalated supply chain expenses and adverse mix, somewhat negated by productivity improvements as well as gains from cost savings.Moreover, adjusted EBIT for the quarter fell 14% to $417 million owing to lower gross margin, soft sales and increased adjusted administrative costs, partly compensated with lower marketing and selling costs. Campbell Soup Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Campbell Soup Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Campbell Soup Company QuoteSegment AnalysisThe Latin America business is supervised as part of the Global Biscuits and Snacks segment starting from fiscal 2018. Earlier, this formed part of the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment.Campbell reports its results under three segments, namely, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, Global Biscuits and Snacks, and Campbell Fresh.Americas Simple Meals and Beverages: In first-quarter fiscal 2018, sales at the division dipped 5% year over year to $1,218 million, on account of softness in V8 beverages and soup sales. Sales for the U.S. soup dropped 9% owing to a drop in condensed soups, broth as well as ready-to-serve soups. This was somewhat offset by benefits from Prego pasta sauces.  Global Biscuits and Snacks: Sales at this division rose 3% at $709 million. Excluding the impact of currency tailwinds, sales grew 2% backed by Pepperidge Farm snacks strength, representing growth in Goldfish crackers and Pepperidge Farm cookies.Campbell Fresh: Sales at this segment remained flat at $234 million on the back of greater Garden Fresh Gourmet sales, Bolthouse Farms salad dressings along with strength across carrot ingredients. This was partially offset by soft carrot sales. Also, sales of Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages remained flat.    FinancialsCampbell ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $163 million, long-term debt of $2,269 million and total equity of $1,689 million. Further, the company generated $188 million as cash flow from operations during the first quarter.Fiscal 2018 OutlookCampbell remains focused on getting its C-Fresh division back on growth track, by solving the problems related to soft carrot sales and beverage products. Its solid focus on cost savings and core strategic imperatives are likely to drive growth in the long term.Management updated its outlook for fiscal 2018.

123,MKC,"Dean Foods Company (DF  -  Free Report) has been struggling with higher raw milk costs and lower volumes for quite some time now. Also, a tough retail scenario that is characterized by fast-evolving consumer trends has been weighing upon the company’s performance.In the last six months, shares of the company have lost 44.1%. The downturn was wider than the industry’s decline of 40.1% and the broader Consumer Staples sector’s fall of just 0.9%. The stock also has  a VGM Score of C. What’s Denting Dean Foods’ Performance?Dean Foods’ business is heavily dependent on commodities such as raw milk, soybeans, diesel fuel and others, the prices of which often fluctuate. Hence, any rise in their prices is likely to hurt the company’s margins, which is quite evident from the company’s third-quarter 2017 results. Though Dean Foods posted in-line earnings, it has lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the last three quarters. Also, it has delivered negative earnings surprise of 15.2% in the trailing four quarters.Also, sales lagged estimates for the second straight quarter. Both earnings and sales declined year over year. While, adjusted gross profit declined 9.1% to $448 million, the adjusted operating income was down by 34.8% to $45 million in the third quarter.Results were hurt by soft volumes, higher raw milk costs and loss of share in U.S. fluid milk volumes. Moreover, lost sales volumes and incremental costs related to the recent hurricanes in both Texas and Florida weighed upon its performance. Consequently, management slashed earnings view to the 80-90 cents band for 2017 compared with 80-95 cents, guided earlier.Additionally, stiff competition in the retail grocery industry, both geographically and particularly at the processor level, in all major product lines have been hurting Dean Foods’ results.Estimate RevisionsThe Zacks Estimate for 2017 moved down by 2 cents to 81 cents in the last 30 days. For 2018, it has moved south by 9 cents to 82 cents. Can the Stock Rebound?Dean Foods has been making efforts to revive its performance. To this end, the company has undertaken strategic steps to optimize its capital allocation and concentrate on core business activities. As part of this strategy, management is looking to diversify its portfolio of brands moving beyond the pure milk products.In fact, the company expects to gain from the smart volume initiative through the rest of 2017 aimed at improving the top line, building margins and creating operating efficiencies. It also remains on track with its comprehensive productivity program including OpEx 2020 along with company-wide initiatives to drive efficiencies.We believe these initiatives will go a long way in offsetting the aforementioned headwinds, but not anytime soon.Looking For Solid Picks in the Consumer Staples Space, Check TheseSome better-ranked stocks in the same space include McCormick & Company, Incorporated (MKC  -  Free Report), B&G Foods, Inc.

124,MKC,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) has been a preferred pick for investors lately. Shares of the company have surged 33.4% in the past six months, compared with the industry’s rally of 20%. Recently, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock hit a new 52-week high of $78.03 during the trading session on Nov 17, eventually closing at $77.97.We note that the company has been gaining from impressive performance in the previous quartets. Notably, Tyson Foods’ earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimates in two out of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 6.03%. Sales also beat estimates in three out of the past four quarters.Let’s look deeper into aspects which have been driving the company’s impressive performance.Solid Q4 PerformanceTyson Foods recently posted fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein earnings and sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year on year. Results mainly benefitted from strong performance in all segments, with an increase of 3.2% in net volume. The performance of Beef and Chicken remained particularly sturdy owing to a rise in volume of 4.1% and 3.3%, respectively. The quarter also witnessed 7.2% growth in net average selling price. Rising Preference for Protein-Packed Food Propels Growth Of late, Tyson Foods has been divesting non-protein businesses and allocating resources toward more profitable segments which include chicken and beef products as well as other fresh food offerings. The performances of Chicken and Beef segments have been steadily improving owing to rising consumer demand for protein-packed food products. Such a trend is positively impacting volumes in the company’s Pork segment. For fiscal 2018, USDA expects overall domestic protein production (chicken, beef, pork and turkey) to increase roughly 3-4% year over year. This will enable Tyson Foods to sustain its robust performance.Acquisitions to Drive Prepared Food Segment Rising consumer preference for protein-packed and fresh food offerings have also propelled the performance of Prepared Foods segment. Tyson Foods has undertaken several acquisitions to augment the segment’s performance. In this respect, the acquisition of AdvancePierre has been driving the company’s top-line in the last few quarters. Moreover, Tyson Foods announced plans to add Original Philly Holdings to this segment, which specializes in raw and fully-cooked Philly-style sandwich steak and cheesesteak appetizers. The takeover is expected to expand Tyson Foods offerings.Positive Outlook Considering the company’s steady progress in all its food segments, management envisions earnings for fiscal 2018 to rise 7-10% from the prior year, to reach $5.70-$5.85 per share. Further, sales for fiscal 2018 are expected to increase 7%. The company has also initiated a Financial Fitness program to enhance cost savings and operating efficiency in the upcoming periods. The program is targeted to benefit the Prepared Foods and Chicken Segments performance in particular.Undoubtedly, Tyson Foods is well positioned in the food market with a robust portfolio of strong brands and continuing efforts to sustain its sturdy performance.Do Consumer Staple Stocks Interest You?

125,MKC,"Treehouse Foods, Inc. (THS  -  Free Report) has been going through a rough patch for a while now, which is clear from its dismal stock price performance. Evidently, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock has plunged 40.6% so far this year, much wider than the industry’s decline of 8.2%. In fact, this packaged foods and beverages manufacturer has fallen sharply by 35.4% in the past 15 days.So, let’s delver deeper into what’s been hurting Treehouse Foods and see where its headed.Persistent Industry HeadwindsTreeHouse Foods has been battling major industry hurdles like stiff competition, intense promotional headwinds and sluggish store traffic on account of consumers’ changing preferences and evolving shopping patterns. Consumers’ rapid shift toward online shopping and Amazon.com Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) growing dominance has weighed upon store traffic. These factors and increased promotional activities also create considerable pricing pressure, which remains a threat to profit margins.Elevated CostsTreeHouse is incurring higher operating costs due to acquisitions, additional investments in sales force and general growth of the business along with higher incentive compensation. Further, escalated commodity and freight expenses significantly weighed upon the company’s operating performance in the third quarter, especially in Beverages and Snacks units. Owing to the aforementioned hurdles, direct operating income (DOI) margin in these segments contracted 610 and 480 bps respectively in the quarter. Also, management expects the division DOI to have a considerable drag on the bottom line in 2017. Moreover, commodity and freight costs are likely to remain high in 2018 as well, thus posing concerns.Q3 Bears the Brunt, Dismal Outlook Dents Estimates    Treehouse Foods bore the brunt of the aforementioned headwinds in the recently reported third-quarter 2017, wherein both top and bottom lines declined year over year. Moreover, earnings came way below the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as management’s guidance range. Results were hurt by pressurized volumes and challenges related to pricing in certain segments. Also, the divestiture of the SIF (Canned Soup and Infant Feeding) business marred the company’s top line in the quarter. Additionally, higher freight and commodity costs weighed upon the EBITDA (particularly the Beverages and Snacks segments).Treehouse Foods, Inc. Price and Consensus  Treehouse Foods, Inc. Price and Consensus | Treehouse Foods, Inc. Quote Unfortunately, management expects these problems to linger, which compelled it to curtail its earnings outlook to a band of $2.70-$2.80 per share, compared with the previously anticipated range of $3.15-$3.30. Ever since the drab quarterly outcome and view, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and 2017 have moved down from $1.29 to 93 cents and from $3.17 to $2.78, respectively.A Ray of Hope Amid HurdlesTreeHouse Foods is making attempts to enhance its operational performance and reduce cost structure through its TreeHouse 2020 strategy. The plan has been designed to restructure and realign the business as a whole. Alongside of cost savings, the initiative is expected to improve management of the company’s category and customer portfolio, as well as optimize its supply chain.  The plan, which will be carried out through a series of phases, is expected to improve the company’s operating margin by 300 bps by the end of 2020. Apart from this, the company remains focused on expanding its product offerings through strategic buyouts, which should aid its performance.While these growth efforts appear impressive, it remains to be seen if they can help the company offset the present challenges. Thus, we prefer to remain on the sidelines for now.Nervous About Treehouse?

131,MKC,"Shares of Dean Foods Company (DF  -  Free Report) declined 1.1% on Nov 7 as the company slashed its adjusted earnings view for 2017 after reporting in-line third-quarter 2017 earnings. This marked an improvement from the company’s negative earnings surprises delivered in the preceding three quarters. However, the company’s sales lagged estimates.Further, this Dallas-based food and beverage company’s shares have plunged 20.1% in three months, wider than the Consumer Staples sector’s downside of 3.1%.Despite a tough retail backdrop, the company’s results gained from overall solid sales execution, which helped in wining some new business for 2018. Though the company displayed stringent focus on cost productivity and commercial initiatives, results were hurt by lost sales volumes and incremental costs related to the recent hurricanes in both Texas and Florida. The company estimates that the hurricanes impacted business in the third quarter by nearly $6 million or 4 cents of earnings per share. The impacts primarily related to revenue lost, soft resin supplies and increased freight.Further, soft volumes, higher raw milk costs, and loss of share in U.S. fluid milk volumes were hindrances.Q3 in DetailPlagued by lower volumes and increased raw milk expenses, the company’s quarterly adjusted earnings of 20 cents per share came in line with Zacks Consensus Estimate while it plunged 45.9% year over year.Dean Foods Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Dean Foods Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Dean Foods Company QuoteOn GAAP basis, the company posted loss per share of 11 cents, against earnings of 16 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Net sales declined 1.4% year over year to $1,937.6 million, and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,973 million. Total volumes of 608 million gallons dropped 6.6% from 651 million gallons in the prior-year quarter. The lag was mainly due to volume and private label mix challenges that continued in the quarter.Raw milk costs escalated about 10% year over year and nearly 7% on a sequential basis, which also impacted top line.Further, the milk category remained soft as the USDA data through August 2017 revealed that fluid milk volumes dipped 2.2% year over year, on a quarter-to-date basis. Additionally, Dean Foods' share of U.S. fluid milk volumes contracted 50 basis points.Adjusted gross profit declined 9.1% to $448 million, while the adjusted operating income collapsed by 34.8% to $45 million in the third quarter.Financial PositionDean Foods ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $24.3 million, long-term debt including current maturities of about $946.5 million, and shareholders’ equity of $604.4 million. Total debt outstanding, excluding cash on hand, was nearly $928 million as of Sep 30, 2017.In the first three quarters of 2017, the company generated nearly $67 million of net cash from operating activities and $5 million of free cash flow.The company deployed roughly $61 million as capital expenditure in the nine months of 2017. As of the end of the third quarter, Dean Foods’ all cash netted leverage (net debt to bank EBITDA total leverage ratio) came in at 2.56 times, reflecting slight increase from second-quarter 2017.In the fourth-quarter, the company expects free cash flow to benefit from sequential rise in operating results, partly offset by seasonal ice cream build and higher capital expenditures. Further, management significantly lowered its free cash flow guidance for 2017 to $10-$20 million, from the prior forecast of $60-$75 million. Additionally, the company trimmed its capital expenditure forecast for the year to $105-$115 million.The Road AheadWhile the third-quarter performance remained soft, the company expects to gain from its smart volume initiative through the rest of 2017, aimed at improving top line, building margins and creating operating efficiencies. This initiative relates to managing private label products, while also analyzing new volume opportunities and evaluating existing volume profitability. This means ensuring that volumes are produced and sold at appropriate margins.Additionally, the company’s initiatives to strengthen brands and diversify portfolio will enable it to build brand equity on DairyPure by launching innovative products and improving marketing. Further, the company remains on track with its comprehensive productivity program, including OpEx 2020, and company-wide initiatives to drive efficiencies. Evidently, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company is progressing well on its OpEx 2020 cost productivity plan, which is aimed at generating annual savings in a range of $80-$100 million.Following the third-quarter results, the company slashed adjusted earnings guidance for 2017. The company now envisions adjusted earnings per share in the range of 80-90 cents, compared with the previous forecast of 80-95 cents.Still Interested in Consumer Staples Space?

132,MKC,"With rising consumer confidence, spending on beauty and personal care products in addition to apparel and footwear has increased. Moreover, the rise of e-commerce has driven growth of the beauty segment.The Estée Lauder Companies Inc (EL  -  Free Report), one of the leading manufacturer and marketer of beauty products, has been a favorite pick for investors. Shares of the company have surged 29% in the past six months compared with the industry’s gain of 13.2%. Recently, its shares have hit a new 52-week high of $111.79 during the trading session on Oct 16, eventually closing at $111.28.Let’s delve into the aspects which have been aiding the company’s impressive performanceE-commerce on the Rise Estée Lauder has been continuously opening sites across different regions and targeting sustained growth in its e-commerce platform. During the fiscal year 2017, global online sales of the company depicted a 33% growth to reach $1.3 billion. Further, Estée Lauder is implementing new technology and digital experiences including online booking for each store appointment and omni-channel loyalty programs. These initiatives are expected to boost the company’s top line.Well Planned AcquisitionsEstée Lauder has been widening its portfolio through acquisitions. The buyout of BECCA and Too Faced (during the first quarter of fiscal 2017) have strengthened its fastest-growing prestige portfolio. This, in turn, have contributed about 3.5 percentage points of the reported sales growth during the fiscal fourth quarter and approximately half the reported sales growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The recent investment in DECIEM — a fast-growing multi-brand company — is also expected to aid beauty sales in the forthcoming periods.Other notable acquisitions of Estée Lauder include By Kilian, RODIN olio lusso, GLAMGLOW and Le Labo. Such acquisitions aid the company to expand its portfolio and maintain the respective loyal customer base.Strategic Allocation of Resources & Marketing Fuels Sales Effective promotions help cosmetic and beauty companies to influence consumer sentiments and thereby enhance sales. Estée Lauder emphasizes heavily on marketing, especially through digital media and social networking.The company continues to reallocate resources and reduce costs under the Leading Beauty Forward initiative, in order to boost its beauty business. After its full implementation, Estée Lauder expects the initiative to yield annual net benefits, primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses of $200-$300 million, before taxes.Favorable EstimatesAhead of its first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate inched up by a penny to reach 97 cents in the past 30 days. Estimated earnings for the forthcoming quarter lie in the upper end of the management’s guidance of 94-97 cents. This marks an increase of 12% to 15% over the prior-year earnings of 84 cents. However, estimated earnings of $3.97 per share for the fiscal year 2018 surpass management’s anticipated range of $3.87-$3.94.Final Thoughts                                                                                Estée Lauder has been struggling with social and political issues in Hong Kong. Though the company is attempting to strengthen its business with local consumers in Hong Kong, we do not anticipate a significant increase in consumption from the region in the near term.Nevertheless, the company expects to easily offset such challenges based on its strong growth in other emerging regions. The Middle East, North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa and Asia Pacific markets offer extensive untapped potential for the company. Estée Lauder also expects strong growth of its brands in China, and has therefore been expanding steadily in the region.Moreover, Estée Lauder is strongly positioned in the beauty arena, with its robust brand portfolio and productive growth strategies. The company sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a VGM Score of B, indicating its inherent growth potential.Looking for More?

133,MKC,"The food industry’s performance has been dismal for quite some time now due to the prevailing pricing and competitive pressure. Evolving shopping behavior and increasing presence of small firms have been plaguing the industry. A shift in consumer preference toward non-genetically modified, organic, and gluten free products is also hurting business. The acquisition of Whole Foods by online giant Amazon.com has further made competitors skeptical and raised concerns.Despite industry-wide issues, Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) has been on a growth trajectory over the last few months. We believe Sysco’s impressive earnings history and solid growth strategies are making the stock a viable bet. Let’s delve deeper and try to find out what’s taking this food company higher.Why Invest in Sysco?Favorable Rank and VGM Score: Sysco, with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) flaunts a VGM Score of A, which makes it a favorable investing option. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. We note that the VGM Score is a comprehensive tool that will allow investors to filter through the standard scoring system and choose better winning stocks. In order to screen out potential winning stocks, we consider only those that have a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 and a VGM Score of A or B.Share Price Performance: Sysco has exhibited a bullish run in the past six months gaining roughly 4.6% as against the industry’s decline of 7.4%. The industry is currently placed at the top 35% of the 265 Zacks Classified industries. The stock also exceeded the Consumer Staples sector, which gained only 3.8% in the said time frame.  Further, we believe there is still much momentum left in the stock, which is quite evident from its low beta of 0.52 and a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.4%.Rising Estimates: Analysts have become increasingly bullish on the stock over the last 60 days with estimates moving up. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter is pegged at 73 cents, up from 72 cents per share in the said time frame. Similarly for fiscal 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate increased from $2.75 per share to $2.77, over the same time frame.Impressive Earnings History: Sysco delivered positive earnings surprises in six of the past seven quarters, with in-line results in one. Acquisition and margin improvement has been driving the company’s earnings. We note that Sysco has been consistently witnessing an improvement in sales, driven by acquisitions and volume growth. The buyouts of London-based Brakes Group and Supplies on the Fly e-commerce platform are encouraging. Sysco’s acquisition of London-based Brakes Group in July 2016 has benefited the company significantly. In fiscal 2017, Brakes performed reasonably well in midst of challenging environment in UK and it recorded earnings of 14 cents per share, exceeding its EPS estimates. Brakes is also making good progress in its supply chain transformational efforts, which is helping them to be efficient and will ultimately improve overall service and reduce costs.Sysco Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Sysco Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Sysco Corporation Quote Improving Margins: Sysco has been impressively managing expenses since the past few years and is making progress in both SG&A and supply chain, which is reflected in higher operating income growth.Further, Sysco delivered positive gross margins in the last nine quarters, after declining consistently since the last two fiscal. Modest inflation will also lead to margin improvement. Sysco was under deflationary pressure for an unprecedented six consecutive quarters, and the trend is finally beginning to shift toward inflation from the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Meat prices are abating, and dairy and produce prices have also begun to rise.Valuation Multiples: If we look into the company’s P/E and P/S multiples, we note that the company generally trades below its industry average.Sysco has a forward PE ratio of 19.6. This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 is 22.5. Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified industry’s PE ratio, which is pegged at 20.3. This indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.Right now, Sysco has a P/S ratio of about 0.5. This is significantly lower than the industry average of 1.8 and S&P 500 average, which comes in at 12.5 right now.Looking for More?

We believe its efforts to innovate products to boost sales is doing the trick for the company. Also, the cosmetics industry is also doing well at the moment.Upbeat Q2 Performance We note that Provo, UT-based Nu Skin posted upbeat second-quarter 2017 results, wherein both earnings and sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Further, it raised its guidance for full-year earnings. In fact, the company’s earnings have surpassed estimates in three of the trailing five quarters.Nu Skin’s revenues declined 2% due to foreign currency fluctuations. Revenues were adversely affected by dismal performance from Mainland China, South Asia/Pacific, Hong Kong/Taiwan, Japan and South Korea regions.

135,MKC,"The food industry has been in troubled waters of late. The industry has been grappling with challenges like stiff competition, tight margins and aggressive promotional environment. Moreover, customers are also becoming more inclined toward private label products as they are low-cost alternatives to national brands, which are hurting the food companies.With e-commerce major Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) acquiring the natural and organic foods supermarket chain Whole Foods Market investors became skeptical. The traditional food companies feared losing customers and had to face pricing pressure amid tight margins, as Amazon is expected to keep grocery prices low. Amazon’s deal has changed the retail landscape and has intensified competition both in stores and online.If we look into the industry’s performance, we note that it has lost around 10% year to date. On the other hand, the S&P 500 generated a return of 14% over the said time frame.Industry giants like General Mills, Inc. and Campbell Soup Company have also disappointed investors in their recently reported quarterly results. While General Mills missed both top and bottom-line expectations in first-quarter fiscal 2018, primarily hurt due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic food and lower sales of yogurts and cereals in North America, Campbell’s top and bottom-line results have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate as the company faces intense global competition for nearly all key products.Consequently, excessive pressure from competitors is likely to cause Campbell to incur greater marketing and other costs or reduce prices, all of these are likely to hurt the company's overall performance.Nevertheless, not all food majors are underperforming. Companies such as Pinnacle Foods, Inc., The J.M. Smucker Co. have resorted to cost cuts and are focusing on innovation to boost sales. Sysco Corp. and United Natural Foods, Inc. are banking on acquisitions to drive growth.McCormick & Company, Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report) has been gaining momentum of late driven by its efforts to boost its portfolio. Though rising material costs, sluggish sales in the U.K. and higher brand marketing expenses have raised concerns for sustaining the company’s performance, its acquisitions, cost savings and innovation initiatives bode well. The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company also posted upbeat third-quarter fiscal 2017 results recently and raised its fiscal outlook.

Their shares have rallied more than 20% year to date and have outperformed the S&P 500’s gain.The Ridgefield, CT-based The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc. (CHEF  -  Free Report), which is a distributor of specialty food products in the United States and Canada, is one such stock which is on the roll owing to strong growth prospects.

138,MKC,"TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (THS  -  Free Report) posted third-quarter 2017 results, wherein the top and the bottom line declined year over year. Also, earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were affected by volume pressure as well as challenges related to retail bid pricing and manufacturing. The divestiture of soup business marred the quarter’s performance.Following the results, the company lowered its 2017 earnings guidance, which weighed upon investors’ sentiment. Evidently, shares of TreeHouse Foods tumbled more than 35% on Nov 2. In the last six months, the company’s shares have lost 50.6% compared with the industry’s decline of 6.6%.Quarter in Detail Adjusted earnings of 67 cents per share fell 4.2% year over year and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents. Earnings were also below management’s guidance of 75-83 cents.Net sales of $1,548.8 million came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,527 million. However, sales declined 2.4% from last year owing to the divestiture of the SIF (Canned Soup and Infant Feeding) business. The divestiture lowered revenues by approximately 2.9%. This was slightly offset by gains from favorable pricing, currency translations and volume/mix. The top line also gained from product recall re-imbursements worth $1.7 million.Gross margin was 16.8% in the third quarter, down 120 basis points (bps) from the year-ago figure primarily due to lower sales. Product recalls, margin improvement initiatives and restructuring activities lowered gross margin by 0.5%. Further, gross margin was impacted by unfavorable volume mix as well as increased operating and commodity costs. These were partially offset by gains from reduced incentive compensation and depreciation.Adjusted EBITDA tumbled 12.7% to $148 million, due to higher commodity and operating costs, and adverse volume/mix. These were partially offset by a reduction in variable incentive compensation.Segment DetailsThe company’s reportable segments are organized by products and are classified into Baked Goods, Beverages, Condiments, Meals, and Snacks.Baked Goods: Sales from the segment increased 6.6% to $351.2 million. The segment gained from favorable volume/mix and foreign currency rates, partially offset by lower pricing. Direct operating income margin for the segment increased 310 bps to 13.4% owing to higher volume, lower selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) as well as lower operations and commodity costs.Beverages: Sales increased 4.3% to $244.9 million as a result of favorable volume/mix. This was partially offset by unfavorable pricing, resulting from enhanced competition. During the quarter, direct operating income margin declined 610 bps to 21.1% owing to lower pricing, higher commodity, freight and operating costs. These were partially compensated by lower SG&A expenses.Condiments: Sales for the segment increased 3.4% to $333.8 million as a result of favorable volume/mix, pricing and foreign exchange rates. In the third quarter, direct operating income margin declined 150 bps to 10.3%, primarily due to higher commodity and operating costs. These were partially offset by increase in volume and price and lower SG&A expenses.Meals: Net sales declined 18.2% to $284.6 million owing to the divestiture of the SIF business, adverse volume/mix in the ready-to-eat cereal category and unfavorable pricing. Direct operating income margin increased 180 bps to 11.3%. The upside was mainly due to favorable commodity costs and lower depreciation, which were partially offset by increased operating costs. .Snacks: Net sales from the segment declined 5.4% to $332.6 million, owing to adverse volume/mix arising out of weak consumer trends and exit of low margin co-pack business. These were partially offset by favorable pricing. Direct operating income margin fell 480 bps to 0.5% due to unfavorable volume/mix, increased commodity and operating costs. These were partially compensated through lower SG&A expenses.Treehouse Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Treehouse Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Treehouse Foods, Inc.

139,MKC,"Coty Inc (COTY  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 9, before the opening bell.The company has been undertaking several efforts to augment its portfolio and transform its brands. Such initiatives led to higher fixed and operating costs, which are weighing on the company’s profitability. The company’s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 27.7%.Also, these factors have caused Coty’s shares to decline 15.5% in the past six months, as against the industry’s increase of 8.2%.  With these aspects in mind, let’s look into some factors that are likely to impact the company’s first-quarter results.What to Expect? The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has been stable in the past 30 days at 7 cents per share. The estimated earnings figure reflects a decline of 69.6% from the year-ago figure of 23 cents. However, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2,224 million for the first quarter, a substantial increase from the prior-year reported sales of $1,080 million.Coty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Coty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Coty Inc. Quote Factors Impacting the Quarter Product launches are expected to continue driving Coty’s performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The company consistently introduces new products in response to shifting consumer preferences and makes use of strategic advertising and merchandising skills to market new launches. In this regard, the company made several launches during fiscal 2017 including products like Hugo Iced, Boss Tonic and Chloe Love Story Eau Sensuelle. Additionally, Coty is expected to benefit from its ongoing repositioning and reinvention of the COVERGIRL brand.Furthermore, Coty continuously evaluates strategic acquisitions and new brand licenses to enhance its portfolio. In this respect the company has been significantly gaining from the acquisitions of ghd and Younique. Positive synergies from the company’s acquisitions and licensing agreements are expected to benefit first-quarter fiscal 2018 results as well. The company has also been undertaking digital transformation efforts to augment its e-commerce offerings.While we expect such efforts to positively impact the company’s top line, the bottom-line performance is anticipated to remain challenged due to enhanced marketing expenses. Although the company’s acquisitions, product launches and brand transformation efforts have strengthened its portfolio, such efforts have led to increased marketing spending. Moreover, the company expects increased fixed costs and operating expenses during the first half of fiscal 2018, owing to higher marketing investments.Further, the company has been facing several headwinds in its Consumer Beauty segment, especially in North America. Weak market trends across some of its categories and reduction of shelf space for a few brands like Astor has been dragging the segment’s performance lately. These trends are also expected to affect the company’s first-quarter fiscal 2018 results.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not show that Coty is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) as well as a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen.

Further, organic sales were fueled by higher volumes of 6.9% that was partly offset by 3.7% higher promotional investments. Also, hurricanes hurt organic sales growth by roughly 20 basis points (bps).Gross margin declined 10 basis points to 45.3% due to higher promotion and coupon investments in the domestic business. This was somewhat compensated by favorable volumes and positive effects of buyouts and divestitures. Adjusted operating margin declined 200 bps to 20.5%, due to higher SG&A ratio and lower gross margin.Segment DetailsConsumer Domestic: Segment net sales increased 9.7% to $729.2 million, while organic sales were up 2.2% as 7.1% higher volume growth overshadowed the 4.9% negative impact from price stemming from higher promotional investments.ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, cat litter and baking soda, BATISTE dry shampoo and OXICLEAN stain fighters remained the main growth drivers.

Organic sales jumped 6.2% driven by 7.1% higher volumes, which was partly negated by negative price effect of 0.9% from higher promotional investments.FEMFRESH, OXICLEAN and STERIMAR in the export business, STERIMAR and ARM & HAMMER baking soda in Mexico, FEMFRESH in Australia as well as ARM & HAMMER cat litter and BATISTE in Canada provided a major impetus to sales.Specialty Products: The segment sales showed an increase of 5.3% to $3.8 million.

The company also terminated its previously authorized buyback plan, while it continues to have its evergreen repurchase plan. Church & Dwight currently has 250 million shares available for repurchase.Guidance for 2017The company remains impressed with its organic sales growth in all three segments, which was backed by continued investments. Also, Church & Dwight’s stable portfolio of value and premium products, launch of new and innovative products, and aggressive productivity programs should keep driving its performance. Management remains committed toward innovations in particular, as it believes that remains the biggest driver for its top and bottom line growth in future.The company now expects reported sales to grow 7% and organic sales to rise 2.5% in 2017. Earlier, it anticipated reported and organic sales growth of approximately 3%.

141,MKC,"Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NUS  -  Free Report) posted third-quarter 2017 results, wherein earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the top and the bottom line declined year over year due to lower sales leaders and weak performance in the regions of South Korea, Japan and Hong Kong/Taiwan. As a result, management trimmed guidance for 2017.This led to negative sentiment among investors, as Nu Skin’s shares dipped 1.4% during after-market trading hours on Nov 1. However, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has outperformed the industry in the past three months owing to its consistent efforts to improve performance through product launches. Nu Skin’s shares have returned 4.1% as against the industry’s 2.6% decline.Q3 Highlights The company posted earnings of 76 cents per share which met the higher end of management’s previous outlook of 74-76 cents. However, earnings slumped 22.4% from the prior-year period, due to lower revenues and margins. A higher tax rate negatively impacted the quarter’s performance. Revenues of $563.7 million in the third quarter were almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $564 million, but slipped 6.7% from the prior-year quarter. On a constant-currency basis, revenues dropped 5.8%. Dismal performance from the Hong Kong/Taiwan, Japan and South Korea regions dragged overall revenues of Nu Skin.Also the prior-year results benefited from LTOs (limited-time-offer) which increased the number of sales leaders. This trend was absent during the quarter under review, which impacted the year-over-year comparison. Further, foreign currency affected revenues by 1% during the quarter.The company’s sales leaders recorded a year-over-year decline of 4.6% to 64,200, due to the absence of prior-year’s LTOs. On the other hand, Nu Skin’s customer base increased 7% to 1,069,000 from the prior-year quarter.The company's gross profit declined 7.4% to $442.9 million, with the gross margin shrinking 60 basis points (bps) to 78.6%.Further, operating income plunged 21.8% to $64.3 million and operating margin decreased 220 bps to 11.4%.Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.

Event, the company had announced plans to launch several new products and sales programs to operate more efficiently.For fiscal 2017, management slightly trimmed revenues and earnings view.

142,MKC,"Despite the fact that input costs are on the rise across the industry with additional capacity only likely to increase these costs further, there are some food stocks with something unique to offer that make them Strong Buys (Zacks Rank #1). (You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here).Since I’ve chosen a motley crowd, including a specialty foods supplier, a frozen foods supplier and a couple of meat producers, it’s hard to get into industry specifics. Suffice it to say that not all food companies are created equal. So there are opportunities in the space that we can tap into.  McCormick & Company, Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report)McCormick & Co is a global leader in the manufacture, marketing and distribution of spices, herbs, seasonings, flavorings and other specialty food products. The company also, through subsidiary corporations, manufactures and markets specialty plastic bottles and tubes for food, personal care and other industries.The factors pressuring the market include rising input costs, increasing private label competition particularly given Amazon’s Whole Foods acquisition and, in McCormick’s case, also high (although manageable) financial leverage. Finally, there was the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser’s food division, including Frank's Red Hot and French's mustard that required it to both issue fresh shares (so dilution) and additional debt (so increased leverage).But there are also factors working in its favor, including the benefits from the acquisition such as market consolidation and therefore increased negotiating power with retailers, scope for international expansion and management’s stated goal of bringing down the leverage over the next three years with the resultant positive impact on earnings. The acquisition aside, McCormick enjoys a coveted position in the specialty foods space because it sells spices, use of which is likely to increase as against sugary or salty foods sold by others, usage of which is coming down. It therefore enjoys some pricing power.The industrial business is a nice complement to the consumer business and provides a hedge because it generates stronger growth off a smaller base of more diverse customers. The company also shows a slow and steady earnings growth rate, which helps it pay a nice dividend year upon year. The company is expected to grow revenue 9.3% in 2017 and less than 11.5% in 2018. It is expected to grow earnings 10.9% and 10.8%, respectively, this year and next. The current quarter earnings estimate is up 4.2%. The 2017 estimate is up 2.7% and 2018 estimate is up 4.3% in the last 60 days. The company topped estimates in each of the last four quarters at an average rate of 4.0%.Nomad Foods (NOMD  -  Free Report)Feltham, UK-based Nomad Foods Ltd. manufactures and distributes frozen foods primarily in the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Sweden, France and Norway. The company's portfolio of frozen food brands includes Birds Eye, Iglo and Findus, which it acquired over the last few years.Nomad’s strategy is to grow through acquisitions. It typically focuses resources on 4-5 categories in each country, in which it seeks to command significant market share and generate strong gross margins. These categories are, by definition, its “must-win battles,” attracting the bulk of R&D, advertising and promotion money. Another group comprising 10-20% of revenue gets some R&D but no advertising money. The rest of the business is managed for cost and allowed to die a natural death where necessary. The company is expected to grow revenue 6.7% in 2017 and less than 1% in 2018. It is expected to grow earnings 19.6% and 17.7%, respectively, this year and next. The earnings estimate for the December quarter is up 33.3%. The 2017 estimate is up 11.1% and 2018 estimate is up 18.2% in the last 60 days.Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report)Tyson Foods is the world's largest fully-integrated producer, processor and marketer of chicken and poultry-based food products. Tyson is a comprehensive supplier of value-added chicken products through food service, retail grocery stores, club stores and international distribution channels. Although its core business is chicken, in the U.S., Tyson is also the second largest maker of corn and flour tortillas under the Mexican Original brand and through its subsidiary Cobb Vantress, the top chicken breeding stock supplier.The meat production industry is highly competitive although Tyson, along with a few others command leading market share. All the top meat producers have extensive chicken processing operations, so they have been impacted by regulatory scrutiny on price fixing charges. It’s also true that for whatever reason, chicken prices have been robust, helping these companies.The other factor is demand, which is based on increased consumption across the world, especially by the growing middle class in developing countries that will account for most of the growth. The USDA estimates that broiler meat production will grow 1% this year partly because of numerous outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) across Asia, Africa, Europe, Russia and the U.S. as offset by the growing demand for low-cost animal protein. Given the low production growth rate, companies with a broad product range, distribution capacity/relationships are likely to be more successful (provided they can also find a way to keep costs down).It’s also been reported that major distributors/grocers like Costco are starting their own poultry operations, which may have an impact on the big meat producers and can also hurt their margins.Tyson also generates some revenue from other meats like beef that while generating lower margins, result in steadier volumes. China lifting the beef ban is a positive in this respect, which along with continued strength in domestic demand are good for its results.Tyson has consistently grown revenues in each of the last 10 years barring 2016. That trend is already reversing this year. Gross profits, EBIT, EBITDA and net income have also moved up steadily, particularly after 2014. With cost savings from the AdvancePierre integration, supply chain improvements and elimination of 450 management positions across three locations yet to kick in, the company is likely to see margin expansion. The recent spike in the debt level may help finance the Kansas chicken processing plant it’s planning to build.Tyson’s surprise history hasn’t been anything to write home about, with the company missing estimates almost as frequently as it beat. But it’s encouraging that its earnings estimates are showing an upward trend. Accordingly, estimates for 2017 and 2018 are up 1% and 6.8%, respectively. Overall earnings are expected to be up 17.0% this year and 7.3% in 2018 despite much slower revenue growth expectations.Pilgrim's Pride Corp. (PPC  -  Free Report)Pilgrim's Pride is one of the largest chicken companies in the U.S., Mexico and Puerto Rico. The company's fresh chicken retail line is sold throughout the U.S., throughout Puerto Rico, and in the northern and central regions of Mexico. Its prepared chicken products are sold to some of the largest customers in the food service industry across the US. Additionally, commodity chicken products are exported to over 90 countries.Being a vertically integrated company, it controls every phase of the production including feed mills, hatcheries, processing plants and distribution centers across the U.S., Puerto Rico and Mexico. This helps it to keep costs down.The company recently acquired JBS-owned Moy Park, which has extensive operations in the UK from where it sources its chickens. These are mostly sold to supermarkets and quick service restaurants in the UK and Ireland itself although some of the production is also sold to European countries. So the acquisition enables expansion into the European market through a local player. This is perfect in terms of acceptance (local brand), geographical diversification (an important market in Europe) and cost savings (costs to be eliminated on integration of Moy Park will be around $50 million).People’s Pride’s revenue shows an upward trend over the last ten years. While 2015 and 2016 could have been better, 2017 is shaping up to be a good year with the revenue growth returning. The profitability ratios tell the same story. Moreover, 2017 estimates have jumped 98% and 2018 estimated have jumped over 10% in the last 60 days. The surprise ratio has been generally disappointing, but there was a positive (turning point?) in the last quarter.   Wrapping UpWhile each of these companies have a strong market position and factors supporting steady growth over the long term, it’s worth noting that they are all trading at a premium to the industry. So while some may fear downside risk, the fact remains that these are stocks that we may want to accumulate.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

144,MKC,"McCormick & Company, Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report) has been gaining momentum of late driven by its efforts to boost its portfolio. Though rising material costs, sluggish sales in the U.K. and higher brand marketing expenses have raised concerns for sustaining the company’s performance, its acquisitions and innovation initiatives bode well for the company. Moreover, its cost-saving initiatives has significantly aided profitability.The company also posted upbeat third-quarter fiscal 2017 results recently and raised its fiscal year outlook. Let’s delve deeper into the earnings performance as well as other factors which are providing an impetus to the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company to scale higher.Robust Third-Quarter ResultsMcCormick outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2017. In fact, the company delivered positive earnings surprise in 13 of the last 15 quarters. Earnings grew on the back of cost savings as well as lower currency impacted earnings, while acquisition of food division of Reckitt Benckiser Group (RB Foods) and Enrico Giotti SpA and a shift in the portfolio to more value added products boosted sales. Despite higher brand marketing expenses and material costs, the company delivered double-digit adjusted operating income growth and expanded its adjusted operating income margin, marking seven consecutive quarters of margin expansion.The company also raised its sales, operating income and earnings guidance to reflect the acquisition of RB Foods. Moreover, the company expects lower currency impact on fiscal 2017 earnings.

Estimates increased 3.7% for fiscal 2017 and 2.2% for fiscal 2018, respectively.McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | McCormick & Company, Incorporated QuoteAcquisitions Boosting SalesMcCormick has been strategically increasing its presence through acquisitions in order to grow its spices and seasonings portfolio. In the emerging markets too, the company has extended its reach where it had little or no distribution. The recent acquisition of RB Foods in August is the largest deal for the company till date. The deal has added iconic brands like Frank's RedHot Hot Sauce, French's Mustard, French's Crispy Vegetables and Cattlemen's BBQ Sauce to the company’s robust spices portfolio. These brands will position the company in the leading U.S. condiments category and will strengthen and expand McCormick's business presence internationally.

145,MKC,"Behind a successful investor is a lot of homework. There is no thumb rule that for getting lucrative returns, one should invest in risky stocks although the strategy works well when the market is bullish.We have created an investment strategy which proves that less-risky stocks could also give handsome returns if some parameters are taken into account.Beta UnderstandingBeta measures the volatility or risks to a security relative to the market (we are considering the S&P 500 here). That is, beta measures the extent to which the price of a stock moves with respect to the market.If the beta is equal to 1 it means that the stock is as volatile as the market. So, a stock is relatively more volatile if it has beta greater than 1 and less volatile if beta is less than 1.For example, if the beta is 1.8 then the stock will witness 80% more movement than the market.  Hence, we can say that if the market goes up, the stock will outperform by 80%. Conversely, if the market plunges, the stock will lose much more value than the market.Building a Low-Risk PortfolioIn order to find stocks with lower-than-market volatility, we added beta between 0 and 0.6 as our main criterion for screening. However, we need to keep in mind that low beta is not the only metric to be considered for choosing stocks in a volatile market. Hence to reach the winning strategy, we have considered a few additional criteria.Percentage Change in Price in the last 4 Weeks: We considered those stocks that saw positive price movement over the last month.Average 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable.Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank equal to 1: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks indicate that they will significantly outperform the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.Here are five of the 18 stocks that fit the bill:Headquartered in Niwot, CO, Crocs (CROX  -  Free Report) is involved in designing casual footwear for men, women and children. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 83.89%. Also, the company’s earnings for 2017 will likely grow 92.6%.Guess?, Inc. (GES  -  Free Report), headquartered in Los Angeles, CA, is the designer and supplier of casual apparel and accessories for men, women and children. The company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 20.57% for the last four quarters. Also, the firm’s earnings for fiscal year 2018 is expected to grow by 31.1%.Headquartered in Portland, OR,Craft Brew Alliance (BREW  -  Free Report) is the leading seller of craft beers in the United States. For 2017, the company’s earnings will likely grow 350%. Also, Craft Brew surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in two of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 222.74%.Founded in 1889 and based in Sparks, MD, McCormick & Company (MKC  -  Free Report) is a leading marketer of spices, seasonings, specialty foods and flavors to the entire food industry across the globe. The company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 3.97% for the last four quarters.Headquartered in Greeley, CO, Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (PPC  -  Free Report) primarily processes and supplies fresh and frozen chicken products. For 2017, we are expecting the company to witness year-over-year earnings growth of more than 47%.

These were partially offset by sluggish retail environment in the United States and weak performance of the company’s Bobbi and Clinique brands.Fragrance category reported revenue growth of 8% (up 7% on a constant currency basis) to reach $476 million driven by increased sales of luxury brands such as Le Labo, Tom Ford and Jo Malone London, partially offset by declines in certain Estée Lauder and designer fragrances.Hair Care sales amounted $136 million and remained flat compared with the prior year, owing to moderate growth of Bumble and bumble as Aveda brands. These were countered by lower sales of Origins hair care products.Regional Results Sales in the Americas increased 8% (up 7% on a constant currency basis) to $1,329 million, benefiting from the acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA. The company’s online and specialty-multi channels registered strong growth in the region, including increased sales across a number of brands.

Weak sales in Latin America also impacted sales negatively.Sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa region improved 20% (up 18% on a constant currency basis) to $1,258 million owing to enhanced retail travel sales and growth across most of the key markets. Foreign currency changes favorably impacted the region’s results, with significant gains in Russia and Italy. Nevertheless, the Middle East region registered lower sales in the quarter owing to macro-economic challenges.In the Asia/Pacific region sales improved 16% (up 17% on a constant currency basis) to $687 million.

148,MKC,"The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) posted robust first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both top and bottom line topped estimates and grew year over year. Notably, earnings marked the fourth straight quarterly beat, while sales surpassed estimates for the second consecutive quarter.Q1 HighlightsQuarterly earnings from continuing operations of $1.46 per share jumped 7% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.41. Results primarily gained from solid sales and gross margin expansion.Clorox Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Clorox Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Clorox Company (The) QuoteNet sales of $1,500 million advanced nearly 4% year over year, also coming ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,478 million. The top line beat was driven by growth across the United Sates and International businesses, as well as 4% rise in volumes. Growth at the International business was backed by increased pricing, offset by unfavorable mix.Clorox’s gross margin expanded 50 basis points (bps) to 44.9% in the quarter, thanks to efficient cost savings and improved pricing in the International business, somewhat offset by increase in manufacturing and logistics expenses as well as greater commodity expenses.Revenue by SegmentSales in the Cleaning segment improved 5% to $559 million, mainly driven by strength in Home Care with higher shipments for several Clorox branded products, particularly Clorox disinfecting wipes, along with Scentiva wipes and sprays introduced in January 2017.Household sales grew 5% to $441 million aided by volume growth across all businesses, particularly Cat Litter. Results also benefited from increased merchandising activity for product innovation in Bags and Wraps and greater shipments of Glad premium trash bags.Sales at the Lifestyle segment rose 4% to $246 million driven by strength in Burt's Bees Natural Personal Care, which witnessed double-digit volume growth. Top-line growth also reflected the benefits of improved sales in Dressings and Sauces, supported by increased merchandising for bottled Hidden Valley ranch products.In the International business segment, sales grew 1% to $254 million driven by improved pricing, partly negated by volume declines, particularly in Argentina.FinancialsClorox ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $468 million, and long-term debt of $1,787 million. In first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company generated $257 million of net cash from continuing operations.Looking AheadFollowing the first-quarter results, the company slashed guidance for fiscal 2018 to include the hurricane-related impacts and the divestiture of the Aplicare business in August 2017.The company now expects fiscal 2018 sales growth in a range of 1-3%, compared with the previous guidance of 2-4% growth. The lowered guidance reflects a slightly less than 1 percentage point reduction in the fiscal year related to the Aplicare divestiture.Gross margin is now estimated to be down slightly, versus the earlier guidance of expanding slightly. The recent guidance reflects significant cost pressures due to the recent hurricanes, particularly in the second and third quarters.Driven by an anticipated 10 cent impact from hurricanes, the company now envisions fiscal 2018 earnings from continuing operations to range from $5.47-$5.67 per share, reflecting a 5 cent decline from the previous guidance of $5.52-$5.72 per share. However, the company anticipates the impacts of hurricanes to be partly mitigated by continued strength in its underlying business performance. Clorox currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Milling and Other operations were weak as well due to lower volumes, while product margins remained strong. Transportation results were impacted by diminished U.S. grain exports and slow start to North American harvest.Archer Daniels' Corn Processing segment’s adjusted operating profit improved 18.2% to $253 million. Results benefited from enhanced margins at North America Sweeteners and Starches. Further, favorable ethanol margins drove Bioproducts results.The Oilseeds Processing segment’s adjusted operating profit decreased 17.9% year over year to $119 million. Results were hurt by reduced global crush margins as well as lower South American origination margins. Together, these factors hampered Crushing and origination results.

However, results in Asia continued to gain from Wilmar’s contributions.The Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients segment’s adjusted operating profit dropped 16.4% to $61 million owing to hurdles in the specialty ingredients business. This was partly offset by double-digit rise in WILD Flavors’ operating profit driven by strong sales in Asia and EMEA.FinancialsArcher Daniels ended the quarter with $518 million in cash and cash equivalents.

150,MKC,"Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc (NUS  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1, after the closing bell.The company is expected to gain from ongoing innovation and sales-enhancing initiatives. However, lower revenues from Mainland China and negative currency fluctuations are expected to hurt Nu Skin’s performance.Notably, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimates in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 10.8%. We note that this has helped Skin to outperform the industry in the past year. Its shares have returned 2.3% as against the industry’s decline of 7.8%.So let’s look at how things are shaping up prior to the upcoming third-quarter results.What to Expect? The Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings for the third quarter is pegged at 76 cents, which reflects a year-over-year decline of approximately 29.1%. Further, the consensus mark has declined by a penny over the past 30 days.Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $564.3 million for the quarter under review, representing a 6.6% drop from the year-ago period. Expected revenues are, however, higher than management’s projected range of $559-$563 million for the said period.Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. QuoteFactors at Play  From a regional perspective, we note that the performance of the EMEA region has been positively impacting the company’s sales. The consensus estimate of revenues for the third quarter is expected to rise for the EMEA region to reach $39.1 million approximately, depicting growth of 6%.Consensus estimate of revenues from the South Asia/Pacific region is also expected to grow 8.7% from the prior year, to reach $77 million. However, dismal performance in Mainland China is expected to continue in the third quarter as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this region is expected at $168 million, depicting a 22.4% decline from the prior year. Revenues are also expected to be negatively impacted by currency fluctuations.Nevertheless, the beauty segment has been benefitting from increased consumer confidence and spending. In order to gain from these trends, Nu Skin remains committed toward innovation and product launches to suit consumer needs and thereby expand market share. The company also expects its top line to gain from product launches, lined up for the second half of 2017 as well as 2018.Earlier this month, the company’s focus on these endeavors led management to raise the lower end of its earnings view for the third quarter.Nu Skin now expects earnings in the range of 74-76 cents per share, compared with the previously anticipated range of 71-76 cents.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?

151,MKC,"It has been more than a month since the last earnings report for McCormick & Company, Incorporated (MKC  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 2.5% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.McCormick Tops Q3 Earnings, View Up on AcquisitionsMcCormick posted third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both the company’s earnings and revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company raised its sales, operating income and earnings guidance to reflect the acquisition of food division of Reckitt Benckiser Group (RB Foods) and lower currency impact on earnings.Adjusted earnings of $1.12 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05 by 6.7%. We note that the company has delivered positive earnings surprise in 13 of the last 15 quarters, excluding the current quarter. In the third quarter, adjusted earnings were also 9% higher year over year owing to higher operating income. Further, the favorable impact of higher sales and cost savings were offset by an increase in brand marketing and material costs and currency headwinds.Revenues and ProfitsIn the reported quarter the global leader in flavors and spices generated revenues of $1,185 million, which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,146 million by 3.4%. Revenues grew about 9% from the prior-year quarter, including currency tailwinds of 1%. Sales were driven by strong base business and impressive product portfolio growth.The acquisitions (RB Foods in August 2017 and Enrico Giotti SpA in December 2016) also contributed to higher sales by 4%. Excluding currency impact, revenues grew 7%, driven by both the consumer and industrial segments.The company’s adjusted operating income grew 18.6% to $204 million in the third quarter. On a constant currency basis, it increased 19% due to higher sales, cost savings and lower selling, general & administrative costs. A shift in the portfolio to more value added products also boosted sales.Segment DetailsConsumer Business: Segment revenues grew 5%, primarily driven by strong base business and new product sales compared with the year-ago period. Solid performance in the Americas was driven by the acquisition of RB Foods as well as strong pricing, new products and expanded distribution. Sales also grew in China and India, which were partially offset by weak sales in the United Kingdom, where the retail environment suffers from stiff competition.Adjusted operating income grew 9%, on a constant currency basis, driven by the favorable impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offsetting the impact of higher material costs and brand marketing expenses.Industrial Business: Industrial segment sales grew 14% with minimum impact from currency, driven by increased sales across all three of its regions. While sales in the Americas were led by continued growth momentum in branded foodservice, as well as incremental sales from RB Foods, sales in EMEA region was driven by sales from Giotti acquisition.Sales to both quick service restaurants and packaged food companies also increased during the quarter. Industrial sales in the Asia/Pacific region increased in the quarter driven by new products and promotional activities of quick service restaurants.On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income rose 44% year over year, driven by favorable impact of higher sales, product mix and CCI-led cost savings and favorable selling, general and administrative costs, more than offset the unfavorable impact of increases in material costs and an increase in brand marketing.Fiscal 2017 Guidance RaisedFor fiscal 2017, the company has revised its guidance reflecting the acquisition of RB Foods and lower currency impact on earnings. The company now expects sales to grow approximately 9-10% in fiscal 2017, in comparison with approximately 4-6% announced earlier. Excluding currency, McCormick expects sales to grow approximately 10-11% in fiscal 2017, in comparison with approximately 5-7% announced previously.The company expects higher brand marketing, increased pricing, new products, expanded distribution and acquisitions to contribute to the growth. Further, the company anticipates pricing actions to offset higher material costs, which are anticipated to rise by mid-single digits. In addition, the company has raised its cost savings target to at least $105 million, compared with the earlier goal of approximately $100 million.The company now expects 2017 adjusted operating income to grow approximately 20-21%, from adjusted operating income of $657 million in 2016. Previously, the company anticipated adjusted operating income growth of 8-10%. On constant currency basis, adjusted operating income is now expected to grow 21-22%.Driven by higher sales and operating income, McCormick now expects 2017 adjusted earnings in the range of $4.20-$4.24 per share, compared with $4.05-$4.13 per share estimated previously. This marks an increase of 11-12% compared with $3.78 in 2016. Also, currency will unfavorably impact earnings by 1%, compared to 2 percentage points previously.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter.McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price and Consensus  McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price and Consensus | McCormick & Company, Incorporated QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, McCormick's stock has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum is doing a bit better with a D.

152,MKC,"Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) posted third-quarter 2017 results, wherein both the top and bottom line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the latter also grew year over year. While the top line marked a recovery from two consecutive misses, bottom line marked its third straight beat. Notably, Pinnacle Foods has been witnessing year-over-year growth in earnings since 2014.Further, management reaffirmed its full-year adjusted earnings guidance at the low end of its previously stated range. It looks like the conservative stance and a decline in top line weighed upon investors’ sentiment, as Pinnacle Foods’ shares dipped 3.1% on Oct 26. Nonetheless, backed by an impressive earnings history, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has rallied 8.9% over a year, as against the industry’s downside of 7.1%.Q3 HighlightsAdjusted earnings of 58 cents per share rose 9.4% from the year-ago period, and came a penny ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  However, GAAP earnings for the quarter came in at 39 cents, compared with 44 cents in the prior-year period.Net sales fell 1.2% to roughly $750 million, while it came slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $749 million. While underlying sales grew 3.1%, it was more than offset by an adverse 3.6% impact from the exit of certain low-margin Aunt Jemima (AJ) frozen breakfast products that were sold to retail and foodservice consumers. Top line was also hampered by lingering impacts from the 2016 shutdown of Boulder UK operations and SKU rationalization plan. Hurricanes Harvey and Irma also dented net sales by 0.7%.Management further stated that the company’s in-market performance remained quite strong in the third quarter, as its retail consumption jumped 3.5% from the year-ago period and market share elevated by 0.7 share points. This also marked Pinnacle Foods’ 14th straight quarter of market share growth, when compared with the same year-ago period.Adjusted gross profit decreased 5.4% to $216.7 million with the gross margin contraction of 130 basis points (bps) to 28.9%. This was attributable to adverse impacts from the hurricanes along with various discrete costs associated with AJ’s exit and production investments undertaken in second-quarter 2017.Consequently, adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) slipped 3.1% to $130.4 million in the quarter.Segment DetailsFrozen: Segment sales declined 4.1% to $301.4 million on account of the hurricanes and AJ’s exit. Underlying sales remained flat year over year, as favorable impacts from net realized pricing and currency translations were offset by lower volume/mix. Adjusted EBIT for the segment dropped 11.1% to $52.5 million, owing to the aforementioned discrete costs, along with higher input costs and marketing expenses which could not be compensated by increased productivity.Grocery: Segment sales rose 4.4% to $270.4 million backed by solid volume/mix growth and favorable net price realization, partly countered by the detrimental impacts from hurricanes. Adjusted EBIT for the segment grew 4.7% to $58 million backed by enhanced net sales; productivity savings and synergies from the Boulder Brands acquisition. These were offset by the factors that hurt operating income at the Frozen segment.Boulder: Pinnacle Foods completed the acquisition of Boulder Brands on Jan 15, 2016. Consequently, it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. In third-quarter 2017, sales at the Boulder segment jumped 9.3% to $101 million, fueled by robust underlying volume/mix growth, along with favorable net price realization. This was somewhat mitigated by the SKU rationalization program and shutdown of the Boulder UK operations. Adjusted EBIT for the Boulder Brands segment totaled $18.6 million, representing a surge of 49% from the prior-year quarter.Specialty Foods: Segment sales tumbled 17.2% to $77 million due to reduced volume/mix, impacts from the AJ exit and lower net price realization. Well, the volume/mix was majorly hurt by the company’s previously announced exit from its gardein private label business. Also, the segment’s adjusted EBIT plunged 21.3% to $7.3 million in the reported quarter.Other Financial AspectsPinnacle Foods ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $131.3 million, long-term debt of $2,936.4 million, and total equity of $1,967.5 million.In the first three quarters of 2017, the company generated cash flow from operations of $178.7 million and incurred capital expenditure of $70.5 million.2017 GuidanceManagement remains impressed with its in-market performance in the third quarter, as all the retail segments delivered consumption and market share growth. Moreover, management noted that its bottom line has grown nearly 20% through the third quarter. Going forward, the company expects results to be stronger, and anticipates gross margin for 2017 to be in line with 2016. Also, Pinnacle Foods is on track with its network optimization plan, and remains committed toward achieving its long-term margin goal for 2019 and onward.  All said, Pinnacle Foods reaffirmed its adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2017 in the band of $2.55-$2.60, and still expects the bottom line to come at the lower end of this range. This outlook, which includes the effects of the aforementioned discrete items and the back-to-back hurricanes, reflects a year-over-year increase of nearly 19%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $2.55 for 2017, which marks the lower-end of the company’s forecasted range.Net sales and adjusted earnings for 2017 are anticipated to gain roughly 1% and 3 cents, respectively, from the 53rd week, which is likely to benefit the fourth quarter.However, the company now expects input cost inflation to be 3% on account of greater-than-anticipated transport costs. Productivity is now estimated to be slightly more than 4% of the cost of products sold. Notably, this does not include the synergies (of at least $15 million) from Boulder Brands acquisition, which are likely to have a favorable impact on the gross margin as well as SG&A costs.Capital expenditures for the full year are now expected to be $100 million, compared with the old projection of $115-$125 million.Looking for More?

During the quarter gains from the cost-saving initiatives under the company’s funding-the-growth and 2012 Restructuring Program, were neutralized by increased raw and packaging material expenses.In the reported quarter, adjusted operating profit of $985 million dipped 4%, with the adjusted operating margin contracting 160 basis points (bps) to 24.8%. Operating margin decline can be attributed to 140 bps rise in adjusted selling, general & administrative expenses as a percentage of sales, which included higher investments in advertising.Year to date, Colgate’s market share of manual toothbrushes has reached 32.6%. Further, the company continued to lead with market share in the global toothpaste with a gain of 43.5% year to date.Segment DiscussionNorth America net sales (20% of total sales) fell 0.5%, reflecting a 4% decline in pricing offset by 3% rise in unit volume and favorable currency impacts of 0.5%.

On an organic basis, sales for Asia Pacific were flat with last year.Africa/Eurasia net sales (6% of total sales) inched up 0.5% year over year, fueled by 2.5% gains from both pricing and positive currency effects, partly offset by 4.5% drop in unit volumes. Volume declines in the Sub-Saharan Africa and Middle East regions, were partly offset by gains in Russia. Organic sales for Africa/Eurasia dropped 2%.Hill’s Pet Nutrition net sales (15% of total sales) were up 2% from the year-ago quarter. During the quarter, positive impact of 1% from increase in unit volume and currency were somewhat neutralized by flat pricing.

Net cash provided by operating activities came in at $2,295 million for the nine months ended Sep 30, 2017.Other DevelopmentsAcknowledging the success of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program to date, the company’s board on Oct 26 approved an expansion and extension of the program through Dec 31, 2019. This will enable the company to take advantage of the incremental opportunities in the process of streamlining operations. The expansion is expected to attract cumulative after-tax charges of $1,280-$1,380 million from the program, marking an increase from the previously estimated charges of $1,120-$1,170 million. After-tax charges for 2017 are now likely to be in the range of $250-$280 million.Additionally, the company expects after-tax savings from the program to increase to $500-$575 million, compared with $425-$475 million estimated earlier. The projected savings target a three to four year average cash payback, with an after-tax rate of return above 30%.OutlookLooking forward, Colgate anticipates the backdrop to remain challenging due to uncertain global markets and slowing category growth worldwide. However, the company remains on track with its brand building and productivity maximization initiatives. Consequently, the company reiterated low-single digits growth projection for both net sales and organic sales for 2017.Including the impact of the expanded Global Growth and Efficiency Program, the company continues to expect gross margin expansion for 2017, along with mid-single digits percentage decline in GAAP earnings per share.Excluding the restructuring charges resulting from the program and other one-time items, the company projects strong cash flow generation, gross margin expansion and higher advertising investments for 2017.

It was favorably impacted by volume growth, reduced marketing, research and general spending and cost savings of $125 million from the FORCE (Focused on Reducing Costs Everywhere) program.

155,MKC,"After reporting weaker-than-expected results in the first half of 2017, Philip Morris International Inc (PM  -  Free Report) continued with its dismal performance in the third quarter. Both earnings and revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in third-quarter 2017 results. Moreover, the company lowered its earnings guidance for 2017 due to higher impact of unfavorable currency.Quarter in Detail Adjusted earnings of $1.27 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.39. While the company benefited from strong pricing and growth in Reduced Risk Products, lower cigarette volumes hurt its performance. Nevertheless, adjusted earnings in the reported quarter inched up 1.6% from the year-ago periodNet revenue, excluding excise taxes, was $7,473 million, which increased 7% (up 9% excluding unfavorable currency of $136 million) in the third quarter. Favorable pricing and volume/mix in the quarter drove revenues. While, revenue increased across Asia, Latin America & Canada and the European Union (EU), the same had declined in Eastern Europe, the Middle East & Africa (EEMA).During the quarter, revenues from combustible products declined 3.6% (down 4.6% excluding negative currency) to $6.5 billion. On the contrary, Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) reported a whopping increase from last-year quarter, stemming from the shift of customer preference away from tobacco products.

The figures were unfavorable in the EU, EEMA region and in Latin America & Canada mainly owing to low cigarette shipment volumes. These were offset by increased volumes in Asia, as well as higher heated tobacco unit shipment volume across all regions. While cigarette shipment volume declined 4.1% in the quarter, heated tobacco unit shipment volume of 9.7 billion units, increased significantly from 2.1 billion units recorded in third-quarter 2016.Adjusted operating companies income was up 2.2% year over year to $3.1 billion due to favorable pricing and growth witnessed in Asia.

156,MKC,"SUPERVALU INC (SVU  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected sales and earnings in second-quarter fiscal 2018.The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 46 cents that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents and the year-ago earnings of 21 cents. Robust earnings were driven by higher sales in the Wholesale business and the benefits from the completed acquisition of Unified Grocers in June.Though the company reported a strong second quarter, its share performance has been unimpressive due to negative surprises reported in two of the past four quarters. In fact, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have underperformed the industry over the last three months. The stock has lost 27.7% in the last three months, wider than the industry’s decline of 3.8%.Quarter in Detail SUPERVALU’s net sales rose 35% year over year to $3,800 million. Also, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3,758 million. This upside was backed by increased sales witnessed at the Wholesale segment, but were hurt by decline in Retail net sales.Gross profit for the quarter amounted $428 million that depicted 8% growth from the prior year. However, margin contracted 280 basis points to 11.3%, owing to store closing costs and changes in business segment mix. Wholesale segment accounted for a large portion of the total sales and gross profit during the quarter.During the quarter, SUPERVALU’s operating loss was of $7 million, as compared with the operating earnings of $58 million in the prior-year period. This was caused by higher selling and administrative expenses.SuperValu Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise SuperValu Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SuperValu Inc. QuoteSegment DetailsWholesale: Net sales at Wholesale business grew 58% year over year to $2.74 billion, mainly driven by the revenues from Unified Grocers business. Additionally, the segment also gained from sales to new customers and stores. These were partially offset by reduced military sales and stores that no longer receive supplies from SUPERVALU. Also, the segment’s operating income totaled $61 million, up from $58 million in the year-ago quarter.Retail: Net sales at Retail slipped 1.1% to $1.02 billion. This decrease represents store closures and unfavorable identical store sales of 3.5%, partly mitigated by sales from acquired and new outlets.In fact, we note that this leading grocery dealer is witnessing sluggish sales in the retail business due to competitive pressures. This is the tenth consecutive quarter of sales decline of the retail segment.Further, the segment reported operating loss of $58 million, wider than the operating loss of $12 million in the year-ago quarter. The downside was driven by lower sales and reduced gross margin owing to enhanced promotional activities.Corporate: During the second quarter, fees earned under services agreements were down 2.4% to $40 million. Further, the segment delivered operating loss of $10 million, as against operating income of $12 million delivered in the year-ago quarter.Financial Update The company’s cash and cash equivalents stood at $209 million as of Sep 9 compared to $252 million as of Jun 17.Long-term debt was $1,601 million and total stockholders’ equity totaled $373 million as of Sep 9, compared with long-term debt of $1,282 billion and stockholders’ equity of $397 million as of Jun 17.Further, the company’s year-to-date net cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations amounted $116 million, as compared with $208 million in the previous year.Outlook For fiscal 2018, management continues to expect adjusted EBITDA, including Unified Grocers of $475-$495 million.We commend SUPERVALU’s efforts to develop the wholesale operations, primarily through adding new customers, retaining and developing business with existing customers and acquisitions. In fact, the acquisition of Unified Grocers has yielded positive results and is expected to radically boost the company’s wholesale segment, alongside offering new growth opportunities across multiple geographies. It also recently announced a definitive merger agreement to acquire Associated Grocers for approximately $180 million. The company has also been working hard toward achieving a turnaround in its retail segment, reduce costs and increase operating efficiency. Looking for More?

157,MKC,"While some investors might want to look for the next hot sector or up-and-coming industry to dive into, sometimes investing in more everyday industries can prove just as beneficial and profitable.With that said, we will look at three companies that hold unique positions in an industry close to many peoples’ hearts: food.On top of their standing as big names in their respective food industry segments, these three firms also hold strong Zacks Ranks. Let’s take a look at some of their current fundamentals to see if investors might want to grab these food stocks from the grocery aisle.McCormick & Company (MKC  -  Free Report)This maker of ubiquitous seasonings and spices is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and scored an “A” grade for Momentum in our Style Scores system.McCormick’s 6.10% year-to-date price change is less than the S&P 500, but its 6.62% 12-week price change shows that it could be starting to heat up right now.On top of this, McCormick is an interesting growth pick.McCormick’s current cash flow growth of 6.61% is above its industry’s average, and along with its 0.95 current ratio and 26% return on equity—which both also top the industry average—this helps show that the spice maker is growing.And based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates, McCormick’s sales are expected to jump 20.31% this quarter to hit $1.5 billion. For the full-year, the company’s revenue is projected to grow 9.25% to touch an upward estimate of $4.84 billion.McCormick’s quarterly earnings are set to pop 19.49% based on our current estimates, while the company’s full-year EPS is expected to gain 11.59% to reach $4.24 per share. This marks strong growth for such an established company in a niche seasoning sector that hasn’t changed much in years.Shares of McCormick sit roughly 7% below their 52-week high, which means the flavor making power has room to climb, and the company has missed earnings expectations just twice since the start of 2013.United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report)United Natural Foods is one of the leading national distributors of grass-fed antibiotic and hormone-free natural protein, as well as natural deli meats, cheese, bakery goods, and prepared foods.This massive natural food supplier is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and also sports an “A” grade for both Value and Growth in our Style Scores system, which helped it earn an overall “A” VGM grade.UNFI is currently trading at 15x earnings, which is well below the “Food – Miscellaneous” industry’s average P/E ratio of 21.53. The company’s P/B ratio of 1.22 marks a 58.6% discount to the industry average, while United Natural’s 0.22 P/S ratio also beats the industry’s 1.23 average. These metrics help to show that the natural food company could be a value play for investors at this time.Furthermore, United Natural’s 3.19 sales to assets ratio crushes the industry’s average of 1.13. The company’s 7.58% current cash flow also tops the industry’s 5.84% average and helps show that the company is on a strong growth trajectory.Based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates, United Natural’s revenues are projected to pop 4.85% in its current quarter. On top of that, the company’s sales are expected to climb 4.52% for the year to hit an upward estimate of $9.72 billion. UNFI’s earnings are projected to gain 1.23% in the current quarter and jump over 5% for the year.In the last 12 weeks, the company has seen its stock price climb 10.43% while the “Food – Miscellaneous” industry has been flat. This means shares of UNFI could continue to gain before they come close to breaking through a new threshold.Pinnacle Foods (PF  -  Free Report) The maker of Duncan Hines, Hungry-Man, Vlasic, and many more packaged staples, has seen its stock price climb 14.59% over the last year. Today, Pinnacle Foods is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and scored an overall VGM grade of a “C.”Pinnacle Foods’ 14.97% current cash flow growth far outpaces the industry’s 5.84% average and helps show that the company is expanding. On top of that, the company’s earnings per share are projected to climb 8.49% in its current quarter, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates.For the year the company’s revenues are only set to gain 0.93% to hit $3.20 billion. But for an established firm like Pinnacle Foods, those small gains represent somewhat solid growth. More than that, the packaged food giant’s earnings are expected to gain 18.76% for the year, which helps to show that the company has set its sights on drastically improving its bottom line.In addition to this, Pinnacle offers a respectable 2.27% dividend and could be an attractive option for income-focused investors. Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

158,MKC,"McCormick & Co. Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report) posted third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both the company’s earnings and revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company has also raised its sales, operating income and earnings guidance to reflect the acquisition of RB Foods and lower currency impact on earnings.Adjusted earnings of $1.12 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05 by 6.7%. We note that the company has delivered positive earnings surprise in 13 of the last 15 straight quarters, excluding the current quarter. In the third quarter, adjusted earnings were also 9% higher year over year owing to higher operating income. Further, the favorable impact of higher sales and cost savings were offset by an increase in brand marketing and material costs and currency headwinds.Revenues and ProfitsIn the reported quarter the global leader in flavors and spices generated revenues of $1,185 million, which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,146 million by 3.4%. Revenues grew about 9% from the prior-year quarter, including currency tailwinds of 1%. Sales were driven by strong base business and impressive product portfolio growth.The acquisitions (food division of Reckitt Benckiser Group (RB Foods) in August 2017 and Enrico Giotti SpA in December 2016) also contributed to higher sales by 4%. Excluding currency headwinds, revenues grew 7%, driven by both the consumer and industrial segments.The company’s adjusted operating income grew 18.6% to $204 million in the third quarter. On a constant currency basis, it increased 19% due to higher sales, cost savings and lower selling, general & administrative costs. A shift in the portfolio to more value added products also boosted sales.McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | McCormick & Company, Incorporated QuoteSegment DetailsConsumer Business: Segment revenues grew 5%, primarily driven by strong base business and new product sales compared with the year-ago period. Solid performance in the Americas was driven by the acquisition of RB Foods as well as strong pricing, new products and expanded distribution. Sales also grew in China and India, which were partially offset by weak sales in the United Kingdom, where the retail environment suffers from stiff competition.Adjusted operating income grew 9%, on a constant currency basis, driven by the favorable impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offsetting the impact of higher material costs and brand marketing expenses.Industrial Business: Industrial segment sales grew 14% with minimum impact from currency, driven by increased sales across all three of its regions. While sales in the Americas were led by continued growth momentum in branded foodservice, as well as incremental sales from RB Foods, sales in EMEA region was driven by sales from Giotti acquisition.Sales to both quick service restaurants and packaged food companies also increased during the quarter. Industrial sales in the Asia/Pacific region increased in the quarter driven by new products and promotional activities of quick service restaurants.On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income rose 44% year over year, driven by favorable impact of higher sales, product mix and CCI-led cost savingsand favorable selling, general and administrative costs, more than offset the unfavorable impact of increases in material costs and an increase in brand marketing.Fiscal 2017 Guidance Raised For fiscal 2017, the company has revised its guidance reflecting the acquisition of RB Foods and lower currency impact on earnings. The company now expects sales to grow approximately 9–10% in fiscal 2017, in comparison with approximately 4–6% announced earlier. Excluding currency, McCormick expects sales to grow approximately 10–11% in fiscal 2017, in comparison with approximately 5–7% announced previously.The company expects higher brand marketing, increased pricing, new products, expanded distribution and acquisitions to contribute to the growth. Further, the company anticipates pricing actions to offset higher material costs, which are anticipated to rise by mid-single digits. In addition, the company has raised its cost savings target to at least $105 million, compared with the earlier goal of approximately $100 million.The company now expects 2017 adjusted operating income to grow approximately 20–21%, from adjusted operating income of $657 million in 2016. Previously, the company anticipated adjusted operating income growth of 8–10%. On constant currency basis, adjusted operating income is now expected to grow 21–22%.Driven by higher sales and operating income, McCormick now expects 2017 adjusted earnings in the range of $4.20–$4.24 per share, compared with $4.05–$4.13 per share estimated previously. This marks an increase of 11–12% compared with $3.78 in 2016. Also, currency will unfavorably impact earnings by 1%, compared to 2 percentage points previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 is $4.09 per share, which is below the guidance range.Our TakeOverall, McCormick is focusing on driving revenues through acquisitions and expects the momentum to continue in fiscal 2017. Its cost-saving initiative is also appealing. However, earnings growth is likely to be hurt by higher input costs as well as brand-marketing expenses.Share Price MovementIf we look into the year-to-date performance, McCormick’s shares have outperformed the industry. The stock increased 3.3% against the industry’s decline of 10.2%.Zacks Rank & Key PicksMcCormick currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked food companies include Nomad Foods Ltd. (NOMD  -  Free Report), Ingredion Inc. (INGR  -  Free Report) and The Chefs’ Warehouse, Inc.

160,MKC,"McCormick & Company, Incorporated (MKC  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Sep 28, before the opening bell. The company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimates in 13 out of the last 15 quarters, with an average beat of 4.4% in the trailing four quarters.Let’s look into some factors that are likely to impact the third-quarter results.                     Estimate Revisions The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has remained unchanged over the last 30 days at $1.05, reflecting a year-on-year increase of 1.7%. However, estimates for fiscal 2017 have increased by a cent to reach $4.09, reflecting growth of 8.3% from the prior-year period.Further, analyst polled by Zacks expects revenues of $1.15 billion for the third quarter, up 5% from the prior-year period. Revenues for fiscal 2017 are expected to be $4.8 billion, displaying an increase rise of 7.9% from the previous year.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil? Our proven model does not conclusively show that McCormick is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.McCormick has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.05. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | McCormick & Company, Incorporated QuoteFactors at Play McCormick’s strategic focus on acquisitions has been aiding the company to boost top line for quite a while now. It recently completed the acquisition of the food division of Reckitt Benckiser Group plc. The acquisition is anticipated to generate cost synergies of approximately $50 million, expected to be achieved by 2020, with significant margin and earnings accretion in 2017. Moreover, the buyout is expected to position McCormick as one of the leading companies in the U.S. condiments category. In the past, the company has made several acquisitions including Italy-based Enrico Giotti SpA and Australia-based Botanical Food Company (both carried out in 2016).Additionally, the company has been focusing on innovation and brand marketing to enhance portfolio and revenue opportunities. McCormick has also remained dedicated toward its Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (“CCI”) program, which aids cost reduction. Cost savings through CCI and streamlining actions reached $109 million in 2016, up from $98 million in 2015. Further, it expects to deliver cost savings of at least $100 million in fiscal 2017 and savings of around $400 million by Nov 30, 2019.Nevertheless, McCormick has been battling with increased input costs since the past many quarters. Prices of raw materials such as vanilla, garlic, cinnamon, oregano and rice, as well as packaging costs have been steadily increasing, thereby affecting margins. For fiscal 2017, the company expects material cost inflation in mid-single digits. Further, the company’s sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) have remained sluggish of late due to difficult economic, political and competitive factors. Moreover, its business in the U.K. has been sluggish as large retailers reduce shelf space for food products to gain space for general merchandise.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.99% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.                                   Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.45 and carries a Zacks Rank #3Church & Dwight Company Inc (CHD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.26% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?

161,MKC,"The grocery industry is going through a rough patch currently. The industry has grappling with challenges like stiff competition and aggressive promotional environment. Traditional grocery companies are facing competition from rivals, who are strengthening their franchises and are offering alternative outlets for food and other staples. Customers are also becoming more inclined toward private label products as they are low-cost alternatives to national brands, which are hurting the food companies.The problems worsened when e-Commerce major Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) announced an all-cash $13.7 billion deal on Jun 16 to acquire the natural and organic foods supermarket chain Whole Foods Market Inc. . On Aug 28, Amazon closed the Whole Foods deal, following Federal Trade Commission’s approval last week.The deal’s impact can be clearly seen in lowered grocery prices of Whole Foods, creating apprehensions at several grocery store chains like Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report), Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report), Sprouts Farmers Market Inc. (SFM  -  Free Report) of pricing pressure, squeezed margins and dwindling customers. It is also expected to further increase the competition in the industry.Given this backdrop, let’s try to ascertain which of these two key food players – Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) and McCormick & Company Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report), is presently in good shape and can make for a better investment option. We note that both Sysco and McCormick carry the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), highlighting the fact that they are likely to perform in line with the broader market over the next one to three months. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Sysco’s market capitalization is $27.4 billion, while that of McCormick is $11.8 billion. Going by its business size, Sysco is undoubtedly a winner. Though Sysco’s massive scale of operations better position it in the long term, short-term industry headwinds are likely to adversely impact both the companies.Business OperationsSysco’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in six of the last seven quarters, which have been primarily attributed to its continued focus on acquisitions, volume growth, rewarding shareholders and margin improvement through cost savings. Sysco’s acquisition of London-based Brakes Group in Jul 2016 has benefited the company significantly.Sysco has also been impressively managing expenses since the past few years. The company is making progress in both SG&A and supply chain and as a result, the company achieved $417 million operating income growth since fiscal 2015 and remains on track to achieve the high end of the three-year adjusted operating income growth target of approximately $600 million to $650 million through the end of FY18.Though stiff competition and aggressive promotional environment remain a concern, Sysco’s efforts to boost sales and margins are paying up, as the company has delivered positive gross margins in the last nine consecutive quarters, after declining consistently for the last few quarters.Like Sysco, McCormick’s earnings have also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in six of the last seven quarters, on the back of rising demand for spices, herbs and seasonings over the last few years. Product innovation, brand marketing support and expanded distribution, as well as pricing actions are also fueling sales growth. However, higher material costs remain its headwinds.Prices of raw materials such as vanilla, garlic, cinnamon, oregano and rice, as well as packaging costs have been steadily increasing, and thereby affecting McCormick’s margins. Though McCormick is working on its expense structure and remains hopeful to accelerate its margins in the remainder of fiscal 2017, the company expects material cost inflation in mid-single digits for fiscal 2017.VGM ScoreWith the help of our new style score system, it is easy to pick the winning stocks. In order to screen out potential value stocks, we consider only those that have a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A or B. However, if we consider stocks with a Zacks Rank #3, we should opt for a better grade.Sysco seems to outpace McCormick on VGM Score as well, as Sysco’s score of A is favorable than McCormick’s VGM Score of D. Hence, we should consider it a favorable investing option.Price PerformanceThe food industry has been struggling from quite some time now. However, the concerns aggravated after the Amazon-Whole Foods deal, which is well reflected in the share price performance of the companies as well as the industry. If we look into the last three months performance of these stocks, we note that while the industry declined 8.6% in the said time frame, shares of McCormick slipped 8.5% in the last six months. On the contrary, shares of Sysco declined 4.0% in the same time frame.Estimate RevisionsUpward estimate revisions are indicative of positive investor sentiment about a stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sysco has inched up 0.7% for fiscal 2018 and 1.4% for fiscal 2019 over the last 30 days, owing to its solid fourth quarter results. However, the same has gone down 0.3% for fiscal 2017 over the last 30 days for McCormick, reflecting negative outlook on the stock. Encouragingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 has gone up 2% for McCormick.Sysco’s earnings for the current fiscal year 2018 ending June 2018 are expected to grow 11.7%, while McCormick earnings per share are projected to grow at a lower rate of 7.7% in its current fiscal year 2017 ending November 2017.Valuation MultiplesNotably, Sysco has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 18.9, which compares favorably with industry’s average of 20.2 and S&P 500 average of 19.3. McCormick, on the other hand, has a higher forward PE of 23.4. So it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Sysco stock in the near term too, as you can see in the chart below:Valuation MultipleSYYMKCIndustryS&P 500P/E F118.923.420.219.3P/S0.52.71.93.1 If we look into another key metric Price/Sales ratio, we note that right now, Sysco has a P/S ratio of about 0.5. This is significantly lower than the industry average of 1.9 and S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.1 right now. On the contrary, McCormick has a P/S ratio of 2.7.The above arguments clearly states that Sysco is better pick investors.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

162,MKC,"McCormick & Company, Inc.’s (MKC  -  Free Report) strategic growth efforts which include acquisitions and innovation have been boosting its portfolio. Moreover, its cost saving initiatives has significantly aided improving profitability. Nevertheless, raw material cost inflation and weak sales in the U.K region have raised concerns for sustaining the company’s performance.Let’s now delve deeper into some of the factors that have been aiding the company’s performance and hindering its growth.    Acquisitions & Innovations Aiding Growth McCormick has been strategically increasing its presence through acquisitions in order to grow its spices and seasonings portfolio. It recently completed the acquisition of the food division of Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, a British consumer products company. The acquisition is expected to significantly boost the company’s robust spices portfolio with iconic brands like Frank's RedHot and French's Mustard that hold top positions in their respective categories in the United States and Canada. The buyout will position McCormick as one of the leading companies in the U.S. condiments category. In the past, the company has made several acquisitions including Italy-based Enrico Giotti SpA and Australia-based Botanical Food Company (both carried out in 2016). The buyouts have aided the company to expand its distribution network and increase brand investment.McCormick has also been investing in innovation in order to develop healthy food products as consumers turn toward fresh food items. In this respect, the company has been partnering with government and trade agencies. It is also shaping up its portfolio with gluten free, non-GMO and organic products to satisfy the evolving needs of consumers.Cost Saving Initiatives The company’s dedicated focus toward cost savings is quite evident from the Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program. Cost savings through CCI and streamlining actions reached $109 million in 2016, up from $98 million in 2015. Further, it expects to deliver cost savings of at least $100 million in fiscal 2017 and savings of around $400 million by Nov 30, 2019. McCormick uses its CCI savings to increase investments and productivity, thereby leading to higher sales and profits.Headwinds Posing concerns McCormick has been suffering from higher input costs since past many quarters. Prices of raw materials such as vanilla, garlic, cinnamon, oregano and rice, as well as packaging costs have been steadily increasing, and thereby affecting McCormick’s margins. For fiscal 2017, the company expects material cost inflation in mid-single digits. Further, the company’s sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) have remained sluggish of late due to difficult economic, political and competitive factors. Moreover, its business in the U.K has been sluggish as large retailers reduce shelf space for food products to gain space for general merchandise.Owing to such headwinds, the company’s shares have underperformed the broader Consumer Staples sector in the past six months. Shares of the company have declined 3.8% in comparison to the sectors gain of 2.4%. Bottom-Line                                                                                                                          We believe that this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has the potential to offset these headwinds. The company’s higher brand marketing, increased pricing, new products, expanded distribution and acquisitions are expected to contribute to the growth, in the forth coming periods. Further, the company anticipates pricing actions to offset an anticipated mid-single digit increase in material costs. The company also expects lower currency impact on fiscal 2017 sales. Moreover in an effort to improve EMEA regions dismal performance, the company had resorted to undertaking streamlining actions during the second quarter of fiscal 2017.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Interest You?

163,MKC,"On Aug 28, we issued an updated research report on Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. , manufacturer and distributor of carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) and non-carbonated beverages (NCBs).Aggressive media campaigns, pricing gains, innovation and productivity improvements are driving the upside for Dr Pepper. However, weak volumes of its carbonated beverages and foreign currency translation raise caution.RCI Program to Boost GrowthWe are encouraged by Dr Pepper’s Rapid Continuous Improvement (RCI) program which has led to strong earnings growth since inception in 2010. Through the program, the company has been able to reduce inventory and storage costs and drive cash flow, which can be returned to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases and re-invested to boost the top line.The company’s expansion of the program through the implementation of five new tracks in 2015 is boosting productivity. In 2016, it introduced a set of Lean tracks in a bid to drive top-line growth and productivity. Notably, earnings rose 9% and sales increased 2.5% in 2016. In the first half of 2017, sales increased 4% and earnings grew 3%. Dr Pepper will continue to focus on RCI and Lean management in 2017.Also, aggressive marketing programs are the other positives. Marketing plans include increasing distribution and availability of the key brands with added focus on high-margin channels and re-deploying cold drink equipment assets across its DSD (Direct Store Delivery) footprint. Moreover, the company regularly develops innovative products to meet evolving consumer needs.ConcernsDr Pepper’s shares have declined 0.7% so far this year, compared to the industry’s 14.2% growth. Estimate revisions went down 4.8% for the current quarter and 0.2% for the year in the last 30 days.Dr Pepper has been seeing persistently sluggish volumes of its carbonated beverages, including the diet versions, due to CSD category headwinds. Cross-category competition and growing health and wellness consciousness are hurting CSD category growth. The diet drinks are also under pressure due to increasing consumer concern regarding the use of artificial sweeteners.Again, the company has international operations which expose it to the effects of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates of the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. Foreign exchange had a 1% impact on revenues in 2016. It is expected to dent core EPS by 4 cents in 2017.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderDr Pepper currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in this Consumer Staples sector are Post Holdings, Inc. (POST  -  Free Report), McCormick & Company, Incorporated (MKC  -  Free Report) and Ingredion Incorporated (INGR  -  Free Report).

164,MKC,"The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) has been delivering better-than-expected earnings over the past several quarters backed by acquisitions, online business growth, and cost savings measures. In fact, strong yields from acquisitions drove its recently announced fourth-quarter 2017 results.Let’s now look into some of the factors that have been impacting the performance of this company.Strong Fourth Quarter Results Both earnings and sales surged during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, which was released on Aug 18. The company posted adjusted earnings of 51 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents. Adjusted earnings also surged 21.4% year over year.Estée Lauder’s net sales of $2.89 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.85 million by 1.5%. Moreover, sales grew 9% from the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by acquisitions. Almost all the brands, geographic regions and product categories, except hair care reported sales growth in the quarter.Immediately after posting an upbeat fourth-quarter result, the company hit a 52-week high of $106.45, eventually closing at $105.92. We also note that shares of this cosmetic giant surged 7.7% since its fourth-quarter earnings release. Shares of this cosmetic giant have been rising primarily on the back of growth initiatives. We observe that shares of Estée Lauder went up 15.9% compared with the industry’s decline of 13.9% over the past year.Strategic Acquisitions Supports Growth The acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced (during the first quarter of 2017) has strengthened its fastest growing prestige portfolio and contributed approximately 3.5 percentage points of the reported sales growth during the fourth quarter. For fiscal 2017, these acquisitions contributed about 2 percentage points of the reported sales growth.The recent investment made in DECIEM – a fast-growing multi-brand company – is expected to aid beauty sales in the forthcoming quarters. Earlier acquisitions including By Kilian, RODIN olio lusso and GLAMGLOW have also boosted Estée Lauder’s skin care portfolio apart from aiding it to bolster its international presence.Online Business Acceleration & Other FactorsEstée Lauder has a strong e-Commerce business and the company expects it to be a major growth engine for the upcoming years as well. During fiscal 2017, global online sales of the company depicted a 33% growth to reach $1.3 billion. A number of brands of the company such as MAC, Tom Ford and La Mer witnessed strong online sales growth during the year. Additionally, under the Leading Beauty Forward initiative, the company continues to reallocate resources and reduce costs in order to drive beauty business. Estée Lauder also has a strong presence in emerging markets which insulates it from the macroeconomic headwinds in the matured markets. The company also gains from the rising demand for beauty products, particularly in the luxury arena and in makeup.Bottom Line Estée Lauder has remained cautious regarding slower retail growth in Hong Kong and unfavorable currency. It has also been witnessing a decline in retail traffic in U.S. brick-and-mortar stores, principally for MAC, Estée Lauder and Clinique.Nevertheless, with a strong portfolio of brands, lucrative acquisitions and well-planned cost and resource allocation strategies, Estée Lauder is well placed in the beauty arena and is expected to easily overcome current challenges.Estée Lauder currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking for More Consumer Staples Stocks?
