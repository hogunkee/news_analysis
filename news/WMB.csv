0,WMB,"Two of North America's biggest pipeline companies announced plans to repurchase subsidiaries as the industry seeks to curb future tax obligations in the face of a federal overhaul.XWilliams Cos. (WMB) is buying the remaining stake in Williams Partners (WPZ) in a $10.5 billion all-stock deal, it said Thursday. Enbridge (ENB) earlier said it made all-share proposals to the boards of its units to acquire all outstanding securities.The deals allow the companies to absorb partnership businesses that have come under government scrutiny. Pipeline stocks plunged in March after regulators said so-called master limited partnerships can no longer charge customers for taxes the companies don't pay. Thursday's announcements follow a similar move by Kinder Morgan (KMI) in 2014.Williams will acquire the outstanding stock of Williams Partners at a ratio of 1.494 of its shares for each unit of the subsidiary, according to a statement. The transaction represents a 6.4% premium to public unit holders, based on Wednesday's close. It extends the period in which Williams isn't expected to be a cash taxpayer through 2024 and will immediately add to cash available for dividends, it said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

6,WMB,"Natural gas is making such a resurgence that some are calling it ""the product of the future,"" and Rice Midstream Partners (RMP) is evidence of that.The natural gas distributor is a master limited partnership formed by Rice Energy (RICE), one of several companies making a big bet on natural gas. Rice Energy owns more than 40% of the relatively young Rice Midstream.Unlike many companies of its kind, Rice Midstream concentrates almost exclusively on natural gas when it comes to transporting energy.""Rice Midstream is a pure play on gathering dry gas production and getting it to the market,"" said Tristan Richardson, an equity research analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. ""Other midstream firms are diversified across wet gas and crude.""But Rice Midstream isn't the only sign energy companies are turning to natural gas for future revenue. BP (BP) has said it wants natural gas to make up 60% of its energy mix in the next 10 years.Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said the liquefied natural gas market will grow four times faster than oil, and double in the next 15 years. Plus, Dow component Exxon Mobil (XOM) announced plans to build liquefied natural gas terminals in Texas and Louisiana.There are others who are joining the party in the same vein as Rice, with midstream companies founded by parent energy firms. They include Antero Resources' (AR) Antero Midstream (AM), EQT Corp.'s (EQT) EQT Midstream (EQM) and Cone Midstream (CNNX), which was formed by Consol Energy (CNX) and Noble Energy (NBL).The Oil & Gas-Transport/Pipeline group is ranked No. 84 out of the 197 industry groups that IBD tracks. Rice Midstream has a 92 Composite Rating, meaning it's outperforming 92% of stocks tracked by IBD. It's also on IBD's IPO leaders list.Rice Midstream debuted in December 2014 and is headquartered in Canonsburg, Pa., near the heart of the Marcellus shale oilfield in the state's Appalachian basin. That's where most of Rice Midstream's natural gas operations are.In addition to distributing natural gas, Rice Midstream supplies water for hydraulic fracturing, a key ingredient in the process. During ""fracking,"" water is injected into wells along with sand or another type of material to loosen the natural gas or oil trapped in the rocks.""The water business has tailwinds right now,"" said Brian Brungardt, a research analyst at Stifel. ""Every (exploration and production) operator continues to improve the well designs they are employing on the fracking side. Improvement largely means using more sand per well.""With more sand comes more water. Another improvement is longer laterals from each well, requiring more water.Of the midstream companies, only Antero and Rice supply water — and Rice stands out from Antero on that count as well.While Antero Midstream just services the needs of parent Antero Resources, Rice Midstream serves third-party customers like EQT, along with parent Rice Energy, its primary customer.Water accounts for 30% of Rice Midstream's operational revenue, but Richardson said the business will be a smaller piece of its operations in the next two to three years as Rice Midstream acquires more infrastructure for distributing natural gas, known as gathering.Midstream companies gather natural gas from wellheads in the field and then ship it along smaller pipelines to larger pipelines that carry gas across state borders.Rice Midstream's gathering volumes jumped 25.7% to 1.2 million cubic feet of natural gas in the fourth-quarter vs. the third quarter. Its Q4 gathering and compression revenue was up 25% to $41.8 million compared with Q3.IBD'S TAKE: Rice Midstream Partners holds a high IBD Composite Rating of 92, but it's not even the highest-ranked stock in its group. Tops on the list is Argentina's TGS (TGS). For more on that company, check here.Gathering volumes could increase even more this year as natural gas prices rise, spurring exploration and production firms to increase spending and drill more.In a January 2017 report outlining short-term production, the Energy Information Administration said it sees natural gas spot prices averaging $3.55 per million British thermal unit this year and $3.72 next year vs. an average of $2.51 in 2016.Rice Energy plans to boost 2017 net production by 59% vs. 2016 and raised its capital spending outlook to $1.035 billion for drilling and completion activity from $686 million in 2016.Even if natural gas prices fall, Rice Midstream will be shielded from commodity price fluctuations as Rice Energy is ""significantly hedged through 2017,"" said Stifel's Brungardt.But if prices were to drop and stay low for an extended period and Rice Energy scaled back production, then Rice Midstream's revenue results could take a hit on reduced volumes, according to SunTrust's Richardson.President Trump's election has given energy firms a boost as his energy policies are widely viewed as a plus for the industry as he promised to push back environmental regulations and allow drilling on federal lands.He also allowed construction on the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline to restart and said TransCanada should ""resubmit its application"" for the Keystone XL project President Obama rejected.But local politics could still inhibit drilling and pipeline expansion.""It appears the new administration early on is taking a more constructive view with various infrastructure projects, pipelines included,"" Brungardt said. ""But local opposition, that 'not in my backyard' mentality, certainly continues to be an issue.""But Richardson said the local regulatory environment has been more bullish as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and state governments approved more pipelines in Appalachia in recent months, including the Williams' (WMB) Atlantic Sunrise pipeline and Energy Transfer Partners' (ETP) Rover pipeline.Brungardt has a hold rating on the stock due to valuation, but says Rice Midstream has a ""solid balance sheet."" Richardson has a buy rating on the stock.Shares of Rice slipped 1.3% to close at 24.92 Friday.RELATED:'Permania' Infects CERAWeek But Don't Count Out Bakken, Natural GasAnalysts Are Bullish On Fracking Supplier Antero Midstream

11,WMB,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT) filed suit Wednesday to terminate its $5.8 billion purchase of Alere (ALR), citing setbacks since the deal was signed in January that it says have significantly eroded the value of the medical-test maker.The acquisition was troubled almost from the start. In February, Alere disclosed a delay in filing its financial results with securities regulators because of revenue recognition problems in China and Africa. It marked the beginning of a drumbeat of bad news as the company said it received subpoenas from the U.S. regarding bribery investigations and billing practices, restated earnings, pulled a product off the market and had its diabetes division excluded from the Medicare health insurance program after billing for patients who had already died.Alere shares, halted during the trading day, ended the session down 8% to 36.67. Abbott was up fractionally to $38.48.Filed in Delaware Chancery Court, the complaint claims that Abbott, based in suburban Chicago, has the right to terminate the transaction because the cumulative effect of the setbacks constitute a material change in Alere's prospects.""Alere is no longer the company Abbott agreed to buy 10 months ago,"" Abbott spokesman Scott Stoffel said in a statement. ""These numerous negative developments are unprecedented and are not isolated incidents brought on by chance.""Abbott's suit seeking to scuttle the merger is likely to be heard by Delaware Chancery Court Judge Sam Glasscock III, who has overseen earlier litigation concerning the deal.In June, Glasscock concluded that Energy Transfer Equity (ETE) could back out of a $33 billion merger with rival pipeline operator Williams (WMB) because of tax problems tied to the combination.Tulsa-based Williams is now suing Dallas-based Energy Transfer for more than $10 billion in damages. In response, Energy Transfer is seeking to force Williams to pay $1.5 billion in fees tied to the deal's failure.While Alere acknowledged challenges during the year, the Waltham, Mass.-based company said the setbacks didn't constitute a material change and insisted that the deal would close as originally agreed.In August, it sued to compel Abbott to pursue U.S. antitrust clearance and close the transaction, claiming Abbott was intentionally dragging its feet to derail the deal and focus on its pending $25 billion acquisition of St. Jude Medical (STJ). The two sides were working with a mediator to settle the dispute.Abbott filed its own suit in November, claiming that Alere violated terms of the agreement by hiding information relating to the bribery investigations, overseas operations and U.S. billing practices. While the two sides agreed to settle the suit, with Alere providing the documents, none have yet been provided, Stoffel said.""We have attempted to secure details and information to assess these issues for months, and Alere has blocked every attempt,"" he said. ""This damage to Alere's business can only be the result of a systemic failure of internal controls, which combined with the lack of transparency, led us to filing this complaint.""

13,WMB,"Investors will find quite a few leading stocks in Fidelity Trend Fund (FTRNX), but it's taken more than just owning the likes of Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook for fund manager Dan Kelley to keep his fund apace or ahead of peers and the stock market.Much of the fund's success can be traced to what goes on behind closed doors: depth of research, fund manager experience, investment philosophy and the timing of buys and sells.And Kelley's views about several of his top holdings, appearing below, reveal a good deal about his plan of attack for beating the market.The $1.6 billion large-cap growth fund was up 3.43% year to date, through Wednesday, well ahead of its peers' 1.7%, and a bit behind the S&P 500's 6.52%. But its long-term track record is also looking good: Average returns over the past three, five and 10 years amount to 9.05%, 13.88% and 8.54%, respectively. The S&P 500 turned in 9.0%, 13.91% and 6.68% for those periods.IBD's TAKE: Stock holdings of top-performing mutual funds are a great place to look for investment ideas. But before buying any, you should thoroughly analyze them using such tools as IBD Stock Checkup.Fidelity Trend is also an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Award-winner, having beaten the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31.Kelley, the fund's manager since 2012 and with Fidelity since 2005, says Trend's main differentiating factor is it selects stocks with mispriced growth. ""I don't really care as much about how fast the growth is, I care about what I'm paying for the rate of growth.""As a result, he likes ""being paid twice, with both positive earnings revisions and a valuation re-rating if I'm right on those positive earnings revisions."" Estimated P-Es of stocks are adjusted lower when expected earnings are revised upward. This improves the attractiveness of such stocks.Kelley segments growth stocks into three buckets: quality, secular and opportunistic growers. Quality growth companies have proven management teams, stable earnings-growth profiles and strong balance sheets. Examples include Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) and Visa (V).Secular growers ""are companies where I get a little discomfort in the valuation on near-term numbers, but they have the ability to grow at a very high organic growth rate for quite some time, and usually for longer than the market expects."" Salesforce.com (CRM) and Facebook (FB) fall in this category.Asked for his view on top holding Apple (AAPL), which just reported fiscal Q4 earnings and its first decline in annual profit in 15 years, Kelley said he could only comment on the situation as of the fund's last filing, Aug. 31.""In general, Apple needs to continue to innovate further on the smartphone for customer demand to remain high and earnings to grow,"" he said. ""The smartphone has become the most important device in most people's lives as the average person checks in 100 times a day. Hence, Apple needs to continue to provide customers with the best user experience, leading operating performance, and exciting new features to drive growth.""On Amazon (AMZN), he said the company, as of the fund's latest filing, still looked cheap vs. its long-term growth potential. ""What has changed from prior years, is the market has come to further appreciate the Amazon Web Services business and the long-term opportunity for that business, both from a revenue growth and earnings potential,"" he said. ""In addition, with respect to the core retail business, more retailers have embraced Amazon as a powerful distribution platform, which has allowed the company to operate more as a marketplace and enhanced the company's margin profile.""The third bucket includes opportunistic growth companies such as Williams Cos. (WMB). ""Those are companies that tend to trade at cheap valuations due to some concern — whether it be a cyclical company and the market gets worried about excess capacity, whether it be some sort of company-specific issue — and those names usually have the highest probability of being re-rated once we see some positive change,"" he explained.In the case of American natural-gas producer Williams, Kelley says that once they didn't get acquired, they started to make some corporate governance moves — changing the board and reducing their risk profile — which led to a re-rating of their stock.""Williams stock increased 28% in price from the end of July through Sept. 30,"" Kelley noted. ""It was the second-biggest contributor to fund performance during 3Q16. Before owning WMB, the fund had a preference to hold WPZ (Williams Partners (WPZ), a Williams affiliate), which also benefited from some of the same de-risking and commitment to balance-sheet improvement that Williams did.As a general rule, Kelley tries not to take huge sector bets. However, earlier in the year he did allocate about a 500 basis point overweight vs. the fund's Russell 1000 Growth index benchmark in the energy sector, which significantly contributed to the fund's performance.As to the three buckets, he usually lets the market dictate where the most compelling value is. That said, the quality bucket has probably been the largest one over time, comprising about 60% of the fund.Metal-packaging maker Ball (BLL) and water-pump and valve producer Xylem (XYL) both strongly contributed to last quarter's fund performance.Xylem has pulled back 9% from its early October peak and has fallen below its 50-day moving average.Kelley's take: ""While I can't comment on specific market moves that have happened since our latest public holdings disclosure, I think it's important to note that I take a long-term perspective when making investments on behalf of fund shareholders and look to take advantage of possible short-term market dislocations.""Global food-and-ketchup manufacturer Kraft Heinz (KHC) is a company that may have low organic growth and a high multiple, but it has a management team that are great capital allocators, points out Kelley. ""When they combined Kraft and Heinz, they took out a lot of cost. ... the management are really known to be really good operators of companies and they can go in and run them much leaner than they were run before. And so, what's happened historically, is that the synergies from these large-scale acquisitions had been much greater than initially expected.""RELATED:Amazon, Facebook, Alibaba Drive USAA Growth FundWhy A Top Columbia Fund Likes These Stock Leaders

Tesla Motors (TSLA) faces a regulatory probe while Volkswagen (VLKAY) paid a hefty price to settle an investigation.Stocks started the week as they finished the prior week -- falling sharply in reaction to the Brexit vote. But financial markets roared back, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow industrials all up more than 3% for the week and above key support levels, helped by Bank of England signals Thursday that it would ease further this summer. Notable breakouts included NetEase (NTES) and Lockheed Martin (LMT).Thirty-one of the 33 biggest banks on Wednesday passed the second round of the Fed's annual stress tests, the industry's equivalent to final exams, clearing their plans to hike buybacks or dividends. The U.S. subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank (DB) and Banco Santander (SAN) were the only ones that failed the second half of the tests, which gauges whether banks' capital and shareholder-return plans would hold up in a downturn and evaluates banks' abilities to assess their own financial planning. The Fed passed Morgan Stanley (MS) on condition that it fix risk-management weaknesses and resubmit its capital plan – the financial forecast that banks submit to the Fed for the tests – by Dec. 29.

Last year's Prime Day was the biggest single-day shopping sale in Amazon's history and helped drive Prime memberships, even though many shoppers and analysts said the actual deals weren't that great.Wal-Mart, apparently in a pre-emptive strike against Amazon, announced it was offering a 30-day trial membership of its Prime-comparable ShippingPass, which also offers free two-day shipping. The membership fees are half that of Prime membership.Amazon shares rose 3.8%, Wal-Mart 1.2%.Alcoholic beverage maker Constellation Brands (STZ) reported a 50% per-share earnings bump to $1.55, while revenue rose 15% to $1.87 billion, topping Street views on both the top and bottom lines.

ConAgra climbed 3.1% for the week, hitting a record high.Acuity Brands (AYI), a highly-rated company that makes smart, connected lighting systems, reported third-quarter results that topped expectations.

18,WMB,"Energy Transfer Equity (ETE) terminated its merger agreement with Williams Cos. (WMB), ending 18 months of negotiations after a court ruled that it can walk away from the deal.A Delaware judge ruled on Friday that Energy Transfer can back out of the nearly $33 billion deal to buy the rival pipeline giant. The company's counsel, Latham & Watkins LLP, has advised the acquirer that it was unable to deliver a required tax opinion by June 28, the date specified in the merger agreement.""Consistent with its rights and obligations under the merger agreement, ETE subsequently provided written notice terminating the merger agreement due to failure of conditions under the merger agreement,"" Energy Transfer said in a statement Wednesday.The proposed tie-up now stands as one of the largest deals undone by the plunge in prices that has sent shock waves through companies, industries and entire economies. Crude's collapse dragged the market value of both companies down by more than a third, straining their relationship and throwing into question the economics of the deal. As oil sank lower than either expected, both companies accused each other of sabotaging the deal.Delaware Chancery Court Judge Sam Glasscock ruled June 24 that Energy Transfer is entitled to terminate the merger after its advisers said the deal didn't free investors from tax liabilities. Williams remains committed to completing the merger and will ""enforce its rights"" under the terms of its agreement if Energy Transfer attempts to terminate the pact, the company said in a statement after the decision. Williams's shareholders voted on Monday to approve the takeover and filed a notice of appeal.Energy Transfer Chief Executive Officer Kelcy Warren feared that pushing ahead with the deal would prompt analysts to downgrade the company and cause an ""implosion,"" according to court testimony from Jamie Welch, the company's former chief financial officer.Before the deal, Williams was facing pressure from investors to simplify its corporate structure and lower its cost of capital. Earlier this month, the company said it may have to cut its 64-cent quarterly dividend -- for the first time in at least a decade -- by a ""material"" amount. The shareholder payout may be cut by 75% in the third quarter, Timm Schneider, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said in a note to clients June 27.

The S&P 500 was up 0.2% and the Nasdaq held on to a fractional gain.Stocks in motion included Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), United Natural Foods (UNFI), Zillow Group (Z) and Biogen (BIIB).One test for the stock market today will be volume. Monday's gains felt good, but took place in relatively weak trade. As IBD's Big Picture on Monday noted, that suggests institutional investors remained on the bench -- not a bullish sign. Gains in rising trade provide the markets' uptrend with more momentum. Still, the S&P 500 opens just 1% off its July 2015 high, and a move above that level would be psychologically important.Another point to watch: small caps. The Russell 2000 and the S&P SmallCap 600 both outperformed the market on Monday.The Labor Department said productivity declined 0.6% in the first quarter, in line with expectations and an improvement over an initial estimate of a 1% decrease.

Alexion shares have been trying to climb the right side of a deepening 11-month consolidation.Biogen skidded 10% after preliminary data of a phase 2 clinical study showed multiple sclerosis treatment opicinumab missed primary endpoints in the trial.A bright spot in the medical picture was LDR Holding (LDRH), which spiked 63% at the open, after Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) said it would acquire the cervical surgery products company in a deal valued near $1 billion. IBD 50 stock Zimmer was down 4%.Recreational vehicle maker Thor Industries (THO) scratched out a 2% gain at the open. The Elkhart, Ind.-based company reported Q1 earnings just above estimates, but with revenue just below analysts' consensus target. The stock ended Monday in a buy range, 3% past a 63.09 cup-base buy point.Overseas markets traded higher, boosted by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's pushback on Monday of expectations for a rate hike. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index took a 1.4% gain. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 added 0.6%. In Europe, Frankfurt's DAX and the CAC 40 in Paris carried gains of 1% or better.Oil prices climbed, with West Texas Intermediate up nearly 1% to $50 a barrel.

Gold rose more than 1%, to above $1,278 an ounce, down 1% this week. The dollar was down, and bonds were inching higher.Staples tumbled 15%, and Office Depot sliced 34% lower in premarket moves on the stock market today after a federal judge blocked the two companies' $6.3 billion merger effort, citing antitrust concerns. Staples will pay a $250 million breakup fee, and said in a release it will close 50 stores in North America and initiate a $100 million stock repurchase program, along with other measures.Other retailers also showed some early distress. Fossil Group (FOSL) crumbled 34% as Q1 earnings and revenue, reported late Tuesday, fell more than expected. The company said challenges in the retail environment and in its wholesale channels had intensified.Macy's dropped 9% after delivering mixed first-quarter results and lowering full-year EPS and revenue guidance below consensus expectations.Disney dropped 5%, weighing heavily on the Dow, after reporting late Tuesday fiscal Q2 revenue and earnings that missed analyst targets. Management noted a decline in ESPN subscribers and ad revenue. Shares have been climbing since February, building the right side of a six-month consolidation. The stock ended Tuesday above the midpoint of the potential base and above its 40-week moving average.Video game maker Electronic Arts powered up 9% before the open after topping fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue views, as well as raising its fiscal 2017 outlook.

The stock is extended above a 34.49 cup-with-handle buy point, cleared in April. It also just topped an alternate entry at 37.20, ending Tuesday less than 2% above that buy mark.At the low end of the list, Facebook (FB) has recently been edging higher after clearing a 117.09 buy point in April, but it traded down about 0.2% ahead of Wednesday's opening bell.Overseas action was generally quiet, with narrowly mixed trade in China and Japan, and with some moderate selling pressure focused in eurozone markets, particularly on banking sector stocks.

21,WMB,"Stocks showed early strength Tuesday, racking up early gains in rising trade -- despite disappointing economic news.The Nasdaq jumped out to an early lead, up 1.5% on an 8% increase in trade. The S&P 500 leapt 0.9%. The Dow racked up a 0.6% increase on trade that was 9% above levels at the same time Friday.The stock market today opened to a weak reading from the New York Federal Reserve's Empire State Manufacturing Survey. The index posted a -16.6 tally for February -- better than January's -19.2, but weaker than the -10 expected by analysts.Homebuilder confidence eased in February from January's high levels, with the National Association of Homebuilders putting its Housing Market Index at 58 for the month and revising its January figure to 60, from 61. Analysts expected an unchanged tally of 61.Europe's market continued to trade mixed, with Frankfurt's DAX down 0.6%, Paris' CAC 40 up 0.2% and the FTSE 100 in London climbing 0.7% in afternoon trade. All three indexes posted solid rallies while U.S. markets were closed Monday.Oil prices continued to trade moderately higher, up a bit less than 1%, after news of a possible production agreement between Saudi Arabia, Russia, Venezuela and Qatar. The agreement would halt output at January's high levels, and require production ceilings on Iran and Iraq, recovering producers which analysts generally see as unlikely to commit to what for them would be low-level curbs.On the Dow, Goldman Sachs (GS) and Home Depot (HD) added more than 2% each. Intel (INTC) was the index's worst early performer, down 0.6%.ADT (ADT) topped the S&P 500 with a 51% gain. The home security services provider announced it would be taken private in a deal with Apollo Global  Management at 42 a share, valuing the company at just above $6.9 billion.Other top performers among S&P 500 companies included ore miner Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), up 8%, and natural gas pipeline operator Williams Co. (WMB), up 6%.Signet Jewelers (SIG) popped more than 5% after reporting plans to voluntarily delist from the London Stock Exchange. The diamond seller reported less than 1% of its annual trading volume was executed on the LSE, making the expense of maintaining its market status there more weighty than the benefits.Among IBD 50 stocks, TAL Education (XRS) rumbled almost 7% higher in huge trade. That put the stock well above its 10-week moving average and about 2% from a 48.94 buy point in six week flat base. The stock had tripped a sell rule last week by diving more than 8% below that buy point.Surgical Care Affiliates (SCAI) pared gains, but remained up 4% in strong trade. The hospital and surgical center operator  reported fourth quarter earnings in line with, and revenue growth well above analyst consensus expectations. Shares are in the fifth week of a shallow consolidation.The early few losses on the IBD 50 list were modest, holding to less than 1%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

Nasdaq 100 futures were ahead 1.9%.The stock market today took some early strength from oil prices, which perked back above $31 a barrel, up more than 5% as a broad range of factors — including potential eurozone stimulus, terrorist attacks on Libyan oil sites, and cold weather in Europe and the U.S. — lifted prices and appeared to scare some short sellers out of their positions.Economic news starts with a preliminary estimate on January manufacturing from researcher Markit at 9:45 a.m. ET.

The move implied an opening back above the 556.70 buy point around which the stock has been caught up, but premarket moves do not always carry through to regular trade.LinkedIn (LNKD) hammered out a 4% premarket gain. The professional networking site ended Thursday with a 3.3% loss this week after falling in seven of the past eight weeks.Overseas, rising oil prices and possible stimulus action in Europe helped boost China's markets.

That left Shanghai up a half-point and the Hang Seng down 2.3% for the week.In Japan, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 bolted 5.9% higher, its biggest move in five months.

141,WMB,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for The Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 4% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is WMB due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Recent EarningsWilliams Companies reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 19 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents. The weaker-than-expected results can be attributed to absence of gains associated with transactions related to JV interests in the Permian basin and Marcellus shale. Lower commodity margins due to the sale of Geismar olefins facility also impacted the results.However, the bottom line improved from the prior-year figure of 14 cents per share.For the quarter ended Mar 31, 2018, Williams Companies reported revenues of $2,088 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,078 million. Further, revenues increased significantly from the year-ago quarter figure of $1,988 million.Segmental AnalysisWilliams Partners L.P.: This segment reported adjusted operating profit of $1,122 million, slightly higher than $1,117 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. Increased fee-based revenues driven by the partnership’s Transco’s expansion and higher gathered volumes drove the results.Other: The segment posted adjusted operating profit of $13 million, below the prior-year profit of $28 million.Expenses SummaryThe total cost and expenses increased 2.5% to $1,597 million in the reported quarter, compared with $1,558 million in the prior-year quarter. Increased costs were primarily driven by higher product costs and processing commodity expenses.Capital Expenditure & Balance SheetDuring the reported quarter, Williams Companies’ capital expenditure was $957 million. As of Mar 31, 2018, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $1,292 million. Long-term debt of the company was $21,397 million, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 69.3%.2018 OutlookThe guidance for 2018 remains unchanged from the prior outlook. The company anticipates net income from its major segment Williams Partners to be within the range of $1.5-$1.7 billion.  Williams Companies expects the annual dividend growth rate of 10-15% for 2018 and 2019, with the dividend-coverage ratio of 1.35x.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to two lower.Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Price and Consensus  Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Price and Consensus | Williams Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, WMB has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum is doing a bit better with a B. The stock was also allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is more suitable for momentum investors than those looking for value and growth.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, WMB has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

142,WMB,"We issued an updated research report on The Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report) on May 21. The company’s proposed acquisition of Williams Partners L.P. (WPZ  -  Free Report) units will simplify its corporate structure and improve operational efficiencies. However, we are worried about the constant regulatory setbacks the Constitution Pipeline is facing.Williams Companies currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that the stock will perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.The midstream energy player’s offer to absorb the rest of its midstream partnership for $10.5 billion is expected to simplify its organizational structure and improve its credit profile. The transaction will also help the company enhance its dividend coverage, making its 5% yield payout more sustainable.With an attractive dividend coverage ratio and above-average payout growth rate, Williams Companies is much favored by investors seeking a steady source of income. Moreover, the company has a long and consistent dividend-paying record. It has paid a common stock dividend every quarter since 1974. As such, we view Williams Companies' dividend as safe and reliable.Growth prospects for energy infrastructure all across North America remain exciting with the requirement to support producers in the growth of shale plays, especially in regions where there is a severe lack of facilities. This creates exciting opportunities for a pipeline firm like Williams Companies as it looks to capture the economic benefit of this trend.However, Williams Companies’ high-profile gas project, the Constitution Pipeline, is grappling with lawsuits and has been denied a water permit by both FERC and New York DEC for environmental reasons. Though the firm plans to seek a rehearing, it has crushed possibilities of the pipeline coming online by 2019. This will most likely affect the company's near-term earnings outlook.We are concerned about Williams Companies’ high debt level which leaves it vulnerable to volatile commodity prices. As of Mar 31, 2018, the company had long-term debt of $21.4 billion, which represents a debt-to-capitalization ratio of more than 69%. The high leverage restricts the financial flexibility of the firm and limits growth. Moreover, the stock lost 9.4% over the past year, compared with the industry’s 11.3% decline.Stocks to ConsiderTwo better-ranked players in the energy sector are BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) and WildHorse Resource Development Corp.

144,WMB,"The Williams Companies, Inc.’s (WMB  -  Free Report) Constitution Pipeline project recently suffered a major setback when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) refused to rescind New York’s denial of a water permit to the project. The ruling has come as a blow to pipeline developers’ endeavors to transport additional natural gas to New England, which relies heavily on pipeline imports from Canada and overseas.Williams Companies applied for the water permit in August 2013. However, the company withdrew and resubmitted the application twice, which led to the resetting of the one-year deadline by New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). In 2016, the DEC announced its decision not to grant the water permit to Williams Companies.Interestingly, the project had received FERC’s approval in early 2016. However, the DEC denied issuing a water quality permit to the pipeline claiming that the owners of the project and the FERC did not analyze the environmental impacts of the project adequately and the pipeline will possibly impact over 250 streams adversely.The pipeline company filed a petition in October 2017 requesting the FERC to repeal DEC’s decision. The company claimed that New York DEC failed to act on the application within the stipulated time frame. The petition filed by the company stated, “The Clean Water Act specifies that if a state agency fails or refuses to act on a request for certification under Section 401 within a reasonable period of time, which shall not exceed one year, after receipt of such request, the certification requirements shall be waived.”However, the FERC maintained that DEC acted within the necessary time frame, given the constant withdrawal of applications by the company which had deferred the decision.Notably, FERC had revoked New York Department of Environmental Conservation’s (DEC) denial of water quality certification to Millennium Pipeline in September 2017. Williams Companies had been hoping for a similar outcome for Constitution Pipeline, however FERC’s latest verdict crushed the hopes of the company to make its pipeline come online by 2019. Nevertheless, the company is planning to seek a rehearing.Notably, the project has also drawn severe censure from various activists and environmental groups as they are of the opinion that the project will have implications on public health and environment.Constitution Pipeline project is jointly owned by William Companies, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) , WGL Holdings, Inc.  and Piedmont Natural Gas Company which was acquired by Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) last year. The $750-million project runs from Pennsylvania to Schoharie County and has the capacity to transport 650,000 dekatherms of gas each day.Oklahoma-based Williams Companies presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1(Strong Buy) Rank stocks here. Over a year, Williams Companies’ stock has outperformed the industry  it belongs to. During the aforesaid period, Williams Companies’ shares have rallied more than 16.2% against the 1.5% gain of the broader industry.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

145,WMB,"Investors in The Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the December 29, 2017 $26.50 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Williams Companies shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Williams Companies is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Oil and Gas - Production and Pipelines industry that ranks in the Bottom 24% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has dropped the estimates. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has remained unchanged at 20 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Williams Companies right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay.

146,WMB,"The May 17, 2018 date is marked important on the calendar for energy infrastructure master limited partnerships (MLPs). This is because major energy companies made headlines on this day as they consolidated their respective pipeline assets. A flurry of merger and acquisition deals hit the energy MLP industry yesterday, mainly in response to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) tax overhaul, announced a couple of months ago to reduce certain benefits for the MLPs.  FERC Tax Overhaul: A Deadly Blow to the MLPsMLPs have long been attractive investment vehicles for energy investors, courtesy of the high yields and tax advantages for being structured as pass-through entities. As a result, MLPs used to allocate their pre-tax income to unitholders on a proportionate basis. The unitholders were responsible for paying their own share of the partnership's tax obligation.While FERC is not a tax-setting regulator, it does influence the rates a pipeline company can charge its customers to seek a proper balance between the pipeline companies’ profits and demands of the ratepayers.Therefore, the FERC felt that its 2005 policy on income tax allowance provided the partnerships an unfair benefit, possibly resulting in double recovery of costs and boosting their distributable cash flows.Thus, on Mar 15, the FERC barred the pipelines owned by MLPs from including their investors’ income tax allowance in their cost of service fees. The regulatory body ruled that the interstate oil and natural gas pipelines owned by MLPs will no longer be able to avail a credit for income taxes that they do not pay.The FERC ruling has definitely been negative for MLPs as the tariff rates will fall for certain pipelines. The partnerships charging cost-based rates for interstate transportation service would now have to lower customer tariffs to transport oil, gas and refined products around the country by the amount of their income tax allowances, substantial in certain cases. A reduction in cost recovery would likely cut into their cash flows. Under the new FERC ruling, holding interstate pipelines in MLP structures will no longer prove beneficial to the unitholders.Consolidation Trend Picks up on FERC Tax RulingIn a bid to simplify their corporate structure amid concerns emerging from the tax policy change, three leading energy companies, namely Williams Companies Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report), Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) and Cheniere Energy, Inc. (LNG  -  Free Report) announced merger deals yesterday, to snap up the remaining stake of their midstream subsidiaries. While Cheniere Energy holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Williams Companies and Enbridge carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Williams Companies, which currently holds a 74% stake in its pipeline unit Williams Partners L.P. (WPZ  -  Free Report), was the first to announce the buyout of the 26% interest in the MLP in a deal worth $10.5 billion.Further, Enbridge Energy inked an $8.9 billion all-stock deal to roll out two of its partnership units, namely Spectra Energy Partners LP (SEP  -  Free Report) and Enbridge Energy Partners LP (EEP  -  Free Report) along with two independent units of Enbridge Energy Management LLC and Enbridge Income Fund Holdings Inc., under a single entity.Later, Cheniere Energy kept the momentum alive by announcing its acquisition plans as well. Cheniere Energy currently holding 91.9% of its midstream subsidiary, inked a $530-million deal to secure the remaining 8.1% stake in Cheniere Energy Partners (CQH  -  Free Report).Offer Terms and Benefits of the Triple DealsWilliams Companies will acquire 256 million outstanding units of its midstream subsidiary. The company will exchange 1.494 shares of its common stock for each unit of Williams Partners. Williams’ bid represents 6.4% premium to Williams Partners’ closing unit price of $38.42 on May 16, thus valuing William Partners at $40.875 a unit. The deal has been approved by the board of directors of both firms.Subject to satisfactory closing conditions and shareholders’ approval, the transaction deal is expected to complete by autumn this year, post which, Williams Partners will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Williams Companies. Along with easing the organizational structure and improving the credit profile, the deal will also help Williams Companies enhance its dividend coverage, making its 5% yield payout more sustainable.Cheniere Energy plans to exchange 0.45 shares of its common stock for each unit of Cheniere Energy Partners. Notably, the top U.S. natural gas exporter rolled up its subsidiary for just 1% premium based on Cheniere Energy Holdings’ closing unit price of $27.95 as of May 16, thereby valuing the latter at $28.24 a unit. At the given price, Cheniere Energy Partners market cap would be $6.54 billion.The proposed transaction is subject to approval by the board of directors of both firms, post which, the deal would be culminated after meeting the closing conditions. The successful closure of the buyout will improve the company’s trading liquidity and facilitate access to the capital markets as well as lift its credit ratings besides simplifying the structural complexity.Per the Enbridge pact, the company will swap its shares for the equity of its four affiliates at a ratio equivalent to the closing price as of May 16, thereby denoting no premium. The deal will result into simplification of Enbridge’s organizational structure and boosting its credit rating, which witnessed a fall last year as the company’s decision to take over Spectra Energy in a $37-billion deal increased its leverage metrics.Having all the core assets under a single entity is likely to be a prudent move for expanding its investment appeal and attracting premium valuation. The merger plans, if it comes into effect under the proposed terms, are expected to have not much an impact on Enbridge’s current three-year financial outlook but will definitely prove conducive to its post 2020 guidance owing to tax and other synergies.Are Others to Follow Suit?The trio of deals amounting to a total of around $20 billion indicates a massive industry shift on a single day, which in turn might also motivate other akin companies to jump on the bandwagon.Notably, Energy Transfer Equity L.P. might just be the next in line. The firm is also considering a merger with its MLP Energy Transfer Partners LP, provided it gets a nod from the rating agencies suggesting that the combined entity would be able to maintain an investment grade-rating. In fact, the Energy Transfer Partners CEO hinted on the recent quarter earnings call that the merger would prove to be a strategic move by the company amid the tax ruling.Further, TransCanada Corporation believes that its MLP TC Pipelines LP no longer remains an attractive funding instrument under the new tax policy and hence, it mulls over purchasing its MLP.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

149,WMB,"Production and pipeline major, The Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report) recently received clearance from a U.S. federal appeals court to move ahead with the construction of Atlantic Sunrise natural gas pipeline worth almost $3 billion. The pipeline, which will connect Pennsylvania to South Carolina, will enable Williams Companies to transport Marcellus shale gas across the eastern region of the United States.Williams Companies expects the construction of the pipeline, which will be an expansion of the Transco system, to be completed by mid-2018. The pipeline will have a transportation capacity of around 1.7 billion cubic feet of gas per day (bcf/d). It will move Marcellus shale gas from Pennsylvania to the rest of the country. The company expects the pipeline to add value to its existing energy infrastructure, which will provide it with a steady flow of revenues in the future. It will also help citizens to receive affordable clean energy source as well as contribute to the economic growth of the country.At the beginning of this week, environmentalists appealed to the court for a stay of construction, which has now been overruled as the opponents of the pipeline could not gather satisfactory facts. The stay of construction could have potentially put 8,000 jobs at risk. The company intends to resume construction of the gas pipeline soon. Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) is one of the companies expected to use the pipeline once construction is complete. IT has already secured 1 bcf/d gas transport capacity on the pipeline.About Williams CompaniesTulsa, Oklahoma-based Williams Companies is a premier energy infrastructure provider in North America.

However, we remain worried about volatile natural gas prices and Williams Companies' high debt level.Price PerformanceWilliams Companies has lost 8.9% of its value year to date compared with 2.4% decline of its industry.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderWilliams Companies currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

150,WMB,"North American energy firm The Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 15 cents per share missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents. Higher impairment charges incurred during the quarter along with unfavorable changes in the income tax provision led to the weaker-than-expected results.Further, the bottom line also deteriorated from the prior-year figure of 20 cents per share. This was mainly due to the absence of gains associated with the Geismar olefins facility which was divested on Jul 6.  Higher costs and lower adjusted profit from William Partners L.P. (WPZ  -  Free Report) also led to lower year-over-year earnings.For the quarter ended Sep 30, 2017, Williams Companies reported revenues of $1,891 million, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,825 million.

Unfavorable impacts from the disruptive hurricanes along with the absence of results from the Geismar facility and higher costs led to weaker results. Other: The segment posted adjusted operating profit of $12 million compared with the year-ago profit of $3 million. Results were mainly driven by the absence of unfavorable results from certain former Canadian operations which were offloaded in September 2016.Expenses SummaryThe total cost and expenses increased 3.5% to $1,614 million in the reported quarter compared with $1,560 million in the prior-year quarter. Increased costs were primarily driven by higher impairment charges of $1,210 million incurred in the reported quarter as against $1 million in the third quarter of 2016. However, this was mainly offset by $1,095 million gain on sale of Geismar facility.Further, operating and maintenance costs (O&M) and product costs also rose in the quarter under review.Capital Expenditure & Balance SheetDuring the reported quarter, Williams Companies’ capital expenditure was $644 million.

151,WMB,"The Williams Companies, Inc.

Williams Companies has a dismal record of pulling an earnings surprise. It has not beaten estimates in any of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average negative earnings surprise of 29.83%.Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Williams Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayWilliams Companies’ midstream subsidiary William Partners, L.P. (WPZ  -  Free Report), which is less sensitive to commodity prices, helps the company to maintain a steady stream of revenues. Analysts polled by Zacks expect $2,087 million revenues for the quarter under review compared with $1,988 million in the prior-year quarter. We believe that the company could benefit from increasing volumes and processing margins from the Transco pipeline-expansion projects, placed into service in 2017.The company is expected to benefit from the Northeast G&P operating region on the back of high throughput volumes and acquisition of stakes in two Marcellus Shale gathering systems.Williams also increased its stake in the Williams Partners subsidiary to 74%. This positioned the company for long-term sustainable growth while solidifying investment-grade credit ratings of its subsidiary.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model also shows that Williams Companies is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for this company is +8.33%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 23 cents is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Williams Companies carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) which, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us confident of an earnings beat.Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Other Energy Stocks with Favorable CombinationWilliams Companies is not the only energy firm looking up this earnings season. Here are some companies from the energy space, which, according to our model, also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.07% and a Zacks Rank #1. The company is anticipated to release earnings on May 3.

154,WMB,"It was a week where the price of oil rallied. However, natural gas futures were down slightly.On the news front, energy biggies Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY  -  Free Report), The Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report) and Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report) came up with strong earnings reports.  Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 4.2% to close at $61.68 per barrel, while natural gas prices lost 1% to $2.558 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Earnings Beats & Dividend Hikes from Total, Anadarko & Suncor)The U.S. oil benchmark recorded its second increase in five weeks. The major catalyst was the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded a lower-than-expected weekly build. A tumbling dollar – that made the greenback-priced crude more affordable for investors holding foreign currency – provided further support.Meanwhile, natural gas prices dropped last week despite a larger-than-expected decrease in supplies. The decline was primarily on account of strength in the commodity’s production Investors were also spooked by forecasts of warmer weather, leading to the heating fuel’s tepid demand.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Houston-based energy explorer Occidental Petroleum reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of 41 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. In the year-ago quarter, the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company had posted a loss of 13 cents. The outperformance was owing to improvement in worldwide sales volume and realized price of oil and natural gas liquids. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Occidental Petroleum’s average daily net oil, liquids and gas production volume increased to 621,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day (boe/d) from 583,000 boe/d reported in the year-ago quarter. This increase could be attributed to increased drilling activity and well productivity in the Permian Resources region.Occidental Petroleum’s proved reserves at the end of 2017 were 2.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent, out of which 60% is located in the United States and the rest in other international locations. Finding and development costs (F&D) were $8.53 per BOE in 2017 compared with $9.65 per BOE in 2016.

The bottom line improved from the prior-year figure of 17 cents per share. Better year-over-year results can be attributed to absence of impairment charges associated with equity method investments and favorable changes in the income tax provision.During the reported quarter, Williams Companies’ capital expenditure was $699 million. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had cash and cash equivalents of 899 million compared with $170 million in the year ago quarter. Long-term debt of the company was $20,434 million, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 67.9%.The company issued a preliminary guidance for 2018, wherein it anticipates the net income from its major segment Williams Partners to be within the range of $1.5-$1.7 billion range.  Williams Companies expects the annual dividend growth rate of 10-15% for 2018 and 2019, with the dividend-coverage ratio of 1.35x.(Read more Williams Companies Q4 Earnings in Line, Sales Top)3.    Upstream energy firm Marathon Oil posted fourth-quarter adjusted income of 7 cents per share, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2 cents. In the year-earlier quarter, the company incurred adjusted loss of 10 cents. The strong numbers came thanks to higher production and the recovery in crude prices. In particular, total quarterly output rose 12% year over year to 383,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day (BOE/d).The company’s exploration expenses for the quarter came at $57 million, higher than $34 million in the year-earlier quarter. Moreover, Marathon Oil’s total quarterly cost and expenses rose 7.3% to 1,174 million.During the year, Marathon Oil spent $2,100 million on capital programs, in line with its guidance. The company announced a 2018 capital program of $2,300 million, with 90% of the outlay earmarked for high return U.S. resource plays.Marathon Oil expects first-quarter 2018 United States E&P output available for sale in the range of 265,000–275,000 BOE/d and International E&P output in the range of 105,000–115,000 BOE/d.

The prime reservoir of the project – discovered in March 2015 – holds approximately 1.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.BP was able to start production from the Atoll field seven months before it was planned. Moreover, the company was successful in reducing the operating cost of the upstream project by 33% from its initial projection. BP’s daily oil and natural gas production from the field currently stands at 10,000 barrels and 350 million cubic feet, respectively.Investors should know that Atoll Phase One project is the first key upstream development of BP, having initiated operations in 2018. During 2016 and 2017, BP managed to bring 13 key developments online, which already boosted the company’s daily production by more than 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BoE). The firm believes that all these major projects might help reach its target worth 900,000 BoE of daily new output by 2021.

(XOM  -  Free Report) recently agreed to divest its 50% stake in the Scarborough gas field offshore Western Australia to Woodside Petroleum Ltd for $744 million. The gas field is located in the Carnarvon Basin.The divestment can shrink ExxonMobil's risky asset portfolio and give an opportunity to focus on comparatively cheaper offshore liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) prospects in Papua New Guinea, Mozambique and others.Moreover, the company was of the opinion that the economic development of the gas field involved a few challenges like water depth, resource characteristics and execution complexities. With production unlikely to start before 2025, short-run payoff from the field is not available.Additionally, offshore drilling is excessively expensive that might dent the company’s cash flow. The Scarborough project’s overall estimated cost was $9.7 billion. ExxonMobil’s move is likely to enable the company to improve its cash flow situation.

157,WMB,"The Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Feb 14.In the preceding quarter, the Tulsa, OK-based company reported a negative earnings surprise of 21.05% owing to higher impairment charges and unfavorable changes in income tax provision.Coming to the earnings surprise history, Williams Companies has a dismal record. The company missed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 24.47%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Williams Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteFactors at PlayWilliams Companies’ extensive natural gas exposure raises its sensitivity to the commodity’s price. Natural gas prices ended the quarter at $2.95 MMBtu compared with $3.72/MMBtu in the year-ago quarter, reflecting a decline of around 20.7%. The weakness in the natural gas prices is likely to have an adverse effect in the volumes and revenues of William Partners LP (WPZ  -  Free Report), the company’s largest income generating segment.The analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2,157 million for the quarter compared with $2,198 million in the prior-year quarter.We believe that the company could benefit from increasing volumes and processing margins from the Transco pipeline expansion projects placed into service in 2017. However, the company’s overall results could be offset by the higher operating and maintenance costs for making the project functional. While the company is expected to benefit from its Northeast G&P operating region on the back of high throughput volumes and acquisition of stakes in two Marcellus Shale gathering systems from Western Gas Partners, LP (WES  -  Free Report), it is likely to suffer from decreased earnings from its West operating area. The company posted weaker year-over-year earnings from the segment in the third quarter and the trend is likely to continue in the fourth quarter owing to weaker drilling activities in Barnett shale and Eagle Ford shale among others.  Further, the company is also likely to be affected by lower throughput volumes due to its divestments of Geismar Plant and Canadian assets.We are also concerned of Williams Companies’ high profile gas project, the Constitution Pipeline, which is suffering from constant regulatory setbacks. The pipeline has been denied water permit by both FERC and New York DEC on environmental grounds, crushing the hopes of the company to make it online by 2019, thereby diluting the near-term earnings outlook.Finally, we also remain concerned of the high leverage metrics of the company (more than 71%) which further restricts the financial flexibility of the firm and limits growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Williams Companies is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 20 cents.Zacks Rank: Williams Companies currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Note that we caution against a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) stock going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stock to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Williams Companies, here is a firm from the same industry that you may want to consider as it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Enbridge (ENB  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.88% and a Zacks Rank #3.

158,WMB,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices logged handsome gains.On the news front, Anglo-Dutch oil giant Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) agreed to acquire a 43.8% stake in Silicon Ranch – a solar energy company, while upstream players Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report) and Encana Corp. (ECA  -  Free Report) provided updates regarding their fourth-quarter production outlook.Overall, it was a bullish week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 4.7% to close at $64.30 per barrel, while natural gas prices soared nearly 15% to $3.20 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Hess' Oil Find, Petrobras' $2.95B Settlement & More)Building on its second annual gain in a row, oil prices maintained its solid start to the New Year. The second week of 2018 saw U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest closing since December 2014. The major catalyst was the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded another higher-than-expected weekly draw. On a further bullish note, domestic oil production snapped its steadily rising trend and fell for the second time since October.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 32 of the last 40 weeks and are down almost 114 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 419.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 13.2% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2015.Meanwhile, natural gas – one of 2017’s worst-performing commodities – registered a big jump following a record decrease in supplies. The massive, 359 billion cubic feet (Bcf) withdrawal was blamed on strong demand due to freezing temperatures over bulk of the country.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    In a bid to bolster its renewable energy business, Royal Dutch Shell recently inked a deal to acquire a 43.8% stake in Silicon Ranch Corporation from Partners Group. The deal will help Shell leverage its position as one of the top three wholesale power sellers in the United States along with boosting its New Energies division.Silicon Ranch is a leading solar energy company in the United States and the deal will make Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Shell its largest stakeholder. Silicon Ranch operates around 100 solar facilities across the United States, having about 1.9 gigawatts of solar-based power facilities in its development portfolio. Per the deal, the company will continue to operate under its existing management and retain its brand. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The transaction could be valued up to $217 million in cash, contingent on Silicon Ranch’s performance. Subject to regulatory approvals and satisfactory closing conditions, the deal is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of 2018. Further, the deal also provides Shell an opportunity to increase its stake in Silicon Ranch after 2021.

Houston-based upstream player estimates fourth-quarter production from international operations to miss the prior guidance — provided in October 2017 — owing to weaker-than-expected performance of some of its projects in the North Sea.The company currently expects the fourth quarter production values from international operations to be in the range of 138,000-140,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) compared with its prior forecast levels of 150,000-160,000 BOE/d. Unexpected shutdown of Forties Pipeline System and underperformance of wells in the Beryl area have been the primary factors for the lower forecast. Nevertheless, Apache expects improved realized prices to offer respite amid the declining volumes.As it is, the company has been bearing the brunt of contracting production volumes in all the last three reported quarters. From January to September 2017, Apache’s production averaged 345,495 BOE/d, down 13% from the first nine months of 2016. (Read more Apache Stock Down on Production Guidance Cut for Q4)3.    Shares of Encana moved up around 2.5% to eventually close the day at $13.64 on Jan 9 after the company announced that fourth-quarter production volumes from core assets beat estimates. The upstream operator has successfully repositioned its asset base and shifted focus to four key growth areas namely Montney, Duvemay, Eagle Ford and Permian.On the back of the strength of core assets, Canadian energy behemoth delivered year-over-year production growth of approximately 31% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Further, the output also topped the high end of the company’s guidance range of 25-30%.While the exact total production figures have not been released, an increase of around 31% implies that the output from the core assets jumped to around 310,601 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) in the fourth quarter of 2017 as against the 237,100 BOE/d (or 74% of the total production) recorded in the year-ago quarter. (Read more Encana Gains as Output From Key Assets Tops Estimates in Q4)4.    The Williams Companies, Inc.’s (WMB  -  Free Report) Constitution Pipeline project recently suffered a major setback when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) refused to rescind New York’s denial of a water permit to the project. The ruling has come as a blow to pipeline developers’ endeavors to transport additional natural gas to New England, which relies heavily on pipeline imports from Canada and overseas.Williams Companies applied for the water permit in August 2013. However, the company withdrew and resubmitted the application twice, which led to the resetting of the one-year deadline by New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). In 2016, the DEC announced its decision not to grant the water permit to Williams Companies.From Interestingly, the project had received FERC’s approval in early 2016. However, the DEC denied issuing a water quality permit to the pipeline claiming that the owners of the project and the FERC did not analyze the environmental impacts of the project adequately and the pipeline will possibly impact over 250 streams adversely.

159,WMB,"The Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report) recently urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to extend the timeline of its long-delayed Constitution pipeline, per Reuters. The project was approved by the regulatory board in December 2014 but the construction process has been facing resistance from the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) since April 2016.The pipeline runs from Pennsylvania to New York and can addresses natural gas demand in more than 3 billion homes. The pipeline’s construction faced a blow from the New York environmental regulators who turned down the company’s request for a water quality permit, due to which Williams wants to push the timeline to December 2020. The company has already challenged the environmental regulators’ denial, which awaits another ruling from the FERC.Originally, the pipeline was scheduled to come online in December 2016. Following the water permit denial, the regulatory board agreed to push the date to December 2018. As the permit is yet to come, the company does not expect the project to be finished within the given time. Williams has already withdrawn and resubmitted the pipeline’s application twice so far. After receiving the required permits, the company expects to take around 10 months to a year for the completion of the project.The 125-mile pipeline (201 kilometers) is designed to ship 0.65 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of natural gas extracted from the U.S. shales. Apart from providing clean energy, the pipeline is also expected to generate many jobs for the localities. With the project being delayed, the cost is increasing, which is a high concern for the company. In 2013, the cost of the project was estimated at around $683 million, which has now gone up to about $875 million.Apart from Williams, energy companies like Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) and WGL Holdings, Inc.  also own stakes in the pipeline.Price Performance and Zacks RankTulsa, OK-based Williams has lost 6.8% in the past year compared with 10.9% fall of the industry it belongs to. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, price of oil at the end of the third quarter was $51.67 per barrel, up about 10.5% sequentially. A year ago, crude prices lingered around $45 per barrel.Natural Gas: Prices of natural gas dropped about 3.5% in the July-September period owing to the fuel’s tepid demand due to mild weather conditions and hurricane-related power outages. Despite the sequential fall, natural gas prices remain favorable when compared with the corresponding period of 2016.

This is evident from the current upbeat projection of 148.2% year-over-year earnings growth for the sector. The top line is likely to witness an improvement of 19.7% from the year-ago levels.True to the predictions, the sector came out quite a winner. So far, for the sector components enlisted on the S&P 500 index, total Q3 earnings grew 253.9% on 33.5% higher revenues.Energy Stock Reporting Q3 Earnings on Nov 1Let’s see what’s in store for three energy companies that are slated to release their quarterly numbers.Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report): Texas-based upstream player is slated to report results after the closing bell.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Last quarter, the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 90.91% on improved drilling program and higher price realizations. Also, for the last four quarters, Pioneer Natural’s average positive surprise was 46.74%.Pioneer Natural is expected to keep its earnings streak alive this quarter also as it has the right combination of the two ingredients.

However, Marathon Oil has topped estimates in three out of the last four quarters with an average beat of 1.57%.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Marathon Oil is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.Marathon Oil Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Marathon Oil Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Marathon Oil Corporation Quote The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly output is pegged at 237,000 BOE/d, higher than the 222,000 BOE/d reported in the prior quarter. This may boost the company’s prospects. However, lower price realizations for oil and gas especially in the international markets may put the company’s earnings under pressure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average realized oil and gas prices in the international markets are pegged at 8.8% and 11.5%, lower than the prior-quarter levels.Our model did not predict an earnings beat earlier too. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an earnings ESP of -11.54% and carried a Zacks Rank #3.The Williams Companies, Inc.

162,WMB,"Energy infrastructure provider The Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report) is hopeful of its Constitution Pipeline project to begin service by 2019, subject to necessary regulatory approvals.  The pipeline company requested the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to repeal New York's denial of a water permit which was necessary to move ahead with the project.  The company applied for the water permit in August 2013. The state however failed to act on the permit request within the one year of the statutory deadline. In 2016, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) denied the water permit to Williams Companies. The company believes such delays lead to a waiver of the federal Clean Water Act's Section 401 water quality certification requirement.The petition filed by the company states, “The Clean Water Act specifies that if a state agency fails or refuses to act on a request for certification under Section 401 within a reasonable period of time, which shall not exceed one year, after receipt of such request, the certification requirements shall be waived.”The project is jointly owned by William Companies, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) , WGL Holdings, Inc.  and Piedmont Natural Gas Company which was acquired by Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) last year. The 121-mile natural gas pipeline, which runs from Pennsylvania to Schoharie County was to transport natural gas from the Marcellus shale to customers in the North East.The $750-million project has the capacity to transport 650,000 dekatherms of gas per day. The pipeline which has received President Trump’s support aims to address the problems of transportation infrastructure in the Northeast region and speed up shipments from the prolific Marcellus and Utica basins.The project was expected to become operational in 2015, but got delayed due to lengthy review process, pushing the in-service date to late 2016. The project received the FERC’s approval in early 2016. However, the DEC denied to issue a water quality permit to the pipeline due to its possibility of impacting the ecology and climate adversely.  The DEC claimed that the owners of the project and the FERC did not analyze the environmental impacts of the project properly and that the pipeline can possibly impact over 250 streams adversely.If FERC agrees to the company’s request to retract the water permit denial, William Companies will seek a Clean Water Act Section 404 permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. If it secures all the necessary approvals, the pipeline is likely to come online by the first half of 2019.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

163,WMB,"It has been more than a month since the last earnings report for Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 5.7% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Williams Companies Q2 Earnings and Sales Lag EstimatesWilliams Companies reported adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 13 cents per share missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents. Unfavorable changes in the income tax provision led to the weaker-than-expected results. Further, the bottom line also deteriorated from the prior-year figure of 19 cents per share. This was due to a favorable adjustment related to the reversal of a cumulative anticipatory foreign tax credit in the prior year quarter.For the quarter ended Jun 30, 2017, Williams Companies reported revenues of $1,924 million, below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,262 million. However, revenues increased from the year-ago quarter figure of $1,736 million thanks to higher contribution from Williams Partners. Revenues of Williams Partners were higher by 10.2% to $1,919 million in the quarter.Segmental AnalysisWilliams Partners: This segment reported adjusted operating profit of $1,104 million, up 3.7% from $1,065 million in the year-ago quarter. Absence of $ 341 million of impairment charges and higher fee-based revenues drove results.Other: The segment posted adjusted operating profit of $9 million compared with the year-ago breakeven level. Results were mainly driven by the absence of $406 million of impairment charges. The results were partially offset by unfavorable adjustments related to the income tax provision.Expenses SummaryThe total cost and expenses decreased 30.6% to $1,543 million in the reported quarter compared with $2,224 million in the prior-year quarter. Reduced costs were mainly driven by the $777 million decrease in the impairment charges. The decrease in impairments includes the absence of $747 million of impairments related to Canadian operations.Further, operating and maintenance costs (O&M) and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (S, G&A) and depreciation costs also declined in the reported quarter. However, the product costs rose to $537 million in the quarter compared with the prior-year quarter figure of $401 million.Capital Expenditure & Balance SheetDuring the reported quarter, Williams Companies’ capital expenditure was $545 million. As of Jun 30, 2017, the company had cash and cash equivalents of 1,198 million, as against $135 million in the year ago quarter. Long-term debt of the company was $21,325 million, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 71.9%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been three downward revisions in the current quarter.Williams Companies, Inc. Price and Consensus  Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Price and Consensus | Williams Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, the stock has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum is lagging a lot with an F. Meanwhile, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is solely suitable for value investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of this revision also indicates a downward shift. Notably, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We are expecting an inline return from the stock in the next few months.

164,WMB,"Oil giant ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 28, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 95 cents per share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 85 cents. The quarterly earnings also increased from 43 cents in the year-earlier quarter. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Exxon Mobil Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Exxon Mobil Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Exxon Mobil Corporation QuoteFactors to Consider this QuarterSince the beginning of 2014, long-term debt load has been increasing. Our proprietary model shows that from 2014 to 2016, the company’s long-term debt increased from nearly $11,653 million to $28,932 million.Also, net cash flow from operations has been declining steadily over the last three years, which reflects weak operations owing to persistently low commodity prices.  Oil and gas prices have been down for almost three years and during second-quarter 2017, the prices of the commodities deteriorated further. The prolonged weakness can be attributed to the supply glut in the commodity market. In the quarter under review, oil and natural gas prices fell 8.4% and 5%, respectively. Hence, OPEC’s historical production cut extension deal until Mar 2018 has failed to drive upward price movement.This development is not favorable for oil giants like ExxonMobil as the company’s cash flow might get affected further.Following the shale revolution, the area along the Gulf Coast, which boasts plentiful supply of oil and gas, has regained focus. ExxonMobil is expected to capitalize on the availability of cheap natural gas to manufacture chemicals and energy efficient plastics for export. In other words, the company will cater to the growing demand for chemicals and refined fuels by taking advantage of the shale revolution. Hence, ExxonMobil is expected to generate significant cash flows from its downstream operations in the to-be-reported quarter as well as in the long run.Share Price MovementShares of ExxonMobil have underperformed the industry in the last three months. During the aforesaid period, ExxonMobil’s stock has lost 1.8%, while the broader industry declined 1.6%. It remains to be seen how the stock fares after the second-quarter earnings release.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that ExxonMobil will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -2.35%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate stands at 83 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 85 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: ExxonMobil carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Please note that the Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.  Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Boardwalk Pipeline Partners LP (BWP  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.90% and a Zacks Rank #1.

165,WMB,"It was a week where Tropical Storm Harvey dictated the prices of oil and natural gas. In particular, gasoline shortages caused by the storm boosted the fuel to almost 2-year highs.On the news front, France’s TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) agreed to acquire Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk’s oil and gas unit for $7.45 billion, while American supermajor Chevron Corporation’s (CVX  -  Free Report) Chief Executive John Watson is reportedly planning to leave his post by next month.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures pulled back 1.6% to close at $47.87 per barrel, natural gas prices remained essentially unchanged at $2.892 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Transocean, Chevron & More.)Despite a hefty inventory draw, oil prices recorded another weekly decline. The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded another big drop on continued strong refinery runs. With oil supplies falling for the eighth week, investor sentiment has turned slightly positive on dissipating fears about a meltdown to sub-$40 levels. Analysts also believe that the trend, if sustained, could help tighten the market significantly. The commodity got further fillip from the reduction in U.S. rig count (number of rigs searching for oil) for the third week in four.However, these positive effects were more than offset by the steadily rising domestic oil output that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. At 9.528 million barrels a day, production is at the highest level in more than two years, thereby cancelling out cuts from OPEC and its allies.Meanwhile, natural gas was unchanged despite an in-line increase in supplies. In particular, worries over the fuel’s tepid demand on the back of bearish weather predictions and Tropical Storm Harvey-related power outages offset the gains from the inventory data and pushed down natural gas prices to week-ago levels.Gasoline Price Spikes on Harvey ShutdownsBut the major mover for the week was gasoline. The most widely used petroleum product ended around 2.6% higher on the week to $1.667 a gallon after Tropical Storm Harvey caused weeks of disruptions at refineries in its path and shut units, spark fires and create supply shortage affecting facilities for months.The Gulf of Mexico, which is expected to bear the brunt of the storm, is the energy hub of the United States. It accounts for about 18% and 5% of the total oil and gas production of the nation respectively. The region is also a home to about 50% of the country’s refining capacity. Refineries in the path of the storm have already shuttered leading to weaker crude demand and reduced gasoline supply.The sudden outages in the refineries have driven up gasoline prices on anticipated supply shortages. And with the expectation of lower crude demand due to refinery outages, traders are selling oil.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    French energy giant TOTAL S.A. announced that it has entered into a definite agreement to acquire Denmark-based Maersk Oil & Gas A/S (Maersk Oil) in a share and debt deal worth $7.5 billion. This acquisition – expected to close in the first quarter of 2018 – will allow TOTAL to combine Maersk Oil’s high-quality assets spread globally with its existing assets. The combination of Maersk Oil’s North-Western Europe businesses with TOTAL’s existing portfolio will position the latter as the second largest operator in the North Sea with strong production profiles in the U.K., Norway and Denmark.TOTAL will be able to increase its aggregate hydrocarbon production level to 3,000 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2019 from 2,500 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day at the end of second quarter of 2017. Internationally, in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Algeria, East Africa, Kazakhstan and Angola there is an excellent fit between TOTAL and Maersk Oil’s businesses allowing for value accretion through commercial, operating and financial synergies.This acquisition is going to be immediately accretive to TOTAL’s earnings per share and cash flow. The company expects to generate operational, commercial and financial synergies of more than $400 million per year. (Read more TOTAL Acquires Maersk Oil for $7.45B, Expands Globally.)2.    As per media reports, Chevron’s CEO John Watson is planning to step down, as the company seeks managerial changes to deal with the volatile dynamics of the oil industry. Chevron is expected to announce the transition next month and the company’s vice chairman Michael Wirth is highly anticipated to replace Watson as the new CEO.Watson was appointed as the CEO in 2010. During his seven years of checkered tenure he remained focused on three major strategies. These include the acceleration of the development of Chevron’s Permian holdings, cost-cutting initiatives amid the industry downturn and planned completion and execution of its mega projects.Though oil prices have improved from their lows, but still they are hovering around or below the $50 per barrel mark. Persistent weakness in oil prices poses challenge to the upstream operations of the company as it is not being able to sell crude at attractive prices and hence is unable to generate significant cash flows for shareholders. Chevron, being an integrated player, is trying to increase its focus on downstream business which can be profitable in the current environment.With the election of Wirth — who has substantial knowledge and experience regarding refining and petrochemicals — as the CEO, Chevron will follow the footsteps of energy majors like Exxon Mobil Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell plc and TOTAL S.A., all of whose CEO’s are refining specialists.(Read more: Chevron's CEO Watson Likely to Step down, Wirth to Take Over.)3.    Offshore contract driller SeaDrill Limited  reported a break even in the second quarter earnings, which compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company delivered a strong 97% economic utilization of its floater fleet and 98% on its jack-up fleet. However, the bottom line deteriorated from year-ago adjusted earnings of 59 cents per share owing to lower revenues and high restructuring costs. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Total operating revenues of $577 million in the reported quarter was down 34% from $868 million in second-quarter 2016. Lower revenues are attributed to the lower day rates along with West Tucana and Sevan Louisiana drillships which remained idle during the quarter.As of Aug 24, total order backlog at SeaDrill was $3.1 billion. This comprised $1.2 billion for the floater fleet and $1.9 billion for the Jack-up fleet. The average contract duration is 10 months for floaters and 30 months for Jack-ups.SeaDrill which reported a net loss of $15 million in the quarter and is battling with huge debt and liabilities is in advanced discussions with lenders regarding the restructuring of debts. The company is likely to file for Chapter 11 within three weeks. In July 2017, the company reached an agreement with its bank group to extend the date to Sep 12 by which a comprehensive restructuring plan must be agreed upon.

The court’s ruling came as a blow to pipeline developers’ endeavors to transport additional natural gas to New England, which relies heavily on pipeline imports from Canada and overseas.The $750 million, 121-mile project – jointly owned by William Companies, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation, WGL Holdings, Inc. and Piedmont Natural Gas Company – runs from Pennsylvania to Schoharie County and was supposed to transport natural gas from the Marcellus shale to customers in the North East. The pipeline aimed to address the problems of transportation infrastructure in the Northeast region and speed up shipments from the prolific Marcellus and Utica basins.The project was expected to become operational in 2015, but got delayed due to lengthy review process, pushing the in-service date to late 2016. The project received the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) approval in early 2016.The latest decision reverses FERC’s approval received by the project. Also, the company has been directed to reassess the environmental impacts of the pipeline.

The restructuring will involve a capital contribution by Petrobras to its subsidiary and a partial spin off. The capital injection will be used for the pre-payment of debts contracted by Petrobras Distribuidora and guaranteed by Petrobras.The state-run integrated major is set to invest R$ 6.3 billion (or 2 billion in USD) into its fuel distribution subsidiary which is grappling with heavy debt for years. The move comes after the Brazilian government proposed to sell the controlling stake in Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras SA or Eletrobras on Aug 22 to balance the budget deficit and promote competition and efficiency to the business.Petrobras supplies gas to the state-controlled utility and the latter owes Petrobras and its various subsidiaries around R$10.4 billion. The capital investment is expected to strengthen the balance sheet of Petrobras Distribuidora thus enabling it to attract investors for its initial public offer.

166,WMB,"Energy infrastructure provider The Williams Companies, Inc.’s (WMB  -  Free Report) Constitution Pipeline project recently suffered a major setback when the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals reiterated New York Department of Environmental Conservation’s (DEC) decision to stall the pipeline. The court’s ruling came as a blow to pipeline developers’ endeavors to transport additional natural gas to New England, which relies heavily on pipeline imports from Canada and overseas.The project is jointly owned by William Companies, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report), WGL Holdings, Inc.  and Piedmont Natural Gas Company which was acquired by Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) last year. The 121 mile natural gas pipeline, which runs from Pennsylvania to Schoharie County, had been planned to transport natural gas from the Marcellus shale to customers in the North East. The $750 million project has the capacity to transport 650,000 dekatherms of gas each day. The pipeline aimed to address the problems of transportation infrastructure in the Northeast region and speed up shipments from the prolific Marcellus and Utica basins.The project was expected to become operational in 2015, but got delayed due to lengthy review process, pushing the in-service date to late 2016. The project received the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) approval in early 2016. However, DEC had rejected water quality permit to the pipeline in 2016 owing to its possibility of impacting the ecology and climate adversely.  DEC claimed that the owners of the project and the FERC did not analyze the environmental impacts of the project properly and that the pipeline will possibly impact over 250 streams.Concurrently, the pipeline owners filed a lawsuit challenging DEC’s decision. FERC granted the developers additional two years for a thorough review and completion. The $750 million pipeline project had also drawn much censure from various activists and environmental groups as they were of the opinion that the project will have negative impact on public health and environment.Nevertheless, the owners of the pipeline still were optimistic about their five-year project that received President Trump’s support and challenged DEC’s decision. However, the court dismissed the lawsuit.The decision reverses FERC’s approval received by the project. Also the company has been directed to reassess the environmental impacts of the pipeline.Oklahoma-based Williams Companies presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

167,WMB,"North American energy firm The Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 13 cents per share missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents. Unfavorable changes in the income tax provision led to the weaker-than-expected results. Further, the bottom line also deteriorated from the prior-year figure of 19 cents per share. This was due to a favorable adjustment related to the reversal of a cumulative anticipatory foreign tax credit in the prior year quarter.For the quarter ended Jun 30, 2017, Williams Companies reported revenues of $1,924 million, below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,262 million. However, revenues increased from the year-ago quarter figure of $1,736 million thanks to higher contribution from Williams Partners L.P. (WPZ  -  Free Report). Revenues of Williams Partners were higher by 10.2% to $1,919 million in the quarter.Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Williams Companies, Inc.

(The) QuoteSegmental AnalysisWilliams Partners:This segment reported adjusted operating profit of $1,104 million, up 3.7% from $1,065 million in the year-ago quarter. Absence of $ 341 million of impairment charges and higher fee-based revenues drove results.Other:The segment posted adjusted operating profit of $9 million compared with the year-ago breakeven level. Results were mainly driven by the absence of $406 million of impairment charges. The results were partially offset by unfavorable adjustments related to the income tax provision.Expenses SummaryThe total cost and expenses decreased 30.6% to $1,543 million in the reported quarter compared with $2,224 million in the prior-year quarter. Reduced costs were mainly driven by the $777 million decrease in the impairment charges. The decrease in impairments includes the absence of $747 million of impairments related to Canadian operations.Further, operating and maintenance costs (O&M) and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (S, G&A) and depreciation costs also declined in the reported quarter. However, the product costs rose to $537 million in the quarter compared with the prior-year quarter figure of $401 million.Capital Expenditure & Balance SheetDuring the reported quarter, Williams Companies’ capital expenditure was $545 million. As of Jun 30, 2017, the company had cash and cash equivalents of 1,198 million, as against $135 million in the year ago quarter.

168,WMB,"Electric utility SCANA Corporation (SCG  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter 2017 earnings on Aug 3, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 13.14%. However, the average positive earnings surprise for the last four quarters was 1.87%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Factors Likely to Influence this QuarterSCANA Corp. is well positioned to benefit from a positive regulatory environment as it has a low risk business with outstanding customer growth and operational efficiency. These factors are favorable for stable cash flow generation and growth.However, during the first quarter of 2017, the company’s cash balance decreased 94.2% while long-term debt has been on the rise since the beginning of 2014, reflecting huge costs related to nuclear projects. Hence, the company’s weak balance sheet is a lingering concern.  Q2 Price PerformanceShares of SCANA have gained 2.6% during the quarter, significantly outperforming the industry’s 0.1% rise.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for SCANA Corp. this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -1.35%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at 73 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is higher at 74 cents.

169,WMB,"Markets are a little more than halfway through the Q2 earnings season, with 57.2% S&P 500 members having reported results as of Friday, Apr 28.Picture Emerging Thus FarWe now have Q2 results from 286 S&P 500 members that combined account for 68.8% of the index’s total market capitalization. According to the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these companies are up 11.3 from the same period last year on 6.1% higher revenues, with 74.5% positive earnings surprises and 69.2% beating revenue estimates.Energy Earnings SoarThe ‘Energy’ sector has been off to a spectacular start. For the 48.5% sector components on the S&P 500 index that have reported Q2 results, total earnings surged 226.2% on 15.5% higher revenues. While 50% of the companies have been successful in beating earnings estimates, 81.3% outperformed the top line.Energy: First Half RecapLast year, 'Energy' was the strongest S&P sector performer, with a market-thumping 24% return. In particular, November's historic OPEC-led production cut deal to alleviate a supply glut managed to buoy oil prices and stabilize them around the psychologically important $50 per barrel threshold. The commodity was on a stellar run on optimism surrounding the agreement, and the outlook for oil stocks was getting better.The seemingly positive developments encouraged investors to bet on firming prices for 2017 with the oil industry finally hoping that 'this would be the year.' True to the strong sentiments, U.S. oil prices reached around $55 per barrel in late February, the highest level in 19 months.However, the situation is drastically different now, with the commodity floundering in recent weeks. By Jun 21, crude had cratered more than 20% from its February highs and officially plunged into bear territory. In fact, prices ended down 14.3% for the first half of the year – the worst performance since 1998.Let's take a look at how oil and gas prices behaved during the second quarter of this year.Strong Q2 Earnings Growth PredictionA look back at the Q1 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector were spectacular, driving the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index.The Jan-Mar 2017 period turned out to be a rather good one with both oil and natural gas prices benefiting from easier comparison figures from the year-ago period. While crude slumped to some 12-year low in the first quarter of 2016, natural gas futures dropped to its worst level in almost 17 years.As a result, the sector – whose year-earlier comparison was to an aggregate loss – came out swinging. For the sector components on the S&P 500 index, total Q1 earnings saw robust year-over-year dollar growth on 33.8% higher revenues. While 69.7% of the companies were successful in beating earnings estimates, 63.6% outperformed the top line.The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q2 earnings season as well. This is not surprising, considering that oil and gas are both averaging higher compared to the second quarter of 2016 when the energy companies reported unusually low bottom line. While earnings for the Oil/Energy sector are set to jump a massive 249.0% – the highest year-over-year growth among all sectors – the top line is likely to show an improvement of 16.5% from the second-quarter 2016 levels.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Aug 2Let’s see what’s in store for four energy companies expected to come up with June quarter numbers on Wednesday, Aug 2, after market close.First, we have energy infrastructure provider The Williams Companies Inc. (WMB  -  Free Report). In the previous quarter, this Tulsa, OK-headquartered transporter of oil and gas missed estimates, weighed down by rising costs and expenses.Regarding earnings surprises, The Williams Companies has a decent record, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate just once in the last four reports. And our model indicates that the company is likely to beat on earnings this time around too.This is because, as per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.For the quarter to be reported, The Williams Companies has an Earnings ESP of +50.00% and a Zacks Rank #3, wh the right combination of two key ingredients. (Read more: Is Williams Companies Poised for a Beat in Q2 Earnings?)Simultaneously, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Williams Companies, Inc.

(OXY  -  Free Report) is another energy player set to report second-quarter 2017 results. The company – with significant exploration and production exposure, together with chemical and midstream operations – has a mixed track of having outperformed estimates in two of the last four quarters.However, Occidental Petroleum is not expected to add to its positive surprises in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because the company has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. (Read more: Is Disappointment Likely for Occidental in Q2 Earnings?)Occidental Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Occidental Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Occidental Petroleum Corporation QuoteThen there is Houston, TX-based leading upstream energy firm Marathon Oil Corp.

However, with an Earnings ESP of -7.14% and a Zacks Rank #4, our proven model shows that an earnings beat is unlikely for Marathon Oil in the upcoming quarterly release.

(CXO  -  Free Report) reporting second-quarter 2017 results. Coming to the earnings surprise history, this Midland, TX-headquartered energy explorer – with producing properties mainly in the Permian Basin of southeast New Mexico and west Texas – has been on a bull run: it went past estimates in all the last four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 247.57%.Powered with the right combination of two key ingredients – an Earnings ESP of +2.33% and Zacks Rank #3 – our proven model shows that an earnings beat is likely for Concho Resources in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Concho Resources Inc.

170,WMB,"Leading North American independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products, Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report), is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the opening bell.The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the last four quarters with an average earnings beat of 16.25%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement. Valero Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Valero Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Valero Energy Corporation QuoteFactors to ConsiderValero Energy has the most diversified refinery base among independent refiners, with a capacity of 3.1 million barrels per day in its 15 refineries across the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean. We note that the company is favorably positioned to benefit from increased refining margins, mainly due to its strategic refinery structure that enables it to use cheaper oil for more than half of its needs.Although crude ended the second quarter of this year with a decline of 4.7%, the pricing environment of commodities was much healthier than the year-ago quarter, courtesy of the historical OPEC agreement. Improvement in oil prices is definitely not favorable for Valero as the input cost for refiners increase with a price hike.  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Valero Energy is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Valero Energy currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.08. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Valero Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power. However, the company’s 0.00% Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction inconclusive.Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Though the company’s shares have underperformed the industry during the April–June quarter of this year, it remains to be seen how the stock performs after the earnings release.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model.

The company expects to win more contracts from upstream energy players for drilling oil wells.Also, shares of Ensco have underperformed the industry during the first quarter.

172,WMB,"Oilfield services behemoth, Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 21, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company’s earnings of 25 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate but decreased from 40 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Investors should note that the company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement. Schlumberger N.V. Price and EPS Surprise  Schlumberger N.V. Price and EPS Surprise | Schlumberger N.V. QuoteFactors to ConsiderSchlumberger is the largest oilfield services player in the world and is present in every energy market across the world. In all its operating business segments, the company maintains its position as one of the players. Given its size, attractive reservoir and well-established technology, the company is likely to outperform peers. We appreciate the company’s greater reliance on international market where operations are expected to get a boost in late 2017 to 2018. Although, activities outside the U.S. have hit fresh lows in the first quarter but in the long run, Schlumberger is expected to gain from its international operations.However, weaknesses in oil and gas prices could mar demand for oilfield services by upstream energy companies. During the April-to-June quarter of this year, oil and natural gas prices fell 8.4% and 5%, respectively. Lower commodity prices might lead to reduced exploration and production activities. This could call for lower investments by oil majors which will impact revenues of the company.Price Performance in Q2During the quarter, Schlumberger’s share price have lost 12.6% compared with the 15.1% decline of the Zacks categorized Oil and Gas – Field Services industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Schlumberger is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

173,WMB,"Independent energy firm, Southwestern Energy Company (SWN  -  Free Report), is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 4, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company had delivered earnings of 18 cents per share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 17 cents. Notably, the company incurred a loss of 8 cents in the year-ago quarter. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.     Southwestern Energy Company Price and EPS Surprise  Southwestern Energy Company Price and EPS Surprise | Southwestern Energy Company QuoteFactors to Consider this QuarterSouthwestern Energy has a diversified reserve base in multiple U.S. basins and remains focused on investments in high-return areas such as Fayetteville, Appalachia and other new ventures. Moreover, the company maintains a competitive cost structure, which contributes to steady growth and returns throughout the business cycle. The benefits are expected to be reflected in the second-quarter earnings as well.Despite these positives, Southwestern Energy’s shares have underperformed the industry in the last three months. During the aforesaid period, shares of the company have lost 23.8% compared with the industry's growth of 3.4%.However, natural gas price fell considerably from the level it was trading during early 2014. This provides little space for Southwestern Energy to flourish, as the commodity accounts for almost all of the company’s reserves and production. A volatile macro backdrop also raises concern as it might compel the company to perform below expectations.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Southwestern Energy will beat estimates this quarter.

174,WMB,"Energy player Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3, before the opening bell.In the preceding three-month period, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 21.05%. Coming to the earnings surprise history, Chesapeake beat estimates in three of the last four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Chesapeake is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +7.14%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 15 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 14 cents earnings. This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Chesapeake carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which when combined with positive Earnings ESP, makes us confident about an earnings beat.Note that stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Meanwhile, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Q2 Price PerformanceDuring the quarter, Chesapeake has lost 16.3% as compared to the 16.8% decline of the industry.Factors Likely to Affect EarningsThe crude pricing scenario over the first two months of second-quarter 2017 was way rosier than the year-ago period. Hopes of OPEC’s production cut deal extension was the prime factor driving the year-over-year hike in prices during April and almost the entire of May. Market anticipations proved somewhat correct as OPEC and 11 non-OPEC players, including Russia, decided to extend the production cut deal until Mar 2018 in the Vienna meeting.The same goes for natural gas as the average trading price of the commodity for each of the three months of the quarter was considerably better than the prior-year quarter. Thus, we can conclude that there was a modest recovery in natural gas prices during Q2 after the commodity hit its lowest annual average price during 2016 in almost 20 years.  We can say that the healthy commodity prices were favorable for the upstream business of the company. In fact, the rig count data provided by oilfield service firm Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) showed that for each week in second-quarter 2017, shale drillers kept on adding rigs in the oil patches reflecting increased exploration operations.Higher production of the commodities is likely to create more need for pipeline and storage infrastructures for transporting and storing the surplus output of oil and gas. Hence, the second quarter could prove favorable for Chesapeake’s midstream business as well.On top of that, the balance sheet looks healthy as reflected by the decline in long-term debt over the last three years.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther energy companies you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Global Partners LP (GLP  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +60.00% and a Zacks Rank #1.

175,WMB,"Midstream energy assets operator Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 19.Last quarter, the company had delivered a 5.56% negative earnings surprise. However, Kinder Morgan posted an average positive earnings surprise of 1.67% for the last four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Factors to ConsiderKinder Morgan has the largest network of natural gas pipelines in North America that spread over almost 70,000 miles. Most importantly, the company’s midstream properties are linked to all the prospective plays in the U.S. that are rich in natural gas.These extensive networks of natural gas pipelines, for which the company has invested billions of dollars, provide it with stable fee-based revenues. In fact, Kinder Morgan expects 91% of its 2017 cash flow generation to come from fees charged for its midstream properties.However, weaknesses in oil and gas prices could mar demand for midstream energy assets by upstream energy companies. During the April to June quarter of this year, oil and natural gas prices fell 8.4% and 5%, respectively. Lower commodity prices might call for reduced exploration and production activities. This could call for lower need for transportation and storage properties for carrying and storing the commodities produced.Price Performance in Q2During the quarter, Kinder Morgan has underperformed the Zacks categorized Oil/Gas Production Pipeline Mlp industry. Over the aforesaid period, the stock has lost 11.9% compared with the 9.6% decline of the broader industry. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Kinder Morgan is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is +7.14% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 15 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at 14 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Kinder Morgan carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Please note that we caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderThough an earnings beat looks uncertain for Kinder Morgan, here are some firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model. These have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Boardwalk Pipeline Partners LP (BWP  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +3.45% and a Zacks Rank #1.TransCanada Corporation (TRP  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of + 7.84% and a Zacks Rank #1.The Williams Companies Inc (WMB  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of + 22.22% and a Zacks Rank #2.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively. And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Williams Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Williams Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Williams Companies is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Williams Companies is +50.00% because the Most Accurate Estimate of 27 cents is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 18 cents.

Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Factors at PlayBoth the Marcellus and Utica regions continue to experience strong production growth due to increased drilling efficiency in the regions. The average natural gas production in the Marcellus region was up by 7.4% in second-quarter 2017 from the prior-year quarter. Further, the Utica region also witnessed year-over-year growth of 17.2% in natural gas production. This development bodes well for the company and is expected to drive revenues.The pricing scenario for natural gas has improved from the year-ago quarter. This is a favorable development for Williams Companies as we expect the company to be able to sell the increased output at higher prices. This, in turn, is expected to boost the company’s second-quarter results.The company’s midstream MLP William Partners LP (WPZ  -  Free Report), from which Williams Companies derives most of its revenues, is expected to benefit from expansion projects. Increased growth prospects across North America is expected to unlock attractive opportunities for production /pipeline firms like Williams Companies, Kinder Morgan, Inc.

177,WMB,"Noble Corporation plc (NE  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter 2017 earnings results around Aug 3, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.53%. In the last four quarters, Noble Corp. had an average negative surprise of 15.36%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Noble Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Noble Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Noble Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Noble Corp. is likely to beat on earnings this time because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.  Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +6.06%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 31 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 33 cents. This is very meaningful and a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Noble Corp. carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating on earnings. The combination of Noble Corp.’s favorable Zacks Rank and a positive Earnings ESP makes us confident about an earnings beat.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.  Factors Likely to Influence this QuarterNoble Corp. is a leading offshore drilling firm with a robust portfolio of assets. Though the industry has witnessed a setback in the past few months, the company is likely to be less impacted by it than its peers. This is because Noble Corp. enjoys a strong backlog position ($3.5 billion).Moreover, Noble Corp. has been able to significantly reduce expenses related to oil and gas production activities during first quarter of 2017. The success on this front reflects the company’s consistent efficiency gains and cost-reduction initiatives and should prove favorable for the second-quarter earnings.The company’s price chart is unimpressive. Shares of the company underperformed the industry, year to date. While Noble Corp.’s shares have lost 31.7%, the broader market indices declined 20% during the aforesaid period.However, the offshore drilling industry is witnessing rig oversupply. This is a cause for concern for the likes of Noble Corp. as an increase in rig count may hamper contract flow and dayrates. In addition, major oil companies are lowering deep-water capital spending, thereby worsening the situation.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are other firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model.

178,WMB,"Upstream energy player EOG Resources Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) is expected to release second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company posted an earnings surprise of 0.00%. In the last four quarters, the company’s average earnings surprise was a positive 21.79%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Influencing This Past QuarterAs compared to the year-ago quarter, the pricing scenario for both crude and natural gas has improved considerably. This is a favorable development for EOG Resources as it has been able to sell the commodities at favorable prices.  Also, for second-quarter 2017, EOG Resources expects production in the range of 562.2−592.7 MBOE/D, higher than 551.1 MBOE/D recorded in the April-to-June quarter of 2016. Hence, higher projected output in the view of increased oil and natural gas might drive earnings for EOG Resources.However, we are concerned about the company’s long-term debt scenario. Since the beginning of 2015, EOG Resources’ long-term debt has been on the rise, reflecting the company’s weak balance sheet.Stock PerformanceDuring the quarter, EOG Resources lost 7.2% as compared to the 16.9% decline of the industry.   Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that EOG Resources is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

Newfield beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the prior four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 41.24%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Newfield Exploration Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Newfield Exploration Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Newfield Exploration Company QuoteFactors Likely to Influence EarningsThough we remain positive on Newfield’s emerging resource play development program, we believe that a lower natural gas price environment as compared withmid-2014 level could weigh on the stock since most of its reserves are tied up in the commodity. Since oil and gas prices have been increasingly volatile in recent years, it tends to effect the sector’s stock performance.Additionally, Newfield’s high leverage and its Rockies and Gulf Coast-centered asset portfolio, along with its lack of meaningful exposure to the emerging shale plays, is a competitive disadvantage.However, horizontal drilling in Wasatch and high pressure Uteland Butte are likely tohelp the company enhance its shareholders’ value.Q2 Stock Price PerformancePricing chart for the first three months of this year reveals that Newfield’s shares have outperformed the industry.

Notably, the company incurred a loss of 22 cents in the year-ago quarter. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.   Range Resources Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Range Resources Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Range Resources Corporation QuoteFactors to Consider this QuarterFor 2017, the company has set its production guidance at 2.07 Bcfe per day, which translates to annual growth rate of 33–35%. Given the recovery of natural gas prices from the multiyear low levels, we expect the company to be able to sell the increased output at higher prices. This, in turn, should boost the company’s second-quarter results.The company also projects capital spending of $1.15 billion for 2017. The raised guidance was issued after two consecutive years of capital budget reduction. The company believes that higher activity along with more spending should support significant production growth in this quarter as well as in the future.Despite these positives, Range Resources’ shares have underperformed the industry in the last three months.

182,WMB,"Leading refining player Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter 2017 earnings on Aug 1, before market opens.The company’s earnings surprise history is impressive. Phillips66, which was spun off from ConocoPhillips (COP) on May 1, 2012, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 432.25%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.     Phillips 66 Price and EPS Surprise  Phillips 66 Price and EPS Surprise | Phillips 66 QuoteFactors Likely to Influence EarningsThe company’s free cash flow has been negative over the last two years, reflecting weak business operations. Hence, its ability to pay dividends is at risk. Since the beginning of 2012, there has been exponential growth in long-term debt, reflecting Phillips 66’s weak balance sheet.However, it is to be noted that the company’s prospects are negatively correlated with oil prices. This is because refiners buy raw crude to produce refined products like gasoline. Oil and gas prices have been low for almost three years now and during second-quarter 2017, the prices of both commodities deteriorated further. The prolonged weakness can be attributed to the supply glut in the commodity market. During the quarter under review, oil and natural gas prices fell 8.4% and 5%, respectively. Therefore, this was favorable for the refiners as decrease in crude price translates to lower input cost. This is likely to be reflected in the company’s second-quarter profitability.Q2 Stock Price PerformancePricing chart for the first three months of this year reveals that Phillips 66’s shares underperformed the industry. During the aforesaid period, the company’s shares gained 5.2% as against 8.2% increase for the broader industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Phillips 66 will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -3.81%.
