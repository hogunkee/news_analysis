6,ALL,"There are lots of short-term solutions to address the wave of immigrants who have swarmed the border in an effort to enter the U.S. illegally.Why not use the thousands of currently half-empty residence halls at American colleges and universities to help house families from Central America and Mexico who await adjudication of their asylum claims? The federal government could contract out to universities such as UCLA, Stanford, Cal-Berkeley and large public universities in Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico to offer migrants temporary summertime shelter and sustenance. Law schools could offer pro bono legal counseling, and medical schools could offer health services.Such multifaceted help from institutes of higher education would be particularly apt — and far better than using military bases. The vast housing, recreational and meal-service infrastructures of colleges are often underutilized in summer. Campuses are also bastions of liberal activism, proud both of their diversity and their expertise in dealing with sensitive matters of acculturation.What better first glimpse of America could be offered to immigrants than the energy, pastoral beauty and hospitality of a quiet college quad or well-maintained residence hall?It also makes no sense for college students to venture far and wide for internships when they could be enlisted on campus over the summer to tutor children from Central America and to monitor their safety and treatment.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIf progressives believe that sovereignty and border enforcement are passe notions, then they should at least match their rhetoric with concrete solutions. In California, there are ongoing existential crises with homelessness, unaffordable housing and dismal public schools that rate near bottom of national surveys.How could California square its present circle of being both the most impoverished and affluent of states — the most callous in fact, the most caring in theory?Why not cease the current stampede to private academies that has left the public schools of the greater coastal corridor non-diverse and near-apartheid?The huge Los Angeles Unified School District is now over 70% Latino, as whites and Asians have fled the arrival of immigrant children. It's much the same in Silicon Valley, where private prep schools are expanding enrollments to meet the demand from the affluent members of the tech industry.Yet scholarly studies show that immigration works best when new arrivals are fully ingratiated into diverse schools, neighborhoods and social activities.The huge, multibillion-dollar market capitalizations of West Coast giants such as Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and Yahoo have so far not led to more affordable housing, more diverse top-flight public K-12 schools, or a growing middle class energized by new arrivals from Mexico and Central America.Instead, despite the rhetoric of inclusion, and televised and tweeted fury at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the progressive left coast is among the most exclusionary of all American communities.Zoning and environmental laws drive immigrants into enclaves and ghettoes. Gentrification ends up in the eviction of the first-generation immigrant poor from already overpriced rental units.It is almost as if the louder one rails about unfair border enforcement, the more likely one is to avoid encounters with illegal immigrants. Outrage has become a safe way for elites to signal their virtue, acting out in theory what they are uncomfortable doing in fact.One of the strangest scenes in impoverished rural Fresno County, where I live, is the epidemic of substandard housing. Almost every small old farmhouse now has trailers and shacks tacked on to them — all substandard and not meeting codes — to accommodate recent waves of new immigrants from Mexico and Central America.Yet the media often showcase the huge gated homes and enclaves of Silicon Valley, Hollywood and the journalistic elite. Surely some of all that unused square footage and those guest houses could be used to offer at least temporary hospitality to those in need.Actor Peter Fonda could do far better to help immigrants than by tweeting threats to 12-year-old Barron Trump from his most non-diverse ranch in Paradise Valley, Montana. Instead, Fonda might advocate that Hollywood actors live among newly arrived immigrants, associate with them as equals rather than as the help, and promote public schools by ensuring that their own children and grandchildren attend them.Better yet, why doesn't Fonda invite a few of the immigrant families awaiting word on their legal status to the open spaces of his Montana ranch? Media accounts of his expansive and tasteful digs show an infrastructure that easily could accommodate a few needy immigrant families.It is easy to invoke the Nazis and the Holocaust to express anger at the temporary detention of children and their families who have entered the U.S. illegally. It would be far more meaningful if marquee journalists, actors, academics and activists knew immigrants not just as a distant abstract cause, or as nannies and landscapers, but as their neighbors, their children's school friends — and as their social equals.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:The Left Tries To Blame Trump For Their Own Hate MongeringSeparating Families At The Border: The Hysteria Overlooks Some Key Facts

7,ALL,"Wondering how the U.S. stock market keeps skirting disaster? It's not complicated. For all the drama at their doorstep, trader positioning remains overwhelmingly bullish.It's visible in manager surveys, which last week showed equity funds only a trifle less long than at the height of January's euphoria. It's in markets for call options, where individual investors are engaged in a buying binge of historic dimensions. It's in tech IPOs, stocks favored by short sellers and ones with shaky balance sheets, all of which recently surged.For traders so inclined, each trauma is just another test, even as their frequency quickens. In Tuesday's version, Donald Trump's threat to slap tariffs on $200 billion more in goods from China sent the S&P 500 down as much as 1.1%, while the Dow Jones industrial average fell for a sixth day, the longest streak since March 2017.""We've had more negative catalysts and more negative pull this year than we've had for a long time, but the positives continue to prevail in the investor's mind,"" Jeff Carbone, a managing partner at Cornerstone Wealth in North Carolina, said by phone. ""They're shrugging off the negativity and taking the positive to a greater extent that this is not the end.""It's not that people haven't been warned. They have their memories of February and March, and strategists at banks from Morgan Stanley to Goldman Sachs have repeatedly urged investors to rein in optimism, citing everything from politics to peak earnings and monetary tightening. Earlier today, Citigroup flagged a potential bubble in growth stocks.But the caveats have gone unheeded. In one example, smaller options investors, defined as those who typically trade 10 contracts or fewer in one transaction, last week purchased to open more than 4.5 million calls, an amount that before this January was unprecedented in records going back to 2000, data compiled by Sundial Capital Research showed.While the rush to bet on higher share prices has helped the market stay buoyant this month amid an interest-rate increase from the Federal Reserve and growing trade tensions, it also sets bulls up for pain should things quickly reverse in coming months.""This is fine for now, but we think by year end such a 'risk on' hierarchy will be misplaced given the more uncertain outlook posed by 'peaky' growth rates and ever tightening financial conditions,"" Mike Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley wrote in a note to clients Monday. He urged investors to go defensive in anticipation of a rotation out of companies whose growth is tied to economic growth and upgraded utility stocks.Wilson isn't alone among analysts who see trouble brewing. The rally in growth stocks brought flashbacks of the internet bubble to Citigroup strategists led by Robert Buckland, even as valuation premiums are less than half of those almost two decades ago. A collapse would bode ill for a market whose gains have been increasingly anchored on tech giants such as Amazon.com (AMZN) and Facebook (FB).""Price action of the U.S. growth/value trade looks ominously similar to late 1999,"" the strategists wrote. ""Watch out for a growth bubble.""Bulls have been unfazed, emboldened — as always — by a bedrock of earnings expectations that keeps getting stronger. Estimates compiled by Bloomberg show equity analysts see S&P 500 profit rising 24% in 2018 then 10% in each of the next two years.Numbers like those make it easier to bid up companies that recently went public and those with weaker finances. An exchange-traded fund that tracks newly listed stocks, the Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO), last week posted its second-best gain this year while a Goldman Sachs (GS) basket of companies with flimsier finances outpaced their stronger counterparts.To Matt Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management, all the anxiety over geopolitical turmoil will eventually fade.""People, rightfully so, are just basically saying this could happen, that could happen, but those are 30 or 40 really bad decisions in a row that have to happen for those to come to fruition,"" he said. ""We always confuse hiccups for heart attacks when we're adjusting to the news — just what could happen versus what does happen usually.""As bulls press ahead, bears have been retreating. A Goldman basket of 50 heavily shorted companies jumped more than 3% last week. In the options market, small traders have reduced their bearish wagers. As a result, more than two calls were bought at open for one put that changed hands, one of the highest ratios on record, Sundial data showed.While options are often employed as a hedging tool by large speculators, small traders typically use them to make a direct bet on market directions, said Jason Goepfert, president of Sundial Capital. The latest buying in calls stood out in a market where broad equity trading remained anemic, triggering a spike in its ratio as a percentage of NYSE volume.Coincidentally or not, such indications of retail euphoria flared up in January, just before the S&P 500's first 10% correction in two years. It also accompanied the bull market peaks in 2000 and 2007.""What's most remarkable about the jump in call volume is that it comes during a time of overall suppressed volume,"" Goepfert said. ""That doesn't exactly seem like a good sign.""With the price of call options now trading above historic average, investors should sell them to reap extra returns in a market whose upside appears limited with valuations stretched, according to Rocky Fishman, an options strategist at Goldman Sachs. The firm predicted that the S&P 500 will end next year at 3,000, or an 8% increase from the last close. That'd be below the 45th percentile in the index's history over any 18-month period.""The potential for upside surprises in U.S. equities is lower than the compensation received from elevated call prices,"" he wrote in a note.

But in rare cases, a client stumbles upon an unexpected fortune.Whether they receive a surprise inheritance or hit the jackpot in some other unpredictable twist of fate, individuals can find themselves facing a host of challenges. Advisors step in to provide perspective and sound judgment.To help clients manage unforeseen wealth, advisors wear many hats. Aside from offering tax planning and investment advice, they may serve as a sounding board as clients adjust to a new reality.""Money changes people,"" said Joe Wirbick, a certified financial planner in Lancaster, Pa. ""Their family dynamic changes. Their kids act differently. Their friends act differently. It can get ugly.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOver a decade ago, he worked with a client who won the lottery. The client used some of the money to build his sister a house.Everything started off amicably, but the sister kept expanding the square footage well beyond what they originally agreed. As the construction cost soared, Wirbick's client pulled the plug.This led to a feud, and the siblings stopped speaking to each other.""If you don't earn money slowly over time, you don't know how to handle it when it comes all at once,"" Wirbick said. ""You are not equipped to manage that money.""His client started attending a support group for lottery winners, where they heard cautionary tales of how others had squandered millions. Wirbick recalls that his client couldn't believe that another support group member spent $50,000 on a toilet seat embedded with gold coins.Advisors can play a stabilizing role in keeping their clients grounded after gaining great wealth. That's especially true if they've known the client for years and earned their trust.""I've seen too many people give away their money to their kids or grandkids and, 15 or 20 years later, they may not have enough for themselves,"" Wirbick said.He gives three pieces of advice to those who acquire a huge windfall: It's important to be a good steward of the money, the dollar amount is not as large as it appears on paper, and try not to let everyone know.On a deeper level, advisors strive to enable clients to extract more meaning from their newfound wealth. Doubling as life coaches, they offer guidance on how to harness the money to leave a lasting legacy.Michelle Maton, a Chicago-based certified financial planner, cites a client who sold a painting for vastly more than she paid decades earlier. Maton posed a series of questions such as, ""What have you always wanted to do?"" and ""Who will this impact?""""That clarifies their values,"" Maton said. ""It uncovers what's really important to them. Say their family is really important. They have a choice of buying a fancy car or taking the family on a big vacation every year.""When basking in sudden wealth, clients can look to their advisor to take on a new role as a family mediator. Financial planners often lead meetings to educate family members on the repercussions of having so much money.""With my clients, we discuss what expectations family and friends might impose on them and what expectations they impose on themselves,"" Maton said. ""I tell clients that they can say to their adult children that I've set this rule (about disbursing funds), that they can make me the bad guy.""In addition, advisors can provide a calming influence amid the turbulence that accompanies a planeload of money. Their ability to assess the situation with clear-eyed understanding produces an invaluable benefit.""The first thing we say to a client is, don't do anything until we develop a plan for what the money would be used for,"" said Ryan Dennehy, an advisor in San Ramon, Calif. ""There's no rush. The worst case is to lose it in a casino right away.""From his experience with two clients who hit the jackpot — one in a lottery, the other in a lawsuit award — Dennehy prioritizes debt avoidance. He cautions clients to resist the temptation to finance their high-ticket purchases.""You can buy so much more if you finance it out, but that's what gets people in trouble,"" he said. For newly rich clients, he recommends that they spend $1 million in cash to purchase a home outright than buy five $1 million properties — paying a total of $1 million and borrowing the rest.""Those mortgages stack on top of each other,"" he said.

12,ALL,"The stock market was solidly in positive territory early Monday, as the major indexes looked to rally for a third-straight trading session. Leaderboard stock and FANG name Netflix (NFLX) neared a fresh all-time high after an analyst's price-target hike, while fellow FANG member Facebook (FB) set an all-time high. Meanwhile, top Chinese stocks, like Alibaba (BABA), were broadly higher, but well off their early morning high prices. (For updates on this story and other market coverage, visit the Stock Market Today.)The Dow Jones industrial average led the stock market's action with a 0.8% rise. The S&P 500 moved up 0.5%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq was up just 0.3% after backing off its early high. All three major indexes looked to extend a win streak to three trading sessions.Among the Dow stocks, JPMorgan (JPM) was one of the top performers, with a 2% advance. Shares remain under their 50- and 200-day moving average lines. The global investment bank will announce its Q2 results on Friday.Among the FANG stocks, Netflix was the top performer, moving up more than 2%. Barclays raised the video streaming platform's price target from 370 to 450 — an increase of more than 21%.

The stock's slide was on pace to extend a losing streak to five trading sessions early Friday, moving down about 0.7%. Shares are trying to find support near their 50-day line.

A previous breakout above a 201.60 double-bottom failed when it triggered the 7%-8% loss-cutting sell signal.Among the top growth stocks, Chinese stocks were some of the stars early Monday. China Lodging (HTHT) briefly reclaimed its 50-day line with an over-4% advance, but those gains were all but gone through morning trade. Momo (MOMO) jumped almost 2%, as it continues to rebound from its 50-day line.ZTO Express (ZTO) rose nearly 1% and is finding support around its 50-day line.

20,ALL,"Autohome (ATHM) is the IBD Stock of the Day and provides a lesson on how a double-digit gain can vanish quickly.Autohome on Monday flashed a sell signal as the stock went on an unwanted round trip. That's when a stock gives up everything it gained from the breakout. It's also a reason to pay close attention to your portfolio during a rough day on the stock market.Chinese stocks like Autohome, Alibaba (BABA), JD.com (JD), Baidu (BIDU) and others were getting hammered Monday amid continuing trade-war threats between the U.S. and China. President Trump increased his threats over the weekend, planning to stop Chinese companies from investing in U.S. technology companies.Autohome is a leading online market for automobile consumers. Its cloud platform for used-car sellers now covers more than 35,000 dealers.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAutohome stock is benefiting from burgeoning sales of automobiles online and the growth of China's urban middle class for whom the car is a status symbol.The stock hit a buy point of 107.64 on May 30, a day before the company was added to the closely watched MSCI indexes of China stocks. Company shares jumped 6.3% that day to close at 109.07. The stock broke above the 107.64 buy point from an ascending base, considered a rare but bullish chart pattern that can lead to powerful gains.The IBD Stock Of The Day column can help you understand, for example, the right time to buy a stock, and the optimal time to sell. An ascending base forms when buying pressure forces a stock higher, while general weakness in the market triggers periodic flight among investors.It consists of a series of three pullbacks, each ranging from about 10% to 20% from the most recent high to low. Each of the pullbacks must mark a higher high and a higher low — thus, the ascending base. However, both Autohome and Atlassian (TEAM) provide the lesson that in a weakening market, an investor should always prepare an exit plan even after a leading stock produces this key chart pattern.And while the bases tend to be bullish, some do fail. Alibaba Group broke out from an ascending base in September. The stock rose 8% before pulling back far enough to trigger the automatic sell rule in February.Autohome stock came public in December 2013, soaring more than 75% on its first day of trading. The Autohome initial public offering IPO raised $133 million, pricing shares at 17. The online automotive advertising market in China has achieved rapid growth as a result of the development of China's automotive and Internet industries. China is the largest market for car sales globally, but only an estimated 54 out of 1,000 Chinese own cars.Autohome makes money mainly from advertising. It also has growing sales in auto finance and data products.But where there is market opportunity, there is also competition. Autohome competitors include BitAuto (BITA), a provider of online data and services for China's automotive industry.More competition is emerging from China-based Uxin. The company offers one of the largest used-car e-commerce platforms in China, in terms of both the number of transactions facilitated and total GMV in 2017. Uxin is scheduled to commence an initial public offering, pricing shares Tuesday and trading Wednesday. It aims to raise $437 million by offering 38 million American depositary shares at a price range of 10.50 to 12.50. That gives it a fully diluted market value near $3.5 billion.

The small-cap S&P 600 dropped 1.7%.

22,ALL,"Theater, much like Japan's Kabuki — that's all the Supreme Court confirmation process is. Donald Trump's presentations of his two nominees, Judge Neil Gorsuch last year and Judge Brett Kavanaugh on Monday, were uncharacteristically graceful — a worthy theatrical innovation, in the view of even some Trump critics.Now we get to watch clips of Kavanaugh's visits to senators' offices — where he'll most likely never return to after the playacting is over — with cordial words from Republicans certain to vote for him and maybe even from Democrats certain to vote against.Then there will be hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, presided over by the folksy but canny Chairman Chuck Grassley, with the ranking Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, perhaps restrained by her imposition of what sounded like a constitutionally prohibited religious test for office on another judge on Trump's Supreme Court shortlist.This process is ostensibly to enable senators to make informed decisions. But Kavanaugh is certain to invoke the 1993 precedent set by his District of Columbia Circuit predecessor Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She refused to say how she'd vote in any case.Sure, everybody knows that judges shouldn't make decisions off the tops of their heads. But everyone also knows that they have to deny ammunition to the other side and avoid doing what Judge Robert Bork unfortunately did in 1987. Supreme Court nominees for years have been very smart people, able to deftly avoid this mistake.Of course, everyone knows the outcome of this play, just as they do when they go see ""Hamlet."" Praise from liberal legal scholars Akhil Reed Amar and Benjamin Wittes won't make any difference in the outcome. Kavanaugh will be confirmed, with all Republicans and perhaps a few Democrats voting in favor of his appointment.Curiously, our constitutional republic managed to get along for 127 years without Senate hearings on Supreme Court nominees, and for the next 61, many justices were confirmed after perfunctory hearings or none at all. And since the hearing on Bork and Clarence Thomas' 1991 hearing, the confirmation process has been just theater.Any suspense about the outcome has been eliminated by Senate Democrats' decision to end the filibuster for lower-court nominees and their threatening one against Gorsuch, which predictably led Republicans to apply their rule to Supreme Court nominees. Sometimes partisan rage leads politicians to do self-defeating things.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseJournalists, too. CNN's legal expert Jeffrey Toobin quickly tweeted that Kavanaugh's confirmation would mean ""abortion illegal; doctors prosecuted; gay people barred from restaurants, hotels, stores; African-Americans out of elite schools; gun control banned in 50 states; the end of regulatory state.""That's mostly silly. How many commercial establishments want to bar gay people (assuming they could identify them)? How many elite schools want to reject all black applicants?As for abortion, Democrats have predicted that every Republican nominee would overturn Roe v. Wade. But Roe isn't even the operative precedent today. Planned Parenthood v. Casey later allowed some restrictions on abortion and recognized that medical progress might require allowing more. Assumptions that the ""arc of history"" will always move toward abortion are being undermined at every step by polls and practice.Polls show stable views on abortion, with most Americans favoring additional restrictions and younger voters perhaps even more anti-abortion than their elders. And in practice, abortions are increasingly rare. The pro-choice Guttmacher Institute reports that the peak year for the ratio of abortions per female between the ages of 15 and 44 was 1982 and that the peak year for total abortions was 1990.Since then, the number has fallen from 1.6 million annually to fewer than 1 million. Forty-four percent of abortion facilities are located in just two states, California and New York, according to one pro-life group, and 48% of abortions are performed in five — those two plus New Jersey, Florida and Illinois. A reversal of Roe and Casey would allow states to criminalize abortion, but states in which about 80% of current abortions are performed certainly wouldn't.Toobin's tweet got one thing right. A Justice Kavanaugh, with Justice Gorsuch and others, might produce a consequential change in eroding or overturning the high court's 1984 decision in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, which requires courts to defer to regulatory agencies' interpretation of statutes. Reversal would require Congress to make hard choices rather than punt to unaccountable and anonymous regulators. That resembles moves by some members of Congress who want to reclaim the right to make trade policy rather than leave it to the president. The result might be fewer and more transparent laws.But that's a subject for later columns, after the confirmation playacting ends and Kavanaugh takes his seat with his eight new colleagues.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Millions Dead, Constitution Destroyed, And Other Ridiculous Predictions About Supreme Court Nominee Brett KavanaughIt's Brett Kavanaugh: Will Left's Rank Politics Of Rage Keep Trump's Brilliant Pick Off Supreme Court?

23,ALL,"Liberals are reaching critical mass in the Democratic Party. While not strong enough to win all party contests, the left increasingly defines them. Their rise is clear over the past five presidential elections, and 2018 indicates they will be even stronger in the 2020s.The 2016 election was the latest manifestation of the left's ascendancy in the Democratic Party. Consistently winning 40%-plus of the popular vote, Sanders rode this wave wire-to-wire. Only establishment-dominated superdelegates prevented 2016's nomination from having to be decided on the convention floor.Liberals' share of presidential voters has increased almost one-third since 2000. Exit polling in 2000 showed liberals were 20% of voters; in 2016, they were 26%. While still America's smallest ideological group, they have had a disproportionate impact on the Democratic Party.Basic math shows that liberals alone can take Democrats over half way to a simple majority. By itself, this would be significant enough to require Democrats to take notice. However, deeper examination shows just how much notice Democrats must take.Although comparatively small versus moderates (39%) and conservatives (35%), liberals are intensely loyal to the Democratic Party. In 2016, 84% voted for Clinton; in comparison, only 81% of conservatives supported Trump.Liberals' 26% share of the electorate and 84% Democratic support gives them an electoral impact (share times support) of 21.8%. In comparison, two other Democrat-targeted constituencies — Blacks and Hispanics — combined had less electoral impact: 10.7% and 7.3%, respectively.The final evidence of liberals' growing strength in the Democratic Party comes from measuring their electoral impact as a share of Democrats' total vote. In 2016, Clinton received 48.2% of the popular vote. That means liberals' 21.8% electoral impact approached half (45.3%) of Democrats' total popular vote. In 2000, liberals' 16% electoral impact was one-third of Democrats' 48.4% of the popular vote.Such high percentages mean the left was close to single-handedly determining the outcome of 2016's Democratic nomination. Two years later, there are strong indications that liberals' influence has only grown. Theirs unquestionably has been the strongest intensity since Trump's upset — and arguably on par with his supporters' before that.This does not mean the left will win every Democratic primary — either at the presidential or local levels. Liberals will not always have a viable candidate to back in every race. But they can influence them — and are — besides simply determining final outcomes.Enthusiasm, spending, media attention, and rhetoric all can effectively pull a contest in the left's direction. These influences can affect both a more establishment primary opponent, or the primary electorate. Working through either, the left's candidate can effectively take a primary away from the Democratic establishment.Sanders' 2016 run was a case in point. His positions forced Clinton to respond, not the other way around. By the time Hillary had secured the nomination through establishment-dominated superdelegates, she had been forced more to the left, where Sanders had comfortably remained all along. That movement may have been enough to cost her and Democrats November's race.The logic that prevailed in 2016 continues to play out in this year's midterm primaries. Challengers from the left, not expecting to win, run for the longer-term goal of shaping the agenda. Thus, they have no need to move from more extreme positions — instead, locking them in even more.The establishment candidates run for the immediate and tangible goal of winning. To do so, they cannot afford to lose a significant — even if not determinant — block of votes from the left. So, like Clinton two years ago, they must accommodate, at least in part.As the left moves ever closer to a tipping point within the Democratic Party, it will be the Democratic Party that will tip. Not only are liberals even more able to define its races — either through electoral victories or policy wins — they are also increasingly defining the party itself.If 2018 is proving anything it is that the left's strength in the Democratic Party is continuing the same ascent shown in the past five presidential races. Yet its two-part aspect leaves Democrats with a profound question.The left's ascendancy in the Democratic Party has occurred not just because liberals have increased as a share of the electorate. Its rise has occurred because Democrats' share of the electorate has also declined — from 39% in 2000 to 36% in 2016.The question these two trends pose to Democrat leaders is whether liberals' rise is also causing Democrats' decline.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

25,ALL,"Snoop Dogg, Sir Patrick Stewart and a large British tobacco company: all vaguely in the same news story, thanks to an investment deal announced late Wednesday that an analyst called Big Tobacco's ""most significant"" attempt yet to gain exposure to the marijuana industry.Imperial Brands Ventures, a subsidiary of U.K. tobacco giant Imperial Brands (IMBBY), and Snoop Dogg's venture capital firm, Casa Verde Capital, said they are investing in Oxford Cannabinoid Technologies, a British medical marijuana research firm backed by Stewart of ""Star Trek"" and ""X-Men"" fame.The decision by Imperial, whose cigarette brands include Winston and Kool, comes roughly a year after the company appointed the chairman of a medical cannabis company to its board. It also comes amid flagging demand for cigarettes, and on the heels of the FDA's approval this week of Epidiolex, a cannabis-based drug from GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH).""We are pleased to be partnering with OCT,"" Matthew Phillips, Imperial Brands' chief development officer, said in a statement on Wednesday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Cannabinoid products have significant potential and our investment enables Imperial to support OCT's important research while building a deeper understanding of the medical cannabis market,"" he continued.Earlier this year, an Imperial spokesman told IBD that the tobacco company was ""tracking developments in what is a fast-growing (cannabis) segment.""Oxford said in Wednesday's statement that it had secured investments from Imperial Brands Ventures and Casa Verde and others as part of a Series A funding round. Oxford will use the funds to set up a strategic research partnership and a laboratory in Europe.The company, founded in 2017, intends to fund research surrounding cannabinoids in academic institutions internationally.""With indications ranging from pain and inflammation to cancer and neurological disorders, OCT has commissioned research in many critical areas,"" the statement said.Cowen analyst Vivien Azer, in a research note on Thursday, said Imperial's investment was ""the most significant move among the global tobacco players in the cannabis industry to date. We continue to expect to see more activity in cannabis from both global tobacco and global alcohol.""Last year, Imperial appointed Simon Langelier, the chairman of PharmaCielo, a Canadian medical cannabis company, to its board. The spokesman for Imperial told IBD this year that the company appointed Langelier largely due to his three-decade stint at Philip Morris International. However, the spokesman added that Langelier's cannabis background was not ""irrelevant,"" either.Some analysts believe that the quickly growing — and destigmatizing — marijuana industry presents more of an opportunity for tobacco firms than alcohol.""Vaping is one of the fastest-growing segments in both nicotine and cannabis,"" Azer said in 2016. ""Upon federal legalization, Big Tobacco could leverage its expertise to explore the legal cannabis market through vapor.""Still, tobacco stocks like Altria Group (MO) and British American Tobacco (BTI) crashed two months ago after Philip Morris International (PMI) turned in weak first-quarter sales and weaker-than-expected demand for so-called ""reduced-risk"" devices.Turning Point Brands (TPB), which owns rolling-paper-maker Zig-Zag, has expressed excitement about pot legalization in Canada and the cannabis industry broadly. Philip Morris International planned to invest around $20 million in an Israeli company that makes a cannabis inhaler, according to reports in 2016.Imperial Brands rose 2.8% in over-the-counter U.S. trading.

27,ALL,"Five of the 17 exchange traded funds in IBD's ETF Leaders screen are oil funds, and the good news for ETF traders is that all five are forming bases.This class of ETF tends to track the price of crude oil, and that commodity has been shaping a good chart as well. Crude futures rose to the highest level since November 2014, closing at $72.76 a barrel on Wednesday. That came after oil production was flat while inventories fell.Energy has become a leading sector, now No. 8 out of 33 sectors, after starting the year at No. 25. Exploration and production industry groups in particular have performed well, and that's the focus.With any commodity ETF, these funds' fortunes depend much on the course of crude prices. Commodity bull and bear markets historically run longer than the cycles in the stock market, but opportunities do emerge in the shorter term.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhile oil made new highs during the week, the five energy ETFs have not. That gives investors time to study each ETF before it reaches a proper entry point. For all five, the correct buy point is the same: The previous high made in May plus 10 cents.Here's a summary of the five ETFs:SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) owns more than 70 stocks in exploration & production (nearly 81% of the portfolio), refining & marketing companies (13%) and integrated operations (5%).The fund is equal weighted, meaning that all holdings have the same allocation each time the portfolio is rebalanced.Vanguard Energy (VDE) holds 143 stocks in the energy spectrum, from exploration to gas stations. But the $5.1 billion fund is heavily concentrated on the largest 10 holdings, which account for 63% of the fund's weighting.Some 38% of the portfolio is in integrated oil companies, a group that includes industry giants such as Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX).Fidelity MSCI Energy (FENY) is similar to the Vanguard fund in that it is heavily weighted on its largest holdings. The top 10 account for 63% of the total weighting. That leaves only a small influence in the rest of the 135 holdings in the ETF.Nearly 83% of the $649.5 million fund is invested in big-cap companies.The iShares U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (IEO) ETF has more of a focus on the search and extraction part of the oil business. With 67 holdings, the ETF has put 73% of funds in exploration and production companies. More than 23% of the portfolio is in refinery and marketing.The $514.7 million ETF is the only one among the five that does not own heavyweights Exxon Mobil and Chevron.First Trust Energy AlphaDEX (FXN), an ETF that was discussed in last week's column, holds a portfolio of nearly 50 stocks in oilfield services, refinery, production, drilling and related companies.The other four ETFs are predominantly big-cap funds. But a median market cap of $11.9 million gives the First Trust Energy portfolio a smaller average size. The $396 million fund uses a selection methodology that grades stocks on three-, six- and 12-month price performance, one-year sales growth, certain valuation factors, and other items.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:This Sector ETF Tries To Drill Into Oil ReboundActive Asset Allocation Made Easy With IBD ETF Leaders Index

29,ALL,"Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) led four top stocks pulling back to their 50-day moving averages on Friday. A strong rebound from that key technical level can offer a chance to add shares to your position. But with the Nasdaq composite and other leading stock market averages tumbling Monday on trade war fears, Apple stock and Nvidia stock plunged below that key support level. Nvidia also sold off below its buy point. Financial stocks E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and SVB Financial (SIVB), well extended from their last buy zones, also undercut their 50-day lines.XWhile Apple stock is clearly the most popular name in the group, it lags with a Composite Rating of 84 out of 99. E-Trade leads the group with a 99, and is closely followed by SVB with a 98 and Nvidia with a 97. Top stocks typically have strong Composite Ratings when they launch big moves.When looking for stocks to buy, in addition to strong technical action, it's important to look for top fundamentals. The Composite Rating combines factors such as earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and price performance.Apple stock is back below a three-weeks-tight buy point of 190.47 as it pulls back to the 10-week moving average. Shares are back in buy range from a double-bottom entry at 179.04, closing Friday at 184.92. Apple stock fell 1.5% to 182.17 in Monday's stock market trading, below its 50-day line.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA 10-week-line pullback represents an add-on buying opportunity when the moving average is above a buy point. However, you want to ensure that the stock is finding support at this level, rather than losing it. You also want to buy as close as you can to a rebound off the line is sound strategy.It's key to remember that a rebound off the 10-week line represents a chance to add shares to an existing position, rather than initiate a new one.A stock falling through its 50-day line, especially in high volume, is not good action. Investors should examine their portfolios and consider sell rules.As for investors on the sidelines, look to see if these stocks rebound by the end of the week. A brief foray below the 50-day line, by itself, is OK. But you should wait for a strong rebound.Nvidia stock was 5% from a double-bottom entry at 239.35 on Friday even as it pulled back toward its 10-week line. But keep in mind that Nvidia's base is later stage whereas Apple's double-bottom is an early-stage base. Later-stage bases can work, but they have a higher chance of failing since they form after a stock has already been on a big run.Nvidia tumbled 4.7% to 239.12 on Monday, knifing below its 50-day line and the 239.35 entry in above-average volume. The stock has now roundtripped a 12% gain from the buy point, a strong sell signal.E-Trade stock is finding support at the 10-week line after trading in a relatively tight range over the past several weeks. Shares closed Friday 16% extended from a late-stage consolidation first cleared on March 9.This represents the stock's first pullback to the 10-day line above the buy point. Investors can add shares to their positions at the first two pullbacks, but after that — without the formation of a new base — the stock would be considered too extended.E-Trade stock fell 3.4% Monday, below its 50-day line.Lastly, SVB Financial stock is pulling back to its 10-week line too. After a breakout from a cup-with-handle in late April, shares ended last week 14% above the 271.89 buy point.

30,ALL,"All of a sudden, everyone on the left wants ""free markets in energy policy."" As someone who's advocated for that for, oh, about three decades, this riff should be music to my ears. But is laissez faire energy policy really what liberals are seeking?First, some context. A few weeks ago, liberal activists leaked a draft of a Trump administration directive that would order utilities to purchase coal and nuclear power as part of their energy mix in supplying electricity to homes and businesses.There are good arguments for and against this policy — I'm fairly neutral — but what was fascinating was the indignant response from those on the left who hate fossil fuels. ""Crony capitalism!"" they shrieked in unison. Catherine Rampell, an economic columnist at The Washington Post, moaned that President Donald Trump ""is wielding the power of the state to keep uncompetitive companies in business, and costing taxpayers and consumers lots of money in the process."" ""If that doesn't count as 'picking winners and losers,' it's hard to say what would,"" Rampell wrote.The Los Angeles Times slammed the Trump plan as ""a preposterous idea"": ""Continuing to operate financially nonviable power plants and forcing grid operators to buy power they don't need or want is an unacceptable governmental intrusion into the power market that, by one analysis, would needlessly cost consumers hundreds of millions of dollars.""This could cost hundreds of millions of dollars? That's bad, for sure, but have you ever heard the Los Angeles Times rail against subsidies for wind and solar power? I haven't. The Obama administration's policy was to try to bankrupt coal, oil and other fossil fuels through regulation, while enriching their renewable energy pals in Silicon Valley with lavish subsidies.Remember Solyndra? That was the company that was going to revolutionize solar power, and it went bankrupt after the Obama administration gave the firm hundreds of millions of dollars. All told, $150 billion was pipelined into the green empire under George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and most of the money funded such fiascoes. But now Trump is the one who is accused of ""picking winners and losers""?Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAn even bigger farce is the idea that Adam Smith's invisible hand of free market forces is what is driving certain nuclear power and coal plants into bankruptcy. (Coal still provides five times more electric power than wind and solar combined.) Rampell of The Washington Post explains: ""The reason these (coal and nuclear) plants are struggling, after all, is that they can't compete with cheaper natural gas and renewables."" That's half-true. Yes, $3 natural gas prices have revolutionized the electric power markets and driven down costs.But the idea that renewables are ""cheap"" is a lie, and those on the left know it. Let's be clear about an economic reality that environmentalists have spent four decades trying to hide: Without massive government subsidies, there would be no wind or solar energy to speak of. They are complete creatures of government favoritism; and after 30 years, we still can't cut the umbilical cord.Consider how gargantuan the green energy subsidies are. First, wind and solar receive a tax credit that is basically a 35%-off coupon for the energy they supply, with taxpayers picking up the tab. If coal or nuclear power got a 35% taxpayer subsidy for every kilowatt of electricity they supplied, they would be basking in profits. I helped write and negotiate the just-passed Trump tax bill. When we tried to get rid of the renewable energy tax credit (i.e., create a ""free market in energy""), the green lobby went ballistic and told Republicans this would put much of the industry out of business.For every dollar of subsidy that coal and nuclear power receive, wind power gets almost $5 and solar receives about $20. This does not even include the biggest subsidy of all: About half the states have renewable energy standards requiring utilities to buy 20% to 30% of their power from wind and solar, regardless of the price. What other industry in America has that kind of golden parachute?In terms of assessing the merits of energy alternatives, we ought to have an insurance policy against brownouts and blackouts. Other nations and California have suffered from these because of overdependence on intermittent power sources such as wind and solar. We may regret shutting down reliable nuclear or coal plants, which can't be easily powered up again, during storms, cold winters or hot summer days when we need electricity the most.In the meantime, enough hypocrisy from liberals who lecture us about bailouts and subsidies as if they were Milton Friedman disciples. There is nothing more horrifying to proponents of renewable energy than a genuine free market in energy.Democrats Blast Trump For High Gas Prices … After They Spent Years Trying To Force Them UpDon't Tell Anyone, But We Just Had Two Years Of Record-Breaking Global CoolingCarbon Tax: A Bad Idea Whose Time Should Never Come

But with the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and now the Nasdaq composite retreating, these IPOs have given up all of their gains. Dropbox stock fell back into the 5% buy zone on Thursday, along with Zscaler and Carbon Black.

Zscaler and Carbon Black also undercut entry areas intraday. IQiyi and Huya continued to swing wildly, but still have most of their gains.Should you hold or cash out of these volatile stocks? That depends on your investing horizon and your conviction in these names. But you should have a plan.

Perhaps you let the stock pull back further. If it's a more speculative, short-term trade, you might be quicker to take partial or total profits.That's a question not only for the software IPO trio, but the Chinese livestreaming IPO duo of iQiyi and Huya.IQiyi, a Baidu (BIDU) spinoff, tumbled 12% on Thursday. Huya, a YY (YY) spinoff, plunged nearly 14%. Both are sharply higher over the past several weeks. IQiyi stock and Huya stock had vaulted far above their fast-rising 10-day moving averages, so they were due for a pullback. On Thursday, Huya fell below its 10-day line for the first time ever, while iQiyi ended just above that line.Livestreaming is booming in China, and Huya has turned profitable. However, even if the future is bright for the livestreaming business, that's no guarantee that these two IPO stocks will be among the big long-term winners.If you are confident in these stocks, you might hold tight. Otherwise, you could trim or cash out your position.Huya stock fell 8% Friday morning, closing down 6.5%. Meanwhile, iQiyi stock sank 5.7% after plunging 9% earlier.Whatever your investing strategy, have a plan. How far are you willing to let a stock fall before you act?

Disney gained 1.9% to 106.30.While Wall Street fears a bidding war, one scenario is that the companies carve up Fox, with Comcast getting Sky as well as video streaming service Hulu and perhaps other assets.Disney's deal includes Fox's stake in U.K.-based Sky, a film studio, cable networks and other assets. It excludes the Fox Broadcasting Network. Disney already owns broadcaster ABC.One obstacle to a truce is the history between the companies. A much smaller Comcast tried to buy Disney in 2004 but was rebuffed.Meanwhile, AT&T fell 6% to 32.22, despite its court victory. One analyst said AT&T's fall may be tied to arbitrage over the Time Warner transaction. MoffettNathanson also downgraded AT&T to sell.The Department of Justice sued in November 2017 to block AT&T's $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner on grounds that the merger could hurt competition in the pay-TV industry.Shares in CBS (CBS), Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF), Discovery Communications (DISCA) and other media firms rose in the wake of AT&T's (T) court victory.The landmark antitrust victory over the U.S. Department of Justice is expected to open the door to more acquisitions of media assets by telecoms or even internet companies, such as Amazon.com (AMZN).Viacom (VIA) gained 0.7% to 33.55 while CBS was up 3.6% to 54.27.

The annualized dividend of $3.64 a share gives it a lofty yield of 7.3%.Targa is in the middle of a sales turnaround that's been going on for several quarters in a row. After a period of declining sales in 2015-2016, mostly due to softness in the price of natural gas, sales growth has ramped up in recent quarters. In the past six quarters, year-over-year sales growth has ranged from 16% to 46%.In early May, Targa reported adjusted profit of 10 cents a share, handily beating the consensus estimate. Sales increased 16% to nearly $2.56 billion. Other highlights in the quarter included the sale of Targa's inland marine barge business to Kirby (KEX) for just over $69 million. Targa said the sale proceeds would be used to fund future growth initiatives.In March, Targa announced long-term, fee-based agreements with an investment grade energy company for natural gas gathering and processing services in the Delaware Basin. It also announced an extension of its Grand Prix natural gas liquids pipeline into southern Oklahoma.Targa is a current holding of the highly-regarded value fund BNY Mellon Mid Cap Multi-Strategy Fund (MPMCX).Since hitting a low of 41.75 in early April, shares are up about 18%.

46,ALL,"The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite all started last week higher but closed the week modestly lower. This sideways stock market action offered a chance for many leading stocks to work on handles in their consolidations. Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR) and Akamai Technologies (AKAM) finished handles last week, offering new buy points. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Alibaba (BABA) finished handles on Monday.All five stocks rallied at least 1% on Monday, with Twitter attempting a breakout. The stocks were mixed Tuesday morning.Handles offer a last shakeout of weak holders. When a stock clears a proper handle in strong volume, it's evidence that the stock is ready to advance.Proper handles involve at least five days of moderate declines, though some develop over several weeks. You want to see a gradual drift, ideally in light trade. Heavy trade would imply selling from big institutions. The midpoint of the handle should be above the midpoint of the base. If a handle forms in the lower half of a pattern, there may still be selling pressure as old investors seek to exit with a profit or minimal losses.While handles are most closely associated with cup bases, they also form on double-bottom patterns. Twitter and Akamai stocks are cup-with-handle bases, while the Facebook stock handle is on a double bottom. Alphabet and Alibaba stocks are trying to finish handles in double bottoms.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFacebook stock formed an oddly shaped, double-bottom base, with the second leg of the W falling sharply lower amid the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal. The stock cleared a 186.20 buy point on May 11, but volume was well below average. Indeed, shares had been rallying for a few weeks on weak trade.But after that tepid breakout, Facebook stock has pulled back modestly in even-lighter volume. As of Friday's close, Facebook stock has a handle with a new 188.42 buy point. Shares closed Friday at 182.68, then rose 1% to 184.49 on Monday.Facebook fell 0.4% to 183.80 in stock market trading today.Keep in mind that the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been lagging since the start of November and hasn't made headway for the past 10 months.Twitter has formed a cup-with-handle base with a 33.88 entry. Much of the base formed below its 50-day moving average, though the handle is moderately above that level. Twitter stock price ended Friday at 32.63.Twitter climbed 3.1% to 33.63 Monday after rising as high as 34.03. The breakout attempt came on below average. Twitter fell 2.3% to 32.86 on Tuesday.Akamai Technologies formed a cup base since March 9, forging a handle last week. That gives the stock a 77.69 buy point. The stock climbed 1.5% to 76.46 Monday. Shares popped to 78.25 intraday Tuesday, briefly clearing the entry point, but reversed to close off 0.1% to 76.39.The Google parent rose 1.3% to 1,084.01 on Monday. As of Monday's close, Alphabet stock has a proper handle with a 1,118.25 entry point.However, the midpoint of the handle is just above the midpoint of the base. While that's proper, it also means a fair amount of overhead resistance could remain.Also, the stock's RS line has gone sideways for year, as Alphabet has moved in line with the S&P 500 index.Alphabet fell 0.8% to 1,075.31 on Tuesday.Alibaba has formed a shallow double-bottom base. On Monday, shares rose 1.35% to 197.64. The stock now has handle on a daily chart, creating a 200.10 entry.  Alibaba lost 0.9% to 195.87.But on a weekly chart, this potential handle isn't visible, because Alibaba rose fractionally last week and is up slightly so far this week. The handle buy point also isn't much lower than the 201.60 entry from just above the middle of the double-bottom's ""W.""At minimum, Alibaba's stock appears to be facing resistance at 200. The stock hasn't been above 200 since the mid-March peak of the middle part of the W.

It not only didn't make the financial system safer, it all but killed small business growth.A new study released by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), the quasi-private think tank that serves as the referee for deciding U.S. upturns and downturns, shows the damage done by Dodd-Frank to small businesses was severe.The study, ""The Impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on Small Business,"" by economists Michael D. Bordo and John V. Duca, goes a long way toward explaining why GDP growth under Obama was a mere 2%, a full third slower than the long-term average.It's based on a long-term and well-known dynamic. Small businesses grow faster than large ones, and account for over two-thirds of all U.S. jobs growth. Dodd-Frank's damage was substantial and persistent.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which was passed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and was designed to safeguard the banking system, appears to have made it more difficult for small businesses and entrepreneurs to obtain funding,"" the NBER report notes.It wasn't a small amount, either: ""After controlling for economic conditions and other influences on lending ... the share of commercial and industrial loans of less than $1 million at large banks — those with at least $300 million in assets — has fallen by 9 percentage points since 2010.""Smaller banks, which mainly do only small-business loans, saw their loan volumes decline by twice as much. This is why there has been a silent depression in the once-vibrant small-bank industry.Meanwhile, loans of over $1 million by bigger banks have soared by 80%. Obama and the Democrats were the least small-business friendly administration and Congress since the Great Depression.Why did this happen? Dodd-Frank made making loans to large companies far more attractive. They did so by new compliance rules that treated small and startup loans as inherently more risky than big-business loans.In economic terms, Dodd-Frank increased the fixed cost of making a loan to smaller companies. So banks simply stopped lending to them. Overnight, businesses that once had lines of credit lost them. Many closed. Startups could get nothing.This may sound like a wonky debate, but it isn't. Dodd-Frank's destructive lending restrictions destroyed millions of jobs and kept entrepreneurs from creating thousands and thousands of new, wonderful businesses.And it also explains why, with a few deft strokes of his presidential pen, cutting both regulations and taxes sharply, President Trump has been able to offset Dodd-Frank's growth-killing rules and restored 3% growth to the economy.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Dodd-Frank's CFPB Is Unaccountable And UndemocraticPartial Dodd-Frank Reform Is Good, Total Repeal Is BetterDodd-Frank Reform Is Urgent For U.S. Small Businesses And Consumers

56,ALL,"President Donald Trump reversed course again on Thursday and now plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico. This Trump trade war threat, which tanked the stock market in late February and early March, pressured the Dow Jones Thursday.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1% on the stock market today, finding support so far at its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 slipped 0.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite dipped 0.3%. Stocks accelerated losses as Canada joined the European Union and Mexico in retaliating.Steel and aluminum stocks surged initially, but pared gains. U.S. Steel (X) rose 1.7%. Steel Dynamics (STLD) reversed to trade down 0.9%. Aluminum giant Alcoa (AA) reversed to fall 1%. Century Aluminum (CENX) climbed 3.3%.Dow Jones components Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT), heavy steel users vulnerable in a trade war, fell 1.7% and 2.3%.Harley Davidson (HOG), whose motorcycles could be hit by EU retaliatory tariffs, lost 2.1%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe EU said it would impose 25% tariffs on $3.3 billion worth of U.S. imports starting June 20. Mexico also announced plans to strike back by imposing tariffs on pork bellies, apples, grapes, cheeses and flat steel. Canada announced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. steel, aluminum and a variety of other products.The Trump administration faced a decision with previously granted exemptions from the tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports expiring June 1. Even though the exemptions have covered more than half of steel imports, steel prices have moved higher this year. U.S. prices for steel are already about 50% higher than those in Europe and China, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in a statement opposing any expansion of tariffs or quotas.""Such a move would hit American manufacturers with higher costs, slow the growth of the U.S. construction sector, and put the brakes on job creation in both of these key industries,"" the Chamber said.Hitting Canada and Mexico with the tariffs could be a huge blow to Nafta talks. There's little logic in imposing tariffs on metal imports from the Nafta partners. Canada is the biggest steel exporter to the U.S., shipping 5.8 million metric tons in 2017, or about 16% of total steel imports. Yet Canada is also, far and away, the largest export market for U.S. steel makers, so its retaliatory tariffs will hurt. Through the first three quarters of 2017, the U.S. ran a relatively minor trade deficit with Canada of about a half-million metric tons, according to Department of Commerce data.Trump's move to broaden tariffs on metal imports follows news earlier this week that the Trump administration is preparing to hit China with tariffs on $50 billion worth of mainly high-tech imports as initially planned. That came as a surprise after China-U.S. trade talks appeared close to a deal for China to significantly increase purchases of U.S. energy and agricultural goods.Last week, Trump ordered the Commerce Department to conduct a national security investigation into foreign auto imports. He's said to be considering 25% tariffs on $176 billion yearly imports. News reports say that Trump is determined to keep German luxury cars out of the U.S.For the past couple of months, it has looked like a trade war might be avoided, Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments, wrote in a note distributed early Thursday morning. But he said he was ready to throw in the towel on that assessment. ""Barring a last-minute breakthrough, a trade war with some of America's closest allies will begin tomorrow.""""The incoherent Washington stance on trade is a daily roller-coaster ride, fueled by bitter infighting between President Trump's fierce trade protectionists and his more moderate advisors,"" Valliere wrote.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:This Hot Biotech Dives On FDA Hold; FANG Stock Enters 'Friend Zone'Four Stocks Pop Up On The IBD 50 List, Including Five BelowDow Jones Stocks Apple, Microsoft, Intel, Nike, Visa Are In Buy RangeForget Trump: Why We're Headed For A Long, Cold U.S. And China Trade WarStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

57,ALL,"IBD Leaderboard play Netflix and other FAANG stocks helped the Nasdaq limit losses in stocks today after the Federal Reserve boosted short-term interest rates for the second time this year.The U.S. central bank has now raised the cost of borrowing money by a quarter point for the seventh time since it began doing so in December 2015.The Nasdaq composite gained around 0.3% and hit new all-time highs Wednesday before cooling off on the Fed's 2 p.m. ET announcement.In its statement, the FOMC committee expressed confidence that the U.S. economy is growing stronger, as ""activity has been rising at a solid rate."" In the Fed's May 2 news release, the central bank noted that the U.S. economy was rising at ""a moderate rate.""At the session high of 7748, the index has now marched 12.2% higher since Jan. 1. On IBD Leaderboard, the year-to-date gains have been steeper.Lululemon (LULU), which initially joined the Leaders list on Leaderboard on Feb. 7, has jumped 61% since Jan. 1. Shares in the premium-priced yogawear and sports apparel firm have also ramped up more than 50% since it roared off the 10-week moving average in late March, triggering a buy signal. On Wednesday, the stock backtracked into slightly negative territory after rising 1.9% to as high as 127.34.Fast-growing Etsy (ETSY) and Five Below (FIVE), two more consumer spending-oriented names on Leaderboard, have also scored market-smashing gains.The S&P 500 fell 0.2% as declines in wood products, homebuilding, mortgage service, paper, auto parts, department store and oil and gas machinery stocks offset strength in wholesale drug supply, movie, gaming software, drugstore chain and computer networking firms.The Dow Jones industrial average eased less than 0.2%. The Dow Jones utility average fell fractionally, but at 665 the sector index has dropped more than 8% so far this year. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond rose 3 basis points to 2.99%, still below its May 17 peak of 3.11%.Volume is running sharply higher on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE vs. the same time Tuesday.Going back to Netflix, shares bolted more than 4% higher and got as high as 384.25. Volume is running at a 127% faster than usual pace after Goldman Sachs reportedly boosted its long-term price target to $490 from $390. Analyst Heath Terry forecast that in 2019 the video streaming firm would garner 32.5 million net new subscribers. That well exceeds Wall Street's consensus estimate of 26 million net new adds.The very best companies in terms of fundamentals and stock price strength are able to launch breakouts from third, fourth, and even fifth stage bases. But later-stage bases always carry a higher risk of failure and a significant price correction.Netflix hauled out of a first-stage base at 107.07 in October 2016, then broke out again in the week ended July 21, 2017. Shares cleared a 166.97 buy point in a six-week cuplike base, then ramped up more than 20% before forming a third-stage base.More recently, Netflix surpassed a 338.92 follow-on entry point after testing support at the 10-week moving average in both March and April.In the year 2009, Netflix scored $1.67 billion in annual revenue. Last year, the top line grew 32% vs. the prior year to $11.69 billion. So over the past eight years, Netflix's revenue has not only risen 600%, but it's also achieved a compounded annual growth rate of 27%.Earnings have climbed from 28 cents a share to $1.25 over the same time frame.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see the Los Gatos, Calif., company growing earnings 129% this year to $2.86 a share on a 38% jump in revenue to $16.1 billion.The Street also sees Netflix's top line shattering the $20 billion barrier in 2019.Other FAANG stocks continue to act well.Alphabet (GOOGL) edged up 0.2% for a third up day in a row. The Google search engine owner has formed a seven-day handle on its new double bottom.In Alphabet's double bottom base, the second sell-off took shares down to 984, undercutting the early February sell-off low of 997.An undercut of the first low is good action within this type of base, and the middle peak in between the two sell-offs plus 10 cents offers a standard buy point.So in Alphabet's case, the buy point of 1,178.26 offers a proper entry for growth investors. But the new downward slanting handle, formed in light volume, offers a lower buy point at 1,161.20.Microsoft (MSFT), part of the so-called ""FAAMG"" megacap tech clan, continues to inch higher and is near new highs. At 101.33, the cloud computing, business software and computer and video game console giant remains within the 5% buy zone after a breakout past 97.34 in a six-week flat base.In the March-ended fiscal third quarter, Microsoft posted a 16% boost in earnings to 95 cents a share. That's on top of a 30% increase in the year-ago quarter. Fiscal Q3 revenue accelerated 16% to $26.82 billion. That marked the biggest year-over-year top-line increase in 14 quarters.In other stocks today, TAL Education (TAL), ranking No. 9 in the IBD 50, fell sharply on reports that short selling firm Muddy Waters said it's sold shares short. The Carson Block-led firm reportedly accused the for-profit school operator of overstating its earnings from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2018, ended in February that year.The stock slumped as much 16% to a session low of 38.41 before recouping some of those losses. The stock undercut the 50-day moving average but quickly gained institutional buying support.On May 10, TAL broke out of a six-week cup without handle, but heavy volume was absent. Ideally, a breakout should involve a minimum 40% to 50% increase in volume vs. the 50-day average.All daily charts in Investors.com and MarketSmith show the 50-day average turnover as a red line drawn across the volume bars at the bottom of each chart.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on growth stocks, charts, buy points, proper sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:How Are The Top Growth Stocks Faring?

Wall Street sees more manufacturers entering the OLED display market soon.South Korea's ETNews reported Monday that Apple has decided to use OLED displays for all of its new iPhones in 2019. Apple used only liquid crystal displays for its handsets until late last year when it debuted the iPhone X, its first OLED-display smartphone.While the change is good news for OLED specialist Universal Display, it could spell trouble for LCD screen makers like Japan Display. That company has been the principal supplier of LCD screens for iPhones, ETNews said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLG Display (LPL) is expected to benefit from Apple's move as it ramps up its OLED manufacturing capability. LG Display stock was up 4%, near 10.70, in morning trading.Analysts expect Apple to introduce three new iPhones this fall, including two OLED models and one LCD model. Next year, Apple also is planning to release three new iPhones, but they would all have OLED screens, ETNews said.Universal Display shares hit a record high of 209 on Jan. 19 before concerns spread about slowing sales of OLED-screen smartphones, including the iPhone X. Analysts blame weakening sales on consumers taking longer to upgrade to new handsets, as well as the high price for the iPhone X, which starts at $999.OLED displays are seen as superior to LCD screens in terms of color saturation, refresh rate and lower power consumption.RELATED:Apple Stock, FANGs Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google Are In Or Near Buy ZonesApple Swats Mobile Gaming App Amid Debate Over Services Growth

98,ALL,"When Notre Dame law professor and possible Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett was nominated for the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, her affiliation with a religious group called People of Praise raised red flags. It was some sort of cult, they implied. Sen. Dianne Feinstein famously reproved the nominee by intoning that ""the dogma lives loudly within you, and that's of concern.""It was an echo of the kind of anti-Catholic bigotry that characterized American life for centuries. When the Democrats nominated the first Roman Catholic for president, Al Smith in 1928, opponents warned that all Protestant marriages would be annulled and all Protestant children declared bastards if the Catholic were elected. Republicans circulated pictures of Smith posing before the almost-completed Holland Tunnel with a caption declaring that instead of emptying into New Jersey, it really led 3,500 miles under the Atlantic Ocean to the basement of the Vatican. After his loss to Herbert Hoover, Smith was reputed to have quipped that he had sent a one-word telegram to the Pope: ""Unpack.""But Feinstein's comment and others' insinuations that Barrett's religion is somehow creepy or suspicious reveals a broader anti-religious bias.Barrett and her family are reportedly members of a religious group called People of Praise. The New York Times implied that the group — most, but not all of whose members are Catholic — departed from mainstream Catholic ideas and doctrines. My Ethics and Public Policy Center colleague Ed Whelan disposed of those suggestions.Curious, I looked at their website. I suppose it's possible that the benign image they attempt to convey to the world is mere window dressing. But then again, Pope Francis appointed one of their members as an auxiliary bishop in Portland, Oregon. It seems doubtful, bordering on impossible, that he would have conferred that honor on a cult member.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFounded in 1971 as part of the lay Catholic ministries movement, People of Praise provides spiritual community, support for those in need, prayer and counseling, and guidance for successful marriages, among other things. More than 1,000 couples have completed their Marriage in Christ program that instills habits of prayer and — this is shocking — conversation to improve relationships.The first thing you see on the People of Praise website is a Louisiana picnic attended by a notably interracial group. One might have thought that such membership groups are far too rare — especially in the current climate. As Dorothy Anderson, an older African-American woman put it: ""In almost all of his speeches, Martin Luther King spoke about blacks and whites living together in unity. I didn't think I'd live long enough to see it, but I saw it last Thursday night at the barbecue.""People of Praise is ecumenical, with Lutheran, Methodist, Anglican and other Christian members in addition to the Catholics. It contains both Democrats and Republicans, rich and poor. Like churches, they send missions to needy communities in the United States. More than 100 members have helped to build and renovate homes, run summer camps for thousands of kids and found schools.As for Barrett herself, it seems that she lives her faith. She and her husband have seven children, including one with special needs and two adopted from Haiti. Her former colleagues on the Notre Dame law school faculty, many of whom have disagreements with Barrett, unanimously endorsed her nomination to the Circuit Court, describing her as ""brilliant"" and also ""generous"" and ""warm."" They wrote: ""She possesses in abundance all of the other qualities that shape extraordinary jurists: discipline, intellect, wisdom, impeccable temperament, and above all, fundamental decency and humanity.""If Barrett is a glazed-eyed cultist, she's done an incredible job of hiding it. She fooled her fellow clerks on the Supreme Court when she worked for Justice Antonin Scalia. Dozens of clerks, including some who worked for Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, endorsed her previous nomination, calling her a ""woman of remarkable intellect and character.""She fooled her students, hundreds of whom signed an endorsement reading, in part, ""Our religious, cultural, and political views span a wide spectrum. Despite the many and genuine differences among us, we are united in our conviction that Professor Barrett would make an exceptional federal judge."" And she fooled all of the Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee along with three Democrats, who voted to approve her nomination.The words ""people of praise"" raise hackles among secularists. Considering their charitable work and transracial, trans-class appeal, they deserve at least the benefit of the doubt. And that Barrett is reportedly a member is the best testimonial of all.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

102,ALL,"Sky-high costs under the current health care system have squeezed small businesses and people who work for themselves. Unlike large employers, which are allowed under federal law to design their own plans, small entities must adhere to stricter coverage mandates and have less ability to customize plans.An estimated 15 million Americans — and their families — who are self-employed or work for a small business lack health care coverage. It's not because they don't want insurance. Rather, they don't have a coverage option that fits both their needs and their ability to pay.All that is about to change.The Labor Department recently rolled out a new rule on association health plans (AHPs) that will allow small businesses and the self-employed to act within the same, flexible health care rules as a large business.AHPs allow small businesses and the self-employed to band together and obtain a health plan as a group. AHPs had previously been allowed based on shared industry.But now AHPs can form based on geographic features, like a common state, city, county or metropolitan area, and across state lines as well. Self-employed individuals without employees, including sole proprietors, can now join an AHP.""Today is a great day for America's franchise job creators and their employees in the fight for high quality, less expensive health coverage,"" said International Franchise Association President and CEO Robert Cresanti when the new rule was finalized June 19.He added that it paves the way ""for franchise businesses to utilize AHPs and make the delivery of products and services more affordable for small business owners, employees and their customers."" He's right.For some, however, the new flexibility is cause for concern, particularly as it relates to potential inequities in care.In practice, flexibility expands choices. Forcing people to pay for benefits they don't want, on the other hand, drives up costs. It can even prevent people from buying insurance at all.Moreover, many of those who join forces to form AHPs will offer generous plans, so they can compete for talent with larger companies offering health benefits.The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 4 million Americans, including 400,000 who would otherwise be uninsured, will join an AHP by 2023. Expanding choice this way encourages people to sign up for coverage.With this rule, new businesses will now have the chance to join an AHP. Chambers of commerce can get a plan for their members, and leagues of Uber drivers can form associations and get insurance.There will be more coverage options, enhanced ability to self-insure, less regulatory burden and complexity, and reduced administrative costs. And, as we all know, when there are more consumers and more competition, prices will drop.An AHP group can also now negotiate prices with payers and providers. While they can't charge an individual a higher premium based on pre-existing health conditions, they can base premiums on factors such as age, industry and employee classification.Giving small businesses and self-employed individuals a more even playing field with large businesses also means AHP members will have to play by the same rules. Consumer and anti-discrimination protections will apply.While this rule may not represent sweeping reform, it is a step in the right direction.The Trump administration should continue its progress by adding a final rule to allow for renewal of short-term, limited-duration plans. That's prohibited under current rules.That will bring America closer to the ultimate goal of delivering better health care coverage at lower prices for all.

106,ALL,"When people have had military careers as long as ours, they develop a keen understanding not just of war but also of the conditions leading up to it. Over the years, we have had front-row seats to hostilities in various regions of the world, and our attention often focused on the initial outbreak of those hostilities.Now, viewing current conditions through that lens, we are worried about the possibility of a larger war enveloping the Middle East – one in which the United States and its allies would be necessarily involved.As those conditions persist, the international community must do one of two things: Either ready itself for war or address the situation that is making it an ever more likely possibility. There is no question that the American public and nearly all U.S. policymakers would prefer the latter option. The trouble is that only a minority of them recognize the warning signs, and even fewer have a clear sense of which actions might slow the region's march toward war.To their credit, some key figures in the Trump administration have expressed an understanding of one of the most serious contributors to the existing threat. Defense Secretary James Mattis, for instance, has repeatedly affirmed that among all the crises engulfing the Middle East, the common element in almost all of them is the Islamic Republic of Iran.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe clerical regime has already had the effect of prolonging and worsening specific conflicts like the wars in Syria and Yemen, and is promoting sectarianism all over the region.For that reason, the most important thing the international community can do to prevent such a conflict from breaking out is contain Iran's regional activities while addressing their root causes. Unfortunately, policies leading toward that goal will surely face pushback from defenders of the status quo, who generally worry that all efforts to confront or contain regional adversaries constitute a rush to war.But anyone who is familiar with military history should recognize that the most troublesome wars tend to emerge out of long periods of inaction, during which responsible parties ignored festering hostilities and simply hoped for tensions to deescalate on their own.That is a course of action we cannot afford, since any forthcoming war would almost certainly engulf the entire region and undermine our interests for years or decades to come. And this is to say nothing of the impact it would have on the peoples of the Middle East, including those who are directly subject to the rule of the war's key instigator, the Iranian regime.It may be helpful to point out that the Iranian people recognize the danger they are facing and stand ready to assist the effort to diminish their government's ambitions and limit the role of Iranian sectarianism in neighboring countries like Syria.With this in mind, the governments of the U.S. and Europe should recognize the potential impact of forcing Tehran to confront domestic conditions instead of striving to exploit regional vulnerabilities. This isn't a particularly difficult task, considering that the Islamic Republic is already being rocked by widespread unrest as the people protest several serious issues as well as the very nature of the regime.In December and January, a nationwide uprising engulfed 140 Iranian localities and took the regime by surprise. That surprise was evident from the fact that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei was left with no choice but to break with his traditional strategy of downplaying and denying the political strength of the pro-democratic opposition. He publicly attributed the protests' rapid spread and provocative slogans to the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MEK/PMOI).In the ensuing months, Iranian activists and workers continued staging large demonstrations in clear defiance of the violent repression that put the January uprising on pause.Defenders of the status quo may be uncomfortable with the notion of persistent unrest in Iran. But for global stability and for the Iranian people themselves, this is a far preferable alternative to the Islamic Republic keeping its attention focused beyond its border, where it can continue sowing the seeds of region-wide conflict while threatening to set off a war that the U.S. cannot ignore.On June 30, Iranian expatriates and thousands of political supporters held a major rally in Paris to support the Iranian demonstrators. The annual event typically attracts a crowd of 100,000 to call attention to domestic pressures against Iran's clerical regime and to outline Western policies that might help to enhance that pressure and contribute to the establishment of democratic governance in Iran.This year, more than 33 current and former U.S. officials attended.This gathering is a first step toward promoting Iran's domestic resistance movement and signaling commitment to helping it to avert a larger war in the region. This would make permanent the otherwise temporary effects of just containing Iran's regional activities.This is to say, the root cause of those activities and of the looming Middle East war is the very nature of the mullahs' regime, and in order to eliminate the present risks once and for all,that regime must give way to its overwhelmingly pro-democratic and peace-loving population.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

Shares cleared a 473.89 buy point from a flat base, which was really part of a base-on-base-on-base formation. Since the breakout, Intuitive Surgical stock has stayed in the buy range, aside from closing just below the entry on June 25. Shares of the robotic surgical systems maker climbed 3.55% last week to 495.46, near the top of the buy range.Intuitive Surgical stock rose 0.8% to 499.33, just above the top of the chase zone.Stitch Fix stock soared 12% on Friday in triple normal volume 32.41, blasting past a high-handle buy point of 30.92.

108,ALL,"'Inclusive' Boom: It may be a surprise, but President Trump is nowhere near as unpopular among minority voters as the biased mainstream media suggest. Why is that? In a word, jobs.Trump, it turns out, has been the most consequential president in history when it comes to minority employment. In June, for instance, the unemployment rate for Hispanics and Latinos 16 years and older fell to 4.6%, its lowest level ever, from 4.9% in May. The previous all-time low was 4.8%.African-American unemployment bounced up from its all-time low of 5.9% in May to 6.5% in June. But that 6.5% still represents the second-lowest unemployment reading ever for Black Americans.As for Asian-Americans, unemployment similarly bounced off its all-time low of 2.1% in May, rising to 3.2%. And that's still 0.6 percentage point lower than when Trump entered office.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseConsider all the good news about minority employment when you hear reports of June's ""disappointing"" jobs data.The truth is, the ripping jobs growth that began when Trump entered office and picked up steam after his tax cuts has been good for everyone in America — even liberal media pundits.And it's also been good for Trump. Because quietly, he is winning over those who have benefited most from his policies: Minorities. On average, minority unemployment has dropped 18% since Trump entered office in January of 2017. More than 2 million people have dropped off food stamps and returned to work.Despite a relentless media barrage aimed at Trump and his immigration policies, a new Harvard/Harris Poll found a 10% rise in approval for Trump among Hispanics.And our own IBD/TIPP Poll data show that, on average, minority Americans' confidence in their own finances has risen from 57.1 to 63.5 since Trump took office. That's important, since people's happiness with their own finances is a good indicator of future voting tendencies. As the Zogby Poll recently noted: ""Even though President Trump receives little support from these (minority) groups, things might be going just good enough economically that ... Republicans can retain control of Congress and Trump gets re-elected in 2020.""By the way, we first discussed this phenomenon way back in December of 2017 and again in January of this year. At the time, we noted that a quick Google of the terms ""trump racism"" returned more than 25 million hits in under a second.We wondered, if Trump were truly racist, ""why would (he) put in place policies that, factually speaking, benefit minorities? It's funny, too, that those that sell this toxic brew of false racism don't mention the truth: That, like the rest of us, minorities thrive as the economy's growth picks up.""We have no reason to change our minds.

116,ALL,"Leadership isn't about being the person who has all the answers. Quite the opposite. There's nothing wrong with asking for input, seeking help and admitting you don't know it all. It pays to show you're vulnerable.""A leader who acts like he has all the answers isn't approachable,"" said Steve Arneson, who runs his own Boulder, Colo.-based executive coaching and leadership consulting firm. ""But if you're open-minded and not afraid to ask for help, then people know they have the opportunity to weigh in.""Here's how to build that environment.Get participation. Make sure your people are involved in key decisions. Seek help, input and feedback. Say you're looking at both sides of an issue and want to hear what they think.""You have to get past, 'I have all the answers,'"" Arneson said.Set aside ego. Confidence is vital for a leader. But that doesn't mean you know everything. Arneson said the most confident leaders are also often the most likely to show they're vulnerable. They're not afraid to open up, even about their faults.Gain strength. The power inside people can only truly be unleashed if they bring everything they have to their role, says Barry Kaplan, a partner in New York-area executive coaching firm Shift 180. Openness plays a big role.""That includes talking about things that might be dangerous or risky,"" Kaplan, co-author of ""The Power of Vulnerability,"" told IBD.Be clear. Build an open and trusting environment by first talking about it. When Kaplan works with companies, he often has people write down something they haven't shared before but that's important to the business. It might be about saving money or why one person hasn't been fired. Then talk about that point in a forum where there is no fear of retribution.""There's a lot of pent-up truth that's ready to be unleashed,"" Kaplan said. ""There's courage involved in being vulnerable and speaking my truth. But if I'm authentic it makes me feel good about myself.""Stay true. Be consistent in how you act and treat people. And stick to your values while doing that.""That produces a track record of behavior that people can bank on,"" Arneson said. ""Then when they walk in on Monday morning, they know who they're getting.""Spread the word. Build authenticity into your group's culture by displaying it yourself, so others see it starts at the top. Talk about it every chance you get: in meetings, through a CEO blog and at employee celebrations.""The cool thing about authenticity is you don't have to think about it,"" Arneson said. ""It just comes naturally.""Win faith. If you're open about your weaknesses, you'll earn trust among your team.""Then you'll create a powerful team because people will have each other's back,"" Kaplan said.Take the lead. If the company chief doesn't show vulnerability and authenticity, others won't either. But if she does, it'll spread fast.Kaplan once worked with the leader of an auto parts company who was at a crossroads about whether to shut the doors or keep investing. The boss spoke openly to his people about his dilemma. They opened up about their fears and their staunch belief the company could recover from its slump. The boss decided to invest more in the company.""His people believed more in him because he was willing to say, 'I don't know,'"" Kaplan said. ""He couldn't have been more real. And they ended up having their best year ever.""Reap rewards. Once you open up to the point that you build trust, the benefits pour in.""Then you have an environment that's going to lead to improved performance,"" Kaplan said. ""One new idea leads to creativity and innovation, or you can cut your losses earlier if your company was going to do something that doesn't work.""

117,ALL,"No one is more upset about President Trump's second Supreme Court nomination than the liberal media ... unless it's the entertainment elites in Hollywood and Manhattan. These liberals couldn't see the flagrant hypocrisy surrounding their sentences as they unloaded their fear and loathing on television and Twitter.For example, notice the white male late-night comedians mocking Trump for naming a white male to the court. On ABC, Jimmy Kimmel joked Trump ""narrowed his candidates down to three — but, in the end, Kavanaugh was the white man for the job."" Stephen Colbert pulled a Bingo card from his pocket on CBS. ""I have Trump nomination Bingo,"" he announced. ""You see, all the squares say 'White Guy.'""This is fascinating from the insulated world of late-night comedy shows, where all of the hosts (except for Trevor Noah and Samantha Bee) are white guys. Colbert didn't make this joke when CBS exchanged Colbert for David Letterman, and James Corden for Craig Ferguson.Merrick Garland is another one of those white guy judges out there. But Obama nominated him, so who cares?That's not all. Colbert also mocked the name Brett as the name of a Ruby Tuesday waiter. That's rich coming from a guy who pronounces his last name like he's the snobbish maitre'd at Le Cirque. On Twitter, Colbert claimed a senator had called Kavanaugh ""the Forrest Gump of Republican politics."" It would be amusing to see Colbert take on Kavanaugh in a match of intellects.In one last stab at a late-night white guy, Conan O'Brien's sidekick Andy Richter was so alarmed he tweeted (in capital letters). ""WHY DOES ANYONE TALK ABOUT THIS PRESIDENT AS IF THE FACT THAT HE'S CARRYING OUT A PUTIN-ASSIGNED CHORE LIST ISN'T AS OBVIOUS AS THE BLUE SKY?""Earth to Andy: in Hollywood, it has long been considered a paranoid ""Red Scare"" to proclaim the conspiracy theory that someone in power — or in Hollywood — is a Russian agent.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Moore tweeted: ""This country cannot afford a justice on the Supreme Court who is likely to support the gun lobby's extreme, absolutist interpretation of the Second Amendment.""To be a Constitutional originalist is to dabble in extremism.For sheer lunacy, ""Hellboy"" star Ron Perlman compared Kavanaugh's Catholicsm to Sharia: ""The move back to Medieval Values, Shariah Law even, where old, bitter men get to tell women what is best for their bodies, lives, and well being is as done a deal as this is Twitter.

120,ALL,"Critics of Donald Trump claim there is no rhyme or reason to his foreign policy. But if there is a consistency, it might be called reciprocity.Trump tries to force other countries to treat the U.S. as it treats them. In ""don't tread on me"" style, he also warns enemies that any aggressive act will be replied to in kind.The underlying principle of Trump commercial reciprocity it that the United States is no longer powerful or wealthy enough to alone underwrite the security of the West. It can no longer assume sole enforcement of the rules and protocols of the postwar global order.This year there have been none of the usual Iranian provocations — frequent during the Obama administration — of harassing American ships in the Persian Gulf. Apparently, the Iranians now realize that anything they do to an American ship will be replied to with overwhelming force.Ditto North Korea. After lots of threats from Kim Jong Un about using his new ballistic missiles against the United States, Trump warned that he would use America's far greater arsenal to eliminate North Korea's arsenal for good.Trump is said to be undermining NATO by questioning its usefulness some 69 years after its founding. Yet unlike 1948, Germany is no longer down. The United States is always in. And Russia is hardly out, but instead cutting energy deals with the Europeans.More importantly, most NATO countries have failed to keep their promises to spend 2% of their GDP on defense.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseYet the vast majority of the 29 alliance members are far closer than the U.S. to the dangers of Middle East terrorism and supposed Russian bullying.Why does Germany by design run up a $65 billion annual trade surplus with the United States? Why does such a wealthy country spend only 1.2% of its GDP on defense? And if Germany has entered into energy agreements with a supposedly dangerous Vladimir Putin, why does it still need to have its security subsidized by the American military?Trump approaches NAFTA in the same reductionist way. The 24-year-old treaty was supposed to stabilize, if not equalize, all trade, immigration and commerce between the three supposed North American allies.It never quite happened that way. Unequal tariffs remained. Both Canada and Mexico have substantial trade surpluses with the U.S. In Mexico's case, it enjoys a $71 billion surplus, the largest of U.S. trading partners with the exception of China.Canada never honored its NATO security commitment. It spends only 1% of its GDP on defense, rightly assuming that the U.S. will continue to underwrite its security.During the lifetime of NAFTA, Mexico has encouraged millions of its citizens to enter the U.S. illegally. Mexico's selfish immigration policy is designed to avoid internal reform, to earn some $30 billion in annual expatriate remittances, and to influence U.S. politics.Yet after more than two decades of NAFTA, Mexico is more unstable than ever. Cartels run entire states. Murders are at a record high. Entire towns in southern Mexico have been denuded of their young males, who crossed the U.S. border illegally.The U.S. runs a huge trade deficit with China. The red ink is predicated on Chinese dumping, patent and copyright infringement, and outright cheating. Beijing illegally occupies neutral islands in the South China Sea, militarizes them and bullies it neighbors.All of the above has become the ""normal"" globalized world.But in 2016, red-state America rebelled at the asymmetry. The other half of the country demonized the red-staters as protectionists, nativists, isolationists, populists and nationalists.However, if China, Europe and other U.S. trading partners had simply followed global trading rules, there would have been no Trump pushback — and probably no Trump presidency at all.Had NATO members and NAFTA partners just kept their commitments, and had Mexico not encouraged millions of its citizens to crash the U.S. border, there would now be little tension between allies.Instead, what had become abnormal was branded the new normal of the postwar world.Again, a rich and powerful U.S. was supposed to subsidize world trade, take in more immigrants than all the nations of the world combined, protect the West, and ensure safe global communications, travel and commerce.After 70 years, the effort had hollowed out the interior of America, creating two separate nations of coastal winners and heartland losers.Trump's entire foreign policy can be summed up as a demand for symmetry from all partners and allies, and tit-for-tat replies to would-be enemies.Did Trump have to be so loud and often crude in his effort to bully America back to reciprocity?Who knows?But it seems impossible to imagine that globalist John McCain, internationalist Barack Obama or gentlemanly Mitt Romney would ever have called Europe, NATO, Mexico, and Canada to account, or warned Iran or North Korea that tit would be met by tat.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

121,ALL,"Brexit: U.S. trade ties with Britain are being held hostage by the U.K.'s protracted departure from the European Union. Better to make the exit quick and definitive than long and drawn out.It's been fun, as usual, to watch President Trump on an international stage as he stirs things up. In an exclusive interview with the British Sun, he criticized British Prime Minister Theresa May's plans for a ""soft Brexit,"" with continued close ties to the EU. And he suggested that her conservative foe, Boris Johnson, would make a great prime minister.But a day later, it had all blown over. Trump and May emerged holding hands for a Friday news conference, where each lavished praise on the other's leadership. The president even called May a ""tough negotiator"" — which, in the Trumpian world, is the highest form of praise. Trump also reaffirmed the ""special relationship"" that has bonded the U.S. and Britain since the late 19th century.Even so, Trump's remarks to The Sun highlighted the fact that Britain is stuck in a bitter fight, mostly among conservatives, for how it should leave the EU. Should Britain merely loosen ties a bit and continue hewing to many of its trade rules (""soft Brexit""), or completely walk away and re-establish its economic sovereignty outside of the 28-nation EU (""hard Brexit"").Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Trump has said he's not in favor of the ""soft"" option, which would still leave Britain subject to many if not most of the EU's inane trade rules.As Trump told The Sun, ""If they do a deal like that (a soft Brexit), we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal.""With more than $480 billion invested in the U.S., Britain is our No. 1 investor here. And the U.S., with over $600 billion in place in Britain, is the largest investor there. They are our fourth largest export market and our seventh-largest trading partner overall. So, yes, it matters.Once again, Trump stirred things up, but in doing so revealed a political truth: That Britain's May and her party should have embraced the hard Brexit that Britons voted for two years ago and escaped the EU's toxic economic embrace. All the dire predictions of doom have failed to materialize.Instead, May could face a vote of no confidence in Parliament and leave a tarnished legacy of diminished trade and influence on both sides of the Atlantic, with the U.S. more distant than ever. Trump's blunt talk was meant as a wake-up call for May.

132,ALL,"Six months into the year, the performance of the current stocks in the IBD 50 looks good. Surprisingly good. Yet some stocks are naturally forming new bases.Among the companies that made the list after Thursday's market close, the average year-to-date advance stands at a stout 42%. Either way you cut it, the performance is oodles of times more than the 2.2% lift by the S&P 500, excluding dividends. Through Friday's morning trade, the Nasdaq composite reached 7672, up 11% since Jan. 1.However, no one knows what the next six months will bring. So it makes complete sense to gauge the health of the market on a day-to-day basis. Do it in three steps. One, track the major indexes. The Big Picture column helps immensely in this corner.Two, watch the action of the IBD 50. And three, closely observe the action in your own portfolio. If you're picking top-rated companies, you have insight into how the market leadership is acting.Currently, 13 stocks are trading 10% or more below their 52-week or all-time highs. The median correction within the IBD 50: a delightfully mild 5.5% from the 52-week peak.ZTO Express (ZTO) is about 9% below a 21.70 all-time high. As seen on a weekly chart, the midcap transport stock is working to keep above the rising 10-week moving average. Would a small dip below the 10-week line be reasonable? Yes, because the stock had performed admirably after a breakout past a proper entry point at 17.57 on May 14. After clearing the base, which has features of a double bottom, ZTO rolled ahead with a 23% gain.It's smart to take gains in most stocks when they build a profit of 20% to 25% from the breakout point, as ZTO shows.ZTO, a delivery giant and e-commerce play in China, joined IBD Leaderboard on Tuesday. It is forming a base with a 21.80 buy point.Canada Goose (GOOS) is trading about 14% below an all-time peak of 68.75. But in late June, the stock sank as much as 19% below that high. That means the current correction would be too deep for a flat base.The only stock within the IBD 50 that sits more than 20% off its high: Israel's SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG). At a June 18 short-term low of 45.85, it's fallen more than 35% off its 70.74 peak. The solar inverter firm has now spent more than four weeks below the 10-week moving average, yet has not challenged the 40-week line (equivalent to the 200-day moving average on a daily chart).An escalating global trade war with the U.S. would likely impact the future growth of some IBD 50 firms. Baozun (BZUN), which promotes e-commerce in the Middle Kingdom for non-Chinese exporters, certainly carries more trade-related risk than, say, HealthEquity (HQY), the expert in health savings accounts in the U.S.Digital economy plays seem more immune to the tit-for-tat tariffs. After all, you're not going to find Netflix (NFLX) ""products"" on some container ship heading to Shanghai or Shenzhen.

The base is a third-stage pattern. Maybe more important, it marks the stock's first move above its historical highs set up in February 2014. It is an interesting position to be in with the company due to report on May 24. The April-ending fiscal first quarter is traditionally Splunk's weakest quarter, and analysts are calling for the largest loss (9 cents per share) in the company's history.Consensus views project revenue will rise 84%. But it is worth noting that the company has topped consensus views over the last four quarters by margins ranging from 12% to 75%.E-Trade Financial was knocking out new highs on Friday, climbing toward the top of a buy range above a three-weeks-tight buy point at 62.03. It is the stock's first buy opportunity since an earlier breakout from a flat base failed in early March. The stock pulled back more than 8% below that base's 58.10 buy point, triggering the automatic sell rule.That was no surprise, because the base is a very late-stage base. Breakouts from such bases carry added risk of failure. The same is true of three-weeks-tight patterns — particularly those that occur after late-stage bases. The clear message for investors is to keep their stops and sell rules tight.E-Trade recovered with five straight weekly gains after finding support at its 10-week moving average early in April. The stock jumped nearly 3% in very heavy trade on April 20, just after the company's first-quarter report. The stock on Friday was up 30% since the start of the year, and showing a 12-month gain of 84%.ServiceNow was in buy range above a 176.66 buy point in a flat base.

138,ALL,"Dow futures rose strongly Thursday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, as China led an Asian market rebound. The Dow Jones led a stock market sell-off in Wednesday's session as President Donald Trump threatened to vastly increase the China trade war, with Beijing signaling further retaliation. Microsoft (MSFT), Twitter (TWTR), Okta (OKTA), Urban Outfitters (URBN) and Five Below (FIVE) are all stocks holding up, close to setting up.The Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite only gave up a portion of their recent gains. Still, the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones have been moving sideways since late January, with Trump trade war tensions a major factor. The Nasdaq composite hit new highs recently. But the Nasdaq has outperformed thanks to FANG stocks Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon.com (AMZN) as well as software stocks, all relatively resistant to trade woes.Dow futures rose 0.8% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.5%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.4% above fair value. China's Shanghai composite rallied 2.2% Thursday, as most Asian markets rebounded.

139,ALL,"The president, who might not be fully acquainted with the pertinent Supreme Court case law, says the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel was unconstitutional. The president's opinion, because it is his, is prima facie evidence for the opposite conclusion. It is, however, not sufficient evidence. Consider the debate between two serious people who have immersed themselves in the history of the Appointments Clause, which says:""(The president) shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the United States, whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by law: but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of departments.""The debate turns on the distinction the Supreme Court has drawn between ""inferior"" and ""principal"" officers. If Mueller is among the latter, his appointment was invalid because he was neither nominated by the president — he was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein — nor confirmed by the Senate. Steven G. Calabresi, professor at Northwestern University Law School and co-founder of the Federalist Society, argues as follows:By ""long-standing practice,"" Congress and the executive branch give principal-officer status to all ""important and powerful"" officials, even those who have a boss who can fire them. In 1976, the Supreme Court invalidated the law that created the Federal Election Commission to be composed of two members nominated by the president, two by the speaker of the House and two by the president pro tempore of the Senate. The court held that all six must be nominated by the president as principal officers.Mueller, says Calabresi, is much more important and powerful than an FEC member. Congress has stipulated that the 93 U.S. attorneys are principal officers, and Mueller has, Calabresi says, ""acted and has behaved like,"" and is ""much more powerful than,"" any U.S. attorney. Compare, for example, Mueller's job relative to that of the U.S. attorney for Wyoming. Mueller has ""nationwide jurisdiction"" and powers (e.g., to indict foreign citizens and corporations ""without clearance from (the Justice Department)"") that have had ""a major effect on"" U.S. foreign policy, powers that ""in effect and in practice"" are ""akin to"" those exercised by an assistant attorney general, a principal officer. Mueller has been ""without any real supervision"" by Rosenstein, ""who has treated Mueller as if he was 'independent.'""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFurthermore, Calabresi says Mueller cannot be an inferior officer because ""Congress has not, by law vested in the attorney general, the power to appoint special counsels to investigate wrongdoing"" by high officials. The Appointments Clause creates a ""default rule"" that all U.S. officers are principal officers and it takes an ""affirmative action"" — a statute — to empower the attorney general to appoint a special counsel as an inferior officer, which Congress has not passed. The 1978 law that vested in a special court the power to appoint independent counsels expired in 1999.Writing in vigorous rebuttal, George Conway, a New York lawyer (whose wife Kellyanne works for the president who hopes Calabresi is correct), argues that Calabresi incorrectly asserts that Mueller must be a principal officer because he does not have a supervising and directing boss. Conway says:Rosenstein has testified to Congress that he is ""exercising my oversight responsibilities"" concerning Mueller, with whom he has ""ongoing discussion,"" who ""consults with me"" about his investigation, and who has ""received my permission"" regarding the scope of the investigation.So Mueller, like an inferior officer, has ""a boss"" by whom he is ""directed and supervised,"" and whose ""orders"" Mueller is ""faithfully following."" No presidential power has been diminished because Mueller's mission was defined by a regulation written within the supervising executive branch. And although U.S. attorneys are principal officers, vacancies in the 93 offices can be filled for 120 days by the attorney general without Senate involvement and then ""indefinitely"" by district courts. Calabresi replies: 100 senators would have conniptions were U.S. attorneys treated as inferior officers not requiring senatorial consent.Two intelligent lawyers disagree about this momentous matter, concerning which the Supreme Court's nine justices might eventually be dispositive. If Mueller's appointment is challenged, and the case gets to the court, and five justices reason as Calabresi does, Mueller's subpoenas, indictments and other acts will be null and void.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

146,ALL,"President Trump's aluminum and steel tariff policies have now triggered retaliatory tariffs from other nations, including Canada, the EU and China.Last week Trump imposed new tariffs on more than $30 billion of Chinese electronic equipment and other consumer goods. Our trading partners are now threatening to hit our domestic industries, including wheat, soybeans, pork, bourbon, blue jeans — and even Maine lobsters. The financial markets are jittery, to say the least.Even worse, China's tit-for-tat tariffs are now intentionally designed to antagonize Trump voters in Midwestern and Southern states. They are using tariffs as a political weapon. It's funny that the left doesn't seem to protest this blatant and dangerous foreign meddling in U.S. elections. They even seem to applaud this election interference by a hostile foreign power because Trump is the target.In any case, the goal of these foreign-imposed tariffs aimed at the U.S. is to inflict maximum economic pain on American producers in order to force Trump to retreat.Retreating isn't an option for Trump — never has been and never will be. So this is a game Beijing can't win. For Trump to score a decisive victory, he will need to reclaim the moral high ground in this fight.Our trading partners are claiming indignation that Trump has instigated all these trade disputes. Last week the Chinese accused America of ""firing the first shot.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThat's a laughable claim coming from Beijing. China's tariffs, according to a report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers, are on average about 10%, while our tariffs are closer to 3.5%. This doesn't include non-tariff trade hurdles that make it extremely difficult for American companies to sell things in China.We buy three times as much from them as they buy from us. Many U.S. companies complain, with justification, that to do business in China, they have to disclose trade secrets and patents, and in some cases surrender ownership rights of the firm. How is any of this ""free trade""?But even our European allies have created anything but a level playing field. Their tariffs are about 30% higher than ours, according to the White House Council of Economic Advisers. This does not include the 10% to 20% value-added tax that Europe slaps on American products when they hit their shores. Trump has told our allies that he is not against free trade, but it must be reciprocal, and right now it isn't.This is where Trump can and should change the terms of this debate. He should go back to an offer he put on the table at the recent G-7 meetings in Quebec with the Europeans, Japan and Canada: zero tariffs.Trump challenged the other leaders by proposing: ""We should at least consider no tariffs, no barriers — scrapping all of it."" It speaks volumes about the trade debate that none of the foreign leaders, except perhaps Germany's Angela Merkel, had any interest.If the offer were made to China, the mercantilist leaders would be thrown off their high horse never to recover. These nations are more interested in bashing Trump as a trade warrior while retaining their own indefensible protectionist trade barriers.All the more reason for Trump to seize the high ground in the trade debate by offering it up again and again as America's desired endgame. This is an idea that comes from Trump's National Economic Council Chairman Larry Kudlow, and the good news is that my sources tell me the all-in strategy is being revisited at the White House now.Zero tariffs would be the ultimate victory for totally free and fair trade. It would advantage the United States most because we already impose the lowest trade barriers. It would also expose many of Trump's severest critics as free-trade frauds.President Trump: You should do this, because the worst that could happen is our allies take you up on the offer.Is Trump's Protectionism The Death Knell For Global Free Trade?Turns Out, Those Forced Union Dues Did Go To Liberal Advocacy GroupsCalifornia's Costly Global Warming Campaign Turns Out To Be Worse Than Useless

147,ALL,"Even Indiana Jones would probably have given up.Howard Carter and his team dug through hundreds of boulders in Egypt's Valley of the Kings for about five arduous years, looking for the lost tomb of Tutankhamun. His research told him the tomb was there. But no one — not even he — could find it thousands of years after the child king's death. Carter's once enthusiastic financial backer was losing patience.But in one of history's greatest examples of persistence with a massive payoff, Carter removed rubble that revealed the entrance of the tomb on Nov. 25, 1922. His discovery is still considered the most significant archaeological feat in modern times, Tarek El-Awady, curator of the ""King Tut: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh"" exhibit, told IBD in an email sent from Egypt. ""Howard Carter's discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun still stands as the greatest discovery made by man,"" El-Awady said.The valuable treasures Carter found still draw crowds to museums around the world. But what Carter did to achieve his goals and persevere is equally priceless, including:Carter was never formally trained as an archaeologist or even a scientist. He was the son of an artist and an artist himself. But he learned about archaeology on the job after he was hired at the age of 17 to draw Egyptian artifacts for a wealthy family. His skill as an artist won him a spot traveling to Egypt alongside some of the best archaeologists of all time, including Percy Newberry. From them he learned how to carefully excavate and catalog a dig's artifacts. This knowledge, paired with his previous training as an artist, created a powerful blend of skill sets that few in the world possessed. ""He learned a lot on the job. You can't learn it until you're standing there having to do it,"" Pearce Creasman, associate professor and director of the Egyptian Expedition at the University of Arizona told IBD. ""He put all the pieces together and learned from all these people and added his special skill (of drawing) to the mix.""Carter's skill set was so unique that he commanded respect on digs and was later named chief inspector for the Egyptian Antiquities Service — a position that would set him up for success later.From Newberry and others, Carter learned the importance of being highly detailed in cataloging everything he found. His journals of findings are richly illustrated in painstaking detail — a standard practice in archaeology today — but perhaps seen as excessive or even obsessive in the day.To capture every detail, Carter developed a breakthrough system of classifying digs that culminated with the King Tut discovery. Every group of objects found was designated with a number from one to 620, Nicholas Reeves and John Taylor wrote in ""Howard Carter Before Tutankhamun."" Smaller groups of items found were then notated with single or multiple letters, such as a, b, c, aa, bb, cc and aaa, bbb, ccc.Again, this was Carter applying his talents to something he learned from someone else. Carter ""learned excavation with British excavator Flinders Petrie, who taught him the importance of small finds,"" Brian Fagen, an archaeologist and emeritus professor of anthropology at University of California, Santa Barbara, told IBD. ""Researchers working on the tomb still consult his notebooks, which are an exceptional record, far ahead of their time.""Carter closely observed and took valuable tips from ""experts."" But just as importantly, he knew what to ignore, too. Theodore Davis, a wealthy U.S. attorney and successful archaeologist whom Carter was working with, declared in the early 1910s that all the great finds in the Valley of the Kings already had been found.Carter disregarded Davis' ""expert opinion."" Carter's own experience proved to be just as precious, if not more than Davis'. Carter ""was a maverick operator, stubborn, ambitious and brimming with self-confidence,"" William Cross, author of ""Carnarvon, Carter and Tutankhamun Revisited: The Hidden Truths and Doomed Relationships,"" told IBD. ""His know-how, spark and ingenuity convinced him that the tomb of Tutankhamun was somewhere in the Valley of the Kings.""After Davis gave up on the dig, Carter had to find another backer to fund a continued search.Carter quit his stable job as an inspector for the Egyptian archaeological service in 1905 to free up time for his search. Some of the hardest years of his life followed.Carter's quest for the tomb was almost an obsession. But he knew that to complete it he would need financial backing. After Davis left the quest, Carter teamed up with a new financial supporter, wealthy Briton Lord Carnarvon. The difficulty was convincing him to keep writing the checks even as Carter found nothing year after year.When Carnarvon grew frustrated and was about to cut off Carter's financing, Carter modified his approach to appeal to Carnarvon's sense as an investor. In those times, archaeologist teams kept half of what they found and returned the remainder to Egypt. Carter knew the cost of financing another dig was a fraction of the reward possible if they found the tomb. He explained the economics to Carnarvon and said if he wouldn't pay to keep digging, Carter would from his own pocket. The pitch was so compelling — blending economic reasoning with scientific precision — it convinced Carnarvon to keep writing the checks. ""He got one guy to buy in and sometimes that's all it takes, is one person to make something really big happen,"" Creasman said.Carter's sharp tongue might have made it difficult to sell his idea, but he ""was smart enough and eloquent enough in tales about Tutankhamun's lost tomb to be enticed and trusted by millionaire investors looking to cash in on antiquities, and the glint of gold to come,"" Cross said.Just imagining your success isn't going to do much. Success comes to those who visualize how to get there. Carter provides an example. While still antiquities inspector, Carter looked back and examined all the successful digs in the Valley of the Kings. Not just his, but everyone's. Most archaeologists randomly dug. But Carter applied his detailed grid-block system of analysis to past discoveries. This allowed him to build a holistic picture in his mind of what was explored, and what wasn't. By ""retroactively applying to all the work done in the Valley of the Kings … he knew areas that other people had missed,"" Creasman said. By studying past records, Carter knew others ""dug 10 feet to the right and 20 feet to the left, and 15 feet over here. They had not dug everything, everywhere.""Perhaps it was another example of how Carter elevated archaeology by blending facets of his unique mind as an artist would. Carter's attention to detail allowed him to visualize what parts of the valley were ""clean territory — an area no one has ever excavated,"" Creasman said.""He had this map in his head, along with internal motivation,"" Creasman said. ""I haven't done everything I can do until I've done this. When people obsess on a thing, they can't let it go.""Carter loved his life's work — ever since starting out as an artist. That passion drove him to keep looking and learning. Others who were purely driven by money would have given up. ""Working in the Valley of the Kings is like magic, the silence and the absolute power of the cliffs surrounding the valley makes every Egyptologist willing to spend his entire life working and working, running after a dream that might or might not ever come true,"" El-Awady said.His passion yielded success even when he wasn't trying. In addition to exploring and drawing, Carter loved horses and riding the west bank of Luxor, El-Awady says. ""One of his greatest discoveries happened when the leg of his horse got stuck in a hole that turned out to be the symbolic burial of King Mentuhotep II (Dynasty 11),"" El-Awady said. ""In this tomb, the beautiful statue of the king was discovered.""Carter brought ""long-term planning, the need for a disciplined approach to finding and excavating sites, and the necessity for recording everything with photographs, drawings, or in writing,"" Fagen said. ""He really was one of the first modern archaeologists, with a unique eye for detail, and always a mind for the long-term outcome of the project.""Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.Apply your unique interests and abilities to your profession to reinvent what's possible.Overcame: Many failed attempts to find King Tut's tomb and loss of financial backing""All we have to do is to peel the shrines like an onion, and we will be with the king himself.""

But the complaints about today's gasoline prices expose more about the short attention spans of Americans and the mainstream press than they do about oil markets.According to the Energy Information Administration's weekly report, a gallon of gas costs about $2.92 nationwide. And, indeed, the last time prices were that high was in October 2014.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut stories about today's gas prices rarely adjust for inflation. When you do that, you find that at $2.92, a gallon of gas costs the same today as it did back in June 1984.During President Obama's 8-years in office, gasoline averaged $3.25 a gallon, in today's dollars. For 14 months during those years, it was above $4 a gallon, which is higher than prices ever reached in the wake of the Iranian revolution. (They peaked at $3.94 in March 1980.)What's more, while Trump is right that OPEC can have an impact on oil prices, the explosion of domestic oil production has dramatically weakened OPEC's hand.That's a result of the fracking revolution, which unlocked vast stores of previously unrecovered oil deposits. Plus, Trump promised when he came into office that he'd remove impediments to still more production, and has taken several steps to do so.As a result, oil companies produced 14% more oil this April than they did when Trump took office. In the first half of this year, they will have produced about as much domestic oil as they did in all of 2009.For those who really do want to see lower gas prices, the answer isn't to complain about Trump's Iran policy, or call for him to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve — as some are already doing.The answer is to review the pile of environmental regulations and federal mandates that raise costs. That includes the ethanol mandate, regional air quality rules that have Balkanized gasoline markets in the country, and various EPA rules on what can go into gasoline. The Obama administration's ""Tier 3"" regulations, for example, added as much as 9 cents to a gallon of gas.Regulations made building new refineries almost impossible, resulting in refining capacity dropping from 18.6 million barrels a day in 1981 to 16.8 million by 2005. Obama added to still more refining costs with new regulations imposed in 2015.On top of all this, add state and federal per-gallon taxes, and you see that the government is responsible for a significant portion of gasoline's price.The Trump administration and the Republican Congress could bring gasoline prices down. But only by further enraging their already hysterical political opponents.Is Trump's Protectionism The Death Knell For Global Free Trade?Turns Out, Those Forced Union Dues Did Go To Liberal Advocacy GroupsCalifornia's Costly Global Warming Campaign Turns Out To Be Worse Than UselessMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

161,ALL,"The late-night hosts hate President Donald Trump, so the idea that they would make friendly alliances shouldn't be shocking. But as we've come to understand, in today's world anything that reflects negatively on this president becomes ""news."" So when Stephen Colbert at CBS called up Jimmy Fallon at NBC and Conan O'Brien at TBS for a joint mockery of Trump, the liberal media jazzed up its importance.Vanity Fair called it a ""Historic Group Chat,"" as if these were world leaders in arms negotiations. Entertainment Weekly hyped them as superheroes engaging in an ""Avengers-esque collaboration."" CNN senior media reporter Brian Stelter led his ""Reliable Sources"" newsletter with the headline ""Late night collusion!""This underlines how liberals elevate late-night comedians and ""Saturday Night Live"" satirists as the smartest, greatest Americans, an honor they don't deserve.

""Choking up,"" the Reporter writes, Fallon said: ""I heard you. You made me feel bad. So now what? Are you happy? I'm depressed. Do you want to push me more? What do you want me to do? You want me to kill myself?""Comedians are expected to do the left's bidding like pop-culture guerrillas. The agitators apparently driving Fallon to brink of suicide threats never minded when Fallon fawned all over Hillary Clinton.In 2012, he hosted then-President Obama for a segment of ""Slow Jam the News"" during which he let Obama push his agenda and then endorsed it, saying: ""Awww, yeah. You should listen to the president, or as I like to call him, the preezy of the United Steezy."" In 2013, Fallon dressed up as a woman and partnered with then-first lady Michelle Obama for a skit called the ""Evolution of Mom Dancing.""All is apparently right with the world when the networks work overtime to confirm the ""effortless"" coolness of Democratic leaders. But Republicans can never be normalized or humanized by late-night hosts.When Johnny Carson mocked President Ronald Reagan, it was gentle and had a ""just kidding"" vibe. All these years later, the left expects late-night comedians to lead a vicious campaign of character assassination to ruin Trump, which is why Fallon's hair mussing gets metaphorically reimagined as treason.Other columns by L.

163,ALL,"Progressives: The shocking primary victory of 28-year-old socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over Congress' No. 4, Democrat Joe Crowley, underscores what we have long noted: The Democratic Party is no longer a party of moderation, but a party of the extreme left. And it's moving ever faster and farther leftward with each election cycle.The 57%-42% drubbing of Crowley looks like the death knell not just for his political career, but for that of his mentor House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Crowley, after all, was the hand-picked successor to Pelosi. He had outraised his far younger opponent by 10-to-1.Ocasio-Cortez isn't a make-believe socialist; she belongs to the Democratic Socialists of America. And she had the backing of Bernie Sanders' ""Our Revolution"" political group.""Our Revolution""? Do they want a civil war? It's a real concern. A new Rasmussen poll shows 31% of Americans think a civil war is likely soon, while 59% fear violence from Trump haters. That's scary.And, by the way, Ocasio-Cortez is no fluke. She's part of a trend. Just look at who the leading lights of the Democrats are today. In addition to such progressive stalwarts as Pelosi and Hillary Clinton, their most vocal and visible leaders include far-left Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kristen Gillibrand, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris.The House has so many far-left Democrats we couldn't list them all in an editorial. But they are numerous, and angry, pushing their side ever closer to violent confrontation.Take Rep. Maxine Waters, an influential Democrat who had this to say about civility toward the political opposition: ""If you see anybody from that (Trump) Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them, and you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere.""As the violent rhetoric ramps up, Trump officials (Sarah Huckabee, Elaine Chao, Jeff Sessions, among others) have been harassed in public places and at their homes, threatened with violence and even thrown out of restaurants because they work for this White House. It shows what the left really thinks of democracy.Is this a preview of what America will be like under a Democratic administration?Is this the future of the Democratic Party? Sure looks that way.The party's base is itself increasingly far left. As a study last year by the American Culture and Faith Institute of adults 18 and older showed, 37% of adults said they ""prefer socialism to capitalism."" Most of those were self-described liberals.""That is a large minority,"" wrote researcher and Executive Director George Barna. ""And it includes a majority of the liberals — who will be pushing for a completely different economic model to dominate our nation. That is the stuff of civil wars. It ought to set off alarm bells among more traditionally-oriented leaders across the nation.""They already are pushing for a ""different model.""In addition to embracing violence and the denial of such basic constitutional rights as free speech, freedom of religion and the right to protect oneself, much of the Democratic Party now embraces a spate of far-left ideas. These include such winners as open borders, Medicare for all (single-payer health care), unrestricted abortion, special ""gender"" rights, free tuition, government controlled housing, deep and dangerous defense cuts, a job-killing $15-an-hour minimum wage, a ""guaranteed income"" for all, and ever-higher welfare spending.Meanwhile, the party's socialist-progressive wing, which now dominates, love-hugs all these ideas. And it's actively anti-capitalist.Parts of this agenda of unbridled socialism show up in Democrats' official new policy blueprint called ""A Better Deal."" A better name would be ""A Rawer Deal,"" because these ideas have been tried before and failed. As we've noted here repeatedly, there are no successful socialist countries. None. It's an unworkable, inhuman system that replaces individual rights and freedom with authoritarian control imposed from above, all in the name of ""the people.""Americans have had their economic knowledge systematically dumbed-down by the media and the schools, from elementary school through university. Ask younger people whether they like socialism, and a majority now say yes. They've been trained to hate capitalism, and never lived under socialism. So they don't know it's the death of all they hold dear and the end to their individual dreams.In addition, socialism is antithetical to democracy. A study in 2015 by MIT economist Daron Acemoglu and University of Chicago economist James A. Robinson suggests that democratic systems are the only way to thrive as an economy. ""Our central estimates suggest that a country that switches from autocracy to democracy achieves about 20% higher GDP per capita over roughly 30 years.""It's shocking because there are so many examples of socialism's failures today — from Zimbabwe and North Korea to Cuba and Venezuela. No socialist nation thrives. Ever.

179,ALL,"Exchange traded fund investors can't shake their volatility addiction.Since the week after the infamous ""volpocalypse"" in early February, the ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (UVXY) has seen net inflows of $308 million. More than 70% of that has come since July 3.Investors have poured nearly $220 million into the $503 million fund this month without a single day of outflows. As one of the most liquid, leveraged ETFs that bet on volatility rising, UVXY uses derivatives in an attempt to produce returns equal to 1-1/2 times the underlying Cboe Volatility Index, better known as the VIX. The benchmark, sometimes called the ""fear gauge"" because it rises during times of market turmoil, has fallen roughly 20% in July.Volatility ticked up slightly on Wednesday after the Trump administration released a list of $200 billion worth of Chinese goods that will be subject to new tariffs. The VIX rose to 13.6, still below its five-year average of 14.6.Despite the VIX's sharp downturn since February, the flows are probably bets on volatility rising, rather than shares created to short it, because UVXY is particularly popular among retail investors, who are less likely to deploy a short strategy, according to Josh Lukeman, head of ETF market making for the Americas at Credit Suisse Group.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

186,ALL,"Acceleron Pharma (XLRN) stock jumped Tuesday after it and Celgene (CELG) reported a second win in as many weeks for their blood-disease drug called luspatercept.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Acceleron shares rose 2.9%, to 48.76, after earlier popping as much as 5.4%. Celgene advanced 0.9%, to 84.56. Shares of biotech companies broadly dipped less than 1%.Luspatercept could stoke more confidence in Celgene, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said. The firm's biggest cancer drug, Revlimid, will soon face a patent cliff. But Celgene is working other angles in cancer drugs. It acquired Juno Therapeutics and is partnered with Bluebird Bio (BLUE).""We view this as another positive development that, after recent successes with (Juno's drug called) JCAR017 and (Bluebird's drug called) bb2121, could begin to re-instill investor confidence in the pipeline beyond Revlimid not substantially reflected in shares at current levels,"" he said in a report to clients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe study, called Believe, tested luspatercept as a treatment for patients with beta thalassemia who are dependent on regular blood transfusions. These patients don't produce enough of a protein that carries oxygen throughout the body.Luspatercept showed a ""highly statistically significant"" improvement in red blood cell response. The goal was to reduce red blood cell transfusion burden by at least 33%. Researchers also looked for an absolute reduction of at least two transfusion units from week 13 to week 24 of the study.In addition, luspatercept also met all key secondary goals of the study. Side effects were consistent with previously reported data, the biotech companies said in a news release. The firms now plan to ask regulators in the U.S. and Europe to approve the drug in the first half of 2019.The news was largely expected. About two weeks ago, Celgene and Acceleron released positive data for luspatercept in another study. That late-stage test looked at the drug's ability to improve red blood cell response in patients with what are called myelodysplastic syndromes.Analysts had varied models on these two markets for luspatercept. Credit Suisse analyst Martin Auster calls for $2 billion in peak sales for both disorders. Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges sees $2.6 billion in peak 2025 sales for both uses.RBC's Abrahams models just $1.2 billion for luspatercept — a small fraction of the $12 billion in peak sales for Revlimid. But that could still help Celgene to fill its future Revlimid-shaped hole.""We see this, coupled with other positive pipeline developments for JCAR017 and bb2121 as putting the company (Celgene) on track to reach $10 billion in probability-adjusted sales for its current pipeline,"" he said.Piper Jaffray analyst Edward Tenthoff was more bearish on partner Acceleron. He downgraded Acceleron stock to a neutral rating and cut his price target to 52 from 55.Tenthoff acknowledged the win for luspatercept but said Acceleron is ""not a buy at this valuation.""He sees sales of $20 million in 2020 after U.S. and European officials likely approve luspatercept. The biggest opportunity for the drug is in myelodysplastic syndromes where it could replace current, less effective therapies.But the tail will be short, Tenthoff said. Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are working on a potentially curative treatment for beta thalassemia. Their therapy could get approval by 2020, he said.""While not all patients will be appropriate for or able to afford gene therapy/CRISPR (a form of gene editing), we anticipate significant competitive pressure to impact Acceleron's market share,"" he said.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

187,ALL,"When Delta Air Lines (DAL) releases second-quarter earnings on Thursday, Wall Street will be bracing for its response to the higher fuel costs and international tensions that have converged on airline stocks and profits this year.Delta Air Lines last month cut its second-quarter earnings-per-share outlook, citing a ""sharp rise"" in jet-fuel costs. The carrier this month stuck with that EPS forecast, of $1.65-$1.75, compared with Zacks forecasts for $1.75, up 7%. Analysts expect revenue to rise 8% to $11.679 billion.But fuel costs and labor are typically an airline's biggest expenses. Since Delta first cut its EPS outlook in June, analysts have been waiting to see whether the airline will trim flights from its schedule, or otherwise rearrange it, to recapture sales.Delta in June said it would make a decision on how to handle its flight-capacity plans for the fall. The company said that decision would be made ""through the lens of strong demand and volatile fuel.""""The first course of action may be to adjust their fall and winter schedules, while trying to raise fares in strong markets,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note last week.Despite the concerns about fuel, corporate and leisure travel remain solid. Delta expected a 4%-5% gain in second-quarter unit revenue, or an airline's sales as they relate to the scope of its flight coverage.""Delta's unit revenue outlook will be important as investors continue to worry about the industry's ability to raise ticket prices to cover rising jet fuel prices,"" Becker said in the note.Southwest Airlines (LUV) last month also pulled back its outlook for flight-capacity growth this year amid higher fuel costs. American Airlines (AAL) said travelers might have to deal with steeper fare prices as fuel costs run higher.Delta stock rose 0.2% in the stock market today. American Airlines stock lost 0.5%. Southwest Airlines stock retreated 0.5%. Delta, American and Southwest all recently hit their worst levels of the year.United Airlines (UAL) was down 0.7%. United stock tested support at its 50-day line; it has been consolidating for more than a year.Morgan Stanley analyst Rajeev Lalwani said in a research note Monday that he expected Delta to cut its earnings-per-share outlook for the year. He said American Air earnings per share would likely come in at the lower end of its expected range. He also said airlines' foreign-exchange-related advantages were ""subsiding.""Conditions could also deteriorate for U.S. airlines' international business — an area of strength for Delta in recent quarters.Some analysts remain concerned that a U.S. trade war with China, Europe and others could ding companies' spending plans, which would ultimately hit corporate travel. Outside the U.S., where the airspace is crowded with rivals, all kinds of difficulties await.Airline stocks have been ""pressured by rising fuel prices, trade issues, supply concerns, Iran sanctions, Italy, North Korea, Russia, Brexit, etc.,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Linenberg said in a research note last week. ""In our conversations with investors, we have encountered far more excuses to sell them than reasons to buy them.""Analysts also worry about the state of Brazil's economy, and how much that will weigh on demand in Latin America. But any good news, Linenberg said, could be really good for airline stocks.""That said, investors' expectations toward the sector are quite low, and we are of the view that it probably wouldn't take much positive news to send airline shares higher by 5%-10%,"" he continued.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:S&P 500 Earnings Hot, But Will Trump's Trade Wars Chill Guidance?Delta Air Lines Flags This 'Wild Card' In Earnings Guidance This YearSouthwest To Abandon This Piece Of Its 'History And DNA' PermanentlyAirline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

192,ALL,"EOG Resources (EOG) weathered a massive oil price drop a few years ago thanks to smart investments across multiple basins, first-mover advantage and loads of data.Now, the shale exploration and production company is one of the top performers in its sector as oil prices rebound.Ninety percent of EOG's production comes from its U.S. shale operations. But EOG has spread its resources throughout the Bakken Shale basin in the north-central U.S. and southern Canada, as well as the Eagle Ford and Permian basins in the Texas and New Mexico area. That diversity has been one key to EOG's success.""They have attractive portions across multiple basins,"" said Brian Youngberg, analyst at Edward Jones. ""Some of the other premier players, like Pioneer Natural (PXD), are more focused geographically. But EOG has a handful of positions they got into early, at a low cost.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEOG produced the equivalent of 609,000 barrels of oil a day last year on average for a total of 222 million barrels. It has an estimated 2.527 billion barrels of oil equivalent in proved reserves. EOG grew in both categories during 2017 after a downturn the previous two years.The company is part of IBD's Oil & Gas-U. S. Exploration and Production group, which also features top names like Diamondback Energy (FANG) and Parsley Energy (PE). The company has a 95 Composite Rating from IBD. That means it is outperforming 95% of all stocks in key fundamental and technical criteria.A recent IBD Stock of the Day, EOG is building a base on base with a 128.13 buy point.Managing data is key for tech companies in Silicon Valley to take advantage of trends. EOG brought the power of data to the shale fields, earning it the nickname the ""Apple of Oil"" by analysts.Dave Meats, a senior analyst at Morningstar, says EOG's larger size gives it access to more data than smaller players in the space. EOG has access to its own data on previously drilled wells. It also has data on wells drilled by other companies where it has a small stake.EOG used analytical data from thousands of wells. They find everything from the optimal length to drill during each fracking stage, to which rock type is more productive.""The company does have a technical edge,"" Meats said. ""Not so much (in that) it can do things other companies can't, but that it can lead the way in achieving technical benefits before some of its peers.""Last year, EOG said it had developed 20 mobile apps of its own over two years that allow workers to stay connected day and night. It also has collected data from 5,000 horizontal wells in almost every major unconventional play in the U.S.Further, proprietary data is helping the company cut costs. Meats said the company isn't reliant on expensive analytics packages from Schlumberger (SLB) and other service providers.On top of that, data helped EOG take advantage of being one of the first movers into newer, fringe areas in a potential shale play. It analyzed the success and failure of other wells in the area.""They were kind of early on the Eagle Ford and Bakken,"" Youngberg said. ""They just saw things years ago under the leadership they had and were able to build big positions.""With acreage in some of the most prolific basins in the U.S., the company's broad geographic offerings give it the ability to be more flexible with spending if issues arise.""Some companies are very nimble like EOG. They will move capital here or there a little bit if it makes sense to,"" Youngberg said.Companies that shifted their assets to exclusively focus on the Permian now see production backing up, bottlenecked by limited pipeline capacity that likely will remain constrained through 2019. But both Youngberg and Meats don't expect the Permian bottleneck to affect EOG.When times are tough, company management isn't afraid to make the tough call to put the brakes on spending, analysts say.""They pulled back spending more than others did at a time when oil prices fell back,"" Youngberg said. ""They are willing to go defense when they have to, when oil falls, then switch back into offense pretty quickly.""Unlike its peers, EOG reduced production during the downturn three years ago, when other companies tried to keep production flat or grow slightly.Over the past year, Wall Street's appetite for increases in production at all costs has slowed. Now investors are looking for companies to focus on returning cash to shareholders rather than drilling to keep production up.In its first-quarter report, the company reiterated its 2018 oil production growth target of 16%-20%. It also backed its forecast for a full-year exploration-and-development budget of $5.4 billion-$5.8 billion, after raising it by $1 billion the previous quarter.The company plans to increase its dividend growth rate. And it has small overseas operations in Canada, China, the U.K., Trinidad and Tobago. But EOG is unlikely to commit a lot of capital to any mergers or acquisitions. Instead, management is focused on boosting organic operations.EOG's second-quarter earnings are seen soaring 1,400% to $1.20 per share, up from eight cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Revenue is seen rising 45.8% to $3.79 billion.The company isn't immune to all headwinds, however. Meats says he's bearish on long-term oil prices despite supply constraints out of Libya, Venezuela and Iran currently boosting crude futures.He only expects a supply crunch in the short term and believes oil prices will stay around $55 per barrel in the long term.""EOG is a high-quality company with good asset quality,"" Meats said. ""But I think like every other shale company, the potential for lower oil prices weighs on validation.""Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Energy Stocks And Industry NewsWhy The Next Oil Bonanza Could Be Deep Under Water

Volume ran nearly 10% higher vs. Wednesday on the Nasdaq and fell nearly 5% on the NYSE, according to preliminary data.Among the FAANG plays, Netflix (NFLX) cooled off with a 1.2% decline to 413.50 in trading that boosted 43% above usual levels. Yet the stock holds a comfortable cushion above its rising 50-day moving average. The Leaderboard member is up 115% year to date. The four other FAANG techs advanced 1.5% to 2.4%.Apple (AAPL), up 1.7% to 191.11, has now risen 6.7% past a 179.04 proper buy point in a seven-week double bottom.Meanwhile, enterprise software companies firmed up their leadership role with more gains. Two top names in HR, finance and payroll management, Workday (WDAY) and Paycom Software (PAYC), advanced more than 4% and 3%, respectively. Paycom's turnover came in 9% below its 50-day average. But it was also the highest in more than two weeks.Workday joined the IBD Leaderboard as the 10th current stock in the hand-selected list of top growth companies. It triggered an aggressive entry point in a Shakeout+3 pattern. Workday also has been forming a double-bottom base, one of the eight bullish patterns that every growth investor needs to know to time their buys in the strongest market leaders.More than 2.6 million Workday shares exchanged hands on Thursday, 38% above its 50-day average.In general, seek out those highly rated stocks that form solid bases, then break out past a proper entry in volume at least 40% above average. Huge volume on the breakout day boosts the chance that a growth investor will make money in a relatively short period of time. Sometimes, however, big volume can arrive in the days after a breakout.The Nasdaq 100, tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that all-electronic exchange, rose 1.5%. Within the FAANG names, Alphabet (GOOGL) rallied 2.6% to 1201 and notched a new all-time closing high.The stock is close to surpassing a new handle on its nearly six-month chart pattern, a bullish double bottom. The double bottom features two sell-offs, and the second low must undercut the first low. If no handle forms, the typical buy point is 10 cents above the middle peak in between the two lows.While the Google search engine, AI and self-driving-car company has not been seeing the triple-digit growth that it once enjoyed soon after its 2004 IPO, it's still showing solid growth as a megacap company.In 2017, Alphabet grew profit by 29% to $35.90 a share as revenue rose 23% to $110.86 billion, eclipsing the $100 billion level for the first time.The Street sees earnings climbing 23% to $44.28 a share in 2019.Revenue has jumped 21%, 20%, 22%, 22%, 21%, 24%, 24% and 26% vs. year-ago levels in the past eight quarters.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Alphabet earns a top-notch A for SMR Rating, which stands for Sales + Profit margins + Return on equity.Alphabet is highlighted in today's IBD Stock Of The Day feature.Workday joined the Leaders list of Leaderboard as it moved further past an aggressive entry of 160.9The daily and weekly charts of Leaderboard names are annotated by senior markets writers to flag critical buy points, timely sell signals, and instances of chart action that indicate unusual strength.Fellow enterprise software names ServiceNow (NOW), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Ultimate Software (ULTI) gained 4%, 2%, and 1.3%, respectively.Software continues to rank as the No. 1 sector among 33 tracked by IBD for mid- to long-term performance. See the full rankings in IBD's NYSE and Nasdaq stock tables.Ultimate Software corrected sharply for two weeks but has rebounded fiercely. Still, its latest action is too narrow to qualify as a proper cup base.The company's earnings jumped 73% to $1.30 a share in Q2, the biggest year-over-year increase in at least 18 quarters. Revenue grew 21% to $276.8 million, a quarterly best.On the downside, Broadcom (AVGO) dragged down the fabless semiconductor industry group. The large-cap designer and maker of many types of electronic chips at one point gapped down more than 18% in huge volume following news that it's buying business software firm CA (CA). Analysts reportedly criticized the decision.Broadcom ranked on the top of the ""Down in Price"" section of IBD's Stocks On The Move table. Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK), Zumiez (ZUMZ) and L Brands (LB) also dropped significantly in huge turnover. That's usually a sign of heavy institutional profit-taking or pure selling.Small caps lagged a touch on Thursday, yet remain leaders in year-to-date performance.The Russell 2000 rose just 0.4%, but at 1690 the popular small-cap index boasts a 10% gain since Jan. 1. The S&P 500, closing the session at 2798, is up 4.6%.On Friday, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey hits the wires at 10 a.m. ET.

203,ALL,"Accountability: Even before President Trump announced his pick to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court, predictions of doom and gloom were rampant.

208,ALL,"Judiciary: In federal Judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump has found yet another solid constitutional conservative for an empty seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. Contrary to the shrieking protests heard outside the Supreme Court building on Monday night, the 53-year-old Kavanaugh will be a genuine protector of Americans' rights — just as Justice Neil Gorsuch, whom Trump placed on the court last year, is.Kavanaugh, like Gorsuch, is an originalist. That's not something anyone — left, right or center, Democrat, Independent or Republican — should fear. It means that Kavanaugh, just like Gorsuch, late-Justice Antonin Scalia, Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito, will look at the Constitution first when making decisions.That is how our system was designed from the very beginning. It's not a tool for unbounded activism, as many on the left seem to feel.The Supreme Court is the sole final guardian of the Constitution, the law of our land. The Constitution, and in particular its Bill of Rights, were intended to serve as a basic list of irrevocable rights for U.S. citizens. It's not a tool for unbounded activism, as many on the left seem to feel. Any judge who doesn't take this seriously doesn't belong on the bench.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseKavanaugh does. As he said Monday night, ""My judicial philosophy is straightforward. A judge must be independent and must interpret the law, not make the law. A judge must interpret statutes as written. And a judge must interpret the Constitution as written, informed by history and tradition and precedent.""That's about as good a working definition of the originalist creed as exists.Even so, Kavanaugh is an establishment conservative. He will not push revolutionary shifts in Supreme Court decisions. After all, he's a Yale Law School grad, who has taught at Yale, Harvard and Georgetown. No doubt, he understands the political dimension of the law, having worked in George W. Bush's administration and as a staffer for Kenneth Starr's investigation of President Clinton. He clerked for Justice Kennedy, whose High Court seat he would fill, and has served as a federal judge since 2006.And, as Kavanaugh himself noted, he was actually hired to teach at Harvard by then-Harvard Law Dean Elena Kagan — now on the Supreme Court.Solid credentials.But the immediate angry and loud reaction to his nomination by Democrats and others on the left suggests Kavanaugh will have an uphill political battle to get on the court. President Trump wants a vote by October 1.Two Republican senators — Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — say they'll scrutinize Trump's nominee carefully. Both senators are ardent supporters of the Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion legal across the U.S.On the other side of the aisle, last year Gorsuch received votes from Democrats Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, and Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. All three are moderates elected from states that voted for Trump.But none has yet committed to vote for Kavanaugh.It should be noted that though these five votes are seen as problematic, it's also the case that all of them voted for Gorsuch — whom many agree is more judicially conservative in his leanings than Kavanaugh.Most Democrats have vowed to oppose Kavanaugh, regardless. As Trump named Kavanaugh as his pick, a parade of far-left Democrats and their followers rallied before the Supreme Court, calling for Kavanaugh's rejection.No one argues he isn't qualified. They just don't like his decisions. Or really, any conservative's decisions, whatever they are.Indeed, as the leftist Women's March group showed in their tweeted release, it didn't matter who Trump named. It read thusly: ""In response to the president's nomination of XX to the Supreme Court of the United States, The Women's March released the following: ""Yes, that ""XX"" is an awful judge. Truth is, they didn't need to wait.Nor did NPR's way-left Supreme Court correspondent, Nina Totenberg, who said, quoting the rock group REM, ""this is the end of the world as we know it."" Problem is, she said that nearly two weeks before she knew who the nominee was.We've been here before. Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas, both conservative jurists, were vilified, slandered and attacked publicly for the crime of being Republican nominees to the court. Only Thomas made it on, and just barely. In one of the great injustices of the Senate approval process, Democrats and their organized far-left media mob forced Bork, one of the best-qualified nominees in history to the court, to withdraw after a sickening campaign of defamation and character assassination.In short, the Democratic left politicized the selection of court justices as never before, nearly ruining two decent men. For Democrats and others on the left, it's a legacy  of lasting shame.Democrats say there's ""too much at stake"" with midterm elections coming up to approve of Kavanaugh. But we remind Americans that Republicans during the 2010 midterm elections approved both liberal Sonia Sotomayor (in August, 2009) and Elena Kagan (in August 2010).Republicans didn't like either, and had profound philosophical differences with both, but didn't obstruct them, either.Compare that with Democrats today, as they throw the political equivalent of a child's temper tantrum and vow to oppose and obstruct Kavanaugh from taking a seat on the high bench. There will no doubt be verbal anger and perhaps even violence. They will accuse him of supporting back-alley abortions (a lie). They will say his decisions as a judge that limit the federal bureaucracy's regulatory reach are ""pro-corporation"" and ""anti-environment.""None of that is true. He's neither ""pro-corporation"" nor ""anti-environment."" He's pro-Constitution.Yes, as we noted, Kavanaugh is conservative. But he's also principled. He won't toe a party line. These days, that's all the so-called progressives and their allies in the judiciary have: A party line, one that tilts increasingly to the far left.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Justice Kennedy's First Priority: The First AmendmentGorsuch Strikes A Blow Against The Administrative StateAfter A String Of Huge Supreme Court Wins, Will Never-Trumpers Admit They Were Wrong?

216,ALL,"AT&T and Time Warner were just given the green light to merge over Americans for Limited Government's vigorous objections, but what does this mean for the everyday American?As big media consolidation continues to threaten market competition and free speech, not to mention monopolize the telecommunications industry, it has become overwhelmingly clear that the industry's biggest offender, Comcast-NBCU, needs to be reined in before they continue to wreak havoc on the marketplace.As massive media conglomerates persevere in their quest to monopolize the industry, it is important to realize what this means for alternative viewpoints in media and the already overwhelming effort to hush voices these media giants consider outside the mainstream. Differing ideas and perspectives are what make up the very fabric of this great nation, and if we're not careful with putting too much power in the hands of too few, this could all disappear.When Comcast and NBC merged in 2011, restrictions were placed upon them to keep them in check, mainly to ensure they would not treat competitors or consumers unfairly. As a distributor that would now own the rights to NBC programming, Comcast would have both the incentive and ability to withhold ""must have"" programming from other smaller distributors, or prioritize NBC programming over other local, alternative programming.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseUnder these conditions, Comcast was required to submit to arbitration should disputes arise over pricing and conditions of programming agreements. With such conditions either having already expired, or set to expire, Comcast is about to be cut loose, and an unleashed Comcast will have a long list of repercussions for consumers and competitors in the marketplace — mainly concerning their ability to discriminate, attempt to diminish American companies' and consumers' right to free speech, or even exert their newfound influence in politics.Since the Comcast-NBCU merger in 2011, they have proven time and time again that they are not beneath stifling competition or other viewpoints that may not line up with their own. In fact, not only are they not beneath it, there is ample evidence that points to Comcast repeatedly doing so.Take Bloomberg TV, for example. Comcast's conditions stipulated that they place Bloomberg programming next to MSNBC and CNBC, or other competing news channels such as Fox or CNN, in the channel lineup — yet for three years Bloomberg was blocked from the news channel neighborhood and slotted in an unfavorable spot, which negatively affected their viewership.As Comcast continually looks to get bigger and bigger, they are using their undue influence in the marketplace as a mechanism to control the entire industry — stepping on anyone who gets in their way. As they keep swallowing up their competition, they continue to have a larger, more intense grasp on the market, which can only lead to a dangerous fallout.While an individual federal court judge allowed the AT&T Time Warner merger to go through, it is likely that the issues raised about the dangers of vertical integration of media and its harmful effect on freedom of speech and market competition will be taken all the way to the Supreme Court.It is also important to note that AT&T/Time Warner were not given the go ahead to merge without the implementation of conditions that would ensure they do not force their competitors out of the market, or raise prices.Because Comcast continues to exert its dominance within the industry, essentially bullying its competitors and in turn, diluting diversity of thought, it is imperative that restrictions be reinstated.While Americans for Limited Government will continue to fight the danger to freedom that the AT&T/Time Warner style vertical integration represents, it is important that even if we lose, massive media conglomerates be held accountable and follow the rules. Even with these simple stipulations in place, Comcast had a more than difficult time complying.Freedom of speech should apply to all political viewpoints, not just the loudest voices amplified by left-leaning Comcast and their mainstream media cronies. The bottom line: the last thing this country needs is an unleashed Comcast.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

217,ALL,"The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) remains controversial, with public opinion evenly split and many Democrats campaigning on repeal. However, the Democratic critique of the tax cuts has grown increasingly incoherent.The party excoriates the ""tax cuts for the rich"" while trying to tilt them even further to the wealthy. Democrats slam the deficit effect of the tax cuts while working to worsen budget deficits.In addition, they erroneously describe the law as a ""middle-class tax hike"" while proposing policies that would truly raise middle-class taxes.Disingenuous Critique #1: ""Tax Cuts for the Rich""The most aggressive liberal complaint was that the TCJA represented a giveaway to the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. In reality, the tax cuts nudged the distribution of federal taxes in a more progressive direction.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe bottom 80% of families had previously paid 33% of all combined federal taxes, yet received 35% of the tax cuts. By contrast, the top one percent had previously paid 27% of all federal taxes, but received just 21% of the tax cuts.Since upper-income earners received a lower share of the tax cuts, their share of federal taxes paid will slightly rise.More importantly, several Democratic governors and legislatures are aggressively building loopholes to expand the TCJA's tax cuts for wealthy families.The TCJA capped the federal tax deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) at $10,000 per filer. Given that 88% of SALT benefits went to families earning over $100,000 — and half accrued to the richest five percent of taxpayers — this cap represented a straightforward way to ensure that the rich did not disproportionately benefit from the rest of the TCJA.And yet Democrat-run states such as New York, New Jersey, and California are in the process of rewriting much of their state tax codes to work around this restriction.Approaches include replacing income taxes with employer payroll taxes that would be eligible for the uncapped SALT deduction (which would also reduce lifetime Social Security benefits), and reclassifying individual state and local taxes paid as charitable contributions eligible for a federal deduction. The latter approach will likely be blocked by the IRS.Still, the intention is to cut federal taxes by nearly $650 billion over the decade if all states follow suit. The liberal Tax Policy Center calculates that 96% of the initial benefits would go to the top 20% of earners, and 57% of the benefits would go to the richest one percent. The richest one percent of New Yorkers would triple their benefits from the new tax law.It is brazen, bizarre, and dishonest to slam the TCJA as a ""tax cut for the rich"" while simultaneously trying to expand its upper-income tax cuts by a staggering $650 billion.Disingenuous Critique #2: Soaring DeficitsDuring last year's debate, liberal critics regularly attacked the immorality of passing on $1.5 trillion in new debt to future generations.However, Democratic lawmakers previously enacted legislation with a combined $5 trillion price tag under President Obama, and today are rallying around Sen. Bernie Sanders'  $32 trillion single-payer health care proposal as well as a $12 trillion federal jobs guarantee. These liberal initiatives dwarf the cost of the tax cuts.Furthermore, Senate Democrats have proposed repealing $1 trillion of the TCJA and putting those savings into new spending  (while seemingly retaining a portion of the cuts for middle- and lower-income Americans).A House bill would repeal the entire law and reprogram the savings into college financial aid. In other words, these Democrats have no problem adding $1.5 trillion in red ink — they just wish the package was more tilted towards spending.That by itself does not make Democrats weaker than Republicans on deficits — both parties support adding $1.5 trillion in debt — but it does reveal the disingenuousness of their deficit concerns.It is also noteworthy that, just seven weeks after the TCJA was signed, Democrats teamed up with Republicans on a spending deal that may cost as much as the tax cuts over the next decade.And as described above, state-level Democrats are playing tax accounting games that could reduce federal taxes by an additional $650 billion over the decade. These are not the actions of a party concerned with deficits.Disingenuous Critique #3: ""Middle Class Tax Hike""Even before the tax bills were drafted as legislation, Senate Democrat cries of ""middle-class tax hikes"" earned a brutal ""four Pinocchios"" condemnation from the Washington Post fact checker.When the final TCJA was enacted, the liberal Tax Policy Centercalculated that it will benefit 80% of families and raise taxes for just five percent — with the higher taxes disproportionately affecting the wealthiest one percent. The typical median-income family will save approximately $900 per year, while the average family will save $1,610.Despite this overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., described the tax cuts as a ""cynical one-two gut punch to the middle class"" that would ""raise their taxes."" House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,  called them ""simply theft — monumental, brazen theft — from the American middle-class and from every person who aspires to reach it.""How could anyone describe the TCJA as a middle-class tax hike? By simply ignoring the first eight years of roughly $900-per-year tax relief and focusing only on the $20 tax hike — that's six cents per day — that the median-income family will theoretically face in 2027 if Congress fails to renew the expiring portions of the law.Of course, if your best argument is that the expiration of the tax cuts would harm families, then the obvious solution is to renew them. Instead, House Democrats are rallying around legislation to repeal all of the tax cuts — including those for the middle class.Furthermore, popular liberal proposals such as single-payer health care, a federal jobs guarantee, free college, and a carbon tax would certainly require steep middle-class tax increases in order to fund the programs.Simply put, the Republicans are cutting middle-class taxes while Democrats would force them upwards.The TCJA is certainly not above criticism. Yet Democrats continue to undercut their complaints by trying to double-down on the aspects they claim to oppose the most.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:States Get A Windfall From GOP Tax Cuts, But Will They Return The Money To Taxpayers?Thanks To Tax Cuts, Companies' Overseas Profits Now Flooding Back To U.S.Turns Out, The Rich Will Pay A Bigger Share Of Income Taxes Under GOP Tax Cuts

222,ALL,"State and local governments are running one of the largest Ponzi schemes in American history.They've promised full pensions to their workers. But they aren't putting aside enough money — or generating high enough returns — to fulfill those future obligations. Soon, they'll have to cannibalize current workers' pension contributions to pay retirees. Young and middle-aged government employees will likely never receive the retirement benefits they're counting on.It's too late to prevent this crisis. But there's still time to mitigate the financial fallout — by trimming benefits, raising contributions, and transitioning younger employees to 401(k)s and other defined-contribution plans.Most importantly, it's time to recognize that government officials are too short-sighted and underqualified to manage public pensions.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFor decades, politicians have underfunded public pensions. They've decided to spend tax revenues today, rather than set them aside for future pension liabilities.For instance, between 1985 and 2012, Illinois diverted $41 billion originally earmarked for pension contributions to other priorities. Simultaneously, the state promised increasingly generous retirement benefits to employees — a pledge it had no way of keeping.Today, Illinois' five pension systems face an unfunded liability of $137 billion. Closing that shortfall would require roughly $11,000 from every state resident — including children.Illinois isn't the only offender. According to a recent estimate from the RAND Corporation, state and local government pensions are underfunded by $4 to $6 trillion.  A separate analysis by the American Legislative Exchange Council puts that funding shortfall at over $6 trillion.Governments have masked the severity of the problem by assuming their investments will generate unrealistically high returns.Consider CalPERS, the pension fund for California public-sector employees. The board predicts the fund will earn annual returns of 7% — even though it has averaged just a 4.4% annualized return over the past decade.It is extremely unlikely that CalPERS will come close to its 7% target for the foreseeable future. Asset valuations are already near record highs, which means there's little upside left before an inevitable correction.Even when governments provide adequate funding to pensions, corrupt and incompetent officials often squander it. Consider the current plight of the Dallas Police and Fire Pension fund.It lost $1.5 billion from 2013 to 2016 — largely because the chief administrator invested almost half of the fund's capital in risky private equity and real estate investments.No private pension-fund manager in his right mind would ever take such a high level of risk.The Dallas fund's administrator and several board members spent over $185,000 on extravagant travel in one year chasing risky real estate projects in Napa Valley and Hawaii — just one example of misbehavior that a watchdog group described as pervasive ""absolute corruption.""  Following the scandal, the formerly healthy pension plan was only 45% funded.Government officials have dug themselves — and the workers who trusted them — into a hole. And there's no way out. All we can do now is ease the pain.First, current retirees must tolerate a reduction in benefits. The average pension for a California public-sector worker who retires after a 30-year career is almost $69,000.If that worker started his career in his early 20s and retired in his early 50s, he could easily live long enough to earn more from pension checks than he ever made from his salary.That's not sustainable. It's better to take a haircut now — rather than let pension funds implode and leave retirees with nothing.Second, taxpayers ought to demand that their state and local governments set aside a greater portion of tax revenue for pension contributions. Too often, governments underfund pensions one year and falsely promise to make up the contributions at a later date.Third, the public sector must transition younger employees into defined-contribution retirement plans, such as the 401(k)s common in the private sector. These plans allow employees to manage their own retirement funds, instead of depending on a government pension check that may never come.These reforms will help — but in all likelihood, the federal government will still have to bail out many pension funds. When that happens, taxpayers should kick public officials out of the pension business.After all, these officials have turned pension funds into giant Ponzi schemes.

231,ALL,"Trade: First, President Trump hit China, Canada, Mexico and the EU with trade tariffs. Now, the world is hitting back. Will a burgeoning trade war with our closest trading partners be the undoing of global free trade and Trump's own domestic agenda? Don't count on it.Here's the action so far: President Trump already slapped 10% to 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel imports. In retaliation, Canada has hit U.S. imports with an estimated $12.6 billion in tariffs in retaliation.Next, some $50 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods are set to go into effect later this week, which China vows will not go unanswered.Meanwhile, Trump is also threatening tariffs on European Union autos, a severe sore spot for the EU. It says it will levy $300 billion in tariffs on U.S. autos and other goods — that's not a misprint — if Trump's tariffs go into place.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAnd Trump has taken it even a step further. As Axios reports, the White House has even threatened to push legislation to ""blow up"" the World Trade Organization by getting rid of its two most basic rules: One, the ""Most-Favored-Nation"" principle, under which all countries in the WTO get the same tariff treatment as others; and, two, ""Bound Tariff Rates,"" under which already-negotiated tariff ceilings can't be removed unilaterally.This might sound like a lot of technical mumbo-jumbo, but it isn't. Most of the world's tradable goods come under WTO rules. Eliminating the rules overnight would be destabilizing to the world economy, to say the least. It's one of the big reasons why global financial markets have been on such a roller-coaster ride in recent months.Major U.S. companies (like Harley-Davidson), the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and even some Senate Republicans — usually allied with Trump on most issues — have issued strong denunciations of Trump's tariffs and plans to exit the WTO.But if Trump worries about the reactions from Congress and overseas, he doesn't let on. He promised explicitly to raise tariffs during his election campaign. And if Trump has shown Americans anything since entering office in January of 2017, it's that he's dead-set on keeping his promises.""Any country that devalues their currency to take unfair advantage of the United States and all of its companies that can't compete will face tariffs and taxes to stop the cheating,"" Trump said in 2016.So, yes, Trump is serious about tariffs. But what's also clear is that any extreme moves on trade can by stymied in Congress.There's already a move afoot in the Senate, led by Republicans Bob Corker and Pat Toomey and Democrat Michael Bennet to get rid of Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs. They'll stand on solid legal ground. Article 1 of the Constitution gives Congress, not the White House, power to regulate trade, including tariffs.Moreover, Congress approved of the creation of the World Trade Organization. So pulling out of the WTO or changing it beyond recognition would require Trump to win a vote in Congress.It ain't going to happen.So what's Trump's aim here? Trump isn't just tariff-happy. And he doesn't just hate the WTO to hate the WTO. There's an endgame he has in mind.So what is it? He wants nothing more than for other countries that have highly favorable trade deals through the WTO and U.S. trade agreements to level the playing field a bit. Ultimately, if the gambit works, free traders should be happy. It will actually make trade freer and fairer, rather than treating obsolete trade agreements as if they were an eternally fixed part of Mosaic law.Andy Puzder, who served as CEO of CKE Restaurants for 16 years, explained the dynamic in a recent opinion piece.""With a trade deficit over $500 billion running in their favor, we need to create incentives for our trading partners to renegotiate our current relationships,"" Puzder wrote. ""That's because nations — like people — rarely give up economic benefits they've grown used to having simply because doing so would be fair. They operate in their self-interest.""As noted, the WTO has quite effectively lowered average overall tariffs and trade barriers on many goods and services. It's been a huge success in that respect. But deals made through the WTO have also frozen in place existing unfair advantages that the U.S. agreed to give to Europe, Asia, Mexico and others to help develop their economies.It was a noble act, one for which our major trade partners give the U.S. little or no credit. Last year the U.S. had an overall goods deficit of $810 billion, an enormous amount. That was reduced to an overall deficit of about $568 billion, thanks to exports of services and high-tech. Whether free trade advocates acknowledge it or not, large swathes of the industrial Midwest got decimated by those deficits.Donald Trump promised them relief and hope. He's now keeping that promise, at least rhetorically. Whether tariffs or anything else can ever ""re-industrialize"" the Midwest is an open question.As we've written here many times, we take a back seat to no one on free trade. And we don't like tariffs. Period. They're a tax on consumers and producers. We'd like to see them all go. We believe in truly free trade.That said, highly regulated trade, with tariffs fixed to our disadvantage in semi-perpetuity, cannot be called free trade. That means we need to change past trade deals. That includes NAFTA and the many WTO trade deals that are no longer fair. Trump's doing that.In that sense, despite the anti-Trump rhetoric on trade both here and abroad, the president may in fact be doing free trade the biggest favor of all: He's taking it seriously.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:High Tariffs And Weak Dollar Are No Way To Make America Great AgainTrump Plays Dangerous Game Of Chicken With Trade TariffsWill Trump's Tariff Temptation Kill His Economic Boom?

Activist fund Elliott Management is a key investor in the Medina, Ohio, company.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX): The expert in treating cystic fibrosis rallied nearly 14% to 168.09 in volume running more than triple usual levels. The stock has now taken a serious step in forming the right side of a potential cuplike or saucer-style base.In a saucer, the decline from head to toe can be just as deep as a short cup base.

254,ALL,"European automakers led by Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), Daimler (DDAIF), Volkswagen (VLKAY) and BMW (BMWYY) steered auto stocks higher Thursday amid unconfirmed reports that Germany and the U.S. may favor a bilateral removal of auto tariffs.The CEOs of Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW met Wednesday with the U.S. ambassador to Germany to discuss American duties on imported European cars, according to Handelsblatt newspaper. Ambassador Richard Grenell reportedly proposed eliminating auto tariffs on both sides of the Atlantic.That idea may have the backing of German carmakers and the German government. It stood in sharp contrast to President Donald Trump's threat of a new 20% levy on EU car imports weeks ago, an RBC Capital Markets analyst said Thursday.""This could also ease fears of an impending trade war, which has been an overhang on the auto industry,"" RBC analyst Joseph Spak wrote. ""Further this could be an indication that the threat of higher tariffs is simply a ploy to get reduced tariffs as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross recently implied.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe news sparked a sector rebound with Fiat Chrysler stock jumping 6% in today's stock market action. Daimler stock, Volkswagen stock and BMW stock surged about 5% each. General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F), Toyota Motor (TM) and Honda Motor (HMC) rose roughly 1%. Tesla (TSLA) stock fell 0.55%, continuing to skid lower this week.The U.S. currently imposes a 2.5% tariff on EU passenger cars and 25% on imported pickups and SUVs. Meanwhile, the EU slaps a 10% tariff on imported U.S. vehicles, according to RBC Capital Markets.Since President Trump threatened a 20% levy on EU auto imports weeks ago, auto stocks have plunged, especially foreign automakers. The Trump administration argues that it seeks fair and reciprocal trade.In June, Italian-American Fiat Chrysler's stock fell 19%. Germany's Daimler and Volkswagen tanked 12% and 11%, respectively. BMW fell nearly 10% for a second straight month.GM and Ford didn't fall as much in June, but losses were heavy. GM stock fell nearly 8% while Ford stock slid 4%. Global supply chains mean that U.S.-made cars typically have a high share of foreign parts, so Trump tariffs could raise costs substantially. Also, Europe likely would retaliate.No. 2 U.S. carmaker Ford said Thursday it has no plans to hike imported Ford and Lincoln prices in China, as a potential tariff war escalates, Reuters said.China cut tariffs on all auto imports days ago.But it plans to hit back with a tit-for-tat additional 25% levy on American products, including cars, if the U.S. proceeds with tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports starting Friday.Daimler last month warned on full-year earnings, citing in part the U.S.-China trade fight.RBC's Spak also noted ""solid"" car registrations in the European Union in June, up more than 1% year over year. The region saw strong demand for gas and plug-in vehicles, while poor diesel sales weighed on the month, he said.""This highlights the accelerating shift away from diesel in Europe,"" Spak added. ""This bears monitoring for suppliers with diesel portfolios"" such as Borg Warner (BWA), Delphi Technologies (DLPH), and Tenneco (TEN).Shares of all three auto parts giants rose solidly Thursday.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

278,ALL,"For many advisors, prospecting is the lifeblood of their business. Whether they're just starting out or decades into their career, they routinely ask clients for referrals.Through email reminders or direct requests, these advisors often emphasize that the best compliment a client can give them involves referring friends or family to sign on. It's standard practice — and clients are accustomed to such entreaties.To cast a wider net, enterprising advisors raise their profile in the community. They may lead public seminars on financial topics, write a column for the local newspaper or appear on radio shows as a money expert.Through their outreach, advisors seek to attract prospects in need of financial advice. The more interested parties who call for introductory appointments, the more people these advisors can convert to clients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut some advisors blaze a different path. Rather than succeed by following the conventional playbook, they adopt unusual prospecting strategies.""I rarely ask for referrals,"" said James Hegland, an advisor in Rochester, Minn. ""Yet I get them all the time, and I don't do any advertising.""Instead, Hegland is a prodigious sender of friendly letters. He jots handwritten notes to a wide range of acquaintances, including clients, which convey admiration, support or other positive sentiments.""I'm always looking for people doing great things or attempting to do great things,"" Hegland said. ""Then I write encouraging or complimentary things to them.""Hegland keeps his letters short and sweet. And he never raises business matters or even hints that he'd like the recipient to refer others to his firm.Warmly personal notes can resonate with readers. Because writing letters is becoming less common, they stand out more.For example, Hegland wrote a congratulatory message to a client's young son who became an Eagle Scout. A few days later, the client called and told Hegland, ""This is one of the most meaningful notes my son has received.""Within weeks, Hegland gained a new client as word spread of his kind act. He says this often happens because recipients — and their families — tell others.Hegland began sending handwritten notes on a more regular basis in 2012. He estimates that he has mailed over 700 letters each year since then.When he chats with clients and others, he might inquire about their family or show interest in other aspects of their life. Their responses often trigger a follow-up note.If a client mentions that he recently took a long hike with his children, Hegland will promptly jot a note, ""I'm so proud of you for hiking five miles with your kids."" It not only shows that he listened, but also that he likes what he heard or finds it inspiring.He adds a few eye-catching touches to his letters. For starters, he writes ""personal"" on the lower corner of the envelope. He also uses stationery — and even stamps — with splashes of orange to add a distinctive flourish.""I'm very particular about all of this,"" Hegland said. ""And I never enclose a business card or anything else"" with the letter.For some advisors, prospecting and socializing go hand-in-hand. Hosting festive gatherings for clients and other guests leaves a lasting positive impression, which in turn can generate leads.Megan Jones, an advisor with AE Wealth Management in Topeka, Kan., throws an annual birthday party for all clients who turn 70-½ during the year — to celebrate the age they start taking required minimum distributions from their tax-advantaged retirement accounts. They bring their children and grandchildren and enjoy cake and refreshments.""We give them a funny cone hat to wear when they come in,"" Jones said. ""We had someone post a Facebook photo of her husband wearing the hat. Others saw it, including someone who contacted us and became a client.""To attract prospects to her firm, Jones also leads monthly ""lunch and learn"" programs in her office's conference room. Along with guest speakers, she covers a range of educational topics including estate planning, tax reform and market updates.For many advisory firms, local engagement doubles as a prospecting tool. By banding together to volunteer on a project, from providing services to the homeless to sponsoring a road race that raises funds for a nonprofit organization, advisors build their visibility while giving back to the community.At its core, prospecting flows from strong client relationships. By maintaining strong connections with clients on an ongoing basis — through periodic calls, emails and other communication — advisors reinforce their value. This in turn triggers referrals, as clients are more likely to share their positive experience with others.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Attentive Advisors Create A Comfortable Space For Clients To ShareWhen Clients Acquire Vast Wealth, Advisors Are A Priceless ResourceIf You're Going To A Conference, Get The Most Out Of Every Minute

279,ALL,"Just when the Democrat Party has gone socialist, the old line, anti-Trump, GOP Establishment is flipping out too. Two former GOP Secretaries of State, James Baker and George Shultz, have teamed up to support what they are calling a national carbon tax, which would basically be a trillion dollar national gas tax, and a new tax on electricity and all other forms of traditional energy.That would amount to a death grip on the American economy.They have formed a front to advance this mayhem called the Alliance for Market Solutions. They call this new trillion-dollar tax on working people and the middle class ""pro-growth,"" as they explain in a book, ""Carbon Tax Policy: A Conservative Dialogue on Pro-Growth Opportunities"". But there is nothing pro-growth or conservative about this burdensome, intrusive, Big Government, anti-growth tax.Before you can have a market solution, you must have a problem to solve. ""Carbon pollution"" is not a problem, because there is no such thing as carbon pollution. That term refers to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which come from burning the fossil fuels — oil, natural gas, and coal — that powered the Industrial Revolution. That economic revolution produced the sustained, long term, economic growth that created the modern world.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCO2 is a natural substance found in the environment, essential actually to the survival of all life on the planet. CO2 enables plants to grow, feeding animals, which feed other animals, including humans. Without CO2, plants would die, and so would all other life on the planet, scientifically labelled ""carbon-based life forms"".This is why CO2 can never be referred to as ""pollution.""  As CO2 emissions have increased the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, the planet has flowered with greenery that can be observed from satellites orbiting the planet. This is why very high concentrations of CO2 are pumped into actual greenhouses, to promote rapid growth of plant life.The double peer-reviewed ""Climate Change Reconsidered II,"" published by the Heartland Institute, explains, ""At the current level of 400 parts per million (that is 0.04% of the atmosphere, 4/100s of one percent, a minuscule amount), we still live in a CO2-starved world.  Atmospheric levels (of CO2) 15 times greater existed during the pre-Cambrian period (about 550 million years ago) without known adverse effects,"" such as catastrophic global warming. (emphasis added).CO2 falling below 250 parts per million is considered the starvation threshold for plant life, which would be the real catastrophe for the human race. See e.g. Princeton Physics Professor Will Happer.And as the industrial revolution's economic growth has built the modern world, billions have been lifted out of poverty. Global poverty is now slated for extinction. The middle class has been created, now spreading worldwide. Food supplies have burgeoned. Fatal diseases have been slaughtered. Human health and longevity have skyrocketed.In the movie series ""Planet of the Apes,"" stupid apes originally took over the planet from humans by cutting off the electricity supply, which they were smart enough to know was the foundation of the modern world. Now come the privileged, GOP elites who would do to American and western prosperity what OPEC boycotters did in the 1970s, by raising the price of energy.Naïve Washington ""savants"", as they have called themselves, tell us that with the gusher of revenues from the carbon tax, we can give the money right back to the people with revenue neutral rebates. We can finance income tax cuts, and roll back energy squelching regulations.But who could be silly enough to think we could run trillions of increased taxes through Washington, without seeing it eaten up with increased, wasteful, counterproductive government spending. It wouldn't even reduce the deficit. And President Trump is already rolling back energy-squelching regulations, on his way to American energy dominance, beyond just independence.We don't need to fuel the Washington bureaucracy, and further flood the Washington swamp, pouring oil on the bonfire with trillions of increased taxes paid by the middle class, the poor, and working people. That would be the true ""Bonfire of the Vanities.""Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market? Start with IBD University.

287,ALL,"Consistency has been a characteristic of the credit card stocks this year.At the start of 2018, the payment processor group was No. 34 among 197 industry groups. From there, the ranking at the start of each month has been 23 in February and then 22, 26, 45, again 45 and 39.Going into Friday's session, the credit-card group was No. 37.Two of the credit card stocks recently appeared in the Stock Spotlight screen.Mastercard (MA) is rated No. 1 in its group in Stock Checkup at Investors.com. The stock has some of the characteristics of a turnaround stock, though the negative side isn't bad enough to fit the definition.For example, annual earnings growth slowed to 11% and 7% in 2015-16. Last year, earnings growth picked up to 24%. The Street expects 38% growth this year.Pretax margin was 53.6% last year, the third highest in the past nine years. (The year 2013 was the peak at 55.1%.)The stock chart has some bullish traits. Mastercard completed a three-weeks-tight pattern June 22 and crossed above the 204.10 buy point Wednesday.

290,ALL,"Key Trump administration officials have been confronted at restaurants. Rep. Maxine Waters urged protesters to hound Trump officials at restaurants, gas stations or department stores.Progressive pundits and the liberal media almost daily think up new ways of characterizing President Trump as a Nazi, fascist, tyrant or buffoon. Celebrities openly fantasize about doing harm to Trump.What is behind the unprecedented furor?Just as Barack Obama was not a centrist, neither is Trump. Obama promised to fundamentally transform the United States. Trump pledged to do the same and more — but in the exact opposite direction.The Trump agenda enrages the left in much the same manner that ObamaCare, the Obama tax hikes, Obama's liberal Supreme Court picks and the Iran nuclear deal goaded the right.Yet the current progressive meltdown is about more than just political differences. The outrage is mostly about power — or rather, the utter and unexpected loss of it.In 2009, Obama seemed to usher in a progressive revolution for a generation.Democrats controlled the House. They had a supermajority in the Senate. Obama had a chance to ensure a liberal majority on the Supreme Court for years.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseDemocrats had gained on Republicans at the state and local levels. The media, universities, professional sports, Hollywood and popular culture were all solidly left-wing.A Republican had not won 51% of the popular vote in a presidential election since George H.W. Bush's 1988 defeat of Democrat Michael Dukakis. Before 2016, Republicans had lost the popular vote in five of the previous six presidential elections.And then visions of a generation of progressive grandeur abruptly vanished.Obama left behind a polarized nation. Democrats lost both the House and the Senate. During Obama's tenure, Democrats lost more than 1,000 seats at the state level.Presumptive winner Hillary Clinton blew the 2016 presidential election.Foolishly, Clinton tried to ensure a landslide victory by wasting precious campaign time in unwinnable red states such as Arizona and Georgia. Meanwhile, she too often neglected winnable purple states such as Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all of which Obama had won in 2008 and 2012. Clinton apparently forgot that the Electoral College, not the popular vote, elects a president.After his election, President Trump did not implode as predicted. By following the Obama precedent of relying on executive orders, Trump began recalibrating everything from immigration enforcement to energy development.Abroad, Trump did what no other Republican president would have dared, bombing ISIS into submission, canceling the Iran deal, seeking to denuclearize North Korea, pulling out of the Paris climate accord, and moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.The U.S. economy took off with new tax cuts and deregulation. Radical improvement in unemployment, economic growth, and oil and natural gas production created new consumer and business confidence.Despite his frequent crudeness, Trump is inching toward a 50% approval rating in a few polls. That has only made an impotent opposition grow even more furious — both at the other half of the country for supporting Trump, and at a buoyant Trump himself for baiting and ridiculing progressives in the fashion of no prior president.Worse still, much of the loss of progressive power was at least partly self-inflicted.Former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid foolishly dropped the number of votes needed to overcome a filibuster for executive appointments and most judicial nominations in 2013. That blunder ensured Republicans the chance to remake the Supreme Court when they took over the Senate in 2014.Obama chose not to try to win over his opposition, but to alienate it by veering hard left in his second term. Hillary Clinton foolishly got herself into a number of personal scandals that embarrassed her party and helped lead to her defeat.In reaction to the sudden loss of political power, Democrats would have been wise to run to the center, as did Bill Clinton, who all but ended the era of the Reagan Republicans.They could have dropped their obsession with identity politics and instead attempted to win over blue-collar voters with more inclusive class appeals rather than racial appeals.Instead, Democrats have endlessly replayed the 2016 election. In Groundhog Day fashion, Hillary Clinton repeatedly offered tired excuses for her loss.To progressives, Trump became not an opponent to beaten with a better agenda, but an evil to be destroyed. Moderate Democrats were written off as dense; left-wing fringe elements were praised as clever.Voters in 2016 bristled at redistribution, open borders, bigger government and higher taxes, but progressives are now promising those voters even more of what they didn't want.Furious over the sudden and unexpected loss of power, enraged progressives have so far done almost everything to lose even more of it.And that paradox only leads to more furor.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:The Left Tries To Blame Trump For Their Own Hate MongeringTurns Out, Those Forced Union Dues Did Go To Liberal Advocacy GroupsAfter Its Hard Left Turn, Will Democratic Party Officially Admit It's Socialist?More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

293,ALL,"""There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.""
"
294,ALL,"— Donald Trump, June 13, 2018""North Korea is upgrading its nuclear research center at a rapid pace, new satellite imagery analysis suggests.""
"
295,ALL,"— The Wall Street Journal, June 27, 2018As the president prepares, if this time he does prepare, for his second summit, note all that went wrong at the first. If he does as badly in his July 16 meeting with Vladimir Putin in Finland as he did with Kim Jong Un in Singapore, the consequences could be catastrophic.An exceptionally knowledgeable student of North Korea, the American Enterprise Institute's Nicholas Eberstadt, writing in National Review (""Kim Wins in Singapore""), says the one-day meeting was for the United States ""a World Series of unforced errors."" The result was that North Korea ""walked away with a joint communiqué that read almost as if it had been drafted by the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) ministry of foreign affairs.""Kim, says Eberstadt, is ""the boss of a state-run crime cartel that a U.N. Commission of Inquiry wants to charge with crimes against humanity."" Au contraire, said America's president, who slathered Kim with praise: Kim, with whom Trump has ""a very special bond"" is a ""talented man"" who ""loves his country,"" which reciprocates with ""a great fervor."" Trump called Kim a ""very worthy negotiator,"" which might actually have made sense if Kim had been forced to negotiate for the concessions that Trump dispensed gratis.North Korea, Eberstadt says, is committed to what he calls its ""racial socialism,"" which motivates Kim's ""central and sacred mission,"" which is ""nonnegotiable"" — the unconditional reunification of the Korean Peninsula. This presupposes extermination of the South Korean state, which requires the policy Kim announced last New Year's Day — to ""mass-produce nuclear warheads and missiles and speed up their deployment."" Eberstadt:Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Such a program would not be necessary for regime legitimation, or for international military extortion, or even to ensure the regime's survival: All of those objectives could surely be satisfied with a limited nuclear force. Why then threaten the U.S. homeland?"" America is the guarantor of South Korea's security, and if Washington can be made to blink at a time and place of Pyongyang's choosing, the U.S.-South Korea alliance will end, as will the U.S. security presence there. Hence the delusional nature of Trump's belief: One one-day meeting sufficed to cause the North Korean regime to abandon its raison d'être.In addition to the legitimation supplied to Pyongyang by the pageantry of the summit for which Trump obviously hungered, the official record of the Singapore deliberations reveals no U.S. interest in Pyongyang's atrocious human rights practices (""unparalleled in the modern world,"" Eberstadt says) that raise doubts about the fervor with which North Koreans appreciate Dear Leader's love for them. In return for Trump's promise to halt military-readiness operations, Kim gave nothing — no inventory of his nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, nothing beyond North Korea's decades-old commitment to ""denuclearization"" of the Korean Peninsula, an opaque goal that means only that Pyongyang is not clearly committed to anything — beyond a pre-summit promise to decommission a no-longer-useable nuclear test site. The New Year's Day vow has not been disavowed.Singapore was, Eberstadt believes, probably the greatest diplomatic coup for North Korea since 1950, and a milestone on ""the DPRK's road to establishing itself as a permanent nuclear power."" And the sanctions that were the Trump administration's strategy of ""maximum pressure"" will be difficult to maintain now that a ""defanged"" — Eberstadt's description — Trump has declared the nuclear threat banished.The most dangerous moment of the Trump presidency will arrive when he who is constantly gnawed by insecurities and the fear of not seeming what he is not (""strong""), realizes how weak and childish he seems to all who cast a cool eye on Singapore's aftermath. The danger is of him lashing out in wounded vanity. Meanwhile, this innocent abroad is strutting toward a meeting with the cold-eyed Russian who is continuing to dismantle Europe's geographically largest nation, Ukraine. He is likely looking ahead to ratcheting up pressure on one of three small nations, Lithuania, Latvia or Estonia, each a member of the NATO alliance that, for the first time in its 69 years, is dealing with a U.S. president who evinces no admiration for what it has accomplished, or any understanding of its revived importance as the hard man in Moscow, who can sniff softness, relishes what Singapore revealed.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

It hit an all-time high of 182.45 on June 22.Spotify will have a hard time differentiating itself from rivals such as Apple (AAPL) Music because it offers the same catalog of songs, Helfstein said. It also has limited leverage with the music labels to negotiate for better terms that could improve its profitability, he said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe big three music labels are Vivendi's (VIVHY) Universal Music Group, the Sony Music Entertainment division of Japanese conglomerate Sony (SNE), and Warner Music Group, a division of privately held Access Industries. They, along with Merlin, a representative of many independent labels, control access to most music today with a catalog of 35 million tracks.Spotify is the leader in subscription-streaming music services today, but the relationship between scale and success is not as well defined in the sector as it is in other internet businesses, he said.Scale has translated to market dominance for firms such as Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Airbnb, he said.""Their leadership is a positive feedback loop as content/product availability increases proportionally to consumer demand,"" Helfstein said. ""We see no such force in music streaming because supply has no relationship to demand.""The music streaming market ultimately will be shared by a few scaled players, he said. Some like Amazon, Apple and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google have other businesses that can create cross-selling opportunities using music services.Spotify ended the March quarter with 75 million paying subscribers. It also had 99 million monthly active users of its free, ad-supported service in the first quarter.Oppenheimer predicts that Spotify can reach 218 million paying subscribers by 2024.

Neither the U.S. economy, Europe's economy nor China's economy is likely to benefit.Yet, there's another angle to President Trump's trade war with China. Many U.S. businesses have been in a quiet trade war with China for years.Credit-card companies, such as Mastercard (MA), would love to have full access to China's gigantic consumer market. But China's foot-dragging resistance has made access difficult.In its latest 10-K report, Mastercard noted that in 2017, China's central bank issued ""more guidance and clarity in addition to the 2016 regulations on license application and operational requirements for network operators.""

Yet implementation has been slow.About a year ago, Reuters reported that Mastercard and other major credit cards were preparing to submit license requests to operate in China. Reuters said the regulatory hurdles in China could take two more years to clear.What does all this mean to stock market investors? So far, very little.If China eventually opens its credit-card markets in full, the opportunity would be tremendous for Mastercard (and its major rival Visa (V)).Meanwhile, investors should take the short-term view. Judge the stock on what Mastercard is earning now, not what might happen later.Last year, Mastercard grew earnings 24%, its best annual performance in six years. The Street expects earnings to leap 39%, which would be its best gain in 10 years.Mastercard's stock chart looks promising. The stock cleared a 183.83 buy point in a flat-base pattern in May. Now the stock is consolidating above its 10-week line.In the meantime, Trump has characterized the trade game with China as a sucker's game, with the U.S. being the suckers. Consider this: As the major payment processors have struggled to get full access to China's market, China's UnionPay has expanded its reach to 162 countries.Regardless of what an investor thinks of Trump, he's nailed China's stance for what it is: Free trade for me but not for thee.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:ObamaCare Just Exploded: What It MeansThe IPO Marijuana StockWhy A Failed Breakout Isn't Always A FailureIBD Stock Of The DayThe Latest Inside Investor's Corner

You just have to ask them.These newcomers realize that they don't know it all. As much as they welcome supportive guidance from veteran advisors, they may chafe if treated with bossy condescension.""Mentoring young planners using encouragement and trust will breed confidence,"" said Jeff Realejo, a 25-year-old certified financial planner in Pompano Beach, Fla. That's better than telling them what to do and how to do it.For example, asking, ""Why don't you try this?"" is more effective than declaring, ""You should do it this way."" Granting them the autonomy to make their own decisions — and learn their own lessons — contributes to a richer, more rewarding work environment.If you've developed a well-oiled machine after decades of building a successful practice, you may figure there's no reason to alter a winning formula. But fledgling planners may offer useful suggestions to stay one step ahead as you navigate your business into an uncertain future.""The pace of change is rising rapidly, especially if you want to attract younger clients,"" said Ashley Foster, a certified financial planner in Houston. ""If you've been doing something for 30 years and it has been working for you, you may not want to change. But change will pass you by whether you like it or not.""An increasing number of millennial clients — born in the 1980s and early 1990s — prefer to interact online.

He cites advances in customer relationship management (CRM) platforms.""A lot of advisors either use Microsoft Office/Outlook as a CRM or nothing at all,"" he said. ""It may have worked for them in the past, but today there are many customizable CRM solutions built specifically for financial planners to help them increase productivity.""Misconceptions abound about integrating cutting-edge technology.

Providing ongoing constructive feedback on their performance and affording them ample pathways to learn and grow on the job will solidify your relationship with them.""The younger generation is more focused on values than dollar signs,"" Casarez said.

339,ALL,"Corporate Correctness: Starbucks won raves from environmentalists for its ban on straws. But while a strawless Starbucks won't do anything to help the environment, it will discriminate against the disabled. Virtue signaling can be a tricky business.Under pressure from environmentalists, the coffee giant says that it will replace plastic straws with sippy-cup style lids at all of its stores by 2020. The company isn't the first to do so, although it is the biggest. Hilton and Marriott hotels said they're removing plastic straws at many of their hotels. American Airlines said it will get rid of plastic straws starting this November. Various cities have or plan to impose bans.Why have straws become the bête noire of the green lobby and progressive CEOs? Because some straws end up in the ocean.We'll concede that polluting the oceans with plastic is bad. But environmentalists aggressively pushing this straw ban are using phony statistics while ignoring the real problem.Almost every story on banning plastic straws cites the same statistic — that Americans use 500 million straws a day — which is based on a 9-year-old's ""research"" project he did in 2011. (A more reliable estimate is 175 million.)Whatever the number, straw bans in the U.S. will have virtually no impact on the world's plastic pollution problem. Not only do straws represent a tiny portion of plastic waste that ends up in the ocean, but the U.S. itself accounts for less than 1% of the marine plastic in the world's oceans, according to a 2015 study published in the journal Science. Europe's coastal countries, by contrast, account for almost 3%.Just five countries — China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Sri Lanka — are responsible for more than half of the plastic entering the ocean each year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThat's because, unlike those other countries, the U.S. has better waste management systems in place — which keeps most of our trash in landfills or recycling centers, and out of the oceans. The Science study notes that just 2% of the waste in the U.S. is ""mismanaged,"" compared with 76% in China, 90% in North Korea, 88% in Vietnam, and 87% in India.Another study, published in Environmental Science & Technology late last year, found that the Yangtze River alone dumps 1.5 million metric tons of plastic into the ocean a year — roughly 19% of the world's annual total.Given these realities, eliminating straws from a few hotels and Starbucks chains won't even amount to, pardon the expression, a drop in the ocean.What's more, Starbucks will likely end up using more plastic after the ban than before.According to Reason magazine's Christian Britschgi, the replacement lid Starbucks is likely to use contains up to 15% more plastic by weight than the current lid-and-straw combo. Starbucks, he reports, did not address, nor did it dispute, that its transition to strawless lids would increase its overall plastic consumption.But while Starbucks' ban will do nothing for the environment, it will bring harm to the disabled community, who have been speaking out more aggressively against straw bans.""Plastic straws are an accessible way for people with certain disabilities to consume food and drinks, and it seems the blanket bans are not taking into account that they need straws and also that plastic straw replacements are not accessible to people."" Katherine Carroll, policy analyst at the Rochester, New York-based Center for Disability Rights, told Time magazine.Karin Hitselberger, a disability advocate in Washington, D.C., writes in the Washington Post that she and other ""people with a huge range of disabilities depend on plastic straws to access beverages and the very water they need to survive: cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy and multiple sclerosis, among many others.""""For so many people with disabilities,"" she goes on, ""something as mundane as a straw represents independence and freedom. And the conversation around their environmental impact, without consideration of who uses straws and why, demonstrates how people with disabilities are often forgotten.""So, congratulations Starbucks and all the rest of the woke companies and cities now engaged in the battle against Big Straw.

341,ALL,"American Airlines (AAL) on Wednesday cut its second-quarter unit revenue outlook on weaker domestic pricing power on airfares. The announcement appeared to surprise Wall Street, denting airline stocks and leaving analysts searching for reasons after rising fuel costs and strong demand have given airlines more leeway to charge passengers more to fly.One analyst, in wondering about reasons for the cut, said ""most fingers are being pointed at"" competition from Southwest (LUV). Others said American's less upbeat view on unit revenue was unusual because many airlines had suggested the worst fare discounting was behind them.American Airlines said it expected second-quarter unit revenue to increase around 1%-3%, lower than an earlier outlook for a 1.5%-3.5% gain. The carrier said the cut was due to ""lower than anticipated domestic yields."" Yields measure how much money an airline can get out of passengers when they book flights.Shares of American tumbled 8% to close at 35.96 on the stock market today. The carrier's stock has been at lows not seen before the 2016 election. Airline stocks this year have suffered due to higher jet-fuel costs and President Trump's trade-related provocations.Other airline stocks retreated as well. Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reports second-quarter earnings on Thursday, slipped 1.5%. United Airlines (UAL) lost 3.4%. Southwest fell 0.9%, touching its 50-day line.When fuel costs rise, investors prefer that airlines push fare costs higher. In a solid demand environment, higher fares usually translate into higher unit revenue. Unit revenue gauges how efficiently an airline operates by measuring sales in relation to an airline's overall flight coverage.""In an environment with higher fuel prices and what by all accounts seems to be very strong demand, it's curious that domestic yields would be weaker than expected,"" Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said in a research note.""We have some theories but no concrete explanation. It seems like most fingers are being pointed at American's neighbor,"" he added, referring to Southwest.American on Wednesday also said it would lose $35 million in pretax income as a result of computer-system problems at PSA Airlines, a regional airline the carrier owns, that forced the cancellation of some 3,000 flights last month. But it said costs at non-fuel units would only be up 2.5%. That's less than the 3.5% bump expected earlier, due partly to lower-than-expected maintenance costs.The Trump administration on Tuesday said it would impose tariffs on an extra $200 billion in Chinese products. U.S. tariffs targeting $34 billion worth of Chinese products took hold on Friday. Some analysts worry that a full-blown trade war could force companies to cut spending. That spending pullback, in turn, could crimp corporate travel.As airlines prepare to report second-quarter earnings this month, Wall Street will be focused on how carriers can counterbalance rising fuel prices. American CEO Doug Parker said last month that customers could face rising airfare costs, as higher fuel expenses prompt carriers to pull back on the flights they offer. However, he said such a scenario was unlikely in the near term.Southwest, which reported June traffic results on Tuesday, has already pared back its full-year flight capacity. Delta could announce its own decision on how many flights it will ultimately offer for the rest of the year when it reports on Thursday.""In a rising jet fuel environment, airlines should be raising prices, and investors expect yields to show improvement to offset higher labor and fuel costs,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note. ""The increase in yields will take time, but investors did not anticipate a reduction, mostly because most airlines have indicated that a lot of the deepest discounted fares have left the system.""She said that even though American has benefited from strong demand, that demand appeared to be the product of low fares. As jet-fuel costs rise and unit revenue flags, American would likely trim its fall and winter flight schedules as well, she said.""Demand remains solid but they need to show they can overcome rising fuel costs with higher fares,"" she said.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:S&P 500 Earnings Hot, But Will Trump's Trade Wars Chill Guidance?Delta Air Lines To Make This Key Decision Over Next Month As Fuel Hits ProfitTop Airlines Issue These Warnings As Higher Fuel Prices BiteAirline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

342,ALL,"California's coffee may not necessitate a cancer warning after all.The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA), the office that oversees Proposition 65, recently issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that could effectively exempt coffee from Prop 65's onerous requirements.In OEHHA's own words: ""Exposures to Proposition 65-listed chemicals in coffee that are produced as part of and inherent in the processes of roasting coffee beans and brewing coffee pose no significant risk of cancer.""OEHHA is correct to side with science. According to the federal government's own dietary guidelines, moderate coffee consumption is not only ""(un)associated with an increased risk of major chronic diseases (e.g. cancer),"" but it can actually be incorporated into healthy living styles to ""maintain good health and reduce the risk of chronic disease.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe World Health Organization dropped coffee from its list of possible carcinogens two years ago, noting that moderate coffee consumption can actually lower cancer risk because coffee beans contain healthy antioxidants. As Dana Loomis, an official at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), explained at the time, ""There is less reason for concern today than there was before.""IARC's optimism is justified by the latest empirical evidence. Most recently, two studies published in the Annals of Internal Medicine tracked the coffee intake of more than 600,000 individuals over 16 years. Researchers concluded that coffee drinkers experience lower risk of death from heart disease, respiratory disease, diabetes, stroke, and — you guessed it — even cancer.Coffee remains on Prop 65's list of flagged substances because of acrylamide, a flavorless chemical naturally produced when coffee beans are roasted. Although mega-doses of acrylamide have been linked to cancer in rodents, the National Cancer Institute has found ""no consistent evidence that dietary acrylamide exposure is associated with the risk of any type of cancer"" in human beings.The fact that coffee remains on the target list — in the face of overwhelming evidence — is a testament to Prop 65's longstanding overreach. The law requires warnings for nearly 900 individual chemicals, many of which arguably have no demonstrable link to cancer. Indeed, the American Cancer Society notes that ""not every compound labeled as a possible cancer-causing substance has been proven to the worldwide scientific community to actually cause cancer.""Prop 65 warning signs would impose onerous labeling requirements on small and large businesses that are located in both California and across our country, who supply coffee to California businesses, their customers, and workers. Mandated warning signage also leaves them vulnerable to frivolous lawsuits, which eventually raises costs for the end consumer.The financial fallout from a Prop 65 violation ranges from $2,500 a day per violation — such as improper warning notices — to product recalls and the payment of plaintiff's attorney fees. Since the law's inception in 1986, roughly 20,000 Prop 65-related lawsuits have been filed against small businesses, which have been forced to pay out more than $500 million in settlements.This diverts resources to court dates and legal fees, when they should be spent powering Californians with freshly brewed coffee, as well as creating jobs and more inspiring, productive work environments.Prop 65 threatens California's entire convenience services industry, whose vendors bring coffee — as well as tea, water, fresh food, and more — to employers and employees throughout the Golden State. In California, the convenience services industry delivers well over $700 million in total economic impact, employing more than 3,600 service operators, machine manufacturers, and brokers whom would be negatively impacted by an overreach of Prop 65 into coffee regulation.Why hassle employers with Prop 65 regulations that have no basis in science?If anything, warning labels on coffee beans desensitize Californians to the real health risks posed by other substances. As the Los Angeles Times editorial board recently concluded: ""The measure is so broad, its warnings may actually make it harder for Californians to assess the real dangers they encounter.""OEHHA should move forward with relieving coffee of its Prop 65 burden once and for all. Protect us from actual carcinogens, and leave consumers' coffee alone.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

351,ALL,"The Allstate Corporation (ALL  -  Free Report) recently announced estimated pretax catastrophe loss of about $593 million or $385 million after tax for August 2017. Estimated gross catastrophe losses, excluding homeowners’ flood, are $576 million, stemming from Hurricane Harvey.The company expects reinsurance recoveries to reduce the number by $23 million. About 55% of the catastrophe losses were related to auto coverage. Allstate added that about $53 million estimated losses and expenses from commercial insurance, auto-protection contracts and loss-adjusting expenses were not covered by reinsurance.Allstate is yet to estimate catastrophe loss from Hurricane Irma that hit regions spanning Caribbean to Florida in September. In July 2017, Allstate had estimated to have incurred pretax catastrophe losses of $181 million or $118 million after tax attributable to 13 catastrophic events that took place in June. Taking that into account, the company’s total estimates are $774 million pretax and $503 million after tax for the last two months.Recently, The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) also projected its pretax catastrophe loss between $375 million and $750 million or $245 million and $490 million after tax from Hurricane Harvey. Even Assurant, Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) has projected pretax catastrophe losses between $134 million and $140 million attributable to Hurricane Harvey and expects gross losses from Hurricane Irma to exceed its retention of $125 million pre-tax. HCI Group, Inc. (HCI  -  Free Report) has calculated possible losses between $100 million and $300 million owing to Hurricane Irma.Being a property and casualty insurer, Allstate is exposed to catastrophic events. These have weighed on the company’s claims and benefits, expenses, and cash flow, draining its underwriting profitability. However, the company is making efforts to lower losses through its catastrophe management strategy and reinsurance programs. It is also limiting exposure to riskier geographic markets by raising premiums. This may lead to a decline in the number of policies in force.Zacks Rank & Share Price Impact The Allstate carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Its shares have outperformed the industry in a year’s time. While Allstate’s shares have gained 32.4%, the industry has registered an increase of 26.3%.

352,ALL,"Property and casualty insurer The Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report) expects to incur catastrophe (cat) loss of $593 million pretax ($385 million after tax) for the month of August 2017.The loss may be attributed to six events from Hurricane Harvey. While these losses will cost $591 million pretax, the company expects to incur the remaining $2 million from the prior-period adverse reserve reestimate.Allstate also expects to incur nearly $181 million, pre-tax ($118 million after-tax), in estimated catastrophe losses for the month of July 2017.Catastrophes are an inherent risk of the company that have and will continue to result in material year-to-year fluctuations in its results and financial position. In the first six months of 2017, Allstate incurred cat loss of $1.75 billion, down 2.2% year over year.The company might incur additional loss from hurricane Irma that occurred this month.In order to mitigate weather-related losses, Allstate is focusing on catastrophe management strategy and reinsurance programs. Despite these efforts, we cannot rule out the possibility of losses from catastrophes and severe weather incidents, going forward.Nevertheless, shares of Allstate have been rising steadily year to date, generating returns of 22%, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 10.7%.The outperformance reflects optimism surrounding the stock from initiatives taken by the company such as profit-improvement plans in its auto business, which suffered high auto claims for the past many quarters. Efforts to diversify its business and product offerings at a time when some of its business lines are subjects of friction have also been viewed favorably by investors.  There seems no end to woes and mass devastation as parts of the United States continue to be rampaged by a host of Hurricanes hitting one after another. While Harvey rocked Houston and Texas Gulf Coast, Irma ran amok in regions across Caribbean to Florida. Both storms are considered the costliest in a decade. No sooner the country had heaved a sigh of relief, with Hurricane Jose not turning not as destructive, another hurricane, Maria, hit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Maria is already deemed to a Category 5 storm.Economic losses from Irma are estimated at about $58-$83 billion while the same from Harvey could be as high as $108 billion by Moody’s Analytics. Loss counts are yet to come for the damages caused by Maria. The only good news is that Irma’s impact is projected to be lower than anticipated.Insurers have already started releasing loss estimates. Assurant Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) has estimated between $134 million and $140 million pre-tax of reportable catastrophe losses from Harvey and expects gross losses from Irma to exceed its retention of $125 million pretax.The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) estimates pre-tax catastrophe loss from Hurricane Harvey between $375 million and $750 million or $245 million and $490 million after tax. HCI Group, Inc.

353,ALL,"Property and casualty insurer, The Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report), has been benefiting from profit-improvement plans initiated more than two years ago. This is evident from improving margins in its auto insurance business, which accounts for nearly two-third of earned premiums.Though the company has a huge concentration of auto business, it has diversified its product suite to include homeowners, renters, commercial, life insurance and annuities. This broad product profile will work in favor of the company in the long term by providing revenue diversification.Allstate  has also taken initiatives around claims aimed at curbing loss-adjustment expenses, which will benefit its combined ratio. Some of these initiatives are QuickFoto Claim, Virtual Assist, and use of drones to take pictures of destruction at site.Its recent acquisition of SquareTrade, completed in January, has added to its total policies, along with providing business diversification.Allstate’s shares have returned 24% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of just 8%.Nevertheless, exposure to weather-related losses have always imparted volatility to the company’s earnings. Most of the fluctuations occur within its homeowners’ insurance business. The company expects to incur catastrophe loss of $181 million pretax ($118 million after tax) for the month of July 2017. Hurricane Harvey and Irma will also lead to further loss though the company has not yet quantified it.The company has, however, taken counter measures to control cat losses by purchasing reinsurance and raising premium prices. We believe that these measures will help in reducing earnings volatility and be catalysts to shares.Allstate carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked players in the space are Atlas Financial Holdings, Inc. (AFH  -  Free Report), Markel Corporation (MKL  -  Free Report) and Mercury General Corporation (MCY  -  Free Report).

354,ALL,"On Thursday, Hurricane Irma continued its path of destruction through the Caribbean after hitting Barbuda, St. Barthélemy, St. Martin, Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands, as well as the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico yesterday.Many industries have felt the impact of Irma already, and the storm has yet to make landfall here in the United States.According to the National Weather Service, the storm is projected to hit the central Bahamas by Friday, and then make landfall near Miami, Florida by Sunday morning as a Category 4 hurricane, “bringing high winds, abundant rainfall and potentially dangerous storm surge.”From the greater travel industry to airlines and restaurants, companies that have broad exposure to Florida have seen their shares slide on anticipation of Irma’s impending arrival.

355,ALL,"e massive trail of destruction in Houston and Texas Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Harvey has left insurers feeling jittery in the fear of high claim costs. While its too early to estimate the loss incurred due to the calamity, one of JPMorgan analyst’s anticipates potential losses to range anywhere from $10-$20 billion.Harvey, which went from a tropical storm to a Category 4 hurricane, is expected to be among the top 10 financially damaging catastrophes ever to strike the United States.Is There a Silver Lining to the Cloud?On the face of it, catastrophe losses cause a spike in loss ratio and hurt insurer's underwriting margins. However, these losses act as catalysts in turning the industry's pricing cycle. Notably, insurance industry is highly cyclical in nature, and is characterized by periods of soft and hard pricing phases.Major events like Harvey are required by the industry now to turn the pricing cycle. A benign cat loss environment in the recent years fattened the capital reserves of the insurers resulting in the loosening of underwriting standards as insurers equipped with huge cash did not mind undertaking risky businesses at low prices. This heightened competition and insurers were compelled to lower prices further to attract more business. Eventually, pricing woes crept up, as evident by the continued soft pricing in many insurance business lines.Though the industry suffered a cat loss of $21.6 billion in 2016, it was only a modest increase compared with the 10-year average of $19.1 billion.A recent report by Swiss Re states that global insured losses from disasters plunged to $23 billion in the first half of 2017 from $36 billion in the year-ago period.Lower levels of claims from natural catastrophes and other disasters suppressed demand for insurance against such events, consequently putting pressure on premiums.Further, a report from insurance broker Marsh stated that global insurance rates fell for the 17th consecutive quarter, with property insurance rates down 2.8%.In a recent fact release, the Information Insurance Institute stated that the private insurance industry will easily able to handle losses from Harvey As of Mar 31, 2017, the U.S. property/casualty industry has $709 billion of capital, a cushion that is more than adequate to deal with events like the one mentioned above.Nevertheless, the industry has outperformed the broader market in last two years, evident from a return of 32% compared with the S&P 500’s gain of 24%. Insurance Stocks in FocusCompanies such as Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report), and Progressive Corp.

356,ALL,"Benchmarks turned in a mixed performance on Monday as markets digested the impact of Hurricane Harvey. Energy shares declined after the hurricane disrupted oil refineries in the coastal areas of Texas, rendering them dysfunctional. Meanwhile, the oil prices also declined, weighing further on energy shares. The tropical storm caused widespread destruction of property on the southern coast of U.S., leading to losses for commercial insurers and reinsurers. This led to a decline in shares of insurance companies such as Travelers which weighed heavily on the Dow as the blue-chip index ended in the negative territory. The S&P 500 ended in the positive territory buoyed by gains for healthcare and tech stocks. The healthcare stocks gained because of merger deals. The Nasdaq also finished in the green due to gains in tech and biotech shares.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,808.40, declining 0.1% or 5.27 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 1.19 points to close at 2,444.24. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,283.02, rising 17.37 points or 0.3%. A total of only around 5.13 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6 billion shares. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1.14-to-1 ratio.  On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 1.02-to-1 ratio.Hurricane Harvey Weighs on Energy SharesEnergy shares were impacted after tropical Hurricane Harvey, hit the coast of Texas, rendering oil refineries in the area dysfunctional. Harvey is by far the most powerful hurricane to have hit the southern coast of U.S. in the last 50 years, delivering about 30 inches of rain in Houston and leaving it flooded over the weekend. Conditions could worsen if engineers released water from overflowing reservoirs in order to safeguard the dams.  The coast of Texas houses approximately 30% of the total refining capacity of the U.S. and Houston alone hosts 15% of the total capacity. The shutting down of major oil refineries in and around Houston has impacted almost 15% of the nation’s total refining capacity. Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) closed its Baytown refinery and Dutch Shell  shut its Deer Park facility after the storm pummeled Texas. This disruption led to a decline in the energy shares. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) was down 0.5%. Shares of Exxon, Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) and Chesapeake Energy (CHK  -  Free Report) declined 0.4%, 0.4% and 3.7% respectively due to shutdown of refining operations.Oil prices also declined on Monday. West Texas Immediate oil futures dipped 2.7% to $46.57 a barrel. Also, United States Oil Fund plummeted 2.3%. Economists said that it would take weeks before the refineries became fully functional and therefore the demand for oil by refineries would be low. This led to a decline in West Texas oil futures. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement announced on Sunday that a total of 331,370 barrels a day equivalent of crude-oil production was affected after the hurricane’s landfall.Insurance Sector Battered by HarveyInsurance stocks also declined after the destruction caused by Harvey. Current estimates place the estimated damage at around $30 billion and analysts expect it to be one of the costliest storms in the history of the U.S. In case of such natural calamities, insurance shares are sent lower due to high number of claim payouts.As a result, shares of top American insurance companies like Travelers Companies Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report), Allstate Corp (ALL  -  Free Report) and Progressive Corp (PGR  -  Free Report) all declined 2.5%, 1.4% and 2.2% on Monday.  The SPDR S&P Insurance exchange-traded fund (KIE) dipped almost 1%, posting its worst day since April 28, 2017. Declining shares of Travelers weighed the heaviest on the Dow.Stocks That Made HeadlinesMotorola Solutions Closes Kodiak Buyout, Expands PortfolioMotorola Solutions (MSI  -  Free Report) completed the acquisition of the privately held Kodiak Networks in a bid to broaden its software product portfolio.(Read More)Abercrombie Further Expands Footprint in the Middle EastAmid a highly challenging retail landscape, Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF  -  Free Report) continues to strengthen its footprint, which in turn, boosts its overall performance in second-quarter fiscal 2017 results.

357,ALL,"The untold damage and misery caused by Hurricane Harvey is not just being felt by the residents of Texas. Markets were also singed by the tropical cyclone on Monday, with energy and financials bearing the brunt of the pain. Stocks of energy companies suffered after key refineries in Texas had to close due to widespread flooding. But losses for insurers were possibly the most alarming, with the iShares U.S. Insurance ETF losing 1%.This was possibly a reaction to the enormous level of claims likely to be generated in the aftermath of this disaster. However, industry watchers think that the industry has the ability to absorb resulting losses and may even gain in the months ahead via higher rates. Adding select property and casualty insurers to your portfolio makes for a prudent option at this point.Insurers Possess Sufficient Capital Market watchers believe that insurers and reinsurers possess sufficient capital reserves to withstand the losses incurred by Hurricane Harvey. The damage generated by this Category 4 storm is yet to be correctly estimated. However, it is the fiercest hurricane to impact Texas since 2008. Even now, continuous rainfall is flooding the affected areas of the state. Current projections are that the hurricane may cost the U.S. nearly $30 billion.However, insurers serving individuals and businesses currently sport appreciably high levels of capital. Additionally, they do not require such funds to back existing obligations. Given such a state of affairs, Hurricane Harvey is unlikely to dent insurers’ financial position. At most, insurers with business concentrated in the storm-affected areas would experience a fall in quarterly earnings.Gains Likely in Months AheadIn 2005, insurers had suffered losses in the immediate fallout of Hurricane Katrina. Yet, over the next three months, industry heavyweights such as Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report), The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) and The Allstate Corporation (ALL  -  Free Report) notched up heavy gains. While Progressive and Allstate shares increased 20% and 10%, respectively, shares of Chubb skyrocketed over this period, gaining 27%.A similar scenario is likely to develop this time around as well. First, analysts think that the federal government’s National Flood Insurance Program will have to bear the lion’s share of losses incurred by Hurricane Harvey. Second, insurers will once again be able to raise rates in the aftermath of a storm of such ferocity. Reinsurers will also likely benefit since over the medium term they will gain the ability to increase their insurance rates. In the aftermath of Katrina, the likes of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (MMC  -  Free Report), which is an insurance broker, notched up gains in keeping with insurers.Our ChoicesDespite initial losses, insurers should withstand the impact of Hurricane Harvey without much difficulty. Appreciably high capital reserves provide them sufficient cushion for such an eventuality.Further, they could actually move higher in the months ahead as they begin to raise rates. Investing in property and casualty insurers looks like a smart option at this point. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.

358,ALL,"Residents of southeastern Texas are bracing for the impact of Hurricane Harvey, which continues to wreak havoc on America’s fourth-largest city with heavy rainfall. The record-flood situation is likely to turn worse as the deluge is expected to continue for some days, as per Bloomberg. It is predicted to become the first storm of Category 3 or higher to hit Texas in the last 12 years.Needless to say, a catastrophe of this level is most likely to mess up citizens’ lives. With them, several effects on corporate life are likely to be noted.Energy As per Reuters, Harvey has thumped a quarter of oil production from the Gulf of Mexico and over 10% of U.S. refining capacity. The area is a major hub for oil refineries. Several energy companies have shut down their operations. The last major storm that lashed this region in 2008 was Hurricane Ike, which cost the refining industry roughly $30 billion.This sparked off concerns about oversupply situation in the U.S. Lower demand from refineries is likely to pressure crude oil prices and ETFs like United States Oil Fund LP (USO  -  Free Report). Oil exploration ETF like The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE  -  Free Report) this may lose ahead due to lack of activity.However, demand for finished product gasoline should rise. Gasoline futures on Monday jumped to a two-year high level, which should benefit United States Gasoline Fund (UGA  -  Free Report).  The difference in the price of crude oil for October delivery and Nymex gasoline futures for September — the ""crack spread"" — doubled to about $24 on Friday, as per an article published on CNBC. This should benefit VanEck Vectors Oil Refiners ETF (CRAK  -  Free Report) (read: 4 Sector ETFs Winning on Revenue Growth).Insurance Severe destruction is likely after Harvey’s passage as flooding in Texas may be identical to that of 2005's Hurricane Katrina -- “the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history, said an insurance research group.” Insurance stocks normally fall over 1% in the month following the disaster caused by a Category 3 storm and severe flooding.John Dickson, president of NFS Edge Insurance Agency, estimates about 15% of the Houston area to be insured for flood. As a result, property and casualty insurance companies may be hit hard as these are likely to shell out handsomely on claims in such catastrophic storms.Insurance companies like Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report), The Allstate Corporation ALL, Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report) and Progressive Corp. PGR are likely to be hurt. The insurance ETF iShares Dow Jones US Insurance Fund (IAK  -  Free Report) will feel the brunt (see all Financials ETFs here).Agriculture As per Bloomberg,the rain is washing away the largest U.S. cotton producer, drenching extra supplies stored on fields by many Texas farmers. Ports like Galveston will remain closed till Harvey dies out.The Bloomberg article went on to point out that ports at the Texas Gulf make up about 24% of U.S. wheat exports, 3% of corn shipments and 2% of soybeans. Naturally, this pseudo supply crisis will likely push up crop prices, benefiting ETFs like iPath Pure Beta Cotton ETN CTNN, Teucrium Wheat Fund (WEAT  -  Free Report), Teucrium Corn ETF (CORN  -  Free Report) and Teucrium Soybean ETF (SOYB  -  Free Report). In fact, in such a heavy downpour, livestock is also at risk, which may push up iPath Pure Beta Livestock ETN LSTK (read: Should You Ride the Momentum in Grain ETFs?).Transportation Rail transportation near Houston has been delayed and massive gridlock on highways is expected. As many as 1,847 flights were canceled on Sunday at airports in Houston, Corpus Christi, San Antonio, Austin and Dallas, and an additional 1,580 were called off for Monday, according to FlightAware and quoted on Bloomberg. Naturally, transportation ETFs like SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report) and U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS  -  Free Report) may feel the pressure ahead (read: What Lies Ahead of Leisure & Travel ETFs in 2H?).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

359,ALL,"Property and casualty insurer The Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report) expects to incur catastrophe (cat) loss of $181 million pretax ($118 million after tax) for the month of July 2017.The loss may be attributed to 13 events that took place last month. While these losses will cost $151 million pretax, the company expects to incur the remaining $30 million from the prior-period adverse reserve development.Catastrophes are an inherent risk of the company that have and will continue to result in material year-to-year fluctuations in its results and financial position. In the first six months of 2017, Allstate incurred cat loss of $1.75 billion, down 2.2% year over year.In order to mitigate weather-related losses, Allstate is focusing on catastrophe management strategy and reinsurance programs. Despite these efforts, we cannot rule out the possibility of losses from catastrophes and severe weather incidents, going forward.Nevertheless, shares of Allstate have been rising steadily year to date, generating a return of 26%, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 9.6%. The outperformance reflects optimism surrounding the stock from initiatives taken by the company such as profit-improvement plans in its auto business, which suffered high auto claims for the past many quarters. Efforts to diversify its business and product offerings at a time when some of its business lines are subjects of friction have also been viewed favorably by investors.  On the face of it, catastrophe losses cause a spike in loss ratio and hurt insurer's underwriting margins. Then again, catastrophe losses act as catalysts in turning the industry's pricing cycle. (Insurance industry is highly cyclical, characterized by periods of soft and hard pricing phases).Lately, the industry amassed ample capital reserves owing to low catastrophe losses, which led to losing of underwriting standards as insurers equipped with huge cash did not mind undertaking risky businesses at low prices. This heightened competition and insurers were compelled to lower their prices further to attract more business. Eventually, pricing woes crept up, as evident by the current soft pricing in many insurance business lines.A recent report by Swiss Re states that global insured losses from disasters plunged to $23 billion in the first half of 2017 from $36 billion in the year-ago period.Lower levels of claims from natural catastrophes and other disasters suppressed demand for insurance against such events, thereby putting pressure on premiums.Also, a report from insurance broker Marsh stated that global insurance rates fell for the 17th consecutive quarter, with property insurance rates down 2.8%It remains to be seen if weather-related losses over the coming months can shrink the massive capital surplus and change the insurance pricing cycle.Allstate carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked players in the space are Atlas Financial Holdings, Inc. (AFH  -  Free Report), Markel Corporation (MKL  -  Free Report) and Mercury General Corporation (MCY  -  Free Report). Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

360,ALL,"On Aug 9, the stock of The Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week high of $94.70. The rise in the stock is believed to have been driven by strong second-quarter results, increase in share buyback authorization and expansion plans.Over the past one year, the stock has returned 28%, significantly outperforming the 8.6% gain logged by the industry and 17.6% by the S&P 500 index.Yesterday, the company announced its plans to expand in Charlotte area by creating more than 2200 jobs, over the next three years.Investors favorably viewed the company’s strong second-quarter results which beat estimates by a good 53.3% on the bottom line, driven by improved auto insurance margins and strong investment results, despite incurring losses of $993 million related to catastrophe.Its top line beat by 14.6% cemented investors’ confidence in the company’s ability to grow its premium in a tough and competitive market environment.The recent quarterly results reflected the company’s success in reaping profits on a number of growth initiatives (such as profit improvement plan in its auto business, and efforts to diversify its business and product offering) taken in last two years. In the recent past, the company suffered from huge claims in its auto business and overall premium remained under pressure due to low pricing and a competitive market.Shareholders remain impressed with the company’s financial strength and commitment to proactively manage shareholders' capital.

The most recent one was in Feb 2017 (hike of 12%).Allstate’s efforts to achieve quick growth via inorganic measures also is being viewed favorably by investors.

363,ALL,"The Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1, after market close.Last quarter, Allstate beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 57.7%. It surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 27.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q2 FlashbackAllstate’s earnings have always been exposed to catastrophe losses. The first quarter bore the brunt of cat losses and the same is expected in the second quarter. The company has provided preliminary estimates of cat loss of $638 million on a pre-tax basis, owing to weather-related destruction in April and May.In the first quarter, the company closed the acquisition of SquareTrade, a protection plan provider for consumer electronics and connected devices. Allstate previously said that the deal would dilute earnings for three years. Therefore, the effect of the same will be felt in second-quarter results.The company’s customer-focused strategy, and a wide variety of products and services sold through an extensive distribution network, will likely result in higher policies issued thus aiding top-line growth.Allstate took profit improvement initiatives, over the last two years, in its Auto insurance business. These efforts have started bearing fruit and will aid earnings in this line of business.Shares bought back by the company in the quarter under review will also add to the bottom line.Allstate Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise Allstate Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Allstate Corporation (The) QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Allstate is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

364,ALL,"The second-quarter earnings season has rolled out with 19% members of the elite S&P 500 Index reporting solid quarterly numbers so far. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the performance of 97 index members (accounting for 28.1% of index’s total market capitalization) that have already reported their financial numbers this quarter, indicate that total earnings have increased 8.4% on 5.1% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 78.4% companies surpassing the bottom-line expectations and 72.2% outperforming on the top-line front.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance so far. 53.3% of the sector’s total market cap in the S&P 500 index that have reported quarterly results shows 7.2% earnings growth on 5.4% increase in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. The beat ratio of 81.1% for the bottom line and 66.7% for the top line is higher than the beat ratio of the S&P 500.  The second quarter witnessed several catastrophe losses, which will weigh on underwriting results as well as the bottom line of insurers. Per Aon Benfield, the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc (AON  -  Free Report), catastrophe losses suffered globally is estimated at $53 billion in the first half of 2017.  Few insurers have estimated to have incurred catastrophe losses in the second quarter stemming from severe wind and hail catastrophe events occurred during April and May in the U.S.The Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report) projects $638 million in catastrophe loss while Kemper Corporation (KMPR  -  Free Report) estimates the same between $32 million and $38 million.Nonetheless, prudent underwriting standards should have helped insurers guard against a capital reserve erosion that has built up owing to a benign catastrophe environment.    Net investment income, a major component of an insurer’s top line, has witnessed improvement; albeit far lower than the historical highs. The Federal Reserve has been increasing the interest rates, reflecting their confidence in the improving economic conditions. The Fed has raised interest rate thrice in three quarters. An improving rate environment not only aided an increase in Net investment income but has also improved investment yields.Higher rates should offer some respite to life insurers that suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistently low rates. Annuity sales too should have benefited from higher rates. Nonetheless, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.Also, improving economy means more disposable income and better consumer sentiment. This in turn, is likely to have supported more policy writings, driving premiums higher, which contribute a lion’s share in an insurers’ top line.On the flip side, we do not expect pricings to have been strong. To write new business and retain renewals, insurers have been easing pricing, leading to soft pricing.  Commercial property, workers’ compensation and general liability were the once mostly experiencing soft pricing.Nonetheless, core business growth, geographic expansion, strategic buyouts and prudent capital deployment via share repurchase have benefited insurers.This week will see more than 800 companies reporting their quarterly results, including 183 S&P 500 members.Let’s find out how these four insurers might perform when they release their quarterly numbers on Jul 26.XL Group plc (XL  -  Free Report) is one of the world’s leading providers of insurance, reinsurance and financial risk solutions for enterprises and insurance companies. In the last reported quarter, XL Group beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.70%. The company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -1.12% complicate the surprise prediction.

365,ALL,"Donegal Group Inc. (DGICA  -  Free Report)  has estimated a catastrophe loss of about $20.1 million in the second quarter of 2017. The insurer projects to incur loss between 7 and 9 cents per share in the same quarter.The weather-related loss stemmed from severe wind and hail catastrophe events occurred in the second quarter. However, loss accumulations from these events did not exceed $5 million third-party catastrophe reinsurance retention of the company.  Notably, the company’s trailing five-year average for second-quarter weather-related losses is $10.5 million, far below what it expects to have incurred in second quarter of 2017.Apart from weather-related losses, Donegal Group also incurred $7.6 million of large fire losses affecting the homeowners’ line of business significantly. The figure is visibly wider than $3.7 million incurred in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter is currently pegged at a loss of 7 cents, representing the lower end of the company’s expectation. This reflects year-over-year decline of 122.58%.The company is scheduled to report its second-quarter results today (Jul 19) before the market opens. However, our proven model does not conclusively show that the company is likely to beat on earnings this time. While a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP, an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes the prediction difficult.Being an insurer, Donegal Group is exposed to several catastrophe losses that in turn weigh on the underwriting results. In the first quarter, the company was hurt by higher-than-expected weather-related losses inducing combined ratio deterioration of 750 basis points.Shares of Donegal Group have lost 14.02% year to date, underperforming the Property and Casualty Insurance industry’s gain of 5.08%. The company has also not witnessed any earnings momentum over the last 30 days.Property and casualty insurer The Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report) has estimated a catastrophe loss of $638 million during April and May. While Horace Mann Educators Corp. (HMN  -  Free Report) has estimated to incur a pre-tax catastrophe loss between $31 million and $34 million for second-quarter 2017, Kemper Corporation (KMPR  -  Free Report) has estimated to incur a pre-tax catastrophe loss between $32 million and $38 million.The insurance industry has been building its capital reserve, courtesy benign catastrophe environment.

366,ALL,"Kemper Corporation (KMPR  -  Free Report) has estimated a pre-tax catastrophe loss between $32 million and $38 million for second-quarter 2017. The losses stemmed from 15 storm events affecting underwriting results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter is currently pegged at 14 cents, which translates into year-over-year growth of 51.85%. However, we expect this estimate to move down as analysts incorporate the impact of expected catastrophe loss in their estimates.Kemper noted that the homeowners and auto lines of business were mainly affected by these catastrophe events. The insurer is not hopeful of recovering any of these losses from its catastrophe reinsurance program.Insurers The Allstate Corp (ALL  -  Free Report) and Horace Mann Educators Corp (HMN  -  Free Report) have also estimated catastrophe loss for the second quarter. While Allstate projects $638 million in catastrophe loss, Horace Mann Educators estimates pre-tax catastrophe loss between $31 million and $34 million. Moreover, Donegal Group Inc, (DGICA  -  Free Report)  announced that weather-related losses may account for $20.1 million second-quarter loss.Coming back to Kemper, since this is a property and casualty insurer, it is exposed to the vagaries of catastrophe events and prone to volatility in its underwriting results. The company also suffered due to higher catastrophe losses in the first quarter. In fact, catastrophe losses had dragged the quarter’s net income by $17.3 million. The same weighed on book value per share too. Combined ratio deteriorated 620 basis points year over year to 115%.Shares of Kemper have lost 13.88% year to date, underperforming the Property and Casualty Insurance industry’s gain of 5.71%. The company has also witnessed estimates moving south over the last 60 days.Kemper currently carries Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The company is scheduled to report second-quarter results on Aug 1. Our proven model does not conclusively show that the company is likely to beat on earnings this time. This is because a Zacks Rank #5, which lowers the predictive power of ESP, combined with an Earnings ESP of -64.29% makes prediction difficult.

367,ALL,"The curtain has already been raised for the second quarter earnings season with banks started reporting their quarterly results. The insurance industry is all set to announce its results shortly.  Underwriting results, the major indicator of profitability of any insurer, is likely to be affected. This is due to 16 severe wind and hail catastrophe events which occurred in April and May. The catastrophe losses not only have deteriorated the combined ratio but have also been a drag on the bottom line.The insurance industry has been building its capital reserve, courtesy a benign catastrophe environment. We expect some prudent underwriting standards to guard the insurers from erosion of the same.The interest rate environment has been slowly improving with Fed (Federal Reserve) raising interest rate thrice in three consecutive quarters. This reflects Fed’s confidence in the improving U.S. economy. An increased rate positively impacts the net investment income, a major component of an insurer’s top line. A broader invested asset base and alternative asset classes are other positives.Though the Property and Casualty Insurance industry is currently ranked at #229 (lies in the bottom one-third of the Zacks Industry Rank for the 252+ industries), it has outperformed the S&P 500 in the last one-year period by registering a gain of 15.64%. The index, on the other hand, climbed 13.36%.In this scenario, we focus on two leading property and casualty insurers ahead of the earnings release by the insurers. The Allstate Corporation (ALL  -  Free Report) is the second-largest property-casualty (P&C) insurer and the largest publicly-held personal lines carrier in the U.S., while  Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) is one of the world’s largest providers of property and casualty (P&C) insurance and reinsurance and the largest publicly traded P&C insurer. While Allstate has a market capitalization of $32.46 billion, Chubb has a market capitalization of $67.79 billion.Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). It will be interesting to note which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals.Some better-ranked stocks from the same industry are Progressive Corp (PGR  -  Free Report), flaunting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Everest Re Group Ltd. (RE  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Price PerformanceAllstate has outpaced the industry with its shares rallying 28.44%, whereas Chubb has underperformed the industry with merely 12.29% gain. Allstate emerges a clear winner in this round ValuationThe price to book value metric is the best multiple, used for valuing insurers. Compared with Property and Casualty Industry’s P/B ratio of 1.44, Allstate is over-priced with a reading of 1.67. Meanwhile, Chubb is much cheaper with a trailing 12-month P/B multiple of 1.38. This round goes to Chubb as Chubb’s shares are cheaper than Allstate’s.Debt-to-EquityBoth Allstate and Chubb have lower debt-to-equity versus the industry average of 32.14%. Chubb with a leverage ratio of 28.45 has an edge over Allstate with the leverage ratio of 29.99%Dividend YieldIn the last one-year period, Allstate’s dividend yield was 1.96%, while Chubb’s was 1.66%.  Both have a dividend yield that outpaces the industry’s average of 0.50%.  On a comparative basis, Allstate has an edge over Chubb.Earnings Surprise HistoryWith respect to the companies’ surprise history, Allstate has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters with an average beat 27.77%. Chubb on the other hand delivered positive surprises in three of the last four quarters with a four-quarter average beat of 5.56%.Again Allstate has an edge over ChubbEarnings Estimate Revisions and Growth ProjectionsNotably for both companies, The Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved south for 2017 but rallied for 2018.Allstate 2017 estimates have moved down 0.64% but have increased 1.2% for 2018 in the last 60 days.  Chubb’s 2017 estimates on the other hand have moved down 0.48% but have improved by a cent for 2018 in the last 60 days.For Chubb, The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is $10.30 for 2017, reflecting year-over-year growth of 1.78%. For 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $10.68, representing year-over-year growth of 3.65%. Chubb has long-term expected earnings per share growth of 10.0%.For Allstate, The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is $6.20 for 2017, reflecting year-over-year growth of 27.24%. For 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $6.96, representing year-over-year growth of 12.24%. Chubb has long-term expected earnings per share growth of 8.0%.Allstate has once more edged over Chubb in respect of growth projections.Earnings ESPPer the proven model, Chubb is likely to beat on earnings this time because it has the right combination of a favorable Zacks Rank as well as an Earnings ESP of +0.40.However, our model does not conclusively show that Allstate is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. While a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes prediction difficult.Chubb is a clear winner here.To ConcludeAllstate holds an edge over Chubb on price performance, dividend yield, earnings surprise history and growth projections. While considering parameters like valuation, leverage and an Earnings ESP, Chubb seems better than Allstate. Based on our comparative analysis, Allstate presently has an edge over Chubb.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

368,ALL,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put The Allstate Corporation (ALL  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Allstate has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.65, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.50. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Allstate current PE ratio above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Insurance - Property and Casualty sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 21.31. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Allstate has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 14.37, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Allstate stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Allstate has a P/S ratio of about 0.89. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.18 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, ALL is towards the higher end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Allstate currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of ‘A’, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Allstate a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) of Allstate comes in at 7.72, which is lower than the industry average of 9.93. Clearly, ALL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Allstate might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of ‘B’ and a Momentum score of ‘F’. This gives ALL a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of ‘B’. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been unimpressive. Both the current quarter and full year have seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to five lower.This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has plunged 13.2% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0.6%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Allstate Corporation (The) Price and Consensus  Allstate Corporation (The) Price and Consensus | Allstate Corporation (The) QuoteDespite the bearish analyst sentiments, the stock holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Bottom LineAllstate is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among Bottom 27% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

369,ALL,"The Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report) is poised for growth driven by favorable retention rate, pricing gains, accretion from acquisitions and solid capital management. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) property and casualty insurer remains promising, backed by several growth prospects.Growth Projections: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings per share is pegged at $8.40, which translates into year-over-year growth rate of 25.2%. The consensus mark for 2019 is pegged at $8.81, reflecting growth of 4.9% year over year.Impressive Price Performance: Shares of Allstate have increased 15.9% in a year, outperforming the industry and the S&P 500 index’s growth of 14.6% and 14.8%, respectively.Shares Undervalued: Valuation remains attractive at current level. Looking at the company’s price-to-earnings ratio, it currently has a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 11.1, lower than the industry range of 28.6. Undervalued shares with strong fundamentals offer best investment opportunities.Upward Estimate Revisions: The stock has witnessed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year and 2019 earnings being revised 3.3% and 5% upward, respectively, over the last 30 days.Positive Earnings Surprise History: The company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters with an average beat of 58.04%.Growth Drivers in PlaceAllstate continues to benefit from strong market position and accretion from acquisition of SquareTrade and Arity. The company remains focused on implementing pricing and other actions to continue increasing returns and more importantly, improving profitability.The company’s Property-Liability Segment which contributes majority of its revenues continues to be profitable owing to pricing discipline and strong claims management. It is also benefiting from past acquisitions and growth in emerging businesses as reflected by consistent increase in earned premium for the past many years. The trend continued in 2017 which observed an increase of 3% in net written premium.We expect the segment to continue adding to its top line given a number of strategic initiatives taken for growth. These include product enhancements, revenue diversification from the acquisition of SquareTrade, and changes in business mix to focus on those that command high return on equity.After suffering from declining income in its investment portfolio for the past several years, due to market volatility and low interest rates, the company is gradually gaining ground. Net investment income rose 11.8% in 2017, reflecting higher performance-based results and stable income from market-based portfolios. We anticipate further improvement in investment income with an increase in interest rates.A strong capital position aids the company to return value to shareholders via dividend hikes and buybacks. Earlier this month, Allstate increased quarterly dividend by 24.3%. Its current dividend yield of 1.6% is considerably higher than 0.5% for the industry.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the insurance industry can also look at NMI Holdings Inc. (NMIH  -  Free Report), Infinity Property and Casualty Corporation  and The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) for consideration.NMI Holdings provides private mortgage guaranty insurance services in the United States.

That’s the stock that is stuck in no man’s land.What does that mean?It’s the stock that is neither a value stock nor is it a growth stock. Something is missing from the equation. It has no identity.As a result, these stocks tend to underperform as both value and growth investors shun them.What do these stocks look like?Examples of Stocks in No Man’s Land1.      Shake Shack (SHAK  -  Free Report), despite the shares tumbling from their post-IPO highs, still has a forward P/E of 69.

372,ALL,"Enstar Group Limited’s  Lloyd managing agency, StarStone Underwriting Limited, completed the previously announced reinsurance-to-close transaction with Neon Underwriting Limited for Enstar Group’s Syndicate 2008. The closure of this transaction is expected to help Enstar Group’s Syndicate 2008 undertake the liabilities of the 2015 underwriting year of Neon’s Syndicate 2468 (which comprised underwriting years starting from 2008 to 2015).The transaction, first announced on Dec 20, 2017, satisfied the required regulatory approvals and got completed in the first quarter of 2018, well within the stipulated time frame. Following the completion of the transaction, Enstar Group assumed net reinsurance reserves of £337.8 million (about $456.4 million) pertaining to the portfolio and gross reserves of £402.2 million (about $543.4 million).In fact, Enstar Group is likely to undertake the responsibility for claims handling and offer a complete finality to Neon post wrapping up of the transaction.Enstar Group’s already strong relationship with Neon will possibly be further enhanced and cemented with the close of this deal. Notably, a similar transaction was completed in 2016. The latest reinsurance-to-close transaction will raise the total number of Enstar Group’s completed legacy transactions on Lloyd’s platform to 21 since its inception. This not only strengthens but also boosts the Multi line insurer’s position as one of the industry-leading providers of legacy solutions to the Lloyd’s market.Enstar Group as a multi-faceted insurance group provides its clients with innovative capital release solutions and specialty underwriting capabilities. Given a strong track record of purchasing more than 80 companies and portfolios as well as closed legacy transactions, the Multi line insurer has made a name for itself in the industry. Banking on a sustained operational performance and solid underwriting capabilities, we expect this insurer to continue to undertake such transactions in the near term. Consequently, this will provide an impetus to the company’s already solid portfolio and accelerate its overall growth.Shares of Enstar Group have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has lost 1.4% compared with the industry’s decline of 2.2%. Further, we anticipate better investment results, improving fees and commission income plus a robust capital position to drive the shares higher in the near term. Stocks That Warrant a LookInvestors interested in stocks from the insurance industry can consider Radian Group Inc.

Total revenues from this division were $264 million up 45.9% year over year, led by Square Trade acquisition closed last year.Allstate Life’s premium and contract charges of $324 million increased 1.9% year over year driven by higher traditional life insurance renewal premiums and lower levels of reinsurance premiums ceded.

374,ALL,"The fourth-quarter earnings season is in full swing with 251 members of the elite S&P 500 index having already reported financial numbers so far.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, performances indicate a 16% increase in total earnings on 10.5% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 80.5% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 64.9%, outperforming on the top-line front.On an encouraging note, the Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now.Per the Earnings Preview, earnings are expected to grow 5.7% on 2.8% higher revenues.Industry OverviewThe insurance industry as an integral component of the Finance sector is likely to perform slightly better in the soon-to-be-reported quarter compared with the third. However, the insurers’ underwriting profitability is still likely to bear the brunt of the California wildfires in the fourth quarter. This downside further added to the woes with the catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide estimating cat loss at approximately $10.5 billion.However, such a massive loss led insures to brave the price hike that remained flat due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment. This in turn has even helped improving the premiums and driving the top line as well.Also, prudent underwriting practices aided insurers to weather the cat event.Net investment income, an important ingredient of an insurer’s top line, is expected to have substantially improved on the back of a rising interest rate environment. Although the interest rates have been increasing at a slower pace, the impact of rate hike is clearly visible in the insurers’ investment portfolios. Notably, the Fed kept its promise of three hikes in 2017, the last one made in December, having raised enough optimism among investors.Diverse product offerings, a wide geographical footprint and strong client retention are anticipated to have enhanced insurers’ performance in the quarter to be reported.Moreover, the tax reform policy — enacted in December 2017 reducing the tax rate to 21% from 35% — is expected to benefit the insurance industry to a considerable extent. A lower tax rate would aid the companies’ bottom line, boosting margins directly. Additionally, the tax cut is estimated to make U.S. insurers more competitive, globally.With 482 companies (92 S&P 500 members) set to announce earnings results this week, let’s find out how the following insurers are placed ahead of quarterly releases on Feb 7.Stocks to ConsiderThe Allstate Corporation’s (ALL  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter results are likely to be impacted by catastrophe loss, stemming from the California wildfires. This will not only put a dent in the company’s underwriting performance but also render volatility to the company’s bottom line. Notably, the property and casualty (P&C) insurer expects to incur a loss of $516 million from the California wildfires.Nonetheless, the results are anticipated to gain from a decline in the frequency of auto accidents and improved profitability in auto insurance, reflecting the profit improvement actions initiated in 2015.Further, on the back of an improving interest rate environment, the company is likely to have witnessed investment income growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.57 per share for the yet-to-be-reported quarter reflects a 27.6% year-over-year decline. Allstate carries a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, combined with an Earnings ESP of -8.28% leaves surprise prediction inconclusive as the company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Allstate Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Allstate Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Allstate Corporation (The) QuoteYou can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.(Read More: Will California Wildfires Hurt Allstate Q4 Earnings?)Cincinnati Financial Corporation’s (CINF  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter results might take a beating by the occurrence of Hurricane Nate and the California wildfires during the period to be reported. This might also affect the underwriting profitability and leave an impact on the combined ratio.Notably, the property and casualty (P&C) insurer has projected a loss of not less than $1 million in each of the aforementioned catastrophe events.Nonetheless, Cincinnati Financial is likely to report top-line growth in the fourth quarter, fueled by higher premiums earned. This apart, a gradual improvement in insurance rates and several growth initiatives might have contributed to the possible upside.On the back of a progressing interest rate environment, the company’s net investment income is predicted to have significantly increased in the quarter to be soon reported. Also, investment results probably have risen on both higher interest and dividend income.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 86 cents per share for the yet-to-be-reported quarter represents a 14.7% year-over-year improvement. Cincinnati Financial holds a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, when combined with an Earnings ESP of -2.92%, surprise prediction is left inconclusive.

(PRU  -  Free Report) is likely to have witnessed bottom-line growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter owing to expanded product offerings and broader distribution capabilities. To top it all, share buyback is expected to have added to the bottom-line upside.Moreover, the company might experience favorable results at its U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management segment, driven by its penetration and leadership in the pension risk transfer business. Additionally, on the back of higher Asset Management fees, the company might have witnessed growth in asset under management (AUM) in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Further, the company has possibly benefitted from a gradually improving interest rate environment, favoring investment income from higher invested asset balances.However, rise in expenses is likely to have weighed on the desired margin expansion, hurting the company’s overall performance in turn.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s bottom line is pegged at $2.60 for the soon-to-be-reported quarter, up 5.7% year over year.  Prudential Financial has an Earnings ESP of +0.87% and a favorable Zacks Rank of 2.

As a result, Torchmark’s total premium might have increased, riding on a favorable performance at both its Life Insurance and Health segments.On the back of an improving interest rate environment, the company is anticipated to have reported higher excess investment income in the quarter yet to be reported.However, higher administrative expenses have been forecast to weigh on the insurance underwriting income in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s earnings is pegged at $1.23 for the soon-to-be-reported quarter, up 6% year over year.

375,ALL,"Property and casualty insurer Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report) is expected to release fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 7, after the market closes.Let’s Take a Look at the Factors Influencing Q4 ResultsAllstate expects to incur a loss of $516 million from the California wildfires. This, in turn, might dent the company’s underwriting results to some extent.For the first nine months of 2017, this property and casualty insurer incurred $2.64 billion loss due to the catastrophe, up 16.1% year over year. Other players in the same industry, The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) incurred a loss of $499 million from the same calamity, while Chubb Ltd. (CB  -  Free Report) suffered a loss of $477 million.We expect results to gain from a decline in the frequency of auto accidents and improved profitability in auto insurance, reflecting the profit improvement actions initiated in 2015.Meanwhile, investments made for long-term growth in businesses such as Allstate Benefits, SquareTrade and its connected-car platform at Arity seem to be paying off, as evident from an increase in the company’s current policies and higher premiums. We expect the trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, the company is gradually gaining ground after suffering from declining income in its investment portfolio for the past many years due to market volatility and low interest rates. Net investment income rose 11% for the first nine months of 2017, reflecting higher performance-based results and stable income from market-based portfolios. We expect an increase in net investment income in the fourth quarter.The bottom line will also get support from Allstate’s share buybacks.Through the first nine months of 2017, the company repurchased 10 million shares or 2.7% of those outstanding at the beginning of the year. It further remains on track in executing the $2 billion share repurchase program that was approved in August 2017.Earnings Surprise HistoryAllstate boasts an attractive earnings surprise history. It surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 56.9%. This is depicted in the chart below:Allstate Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise Allstate Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Allstate Corporation (The) QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Allstate is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Allstate has an Earnings ESP of -8.28%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.44 per share is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank:  Though Allstate carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP, its negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.A Stock That Warrants a LookHere is a stock that you may consider as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  CNA Financial Corp. (CNA  -  Free Report) will report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings results on Feb 12. The company has an Earnings ESP of +2.75% and a Zacks Rank #1.

376,ALL,"Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) stands a good chance of leading the property and casualty insurance space, benefiting from compelling products and services. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) property and casualty insurer bears immense potential owing to a few good growth drivers.Growth Projections: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings per share is pegged at $10.64 on revenues of $30.6 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 46.1% for the bottom line and 2.2% for the top line.The expected long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 10%.Positive Earnings Surprise History: Chubb has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last five quarters with an average beat of 14.6%.The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Jan 30. Our proven model shows that Chubb is likely to beat estimates this quarter based on the ideal combination of two strong ingredients: a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of +2.12%, which makes us confident about a likely positive earnings surprise.Northbound Estimate Revision: The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings being revised 0.2% upward in the last 60 days.Price Performance: Shares of Chubb have gained 11.8% in a year’s time, underperforming the industry’s 27.2% rally and the S&P 500 index’s 23.4% registered gain. Underpriced: Looking at the company’s price-to-book ratio — the best multiple for valuing insurers because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next — shares are underpriced at the current level. The company has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 1.36, falling significantly below the industry average of 1.67. In fact undervalued shares with growth prospects are the best investment bets. Chubb carries an impressive Value Score of B.  Growth Drivers in PlaceChubb has remained focused on pursuing growth initiatives that pave the way for long-term growth. Chubb expects both organic and inorganic initiatives undertaken in the United States, Latin America and Asia to drive improvement.While the company is intensifying focus on its middle-market business prospects, it is also leveraging cyber insurance that has huge room for growth.Chubb reviews underwriting actions in portfolios that neither meet its risk appetite nor generate decent net premium. Subsequently, the company either terminates or re-insures business to improve its risk/reward profile.Chubb is on track to achieve annual run-rate integration-related savings of $875 million (up from $800 million, guided earlier) by the end of 2018. This in turn will aid margin expansion.The US President Donald Trump has signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law on Dec 22, 2017. This tax reform policy, an overhaul of the tax code after 31 years, lowers the corporate tax burden to 21% from 35%. A reduced tax rate would aid the companies’ bottom line as well as boost margins. The amended tax cut is also expected to make insurers more competitive globally.The gradually improving rate environment will also continue to drive better investment results. The company anticipates quarterly investment income run rate to remain in the range of $845-$855 million (up from the previously guided range of $830-$840 million).A robust financial position enables the company to return shareholders’ value through dividend hikes and share buybacks as well as pursue growth initiatives. While the company had $1.3 billion remaining under its buyback authorization, it targets a dividend payout ratio of 30% of its operating earnings. With the dividend hike approved in May 2017, the company made 24 straight yearly hikes. While Chubb’s dividend yield of 1.92% betters the industry average of 0.76%, its payout ratio of 33.3 outperforms the industry mark of 12.4.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are CNA Financial Corporation (CNA  -  Free Report), Atlas Financial Holdings, Inc.

AAII’s portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five- and 10-year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% gains registered by the S&P 500. Thus investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy to boost their portfolio returns.A Detailed Look into the Driehaus StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In line with this insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus’ philosophy.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator — positive relative strength — has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.Screening Parameters In order to make the strategy more profitable, we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A or B.

378,ALL,"AXIS Capital Holdings Limited (AXS  -  Free Report) has been witnessing downward estimate revisions of late. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings being revised 0.2% downward in the last 60 days.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) with an unimpressive Growth Score of D. Importantly, back tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), comfortably outperform other stocks.Shares of AXIS Capital have also underperformed the industry in a year’s time. The stock has lost 25.9% in contrast to the industry’s 21.1% rally as well as the S&P 500 index’s gain of 21.7%.AXIS Capital is set to report fourth-quarter results on Feb 7.  However, our proven model cannot conclusively show that the company is poised for an earnings beat this season. This is because the company carries a bearish Zacks Rank of 5, which lowers the predictive power of ESP and has an Earnings ESP of -4.27%. We need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Escalating expenses have been a constant concern for AXIS Capital, mainly on higher net loss and loss expenses, general and administrative expenses, higher acquisition costs as well as an increase in interest expense and financing costs. The company experienced a rise of nearly 37% in this metric in the first nine months of 2017. Moreover, the company’s pre-tax margin has been suffering over the past few years with the metric having contracted 100 basis points (bps) in the first nine months of 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. Therefore, rising expenses are likely to restrict operating margin expansion, which in turn might hurt the company’s overall growth.This apart, the property and casualty (P&C) insurers faced the biggest brunt of a massive catastrophe loss, having largely impacted the industry and qualifying 2017 as the costliest year in terms of weather-related loss. In the first nine months of 2017, the company incurred such losses, amounting to about $700 million that was substantially wider than that of the same period in 2016. Further adding to the woes, the fourth quarter witnessed the Northern California wildfires resulting in catastrophe loss to dent the P&C insurers’ underwriting profitability. Hence as a P&C insurer, AXIS Capital suffered a huge catastrophe loss, weighing heavily on the company’s underwriting income and resulting in deteriorating the combined ratio.Combined ratio in Insurance segment has been deteriorating since 2013 and in the first three quarters of 2017 the metric deteriorated 2110 bps.  Return on equity, a measure of profitability, has been declining over the last few years. Return on equity in the first nine months was (10.3%), declining from 10.8% in 2014.In view of the abovementioned catastrophe loss, insurers are likely to experience weak underwriting results, disrupting the overall performance. But there is a silver lining in this catastrophe cloud as insurers braved price hikes, having remained flat in the past several quarters due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment.This apart, the gradual rise in interest rates has benefited the insurance industry. The Federal Reserve delivered its promise to raise the rates thrice in 2017 and has given investors enough hope of a repeat in 2018.Also, the recent tax cut, which reduced the tax rate to 21% from 35%, is expected to benefit the insurance industry to a large extent. A lower tax rate would aid the companies’ bottom line, boosting margins directly. Additionally, the tax cut is anticipated to make U.S. insurers more competitive globally.Choosing the StocksWhile AXIS Capital doesn’t appear as an attractive pick right now, there are a few solid stocks in the same space promising greater returns. Also, these companies have outperformed the industry’s rally in a year.We have narrowed down to four favorable stocks with an upside potential to enhance one’s portfolio with the help of the Zacks Stock Screener. The VGM Score of A or B coupled with Buy-ranked stocks is the best deal to offer.Northbrook, IL-based The Allstate Corporation (ALL  -  Free Report) deals in property-liability insurance and life insurance business in the United States as well as Canada. The company sports a Zacks Rank of 1 with a VGM Score of B. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings being revised 5.8% upward over the last 60 days.Shares of Allstate Corporation have surged 36.9% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry.Kingston, NY-based Kingstone Companies, Inc. (KINS  -  Free Report) underwrites property and casualty insurance products to small businesses and individuals in New York. The company is a Zacks #1 Ranked player with a VGM Score of B. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings being moved 15.2% north over the last 60 days.Shares of Kingstone Companies have soared 55.2% in a year, outperforming the industry’s growth.Branchville, NJ-based Selective Insurance Group, Inc. (SIGI  -  Free Report) offers insurance products and services in the United States. The company is a #1 Ranked player with a VGM Score of B. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings being raised 7.9% over the last 60 days.Shares of Selective Insurance have gained 35.6% in the last 12 months, comparing favorably with the industry. Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

379,ALL,"With a slew of events and weather-related occurrences making waves in the insurance industry, it will be interesting to see how the industry will fare in the fourth and final quarter of 2017. Starting from massive catastrophe loss to a gradual rise in interest rates along with an improving employment scenario and other economic conditions, the insurance industry has seen it all. Amid such changing conditions, the industry still managed to hold its own and we expect it to do the same in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Below we will discuss the various scenarios that have influenced the Property and Casualty Insurance industry in particular to a great extent.Facing the Storm: Catastrophe LossesThe property and casualty insurers faced the biggest brunt of a massive catastrophe loss, having largely impacted the industry and qualifying the year as the costliest in terms of incurring weather-related loss. Notably, per Swiss Re, the total economic losses from natural and man-made disasters in 2017 are projected to be $306 billion.Further adding to the woes without respite, the fourth quarter also witnessed the Northern California wildfires resulting in catastrophe losses, posing a threat to dent the P&C insurers’ underwriting profitability. Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) estimated preliminary loss for the fourth quarter attributable to natural calamities of about $249 million after tax largely stemming from the Californian wildfires.In view of such losses, the insurers will experience weak underwriting results, disrupting the overall performance. But there is a silver lining in this catastrophe cloud, as the insurers braved price hikes, which remained flat in the past several quarters due to a not so active catastrophe environment. Nevertheless, there are a few insurers with an encouraging track record of weathering such setbacks and emerging winners on the back of their core fundamental strengths.Gradual Improvement in the Interest RatesThe steady increase in interest rates has benefited the insurance industry. The Federal Reserve delivered in its promise to raise the rates thrice in 2017 by announcing the third and the final interest rate hike at its last FOMC meeting held on Dec 13. The interest rate now ranges between 1.25% and 1.50%.  A progressing rate environment has lessened the pressure on the insurers’ investment income, boosting their earnings in process. Moreover, a higher rate environment would make the pricing environment more competitive, further supporting carriers to grow. It is important to note here that investment income constitutes a major component of insurer’s top line.Other Factors Influencing the IndustryWith cyber attacks on the rise, the P&C insurance industry has seen improvement in cyber security insurance, which has led to noticeable premium growth. This apart, advancement in technology has enabled insurers to enhance operational efficiency, starting from underwriting and policy administration to claims and risk management.Additionally, there are a few other factors impacting the industry performance during this time period. To that end, low inflation has remained at 1.7%, falling shy of the 2% target, which is considered good for the economy. Moreover, a reviving housing market is anticipated to enhance insurable exposures and premiums written. Plus, an improving employment scenario and a positive consumer sentiment buoy optimism.Price PerformanceDespite all odds, the industry has scored better than the S&P 500 index in the fourth quarter, riding on core strength. While the industry has gained 6.7%, the elite index has risen 6.4%. Industry RankThe P&C Insurance industry is currently ranked at #92, falling within the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) of the Zacks Industry Rank.Outperformers of Q4Despite adversities spurting concerns for insurers this year, positives like a rising interest rate environment and an improving economy have helped the following stocks perform well in the fourth quarter and yield profits through core strength and business modification.Here is a list of four top-ranked insurers that outperformed the industry in the last quarter. These stocks hold promise to deliver favorable results, banking on operational strength. Also, an impressive Value Score of A or B combined with Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) makes these stocks worth investment bets. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Northbrook, IL-based The Allstate Corporation (ALL  -  Free Report) deals in property-liability insurance and life insurance business in the United States and Canada. Shares of Allstate Corporation have rallied 13.9% in the fourth quarter, outperforming the industry’s increase of 6.7%. The company has a Value Score of A. Shares of Santa Ana, CA-based financial service provider First American Financial Corp. (FAF  -  Free Report), have gained 12.2% in the fourth quarter, outpacing the industry’s rise. The company has a Value Score of A. Mayfiled Village, OH-based The Progressive Corp. (PGR  -  Free Report) provides personal and commercial property-casualty insurance, and other specialty property-casualty insurance and related services primarily in the United States. Shares of Progressive have climbed 16.3% in the fourth quarter, ahead of the industry’s increase. The company has a Value Score of B. Greenwich, CT-based W.R. Berkley Corp. (WRB  -  Free Report) operates as commercial lines writer in the United States and internationally. Shares of W.R. Berkley have grown 7.4% in the fourth quarter, higher than the industry’s gain. The company has a Value Score of B. Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

380,ALL,"The current economic backdrop is shaping up well for insurers as they are witnessing gradual improvement in interest rates along with substantially lower level of catastrophe loss and reduced tax (owing to a noteworthy tax reform effective Jan 1, 2018). These factors have also led to a promising performance in the first quarter of 2018 and augur well for an encouraging second quarter. Hence, we expect the insurance industry to continue with the momentum and deliver a better-than-expected show as the year progresses.However, concerning factors like weather-related events, political turmoil and regulatory uncertainty have posed challenges to the insurance industry, which nevertheless, maintained its focus on achieving two important objectives — the top-line sales growth while bolstering bottom-line profitability. Therefore, despite the aforementioned headwinds, we expect some insurers to generate desirable results and keep the optimism alive among investors on the stock.Pertaining to the interest rate environment, continued improvement in the interest rates has proved to be beneficial for insurers, reflecting stability in the U.S. economy at the same time. The FOMC meeting on Jun 13, 2018 marked the second interest rate hike so far this year, which further cemented insurers’ confidence in the regulatory body’s promise to deliver a fourth rate raise this year and three more in 2019 (exceeding the previously announced limit of two hikes). The recent growth announced at the meeting has put the current interest rate in the 1.75-2% range.An advancing rate environment will ultimately profit the insurance industry with regard to its players’ investment income (a component of their revenues), thereby adding to their overall top line. For instance, the life insurance companies will be relieved of the operating pressures, induced by tight credit spreads that the low-rate environment has exerted for a considerable period of time. Moreover, amid the improving interest rate environment, the property and casualty (P&C) insurers will also gain traction from a broader invested asset base and alternative asset classes.Speaking of underwriting performance, per a Fitch Ratings report, the insurance space is expected to regain substantial underwriting profitability in 2018, albeit at a slower pace after being badly hit by the devastating hurricane activity and earthquakes in 2017.With The Allstate Corporation (ALL  -  Free Report) projecting a total catastrophe loss of $387 million after tax for the months of April and May 2018, the insurance industry players are not expecting a huge impact on their underwriting results. Hence, the occurrence of catastrophe loss is not likely to be a huge drag for the insurance industry, which is hopeful about its underwriting performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, insurers have likely witnessed a noticeable rise in combined ratios, which might inch close to a break-even point as the year moves ahead.Notably, capital strength displayed by insurers will assist them to offset a near-term volatility and the effects of adversities.Additionally, mergers and acquisitions have recently grabbed headlines as an important trend to look out for in 2018. The last couple of years has prepared insurers to take an aggressive and positive stance toward the deal-making environment in 2018, mainly driven by an evolving industry and M&A environment. Hence, this trend is expected to add more fuel to the already upbeat performance of the insurance industry.There are also other factors which have aided results in the last reported quarter and are likely to repeat this quarter to be reported too. The unemployment rate in May 2018 came in at 3.8% (the lowest since 2000 and 1969) with the gross domestic product estimated to grow 2.7% (an increase from the earlier estimate of 2.5%). Further, the inflation fell just below the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.This apart, a recovering housing market looks geared up to enhance insurable exposures and premiums written.Moreover, the tax cut, slashing the tax rate to 21% from 35%, proved to be an attractive option for most corporates including insurers as it helped driving the companies’ bottom-line, boosting margins directly.A sturdy financial position, attributable to continued capital inflow into the industry, will not only back insurers to counter a near-term instability as well as the impact of unfavorable occurrences but will also keep the industry’s growth trend active.Key PicksDespite a slew of headwinds posing a threat to insurers this year, tailwinds like the positive interest rate environment, better underwriting results and a steadily thriving economy have likely cushioned the following stocks to push the envelope further for yielding profits via an underlying strength and business streamlining.We have zeroed in on three stocks that have had a bull run despite all odds. These stocks also carry a VGM Score of A. We expect these best bets to deliver an impressive performance given northbound estimate revisions, a solid Zacks Rank and share price outperformance on year-to-date basis. Our research shows that stocks with a commendable VGM Score of A or B when combined with a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer best upside potential. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Mayfield Village, OH-based The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) provides personal and commercial auto insurance, residential property insurance plus other specialty property-casualty insurance and related services, primarily in the United States. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 7.7% upward to $4.22 over the last 60 days. This is also reflected through the company’s Zacks Rank of 1.The stock has gained 4.2% versus the industry’s decrease of 3.2%.New York-based National General Holdings Corp. (NGHC  -  Free Report) provides various insurance products and services in the United States. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 bottom line being moved 1.8% north to $2.28 over the last 60 days. This is also represented by the company’s Zacks Rank #2.The stock has rallied 38% against the industry’s decline of 3.2%.Headquartered in Birmingham, MI, Conifer Holdings, Inc. (CNFR  -  Free Report) provides insurance coverage in specialty commercial and personal product lines. The stock has seen the consensus mark for current-year earnings being raised 26.3% to 48 cents over the last 60 days. This is also indicated by the company’s Zacks Rank of 2.The stock has gained 12.1% against the industry’s decline of 3.3%. The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

381,ALL,"The Finance sector is set to kick off its earnings season this week with major banks reporting quarterly results. Improving rate environment and tax cuts should continue to drive the sector’s performance.  Per the Earnings Outlook, earnings for the sector are expected to increase 18.5% on 3.6% higher revenues.Insurers, an important component of the Finance sector, are shortly going to release their financial numbers. Earnings of the Insurance Industry are envisioned to grow 12.2% in the second quarter, given a slew of tailwinds favoring its operating environment.Progressing Rate EnvironmentThe second quarter of 2018 marked the second rate hike by the Federal Reserve this year, reflecting a robust economy. The rate now stands at 2% with the regulatory body’s intentions of two more raises in 2018 followed by three in 2019 as well as a couple of in 2020.A Benign Cat EnvironmentAlthough the second quarter escaped the harsh lashes of Mother Nature, a few cat events like rain storms in the United States and Canada still plagued the period. A Morgan Stanley analyst estimates global insured cat loss of about $7.1 billion in the quarter under discussion. The analyst also noted that the count is much lower than the general tally of around $14 billion insurers having suffered natural calamities in any given second quarter.However, price hikes, prudent underwriting practices, portfolio repositioning and adherence to reinsurance covers will help insurers withstand the deficits.Also, lower cat loss means lower claims, which in turn, strengthens reserves. The insurance industry is already boasting an all-time sturdy capital position.While surplus capital is lending a cushion to more capital deployment in growth initiatives, mergers and acquisitions plus shareholder value addition, the same is also responsible for restricting the desired pricing. A Morgan Stanley analyst noted that Jun 1 renewals witnessed an average 1% increase, which is lower than expected.Tax Reforms and Capital DeploymentPer the implementation of the new tax rate effective first quarter, the tax incidence has been lowered to 21% from 35%. Not only will this aid in margin expansion but also increase dividend payouts owing to rise in net profit available to shareholders.W.R. Berkley Corporation approved a 7.1% raise in dividends as well as a special cash dividend of 50 cents per share. Chubb Limited announced a 3% hike in quarterly dividend to 73 cents per share. Unum Group too enhanced its quarterly dividend by 13% and approved a new $750-million share buyback program.Promising Economic NumbersJob growth has been solid through the second quarter of 2018 with an average of nearly 0.211 million.  Unemployment rate in June was 4%.Per Trading Economics global macro models and analysts expectations, the GDP growth rate for the quarter is estimated at 2%.Price PerformanceThe Insurance industry has underperformed the S&P 500 index during the second quarter. While the industry has decreased 5.3%, the elite index has gained 3.8%.Q2 OutperformersRiding high on tailwinds, insurers enjoyed a favorable operational backdrop to generate improved results. With the help of our Zacks Stock Screener, we identified stocks poised to outshine the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter.  Our proven model conclusively states that because of an ideal combination of the two ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank — the following stocks are likely to surpass expectations at their earnings announcement.

382,ALL,"Gradual improvement in interest rates, substantially lower level of catastrophe loss, reduced tax (owing to a noteworthy tax reform effective Jan 1, 2018) and improving economy have resulted in a favorable first half performance and set the tone for an encouraging second half. We expect the insurance industry to continue with the momentum and deliver a better-than-expected show as the year progresses.Notably, insurers battled against the challenges faced during the first half, while remaining focused on achieving two important objectives, which are top-line sales growth while bolstering bottom-line profitability.Concerning factors like weather-related events and political turmoil are beyond any insurer’s control. Despite such trials, we expect some insurers to generate desirable results and keep the optimism alive among investors on the stock.Let us talk about a few driving factors that have paved the way for insurers to perform well in the first half, allaying apprehensions among stockholders.Rising Interest Rates: A Boon for Insurers?The gradually increasing interest rates have been a blessing for insurers, who are major beneficiaries of the climbing interest rates. The FOMC meeting on Jun 13, 2018 marked the second interest rate hike so far this year, which further strengthened insurers’ confidence in the regulatory body’s promise to deliver four rate raises in 2018. The recent growth announced at the meeting has put the current interest rate in the 1.75-2% range.The June meeting also highlighted the seventh straight rate hike since late 2015, the period when the Fed initiated the procedure of raising interest rates from an almost zero level. With the Central Bank adopting a somewhat aggressive stance toward increasing interest rates, we can expect it to deliver its promise of a fourth rate raise this year and three more in 2019 (exceeding the previously announced limit of two hikes).An advancing rate environment will ultimately benefit the insurance industry with regard to insurers’ investment income (a component of their revenues), thereby accelerating adding to the overall top line. For instance, the life insurance companies will be relieved of the operating pressures, resulting from tight credit spreads that the low-rate environment has exerted for a considerable period of time. Rising interest rates as well as increase in bond yields will provide the required breather for insurers to maintain decent margins.Amid the improving interest rate environment, the property and casualty (P&C) insurers will also gain traction from a broader invested asset base and alternative asset classes.Will Favorable Underwriting Performance Buoy Optimism?California mudslides, northeast winter storms and a couple of severe wind and hail events, which mainly affected Mid-Atlantic, Northeast and certain Midwest states, have impacted the results during the first half of 2018. With The Allstate Corporation (ALL  -  Free Report) projecting a total catastrophe loss of $387 million after tax for the months of April and May 2018, the insurance industry players are not expecting a huge impact on their underwriting results. Thus, the positivity surrounding a better underwriting performance remains intact despite such massive inclement weather-oriented losses being incurred.In fact, per a Fitch Ratings report, the insurance space is expected to regain substantial underwriting profitability in 2018, albeit at a slower pace after being badly hit by the unprecedented hurricane activity and earthquakes in 2017. Moreover, insurers have likely witnessed a noticeable improvement in combined ratios, which might come close to a break-even point as the year goes on.Capital strength displayed by insurers will in turn assist them to counter a near-term volatility and the effects of adversities.Other High Points for a Winning PerformanceThere are a few other factors that have bolstered the insurance industry in the first half of 2018. Notably, the unemployment rate in May 2018 came in at 3.8% (the lowest since 2000 and 1969) with the gross domestic product estimated to grow 2.7% (an increase from the earlier estimate of 2.5%). Further, the inflation came in just below the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.This apart, a recovering housing market looks set to enhance insurable exposures and premiums written.Moreover, the tax cut, which slashed the tax rate to 21% from 35%, proved to be an attractive option for most corporates including insurers, as it helped aiding the companies’ bottom-line, boosting margins directly.A strong liquidity profile, attributable to continued capital inflow into the industry, will not only back insurers to counter a near-term volatility and the impact of hostile occurrences but will also keep the industry’s growth trend alive.Outperformers in 1HDespite a slew of headwinds posing a threat to insurers this year, tailwinds like the positive interest rate environment, better underwriting results and a steadily thriving economy have likely cushioned the following stocks to push the envelope and yield profits through an underlying strength and business modification.We have zeroed in on three stocks that have had a bull run despite all odds.

383,ALL,"The Allstate Corporation (ALL  -  Free Report) recently announced estimated pretax catastrophe loss of about $278 million or $220 million after tax for May 2018.Of these, a $224-million was incurred from 12 events and the remainder was from adjustments to prior-period cat loss. About 60% of the catastrophe losses were related to two severe wind and hail events, primarily affecting Mid-Atlantic, Northeast and certain Midwest states.For April, the company expects a cat loss of $211 million or $167 million after tax. Clubbing both, the company will likely bear a $489-million loss in the second quarter, per the recent estimates.Per Aon’s Impact Forecasting, cat loss for May is estimated at $2.3 billion and two-thirds of the same will be borne by the insurance and the reinsurance sector. According to Aon, May will be the most impactful month pertaining to severe weather so far this year across the United States and Canada.Due to a relatively large property insurance business, Allstate is significantly exposed to catastrophic events. Weather-related losses for the past many years have weighed on the company’s claims and benefits plus expenses and cash flow, draining its underwriting profitability.In 2016 and 2017, the company's cat loss widened 51% and 26%, respectively, year over year. The company incurred $361 million of catastrophe loss during the first quarter of 2018.Allstate remains focused on reducing losses through its catastrophe management strategy and reinsurance programs as well as by limiting exposure to riskier geographic markets via premium hikes, which might cause a decline in the number of policies in force. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of significant losses from cat events and inclement weather incidents.Despite the cat loss incidence, our confidence remains intact in the company’s ability to show strong results during the second quarter. Increasing premiums in property and casualty business, an improving auto business, growing net investment income, a low tax rate as well as a strong balance sheet should act as key catalysts for earnings growth.Zacks Rank & Share Price ImpactAllstate carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of the company have returned 3.6% in a year’s time, underperforming the industry growth of 8.7%. Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are Alleghany Corp.

384,ALL,"Investors looking for stocks in the Insurance - Property and Casualty sector might want to consider either Allstate (ALL  -  Free Report) or W.R. Berkley (WRB  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Currently, Allstate has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while W.R. Berkley has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that ALL's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.ALL currently has a forward P/E ratio of 10.58, while WRB has a forward P/E of 20.75. We also note that ALL has a PEG ratio of 1.27. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. WRB currently has a PEG ratio of 2.31.Another notable valuation metric for ALL is its P/B ratio of 1.57. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, WRB has a P/B of 1.73.These metrics, and several others, help ALL earn a Value grade of A, while WRB has been given a Value grade of C.ALL sticks out from WRB in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that ALL is the better option right now.

386,ALL,"The insurance industry is well poised for growth on a gradually stabilizing operating environment, Fed rate hikes and benefits of the tax overhaul position. Taking these factors into consideration it will be a prudent move to add a few stocks from the industry to your portfolio now. Based on its underlying strength and good growth prospects, The Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report) stock seems to be a solid bet now.The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has been revised 6.2% upward over the past 60 days, indicating analysts’ optimism about its earnings growth potential. It is further stressed by the stock’s Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).Here are a few other factors that make the stock a lucrative investment option.Consistent Increase in Revenues: Allstate’s revenues have witnessed a CAGR of 2.8% over the last six years (2011-2017). We expect increase in revenues to continue driven by the strategic initiatives taken for growth.  These initiatives include product enhancements, revenue -diversification from the acquisition of SquareTrade, and changes in business mix to focus on those that command a high return on equity.Poised to Gain From Increase in Interest Rates: The company is gradually gaining traction of late after years of  declining income in its investment portfolio. Net investment income rose 11.8% in 2017, reflecting higher performance-based results and stable income from market-based portfolios. The same was up 5.1% in the first quarter of 2018.  We expect further improvement in investment income with an increase in interest rates.Low Tax Rate to Drive Growth: In 2018, the company anticipates a corporate tax rate of 19% to 20% compared with its historical effective tax rate in the low 30%. The company is taking advantage of lower taxes to increase growth, enhance the employer value proposition, and raise shareholders’ returns. It will be investing in marketing, distribution, telematics, new products and technology to expand in many of its markets.Strong Balance Sheet and Efficient Capital Management: The company’s free cash flow has been increasing over the years. Management’s proactive risk mitigation and return optimization programs continue to enhance operating cash flow and shareholder value. Disciplined capital management by way of share buyback and dividend hike is also impressive. In February, Allstate increased quarterly dividend by 24%. Its current dividend yield of 1.95% is considerably higher than 0.48% for the industry.Strong ROE: Further, Allstate’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) reinforces its growth potential. The company’s ROE of 14.6% has improved over the past two years and remains way higher than the ROE of 4.9% for the industry, reflecting its tactical efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds.Does Allstate Make A Good Investment Option?The answer is “yes”, here’s how. Year to date, shares of the company have lost 11.4% compared with the industry's decline of 1.3%. The company's strong fundamentals should favor it in the coming quarters. The upward revision in Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings reflects analysts’ optimism on the stock. Moreover, it is significantly undervalued and currently trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 10.5, which compares unfavorably with the industry P/E ratio of 26.5. Given that the stock is trading at low valuation levels, it provides an attractive investment opportunity.Also the stock carries an impressive Value Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering in the same space are Alleghany Corp.

391,ALL,"The Allstate Corporation (ALL  -  Free Report) recently announced estimated pretax catastrophe loss of about $211 million or $167 million after tax for April 2018.The company expects reinsurance recoveries to reduce the loss to $195 million. These losses pertain to 10 events that occurred in April. About 60% of the catastrophe losses were related to two severe wind and hail events which occurred in Texas and some parts of Southeastern states.Per a recent report from Aon Benfield, five separate storm systems caused severe thunderstorms across the United States during the month of April. Total combined economic losses from these events were estimated at $2.3 billion, with public and private insurers expected to pay at least $1.5 billion in claims.Due to a relatively large property insurance business, Allstate’s business is significantly exposed to catastrophic events.

394,ALL,"Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 1 after the market closes. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 225%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Genworth is expected to have witnessed better performance at its U.S. Mortgage Insurance. Improving U.S. housing market, solid insurance in force growth, strong loss mitigation programs, growing private mortgage insurance market and lower delinquency are anticipated to have driven this segmental performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted operating income is pegged at $96 million.An improving rate environment is likely to have aided investment results in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $802 million.Rate increase approved over time and a solid insurance in force are expected to have improved premium. The consensus mark for the metric stands at $1.1 billion.Long Term Care as well as Life Insurance sales are likely to have remained soft in the first quarter due to pricing changes in the U.S. Life Insurance Division. Though management is adopting several new product and distribution strategies, it anticipates sales to be affected by lower ratings in the future.Nonetheless, lower tax incidence, courtesy of a new, reduced tax rate might have possibly guarded the bottom line.With respect to its positive surprise trend, the company delivered an earnings beat in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 66.15%.What the Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Genworth is likely to beat estimates this yet-to-be-reported quarter. This is because a stock needs to have the right combination of the two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for an earnings beat.

395,ALL,"Assurant, Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3 after the market closes. The company delivered a positive surprise in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 16.3%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Assurant’s fourth-quarter performance is expected to have been driven by a strong performance across most of its business lines.Growth in mobile business as well as higher contributions from vehicle protection and expense efficiencies possibly have augmented operating income at Connected Living. However, declines in lender-placed and credit insurance are likely to have been a partial offset. Growth at vehicle protection business has been driven by sturdy sales made earlier.Global Lifestyle largely benefited from higher mobile contributions from new and existing programs in fourth-quarter 2017. However, the company does not expect any increase in trade-in volumes during the first quarter 2018. This is because sales of new smartphones have been lower than expected. Nonetheless, a compelling product and client mix are expected to have aided Global Lifestyle’s performance.Revenues and earnings at Global Preneed have probably been driven by expansion from new and existing clients and adjacent product offerings. A lower tax rate will boost its performance.However, the company estimates lender-placed declines in its Global Housing.Lower tax incidence owing to a drop in the tax rate will possibly cushion the bottom line. Also, continued share buybacks should have upped the metric. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.89 per share, up 1.1% year over year.What the Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Assurant is likely to beat on earnings this to-be-reported quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

396,ALL,"The first-quarter earnings season is in full swing with already 267 members of the elite S&P 500 index having reported financial numbers so far.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, performances of these index participants indicate a 25.1% increase in total earnings on 10% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 76.8% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and a 73.8%, outperforming on the top-line front, bearing testament to a solid start.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now. Per Earnings Preview, earnings are expected to rise 26.4% on 5.7% more revenues.Integral to the Finance sector, the insurance industry is likely to witness better results this yet-to-be-reported quarter on the back of an improving rate environment, tax cuts, a favorable operating environment and a better domestic growth scenario.A progressing interest rate environment is likely to have driven higher net investment income, an important component of an insurer’s top line. Though the same is far from hitting a historical high, it nevertheless shows an upward trend. Notably, the Fed has hiked interest rate five times since December 2015 on the back of a thriving economy and has hinted at two more raises this year, followed by three in 2019 and a couple of in 2020.Although insurers have lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines to withstand the low rate environment, they look to benefit from the increasing rates as investment yield improves.The first quarter is likely to benefit from the tax cut.  Per the enforcement of the new tax rate effective January 2018, the tax incidence has been reduced to 21% from 35%. This rate slash will possibly lend an extra boost to insurers’ bottom line.Although the to-be-reported quarter encountered a California mudslide as well as the northeast winter storms, the disasters might still leave the company’s underwriting profitability unhurt. Insurers having already suffered the perils of cat loss last year, should have managed to endure the shortfalls in first-quarter 2018. A Morgan Stanley analyst estimates global insured cat loss between $5 billion and $10 billion. Underwriting profitability is also slightly pressed.Nonetheless, improved pricing, prudent underwriting practices, portfolio repositioning as well as resorting to reinsurance covers are likely to have cushioned insurers to survive the deficits.A wide-ranged product portfolio, expanded global footprint and tactical M&A activity might have aided insurers’ performance in the quarter to be reported.About 900 companies (142 S&P 500 members) will report quarterly results this week. Let’s take a look at how things pan out for the following insurers ahead of their quarterly releases on May 1.Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.’s (AJG  -  Free Report) top line is expected to have gained traction from organic sales as well as strategic mergers and acquisitions. Brokerage segment will be benefitted from a favorable forex impact while Employee benefit consulting operations are estimated to have registered organic growth from new business opportunities. Lower tax rate is likely to boost the companies’ bottom line and margin growth directly. However, a projected rise in expenses will likely limit the operating margin expansion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51 per share for the yet-to-be-reported quarter reflects a substantial 277.5% year-over-year increase. Arthur J. Gallagher carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes our surprise prediction difficult as the company requires a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. (Read more: Arthur J.

However, volatility in Unum U.K. seems to have persisted due to the  Brexit buzz, which probably induced an unreliable business environment.

397,ALL,"Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report) earnings for the first quarter to be reported on May 1, will gain from a decline in the tax rate to 19% to 20%, from a low 30% range earlier. Investments made in growth in many of its market facing businesses through marketing, distribution, telematics, new products and technology, should also yield results.In 2018, Allstate brand Property-Liability, Allstate Benefits, SquareTrade and Esurance are all expected to contribute to growth, which should also be seen in the first quarter.Within Ensurance, auto and homeowners insurance retention increased throughout 2017, and the trend is expected to continue in 2018. Naturally, the first quarter of 2018 may not be an exception.Nevertheless, net premium has been declining at Encompass for the past two years. Decline in premium and policies in force in states with inadequate returns have impacted the overall top-line trends, to some extent. The business is getting smaller as the company exited unprofitable markets and raised prices. This will shrink top line from the segment and we don’t expect the segment to witness premium growth in the first quarter.Then again, after suffering from declining income in its investment portfolio for the past many years, due to market volatility and low interest rates, the company is gradually gaining ground. Net investment income rose 11.8% in 2017, reflecting higher performance-based results and stable income from market-based portfolios. We expect further improvement in investment income with an increase in interest rates.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history, having surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 58.04%.

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ALL in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.64 per share for ALL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.53 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ALL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +4.24% heading into earnings season.The Allstate Corporation Price and EPS Surprise The Allstate Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The Allstate Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

402,ALL,"First-quarter earnings season has already witnessed 130 elite S&P 500 index members having reported quarterly results so far.Let’s see, how the quarter pans out for the life and non-life or the property and casualty (P&C) insurance space.The insurance industry is likely to deliver solid earnings in the first quarter, riding on the strength of an improving rate environment, tax cuts, favorable operating environment and a better domestic growth scenario.An Improving Rate EnvironmentReflecting economic stability, the Fed has hiked interest rate for the sixth time since December 2015, the recent being in March this year. The rate environment has improved to 1.75% from the near zero level.The first quarter thus continues to enjoy the positive impact of a favorable rate environment, driving the insurer’s investment results and the performance of life insurers.Although insurers have lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines to weather the low rate environment, they stand to benefit from the increasing rates as investment yield improves.A Benign Catastrophe EnvironmentThough the first quarter encountered the California mudslide and the northeast winter storms, the insurers escaped a severe magnitude of catastrophe loss. A Morgan Stanley analyst estimates global insured cat loss in the first quarter between $5 billion and $10 billion.Insurers having already suffered the extremities of cat loss last year could manage to brave its first-quarter damages as well. Nonetheless, first-quarter earnings are burdened by catastrophe loss. Underwriting profitability is affected, albeit to a lesser degree. Recently, Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) reported a drag of 64 cents on its bottom line attributable to cat loss.Prudent underwriting standards and cost control measures will likely support profitability.Impact of Tax ReformsThe new tax rate has been implemented effective first-quarter 2018. The overhaul of the tax system slashed the tax rate to 21% from 35%. A lower tax incidence is expected to boost net income, the bottom line as well as the scope for more capital deployment.Progressing Economy: A TailwindAlso, a progressing economy reflects a better employment scenario and the GDP translating into a more disposable income plus a better consumer sentiment.Growth in job opportunities has been solid through the first three months of 2018 with an average of nearly 0.202 million, above the year-ago tally of 0.182 million.  This, in turn, might have supported more policy writings, thus driving the premiums higher. Premiums contribute a lion’s share to an insurer’s top line.Other FactorsDiverse product offerings, portfolio repositioning, geographic expansion, cost-curbing efforts, share repurchases and strategic integrations should have propelled better performances.Ways to Pick the Perfect Insurance StocksWith tailwinds rallying around the industry, investors can comfortably bet on stocks, poised to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the upcoming reports.  Choosing the right stock for one’s portfolio from too many participants is certainly a tough task for investors. But an easy way to shorten the list is by selecting stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), which help surpassing the estimates.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks with the best chances of delivering an earnings beat in the next announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Please check our Earnings ESP Filter that enables you to come across stocks with the potential to outshine earnings estimates this reporting cycle.Our research shows that the stocks with the perfect combination of the two key ingredients have 70% chances of a positive earnings surprise.For investors seeking to apply this strategy in their portfolios, we have highlighted four insurance stocks which might stand out from the crowd with an earnings beat in the upcoming releases.  The Allstate Corporation (ALL  -  Free Report)Northbrook, IL-based Allstate engages in property and casualty insurance, and life insurance businesses in the United States and Canada.With a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +4.24%, Allstate looks well-poised for a positive surprise.

Notably, the company delivered a positive surprise in all the last four quarters.Let’s see, what is in store for the company this yet-to-be reported quarter.Factors to be Considered This QuarterCME Group is likely to report top-line growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, fueled by higher clearing and transaction fees plus access and communication fees. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for clearing and transaction fees is pegged at $865 million and for access and communication fees stands at $26.03 million, highlighting an increase of 9.2% and 7.1%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Moreover, revenues in the first quarter are anticipated to have gained from expansion of futures products in the emerging markets, non-transaction related opportunities, OTC (over the counter) offerings as well as options business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $1.1 billion, translating into a 20.8% rise on a year-over-year basis.Also, the company’s efforts to accelerate organic market data growth might have contributed to its top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for market data and information services is pegged at $101 million, indicating a 4.1% increase from the year-ago quarter.For the first quarter of 2018, average daily volumes (ADV) were 19.2 million contracts, having improved 12.1% year over year as the company witnessed higher volumes across all its product lines.Additionally, the tax cut, which reduced the tax rate to 21% from 35%, will aid the companies’ bottom line, thereby boosting margins directly.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.85 per share, reflecting a rise of 51.6% on a year-over-year basis.However, the company is likely to witness a rise in expenses in the yet-to-be-reported quarter, mainly due to its investments in several strategic initiatives. Management projects adjusted total operating expenses guidance excluding licensing fees to range between $1.10 billion and $1.11 billion in 2018.CME Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  CME Group Inc.

Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 8.14%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered This QuarterCincinnati Financial as a property and casualty (P&C) insurer has been exposed to unpredictable weather-related events and a considerable catastrophe loss. Therefore, the company has possibly incurred cat loss in the first quarter, which in turn might dent its underwriting results and also impact the combined ratio.Further, the company has likely reported an increase in total benefits and expenses, mainly driven by higher insurance loss and contract holders’ benefits, underwriting, acquisition plus insurance expenses. This in turn might restrict the P&C insurer’s operating margin expansion.  Nonetheless, Cincinnati Financial is expected to report top-line growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, fueled by higher premiums earned. This apart, a gradual improvement in insurance rates and several growth initiatives are anticipated to have contributed to this probable upside.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.4 billion, representing an improvement of 4.5% from the prior-year quarter.The company is likely to witness an increase in premiums written in the first quarter, attributable to a controlled expansion of Cincinnati Re that forms a substantial contributor to the P&C insurer’s earnings.Cincinnati Financial is estimated to have witnessed considerable growth in net investment income in the yet-to-be-reported quarter, mainly owing to improved interest rates as well as higher interest and dividend income.The tax cut, which reduced the tax rate to 21% from 35%, will aid the companies’ bottom line, boosting margins directly.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 82 cents, reflecting a rise of 38.9% on a year-over-year basis.Cincinnati Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Cincinnati Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cincinnati Financial Corporation Quote Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Cincinnati Financial is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

406,ALL,"The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24 before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 50.00%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Premiums, contributing a lion’s share to the top line are expected to increase on the back of higher retentions and renewals, improving pricing environment, rise in new business as well as an expansive product portfolio. Each segment is likely to have delivered improved premiums. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $6.6 billion, up 1.3% year over year.Commercial businesses are expected to retain the momentum of delivering a better performance. Pricing and underwriting actions implemented are anticipated to consistently drive results in auto business.A gradual rise in interest rates continues to favor insurers. Travelers estimates $25-$30 million of higher after-tax net investment income on a quarterly basis compared with the tally in 2017. This projection is based on the growth of fixed income portfolio size, higher short-term interest rates, the new U.S. Tax reform as well as specific securities, scheduled to mature in 2018.Riding on the strength of improved premiums and net investment income, total revenues in the to-be-reported quarter are estimated to have increased. The Consensus Estimate for revenue is pegged at $7.2 billion, up 4.4% year over year.Given a not-so-active catastrophe environment and prudent underwriting practices, the company is likely to have delivered an improved underwriting profitability in the impending quarterly performance.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for combined ratio in the Insurances segment is pegged at 94%, improving 200 basis points year over year. Travelers estimates underlying underwriting margins in each segment to improve in 2018.A lower tax rate, courtesy of the new tax legislation effective this Jan 1, 2018, reduces tax incidence. This along with share buybacks is anticipated to have provided an additional boost to the bottom line.

407,ALL,"Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24 after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 37.23%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Chubb’s first quarter underwriting results will be affected by the California mudslides (which occurred in early January). Chubb has projected catastrophe loss from the same at nearly $125 million after tax while the total catastrophe loss is estimated at $305 million after tax. This apart, the company has issued loss estimates pertaining to the northeast winter storms, which hit the East Coast first on Jan 3 and later on Mar 1, 2018. Net loss from these storms is anticipated to be $115 million and $80 million, respectively, on a pre-tax basis.Further, other net losses related to natural catastrophes to date globally in the first quarter, are projected at $60 million pretax.It is important to mention here that such loss is attributable to commercial and personal property plus casualty insurance operations as well as reinsurance activities. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s combined ratio is pegged at 89%, a deterioration of 100 basis points from the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.24, reflecting a 9.7% year-over-year decrease.Additionally, the company might have incurred increased expenses, mainly due to higher loss and loss expenses, policy acquisition costs, administrative expenses as well as policy benefits. This in turn will possibly weigh on the P&C insurer’s operating margin expansion.  However, higher net investment income is expected to have cushioned the company’s top line. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $780 million, representing a rise of 4.7% on a year-over-year basis. This is mainly owing to the improved interest rates as well as better-than-expected private equity distributions. Also, the company expects its quarterly investment income run rate to range between $845 million and $855 million.Moreover, the company is likely to report increased premiums in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, driven by an improved commercial property and casualty (P&C) pricing across its numerous business lines as well as a compelling product portfolio.Strategic buyouts are expected to have contributed to this probable increase in premiums.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Chubb is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 2.60%.Factors to be Considered This QuarterAn expected increase in premiums, investment income coupled with higher service revenues and fees as well as other revenues are likely to have driven the top line in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the period’s revenues is pegged at $7.34 billion, up 17.1%.Both Personal and Commercial business lines are expected to have been benefited by strong a momentum in both its Vehicle and Property businesses.

Snapshot, Robinson and Home Quote Explorer programs are estimated to have boosted the business too.However, expenses might have increased due to higher losses and loss adjustment expenses, policy acquisition costs plus other underwriting expenses.Though there were cat events like the California mudslide and the northeast winter storms dominating the start of the year, underwriting results will still not be hampered to a greater degree. A Morgan Stanley analyst estimates global insured cat loss in the first quarter between $5 billion and $10 billion, much lower than losses incurred in the past years.The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.19 per share, reflecting 77.6% year-over-year growth.With respect to the earnings trend, the company delivered positive surprises in two of the last four quarters with an average beat of 5.01%.The Progressive Corporation Price and EPS Surprise The Progressive Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The Progressive Corporation Quote What the Quantitative Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively show that Progressive is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

411,ALL,"The U.S. Senate passed The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, marking President Donald Trump’s first major legislative victory. The reform, which brings down the tax rate to 21% from 35%, is anticipated to be an overall positive for the corporate sector.Trump noted that such a bill is a “big, beautiful Christmas present” for families, while the White House press secretary said that “a simple, fair, and competitive tax code will be rocket fuel for our economy, and it's within our reach.”Notably, this biggest ever one-time drop in business tax will likely be conducive to economic growth. However, insurers and companies in the finance sectors, such as banks, will have to endure some short–term pain before enjoying the benefits.Initial Impact Not So GlossyThe initial impact of tax reduction to be borne by companies in the insurance sector will be in the form of a write-down in deferred tax assets (DTAs). This is also likely to a take a hit at their risk-based capitalization levels.DTAs arise when an insurer records an asset equal to the expected future amount of the tax deduction, because of the requirement to discount loss and unearned premium reserves.  Rating agency Standard & Poor's estimates that its rated U.S. life insurers had about $35 billion of DTA on their statutory balance sheets as of Sep 30, 2017.The new tax bill requires some insurers to write down DTAs to align their balance sheets to the new tax regime.Per the S&P, the reform will lead to an aggregate write-down of about $14 billion of life insurers’ DTA, representing 4% of statutory capital. Consequently, this will hit the capitalization levels of some insurers. Deterioration in Risk Based Capital at regulated subsidiaries would also impact subsidiaries’ ability to pass on dividend capital to the holding company.Reinsurer RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (RNR  -  Free Report) recently announced an estimated $40 million of reduction in its net income on account of DTAs write-down.MetLife estimates its RBC to be down by 65 basis points. Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report) expects an around 100-point impact to the RBC at the PICA level. Torchmark estimated a reduction of around 50 basis points on the assumption that the tax rate would go down to 25% but the magnitude of decline has been more than anticipated.The S&P also stated major changes from the tax bill to multinational entity taxation rules. Shift to a territorial tax system and the base erosion tax provisions will affect U.S. insurers with international operations as well as foreign reinsurers with admitted domestic subsidiaries.The rating agency expects some degree of repatriation of offshore retained profits to bring cash into the country (from foreign subsidiaries). Conversely, the increased excise tax may result in reinsurers and certain insurers, which use offshore reinsurance captives, adjusting their capital optimization strategies or product pricing due to the higher taxes.Long-Term More AttractiveWhile the near-term impact on insurers is not all positive, the long-term effects would definitely be more attractive. A lower tax rate would flow through the bottom line and aid margins directly. Apart from boosting margins, the tax-rate reduction will also make U.S insurers more competitive globally.In addition to the above, the tax reform, which includes lower domestic tax rates on repatriation of income stashed offshore, will well serve foreign insurers that moved abroad the profit generated in the United States to avoid tax.The bill looks like a major legislative achievement, having been supported widely by industry groups. The Coalition for American Insurance, which represents major U.S.-based insurance groups (Alleghany, The Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report), American Family, American Financial Group Inc., Berkshire Hathaway, Cincinnati Insurance, CAN, EMC Insurance, Liberty Mutual, The Hartford, Travelers and W.R. Berkley Corp.(WRB  -  Free Report), has also endorsed this historical reform.Since the passage of this bill, the industry has grown 0.2%, outperforming the S&P 500’s increase of 0.1%. Going ForwardThe year 2017 had been an eventful one for insurers given huge catastrophe losses on the one hand and the tax reform on the other. We expect 2018 to be smooth for the players as they adjust to the new tax regime and ultimately reap the benefits of a lower tax rate.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

414,ALL,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put The Allstate Corporation (ALL  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Allstate has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.4, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 21.4. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Allstate’s current PE ratio somewhat above its midpoint (which is 12.2) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 29.7. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Allstate has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 16.8, so it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near future.  P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Allstate has a P/S ratio of about 1.0. This is substantially lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is equal to the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.ALL is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P/S metric, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Allstate currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes ALL a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Allstate is just 2.0, a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 2.6. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, ALL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Allstate might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of C. This gives ALL a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen six estimates go lower in the past sixty days and one higher, while the full year estimate has seen five upward and two downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen about 19.3% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has risen about 6.7%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Allstate Corporation (The) Price and Consensus  Allstate Corporation (The) Price and Consensus | Allstate Corporation (The) QuoteThis mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineAllstate is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a decent industry rank (top 44% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happen, this stock could be a compelling pick.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

415,ALL,"The Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report) has performed quite well despite facing multiple challenges owing to the recent natural calamities.For the first nine months of 2017, this property and casualty insurer incurred $2.64 billion loss due to the catastrophe, up 16.1% year over year. However, Allstate bottom line grew a whopping 70% year over year. The upside might have been driven by revenue growth (3.7%), which was higher than rise in expenses (0.4%).Also, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 57%.What’s Buoying the Stock?Allstate’s stellar performance was backed by decrease in the frequency of auto accidents and improved profitability in auto insurance, which reflects the profit improvement actions initiated in 2015.Meanwhile, investments made for long-term growth in businesses such as Allstate Benefits, SquareTrade and its connected-car platform at Arity seems to be paying off, which is evident from an increase in the company’s current policies and higher premiums.Also, the company is gradually gaining ground after suffering from declining income in its investment portfolio for the past many years due to market volatility and low interest rates. Net investment income rose 11% for the first nine months of 2017, reflecting higher performance-based results and stable income from market-based portfolios.Bottom-line results also improved backed by Allstate’s share buybacks. Through the first nine months of 2017, the company repurchased 10 million shares or 2.7% of those outstanding at the beginning of the year. It further remains on track in executing the $2 billion repurchase program that was approved in August.So far this year, the stock has gained 42% compared with the industry’s growth of 19.4%. Additionally,  the company scaled a 52-week high of $104.18 on Dec 13.What to Expect?Of late, Allstate incurred a loss of $516 million from the California wildfires. This, in turn, might dent the company’s underwriting results to some extent. However, its inherent business strength is expected to help Allstate emerge as a winner and deliver a positive earnings surprise once again.The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 7.2% upward over the last 60 days. This also reflects analyst optimism about the company’s earnings performance.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAllstate holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Some other top-ranked stocks in the same space are Mercury General Corp. (MCY  -  Free Report), NMI Holdings Inc. (NMIH  -  Free Report) and ProAssurance Corp.

416,ALL,"RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (RNR  -  Free Report) expects to incur catastrophe (cat) loss of $90 million, from the California wildfires.In the fourth quarter, these losses will further weigh on the company’s bottom line.RenaissanceRe incurred a loss of $9.63 per share for the first nine months of 2017 compared to earnings of $5.14 in prior-year period.Unprecedented catastrophe led to net claims and claims expenses of $1.6 billion in the first nine months of 2017, significantly higher than $0.4 billion in the year ago period.AIR Worldwide, a catastrophe modeling firm expects insured losses from wildfires to exceed $10 billion.This specialty insurer has witnessed multiple weather-related losses in 2017. The results in the third quarter were severely hurt by hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, the Mexico City Earthquake. These natural calamities are estimated to have caused damages of more than $100 billion and underwriting losses at many insurers and reinsurers.So far this year, the stock has declined by 5.9%, underperforming the industry’s growth of 17%.   Losses Estimates Provided by Other PlayersThe Allstate Corporation (ALL  -  Free Report) has estimated pre-tax catastrophe loss of $516 million for October 2017 due to California wildfires.Another insurance giant, American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) has projected $500 million loss from the same event.Travelers Cos. Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) estimates pre-tax loss in the range of $525 million to $675 million and after-tax loss in the $340 million to $440 million band.Bottom LineOn the face of it, catastrophe losses resulted in an increase in loss ratio, thereby hurting insurers’ underwriting margins. However, these losses act as catalysts in turning the industry's pricing cycle. The industry which has amassed a huge capital buffer and led to soft pricing (thanks to a benign cat loss environment in recent years) will likely see price surge in certain lines of business that have been mostly affected.RenaissanceRe carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

417,ALL,"A slew of catastrophe events hounded the previous quarter, disrupting results of insurers, particularly the property and casualty insurers. Successive hurricanes like Harvey, Irma, Maria and two Mexican earthquakes have badly affected the underwriting results for the non-life insurers. While many incurred underwriting losses, others faced slump in underwriting profit.However, capital reserve, built by insurers owing to a not-so-active catastrophe environment, is helping companies meet insurance claims.In fact performance of the insurance industry impacted by hurricanes-related losses dragged the results of the Finance sector in the third quarter. The current year is estimated to be the costliest in terms of cat loss.There is no end to insurers’ worries as the fourth quarter has already witnessed wildfires in California. This is expected to further dent the fourth-quarter underwriting results.The industry has underperformed the S&P 500 index quarter to date. While the index has clocked a gain of 2.8%, th industry has grown 1%.However, a series of catastrophes has probably induced insurers to raise pricing that remained flat for long owing to a benign catastrophe environment. Also, with unemployment rate declining, demand for insurance is shooting up. This in turn will drive premiums higher, which is the primary source of insurers’ revenues.Also, interest rate environment has been improving gradually. The Federal Reserve has hiked rates three times since December 2016 after keeping the rates at near zero since the recession of 2008. There is a chance of one more hike this December with the Fed having earlier indicated about the same possible hikes in 2017 and three more in 2018. With a progressing rate environment, investment income is also set to increase. Investment income is an important component of the insurers’ top lineStrategic initiatives for a diversified portfolio besides mergers and consolidation to accelerate growth, expand globally and add capabilities leverage insurers’ position for a strong, healthy performance.Key Stock PicksBanking on prudent underwriting and core strength, the bottom ¬line of several insurers is able to beat estimates. We zeroed in on five property and casualty insurers that were not only outperformers in the third quarter but have potential to still maintain the momentum and deliver solidly in the fourth quarter as well.  Infinity Property and Casualty Corporation  provides personal automobile insurance products in the United States. The company delivered a 1050% earnings surprise in the recently reported quarter.

418,ALL,"On Nov 15, the stock of The Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week high of $101.12. This upside is believed to have been driven by strong third-quarter results.    In a year’s time, the stock has returned 39.8%, significantly outperforming the 15% growth logged by the industry and 18.1%, by the S&P 500 index.Investors favorably viewed the company’s impressive performance, which saw the stock beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a wide margin of 81.8% on the bottom line, driven by improved auto insurance margins and strong investment results, despite incurring losses of $861 million related to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.  The top line also surpassed estimates by 13.1%, thereby cementing investors’ confidence in the company’s ability to grow its premium in a tough and competitive market environment.The recent quarterly results reflected the company’s success in reaping profits from a number of growth initiatives (such as profit improvement plan in its auto business and efforts to diversify its business and product offerings) taken in last two years. In the recent past, the company suffered from huge claims in its auto business and its overall premium remained under pressure due to low pricing and a competitive market.Shareholders remain impressed with the company’s financial strength and its commitment to proactively manage the shareholders’ capital. During the third-quarter earnings call, Allstate authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program.The company also recently announced a new reporting structure, which will expand its financial reporting segments from four to seven.

421,ALL,"The Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1, after market close.Last quarter, Allstate beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 53.3% and grew 122.6% year over year on higher revenues. The upside was driven by premium growth as well as an increase in net investment income. The customer base rose to 75 million policies in force.The company has an impressive surprise history. It surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 36.9%. This is depicted in the graph below:Allstate Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise Allstate Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Allstate Corporation (The) QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q3 FlashbackAllstate’s earnings have been exposed to catastrophe losses. The first half of 2017 bore the brunt of cat losses and the same is expected in the third quarter, which was shaken by massive catastrophes – Harvey, Irma, Maria.The company has provided preliminary estimates of cat loss of $774 million on a pre-tax basis, owing to weather-related destruction in July and August.In the first quarter, the company closed the acquisition of SquareTrade, a protection plan provider for consumer electronics and connected devices. Allstate previously said that the deal would dilute earnings for three years.Therefore, the effect of the same will be felt in third-quarter results. During the second quarter, Allstate Insurance Company executed a 100% quota share reinsurance agreement with SquareTrade’s largest third-party insurer, which should result in higher underwriting and investment income.The company’s customer-focused strategy and a wide variety of products and services sold through an extensive distribution network will likely result in higher policies issued, thus driving top-line growth.We also expect to see improved auto insurance margins, reflecting broad-based profit improvement plans initiated by the company over two years ago.A large component of the company’s operating income results from investment income so despite the continuation of historically low interest rates, the company has managed well on this front. The portfolio is proactively managed and is primarily a high-quality fixed income portfolio, which generates predictable earnings with modest growth.In the second quarter, the company reported an increase in net investment income and we expect superior performance in the third quarter.Allstate’s capital strength and financial flexibility enables it to manage shareholder capital. The company returned $903 million to its shareholders in the first six months of 2017, which reduced outstanding debt at the beginning of the year by 2.1%. Continuing this trend, shares bought back during the third quarter will push up the company’s bottom line.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Allstate is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Allstate has an Earning ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.09 per share is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank:  Allstate carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Lincoln National Corp. (LNC  -  Free Report) will report third-quarter 2017 earnings results on Nov 1. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.55% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Voya Financial, Inc. (VOYA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.22% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company is expected to report third-quarter earnings results on Oct 31.Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.91% and a Zacks Rank #2.

422,ALL,"Plagued with the ongoing malaise due to a flurry of hurricanes and other catastrophes, the insurance industry seems to have lost much of its sheen to the investors at large. Their sentiments got further dampened by the Fed’s announcement to keep the interest rate unchanged at its most recently held meeting.Havoc Wreaked by Weather Related EventsHaving been blessed by Mother Nature for many years now, the insurance industry has of late faced its immense wrath. Although benign catastrophes in recent years had favored the property and casualty players, their severities took a worse turn with a slew of hurricane strikes namely, Harvey, Irma, Maria, affecting parts of the United States one after another.Economic losses from Irma are estimated at about $58-$83 billion while the same from Harvey could be as high as $108 billion by Moody’s Analytics. Catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide estimates industry insured losses for Maria in the Caribbean between $40 billion and $85 billion.The AIR Worldwide firm has also provided an insurance industry loss projection following the huge impact of the 8.1 magnitude earthquake that hit Mexico in early September. The figure enormously ranges between $0.8 billion and $1.1 billion. Per the same global catastrophe risk modeler, the industry loss estimate is expected up to $2.1 billion, following another tremor that rocked Mexico on Sep 19, 2017.These losses are anticipated to create a dent in underwriting margins for the property and casualty insurers. Insurer The Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report) expects to incur a catastrophe (cat) loss of $593 million pretax ($385 million after tax) from Harvey.Another player, Infinity Property and Casualty Corporation, expects to suffer approximately $10-$15 million of weather-related loss.Low Interest Rates Add to WoesInterest rates are like a double-edged sword for the property and casualty insurers. Though low interest rates protect the value of bonds in their investment portfolio, it takes a toll on their investment yields. An increase in interest rates leads to higher investment income, which is another source of revenue for insurers.A near-zero interest rate from past many years has eaten into the insurers net investment income pie. Despite the rate hikes by the Fed (unchanged at the meeting concluded last month), interest rates remain pretty abnormally low to contribute meaningfully to investment income.Other headwinds the industry grapples with are soft pricing and stiff competition, prompting insurers to relax their rigid underwriting standards in order to gain more business. This exposes them to higher probability of incurring claim cost.How to Gamble With the Stocks for SurvivalThe uncertainty phase persisting in the industry makes it difficult for investors to pick up the right stock to invest in.The safest stock in this backdrop would be the one providing a steady stream of income. Significantly, the still-low interest rate scenario makes the dividend stocks a solid choice for investors looking for a steady benefit.A stock rewarding shareholders with consistent dividends would be the top stock pick in such a scenario.Here are some stocks that qualify our criteria:Aflac Inc. (AFL  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Notably, 2017 marks the 35th year of consecutive dividend growth. Its current dividend yield of 2.1% exceeds the industry’s metric of 1.9% that it belongs to.We expect the company to continue with the dividend growth path, backed by a favorable U.S business and a strong balance sheet.  Though the company is facing weakness in Japan business, chances are slim that its dividend policy will be affected by it.Cincinnati Financial Corp. (CINF  -  Free Report) has increased dividend for 56 consecutive years, an impressive feat achieved by only seven other U.S. public companies. It carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Its dividend yield of 2.6% outpaces the industry’s 0.5% yield. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.       .   There is no question of the company to deviate from the dividend growth track, given its strong diversified business, wide agent network, disciplined underwriting and a strong balance sheet, which should support future dividend growth.Old Republic International Corp. (ORI  -  Free Report) carrying a Zacks Rank #3, has raised dividend for 35 consecutive years. Its dividend yield of 3.9% is amply higher than the industry’s 1.9% tally.The company’s diversified revenue and earnings from general P&C and title insurance subsidiaries, good profitability, moderate use of financial leverage and high cash flow assure us of an impressive dividend growth story to continue in the long term.<!--{cke_protected}{C}%3C!%2D%2Dtd%20%7Bborder%3A%201px%20solid%20%23ccc%3B%7Dbr%20%7Bmso-data-placement%3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E-->4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.
