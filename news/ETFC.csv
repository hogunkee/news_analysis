3,ETFC,"Can the future really be female if an unspoken gender gap keeps quietly eating away at women's futures? While women have been shown to outperform men at investing, they tend to shun the stock market for the deceptive safety of cash savings, leaving men to reap the gains — and keep a grip on the world's private wealth.This disconnect between women and Wall Street runs deep. Hollywood portrayals only underscore the divide, from the chest-thumping boys' club in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" to ""Sex and the City"" heroine Carrie Bradshaw. As she once said about investing, in a phrase that launched a thousand Etsy posters: ""I like my money right where I can see it — hanging in my closet.""In the real world, millennial women in particular are financially vulnerable. The investing gender gap can amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars over the course of a lifetime. That means the difference between being in control of the future and being swept away by the undercurrent of daily expenses.""One thing we realize more than ever these days is that money is power. And that if you don't have as much money as the guys do, it can put you in a tough position,"" says Sallie Krawcheck, CEO of investing platform Ellevest. ""It can keep you in a job you don't want to do. It can keep you in a relationship you don't want to be in. It can keep you from taking that trip around the world, or starting the business you've been dreaming about.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCompared with the average single man, the average single woman's net worth is three times smaller, according to a joint study from Merrill Lynch and Age Wave.Pay equity is part of the equation, compounded by the fact that women are more likely to pause their careers to raise children and take care of aging parents and spouses. Compared with a man with no workforce interruptions, the average woman cumulatively has earned $1.06 million less by the time she hits retirement age.""Women, generally, we're leaning in to our careers and we're becoming much more comfortable around being ambitious professionally. But we're not having that same dynamic (with our money),"" says Jennifer Barrett, a former CNBC personal finance editor and the current editor-in-chief of Grow, a web publication from micro-investing app Acorns. ""It's to our detriment if we don't invest.""No matter where you look, the numbers are pretty straightforward: Compared with men, women are tepid about the stock market. Some 57% of women didn't invest a dime in 2017, vs. 44% of men, according to a recent Acorns study. If handed a thousand bucks, 2.5 times more men than women said they would put that money in stocks. Women also lag men in 401(k) participation and contribution, says the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies.Some women are already feeling the fear of missing out.The Merrill Lynch/Age Wave study found that 41% of women said their greatest financial regret was not investing more of their money. That even trumps career, credit-card and lifestyle woes.Thirty-year-old Caroline Rhoads, an account director at a marketing firm in Philadelphia, said Wall Street ""seems very intimidating.""She has consulted a financial planner once, invested around $1,000 through a Robinhood account, and feels good about her 401(k) and financial future. But she invests conservatively, ""because I feel like if I'm going to invest I need to know what I'm doing, and I don't.""Bridging the investing gender gap may seem abstract and distant, particularly for 20-something women mired in student debt, decades away from retirement. But there are serious consequences for not at least trying to get the ball rolling.""In not being comfortable investing, what you're saying is you're not comfortable building wealth,"" says Barrett. And the gender gap there is ""growing, not shrinking, even as women are earning more and closing the wage gap. We still have a gaping wealth gap.""If it's so important, why is there a dearth of female investors? What accounts for this gender gap in the market? More than a couple of things, it turns out.Think back to ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and Leonardo DiCaprio's testosterone-fueled, Martin Scorsese-directed yacht parties, filled with models and bottles. And earlier this year, an E-Trade Financial (ETFC) ad showed men cavorting with bikini-clad women on a yacht. Who wouldn't want to be associated with that lifestyle?Uh, women.""I can't help but equate Wall Street with the a**hole bros filling lower Manhattan bars most nights, who drink too much, act rudely toward women, and generally behave badly,"" wrote Refinery29's Work & Money Director Lindsey Stanberry in a 2016 story on how to invest. ""Do I really want to put my hard-earned money in their hands? (No.)""Ellevest's Krawcheck says the fact that the investing gender gap even exists ""tells me that women are not being well served by the existing investing industry and by Wall Street.""She should know. Her Wall Street cred includes stints as the head of Merrill Lynch and Citigroup's (C) wealth management divisions. Now she is a vocal proponent of something she calls ""financial feminism,"" or wealth equality between men and women.And no, the solution isn't slapping a bunch of pink labels on existing financial products. Of her days at the heavyweights, Krawcheck said efforts to appeal to female investors didn't consider their financial desires.Ellevest's ""gender-aware"" investing algorithms, she says, consider key differences about women. Their salaries peak sooner than men's. They earn less over their lifetimes. They are more likely than men to outlive their resources.So she aims to help investors reach their goals, not beat the market. Wall Street's obsession with outperforming the stock market indexes ""leaves women completely cold,"" she says.Female investors are more interested in reaching certain milestones, such as retiring at a certain income, buying a home or starting a business, she adds.And she's quick to dismiss the notion that women's risk aversion toward stocks drives the investing gender gap.""It's not that she's risk averse, she's risk aware. And the industry has done a poor job explaining risk to her,"" said Krawcheck of female investors. ""When she understands it, she's happy to take it.""But it's true that women are doing less with their money. Financial services startup SoFi found that men contribute 32% more to their investment accounts than women do, and tend to invest more aggressively.Meanwhile, women are equally or more confident than men in paying bills and setting budgets. But they're far less confident about managing their investments, say Merrill Lynch/Age Wave researchers.Maybe that's why female investors keep more of their money in cash. According to an oft-cited BlackRock study from 2015, female investors keep 68% of their portfolios in cash vs. men's 59%.The apparent safety of a savings account, however, is deceptive. Over the long run, hoarding cash is a terrible way to increase net worth. Consider the math: Interest rates on savings are near zero while inflation is now 2%, which means that $1,000 in the bank today is objectively worth less in the future.Additionally, it pays to take advantage of compounding interest.Say you invest $500 tomorrow in a low-cost index fund that tracks the S&P 500. Then add 50 bucks to that account every month thereafter. Say it grows by an average 8% every year. (Over the last 90 years, the average yearly return for the S&P 500 has been 9.8%, even accounting for crashes.) In 30 years, a no-interest savings account would have grown to $18,500. Your investment in the stock market would have amassed $73,001.26.Still, that's easier said than done for those who don't trust Wall Street. There's a whole generation of women and men who remain deeply distrustful of the stock market. Both the dot-com crash and the Great Recession blindsided them in their formative years.""In a short period of time, they saw two recessions and two market meltdowns,"" says Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride. ""Those memories are fresh. So a lot of (millennials) just never warmed up to equities and have taken a naturally risk-averse stance, detrimental though that may be to their long-term financial health.""Younger people prefer real estate and cash over the stock market, according to Bankrate surveys. And millennial women in particular are in a financially precarious position.""Here's my concern, and it's heightened for millennial women,"" says McBride. ""Millennials are going to have the biggest retirement savings burden in history,"" thanks to longer life spans, fewer pensions, more uncertainty around Social Security, and higher health costs than any generation before them. And holding on to safe-haven assets like gold, he says, is not going to cut it.""To accumulate retirement savings, you need the power of compounding to do the heavy lifting.""Michelle Trejo, a 29-year-old quality assurance engineer in Los Angeles, says that her main vehicle for retirement is her 401(k), though she isn't sure how much she's contributing. Once she saves more money, she is looking to invest in real estate, and then potentially in the stock market.""I wish I knew how to play (the stock market),"" says Trejo, who has dabbled in cryptocurrencies, a far higher-risk investment than stocks. ""I know there's a lot of money there. I just don't know how to get started.""Some experts venture that women get a one-sided directive about what to do with their money: Spend it.""Generally speaking, if you look at who's spending money on clothes and keeping up with the trends,"" says Barrett, ""it's not men. It's women.""Think about how many magazines or style blogs talk about buying ""investment pieces"": a classic necklace, a blazer that will never go out of style. An analysis from purse reseller Baghunter will have you believe that a Birkin bag from Hermes is a better purchase than gold. Of course, that assumes you hold on to the bag for 35 years and keep it in mint condition.""When we talk about buying a handbag as an investment, it makes me cringe,"" said Barrett.That mindset extends beyond the investing gender gap to the venture-capital world.Men with wealth are encouraged to amass more wealth, said The Helm CEO and co-founder Lindsey Taylor Wood at the recent United State of Women conference. Her venture fund invests in female entrepreneurs.""Their buddies are like, 'Get in on this deal, invest in this company, buy this stock,' "" she said. By contrast, ""women with wealth are invited to give their money away. 'Chair this gala, join this nonprofit, be on this board.' ""A notable 61% of women would rather chat about their own death (!) than talk about money, according to Merrill Lynch/Age Wave data.""In our society, talking about money is pretty taboo for women; we learn this from childhood,"" says Ellevest's Krawcheck. ""If you're not talking about money, how do you know what raise to ask for, or how to invest? The answer is: You don't. And women are the poorer for it.""That deep-rooted behavior is encoded early on. In fact, 63% of millennial women vs. 53% of their male peers learned from their parents about saving money at an early age, according to a recent PNC Investments survey. But only 29% of those same women said their parents showed them how to grow wealth, vs. 37% of men.""(There are the) stories that we tell ourselves and the stories that we've heard and internalize,"" says Acorns' Barrett, who is writing a book about the wealth gender gap. ""That investing is hard, that you need to be wealthy to invest. Women in particular get that message a lot. And if you look at the research — even the way parents talk to their sons and daughters about money is different.""Kathy Mirescu, a 40-year-old director of product design, is far from the norm when it comes to enthusiasm for personal finance. It is a quality the Los Angeles resident learned from her mother, a self-taught commercial real estate investor with an accounting background who ""was always looking for investment opportunities and would talk about them"" openly with her three children.""I just grew up not really thinking about it, until I became a lot older, and I started realizing that a lot of my friends, a lot of my peers, who are college educated — a lot of them have advanced degrees — didn't know a lot of the things that I just knew"" about finance, said Mirescu.She bought her own condo at just 29. The down payment came from cash and proceeds from the sale of blue chip stocks that her mother bought for her early on in life.Now Mirescu wants to start an investing club that will help her friends and other women become more financially literate. ""To just simply have a place where we all get in a room,"" she said, and ""help each other set up Roth IRAs.""Acorns' survey found that 42% of women chose Oprah as the person they'd be most likely to take investing advice from. More than half of men chose Warren Buffett.That likely speaks more to women's trust in Oprah than the gender gap, says Barrett. But it also serves to highlight how few female investors are well known on Wall Street.""If you think about really famous investors — can you think of a woman?"" she said. ""We don't have a lot of female role models."" (According to the Merrill study, 45% of women don't have a financial role model, to be exact.)Krawcheck, who took the stage at the United State of Women conference to hearty applause, is an emerging rock star in the realm of financial feminism. At the mention of the Ellevest founder, Mirescu starts ""fan-girling."" (Her words.)She, too, sees money as a ""feminist issue.""""It's about having choices, and money gives you the freedom to have choices,"" says Mirescu. ""And choice is a linchpin of feminism.""Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Millennial Investors Love These Stocks: Robinhood's Top 20 HoldingsHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersWhat Is The Stock Market And How Does It Work?

6,ETFC,"Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) led four top stocks pulling back to their 50-day moving averages on Friday. A strong rebound from that key technical level can offer a chance to add shares to your position. But with the Nasdaq composite and other leading stock market averages tumbling Monday on trade war fears, Apple stock and Nvidia stock plunged below that key support level. Nvidia also sold off below its buy point. Financial stocks E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and SVB Financial (SIVB), well extended from their last buy zones, also undercut their 50-day lines.XWhile Apple stock is clearly the most popular name in the group, it lags with a Composite Rating of 84 out of 99. E-Trade leads the group with a 99, and is closely followed by SVB with a 98 and Nvidia with a 97. Top stocks typically have strong Composite Ratings when they launch big moves.When looking for stocks to buy, in addition to strong technical action, it's important to look for top fundamentals. The Composite Rating combines factors such as earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and price performance.Apple stock is back below a three-weeks-tight buy point of 190.47 as it pulls back to the 10-week moving average. Shares are back in buy range from a double-bottom entry at 179.04, closing Friday at 184.92. Apple stock fell 1.5% to 182.17 in Monday's stock market trading, below its 50-day line.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA 10-week-line pullback represents an add-on buying opportunity when the moving average is above a buy point. However, you want to ensure that the stock is finding support at this level, rather than losing it. You also want to buy as close as you can to a rebound off the line is sound strategy.It's key to remember that a rebound off the 10-week line represents a chance to add shares to an existing position, rather than initiate a new one.A stock falling through its 50-day line, especially in high volume, is not good action. Investors should examine their portfolios and consider sell rules.As for investors on the sidelines, look to see if these stocks rebound by the end of the week. A brief foray below the 50-day line, by itself, is OK. But you should wait for a strong rebound.Nvidia stock was 5% from a double-bottom entry at 239.35 on Friday even as it pulled back toward its 10-week line. But keep in mind that Nvidia's base is later stage whereas Apple's double-bottom is an early-stage base. Later-stage bases can work, but they have a higher chance of failing since they form after a stock has already been on a big run.Nvidia tumbled 4.7% to 239.12 on Monday, knifing below its 50-day line and the 239.35 entry in above-average volume. The stock has now roundtripped a 12% gain from the buy point, a strong sell signal.E-Trade stock is finding support at the 10-week line after trading in a relatively tight range over the past several weeks. Shares closed Friday 16% extended from a late-stage consolidation first cleared on March 9.This represents the stock's first pullback to the 10-day line above the buy point. Investors can add shares to their positions at the first two pullbacks, but after that — without the formation of a new base — the stock would be considered too extended.E-Trade stock fell 3.4% Monday, below its 50-day line.Lastly, SVB Financial stock is pulling back to its 10-week line too.

7,ETFC,"Vanguard Group is ratcheting up the money-management price war as investors increasingly focus on costs. The fund group said last week it will begin offering almost 1,800 exchange traded funds commission-free to online customers on its brokerage platform.Vanguard, which currently sells only 77 of its own ETFs without commissions, will extend the program to products sold by rivals such as BlackRock (BLK), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and State Street (STT), the Valley Forge, Pa.-based firm said in a statement July 2. The no-fee offer won't include inverse and leveraged ETFs, which Vanguard considers speculative investments.""This is about giving investors access to more low-cost options,"" Karin Risi, managing director of Vanguard's retail investor group, said in a phone interview. She said Vanguard has been spending money on its brokerage platform over the past few years to improve the customer experience.Vanguard, a pioneer of low-cost index investing since the 1970s, has been matched and occasionally beaten in recent years on the price of ETFs or other passive funds by BlackRock, Schwab and Fidelity Investments as competition heats up in one of the industry's fastest-growing segments.

Charts also help you spot the right time to sell and take your profits.In part 1 of this series on chart reading for beginners, we answered two basic questions: Why use charts? What's in a stock chart?In this second installment, we'll go over three telltale clues to look for in a stock chart to help you know when it's time to buy, sell or hold. Once you know how to spot these signals and understand the concepts behind them, you'll be ready to capture solid gains with the three most profitable chart patterns.TIP: Watch our free Stock Charts Decoded webinar for an overview of how to read stock charts.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIt's easy to overcomplicate chart reading. But as we saw in part 1 of this series, charts simply tell you a story. And to understand what tale is being told, you really just need to answer the three basic questions discussed below.So keep it simple. You'll be surprised by how much you can learn about the health and potential of a stock just from these three clues.Editor's Note: If you come across terms or concepts you're not familiar with, check out part 1 of this series for more details.The first question to ask when looking at a stock chart is, ""What's the trend?"" There are basically three possibilities: uptrend, sideways, downtrend.As simple as that concept may sound, it's also quite important. You want to buy stocks when they're going in the right direction — up.Why buy a stock that is clearly heading south? Yes, it may eventually find a bottom and reverse that trend. But why jump in when it's headed the wrong way? Wait until it shows clear signs of renewed strength and begins moving in the right direction.When a stock is moving sideways, there's no clearly defined trend. You don't know if the stock will jump higher or take a nosedive. Again, why take the risk at this stage? You're better off waiting for the stock to show signs of a new uptrend.Charts tell a story. They show you if a stock is being heavily bought or aggressively sold by large investors. But the only way to decipher that story is to look at the changes in share price together with the changes in volume (i.e., the number of shares traded that day or week).Share prices fluctuate daily, up or down. To see if the buying or selling is serious — and to see if the underlying trend is changing — you need to check the volume.For example, say a stock normally trades 1 million shares a day. If the share price rises or falls a bit one day and volume is around 1 million shares, that's nothing unusual. But if the stock suddenly trades 3 million shares one day as it gains 5%, you know something is up. You want to pay particular attention to those kinds of unusually heavy-volume days or weeks.Let's look at some different scenarios and what they mean.Price GAIN In Unusually Heavy Volume: Look at the weekly chart for Netflix below. The video streaming giant's share price has been rising sharply since the end of 2016. And as indicated by the arrows in the chart, there were several weeks where Netflix's share price rose sharply and volume also spiked.What story does such behavior reveal? That mutual fund managers and other large investors are aggressively scooping up shares. This so-called ""institutional demand"" is exactly what you want to see, since it's these large investors that provide the fuel a stock needs to make a sustained climb.Nvidia, which rose over 650% after being highlighted in the IBD 50, offers another example of strong institutional demand. In the daily chart below, look how the stock was trading in a tight range right along its 50-day line in April and May of 2017 (1). The stock then gapped up on May 10 in volume 268% higher than normal (2). And note how volume continued to come in well above average as the stock moved higher in the days that followed (3). Large investors were clearly in buying mode. The stock spiked again in heavy volume on June (4).Price DROP In Unusually Heavy Volume: This is the exact opposite of the scenario above. A large drop in price accompanied by a big spike in volume shows large investors are aggressively dumping shares. In other words, the selling is serious. As the example of 3D printing stock 3D Systems (DDD) shows below, it's especially worrisome if the stock is crashing below the 50-day or 10-week moving average line when that happens.Look how volume rose sharply as the stock crashed right through its 50-day line (1). And the same thing happened as the stock failed to find support at the 200-day line (2). These were both signs that after a big run prior to 2014, 3D Systems' trend had changed.Price GAIN In Unusually Light Volume: If the share price is rising significantly, but volume is normal or below average, what does that tell you? That, at least for now, large investors are not buying aggressively. In other words, there's not a lot of conviction for the move.Such moves can turn out to be a head fake, which was the case for Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) in the chart below. The stock broke out from a base, but volume was well below average (1). On the day of a breakout, you want to see a 40% or larger spike in earnings to show strong demand. Old Dominion fell well short of that.In the days that followed, note how volume rose sharply as the stock fell (2, 3). So a light-volume breakout attempt turned into a heavy-volume sell-off. Such behavior is a clear sign that large investors are in selling, not buying, mode.Price DROP In Unusually Light Volume: When a stock falls but the number of shares traded is much lower than normal, it tells you large investors are not selling aggressively. This is an important clue that can help you sit tight and hold on for bigger gains down the road.The example of Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) below proves that point. While Ollie's was building a new flat base, note how volume on down weeks was below average (1). It was also finding support at the 10-week line. As the arrows in the chart indicate, the stock broke out of that base in heavy volume and showed several heavy-volume up weeks as the stock climbed higher for months. It's a clear example of how you can see what fund managers are up to by looking for unusual spikes in price and volume in a stock chart.Last but not least, see if your stock is finding support or running into resistance at key lines like the 50-day and 10-week moving averages. Also look for support or resistance at important price areas, such as new or recent buy points in a chart pattern.How your stock performs at these testing grounds reveals a great deal about its strength. Why? Because many fund managers and other large investors closely follow these benchmarks.If these big players still favor the stock, they'll often step in to pick up more shares and protect their positions when it pulls back to the 50-day or 10-week line. Their buying will keep the stock above those benchmarks. But if the stock crashes below the moving average in heavy volume, it's a sign that large investors have shifted into selling mode.Take Alarm.com (ALRM) as an example. As it was making a nice run in 2017, the stock consistently found support at its 10-week moving average (1, 2, 3). It was in a clear uptrend, and there were several heavy-volume up weeks — a sign of institutional demand.But note how that trend changed toward the end of that year. The stock failed to find support at the 10-week line and crashed below it in heavy volume (4). After that, note how the 10-week moving average changed from an area of support to a line of resistance (5, 6).Lines Of Defense: You can think of the 50-day and 200-day moving average lines as a stock's first and second lines of defense. (On a weekly chart, the equivalents are the 10-week and 40-week moving averages.) If a stock fails to find support at the 50-day line, see if it can at least hold its ground at the 200-day moving average. In the case of 3D Systems discussed earlier, you can see how the stock failed to find support at either benchmark, and crashed below both of them in heavy volume (1 and 2, above).Steppingstones: E-Trade Financial (ETFC) shows how stocks will often form steppingstones as they climb higher. This happens as the stock hits resistance (1) and pulls back, then finds support (2) and rises again. It's very healthy action to see a stock turn a former ceiling of resistance into a new floor of support.In the next installment of this series on chart reading for beginners, we'll go over the three most profitable chart patterns: cup with handle, double bottom and flat base.As we do that, you'll see how each of the three telltale clues discussed above come into play:You can also learn more with our free lessons on how to read stock charts.

9,ETFC,"Five financials within striking distance of buy points are your top stocks to watch this week: Square (SQ), PayPal (PYPL), TD Ameritrade (AMTD), E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and SVB Financial (SIVB).E-Trade and SVB Financial lead the group of financial sector names with the highest-possible IBD Composite Rating, a 99. TD Ameritrade and PayPal each earn a 96, while Square has a 94. The Composite Rating combines a variety of fundamental and technical metrics, like earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance. IBD's research shows many top stocks have high Composite Ratings when they make big moves.Square is just extended from a cup buy point of 58.56. Even though a handle with a slightly earlier entry shows up on a daily chart, it isn't long enough and is not present on a weekly chart. With Square only slightly above the 5% buy range from the cup, it could pull back to a buyable level as many leaders do. If you're looking to buy, make sure that pullback is gentle. Square stock fell 0.8% to 61.29 on Monday.Payment processing peer PayPal is right at a double-bottom entry at 84.09. PayPal initially cleared that level on June 4, but lost 2.3% Thursday amid the Nasdaq's distribution day. But the decline for PayPal came in light volume. Shares reclaimed the entry on Friday, but dipped 0.5% to 83.89 Monday, back below the buy zone.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOnline broker TD Ameritrade, which is a member of the IBD 50 list of leading growth stocks, is hovering just below a buy point. After retaking the 50-day line June 1, shares are near a flat-base entry of 63.11. TD Ameritrade pulled back 1.25% to 61.53 on Monday.And E-Trade, another online brokerage, is well extended from a flat base first cleared in March, but it could soon provide an opportunity for existing shareholders to add to their positions. The IBD 50 stock is working on a four-weeks-tight buy point at 66.17, highlighted in aqua on a weekly chart in MarketSmith. E-Trade retreated 1.4% to 64.48 on Monday. With the three- and four-weeks-tight patterns, you want to buy as close to the buy point as possible.SVB Financial is an IBD 50 member as well. And like E-Trade, SVB is working on a four-weeks-tight pattern too. The entry point is 328.01, but SVB stock slid 1.4% to 321.11 on Monday. SVB Financial is the parent of Silicon Valley Bank, which is a lender to notable tech companies. It saw earnings surge 90% last quarter.All of these top stocks have relative strength lines that have been moving more or less sideways at or near record highs. The RS line measures price performance vs. the S&P 500. While the RS line isn't a make-or-break factor for a successful breakout, an upward-sloping RS line when a stock clears a buy point is a bullish indicator.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Futures Fall With Eyes On Trump; Facebook, Cisco, RH, E3 In FocusStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksBanks And Financial Stocks: Latest News And AnalysisWhat's Today's IBD Stock Of The Day?

11,ETFC,"When a company posts high pretax margins year after year, the situation points to two realities.The first reality is that the company is doing something right. The second is that the company might be operating in a space where high profit margins are the rule, not the exception.Take a look at three stocks that have appeared recently in the Big Cap 20 with the best pretax margins.The three are Mastercard (MA), E-Trade (ETFC) and Charles Schwab (SCHW).See a trend? Yes, the money businesses are places where high margins are commonplace.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn that situation, how should an investor respond? Should the investor buy shares and then sit back and watch the stock price rise?If only it were that simple.When weighing stocks with high pretax margins, the investor should ask two questions.How do those margins look vs. companies in the same industry group? (Maybe in that context they are not so high after all.)And how do the margins compare to the company's history? (In some cases, margins may be declining.)Mastercard posted a pretax margin of 53.6% in 2017.In the eight previous years from 2009 to 2016, Mastercard's average pretax margin was 51.9%.The highest was 55.1% in 2013. The lowest was 44.1% in 2009.Within the credit payment processor group, only one stock in 2017 had a higher pretax margin than Mastercard — Visa (V), which had a 64.7% pretax margin last year.E-Trade Financial pegged a 45.9% pretax margin in 2017. In three of the previous eight years, the company lost money. The average pretax margin in the remaining five years was 25.7%.Does that sound like a problem? It isn't. Pretax margin stepped up in each of the past five years — 17.2% in 2013 and then 25.3%, 36.6%, 41.4% and 45.9%.Within the brokerage group, two stocks had a higher pretax margin than E-Trade — Interactive Brokers (IBKR) (pretax margin 54.4% in 2017) and MarketAxess (MKTX) (50.9% in 2017).Charles Schwab achieved a pretax margin of 42.4%. This represented the fifth consecutive year of increasing pretax margins.The average pretax margin over the previous eight years was 31.8%.In the brokerage group, the three aforementioned brokerages did better than Schwab on pretax margin — Interactive Brokers, MarketAxess and E-Trade.Although profit margins are important, the full range of CAN SLIM criteria should be considered before buying a stock.In some cases, a strong stock may have thin margins. Amazon.com (AMZN) had a pretax margin of 2.1% in 2017. Netflix (NFLX) delivered a pretax margin of 4.2% last year. Yet, both companies had strong revenue growth in 2017.RELATED:Oil Driller Offers High Dividend YieldP/E Ratio? Forget About ItHow To Find The Next Big Winner In Stocks

13,ETFC,"Three IBD Stock Spotlight names, Splunk (SPLK), E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and ServiceNow (NOW), ended the week in buy ranges.Big data mining tools maker Splunk was in buy range above 112.76 in a seven-week cup base. The base is a third-stage pattern. Maybe more important, it marks the stock's first move above its historical highs set up in February 2014. It is an interesting position to be in with the company due to report on May 24. The April-ending fiscal first quarter is traditionally Splunk's weakest quarter, and analysts are calling for the largest loss (9 cents per share) in the company's history.Consensus views project revenue will rise 84%. But it is worth noting that the company has topped consensus views over the last four quarters by margins ranging from 12% to 75%.E-Trade Financial was knocking out new highs on Friday, climbing toward the top of a buy range above a three-weeks-tight buy point at 62.03. It is the stock's first buy opportunity since an earlier breakout from a flat base failed in early March. The stock pulled back more than 8% below that base's 58.10 buy point, triggering the automatic sell rule.That was no surprise, because the base is a very late-stage base. Breakouts from such bases carry added risk of failure. The same is true of three-weeks-tight patterns — particularly those that occur after late-stage bases. The clear message for investors is to keep their stops and sell rules tight.E-Trade recovered with five straight weekly gains after finding support at its 10-week moving average early in April. The stock jumped nearly 3% in very heavy trade on April 20, just after the company's first-quarter report. The stock on Friday was up 30% since the start of the year, and showing a 12-month gain of 84%.ServiceNow was in buy range above a 176.66 buy point in a flat base. The initial move above the entry occurred in quiet trade. So you would like to see a bump of big volume to confirm the move as a breakout.RELATED:Apple's Big Run Teaches Crucial Lesson For Investing SuccessWalmart, Home Depot, Tencent, Cisco Earnings: Investing Action Plan Splunk Just Within Buy Range As Earnings ApproachActive Asset Allocation Made Easy With IBD ETF Leaders Index

14,ETFC,"In every issue of IBD Weekly, mini weekly charts for each stock of the IBD 50 stocks offer a concise snippet of guidance. The goal: answer many key questions.Is the stock in buy range? Or too far extended? Should you snatch some gains now? Or is the stock selling off so badly that a full exit is the right move?Is there another place to get even more detailed commentary and insight on what the top leaders are doing right now? Yes. Leaderboard, which launched a brand-new interface and new features on Thursday, can help.IBD's market writers create annotations on daily and weekly charts of the top 10 stocks ranked within the IBD 50. When one of these stocks hits an ideal time to buy, a blue annotation gets added. For sell signals, watch for annotations in red.These features arm both the beginning investor and the seasoned veteran with even more expertise on market timing. These annotations are placed in real time and are based on the rules IBD has developed through decades of research on what actually works in the stock market.Leaderboard users see regular updates on current action and a ""Leaderboard analysis"" for these top 10 stocks. The analysis also helps optimize the management of stock positions to reduce risk when the rally becomes long in the tooth. When market choppiness and corrections intensify, a user will get suggestions on when to cut the position by half. When the market uptrend resumes in bullish fashion or if the stock improves, the analyses note the precise moment in which to turn a half-size position back into a full one.Netflix (NFLX) ranked No. 10 within the IBD 50 at Thursday's close. The online video streaming giant joined the Leaders list of Leaderboard on Dec. 6, 2016, just as it rushed past an early entry point at 120. By February, the stock rose to 145. Leaderboard put a red annotation on the weekly chart, suggesting to take profits as the breakout gain hit the 20% threshold.Those with tons of conviction could, of course, decide to hold longer. Netflix has formed numerous bases since then, but the uptrend has stayed intact. More recently, on April 5, Netflix re-entered the Leaderboard as a half-size position. This made sense, given that market swings have been much more intense vs. 2017. On April 17, Netflix's Leaderboard chart showed a switch to full position following strong Q1 results. But the stock got cut back to half position just five trading sessions later as the stock began to gyrate.The most recent annotation to return to a full position? On April 26, as Netflix held firmly above the 50-day moving average. Institutions were shoring up the stock.Abiomed (ABMD) ranked No. 2 on Thursday. The Leaderboard analysis pointed out that buying back shares at 304.38 was justified, even though the stock had just flipped beneath that proper buy point. Abiomed triggered the golden rule of investing (cut your losses short). Yet it sometimes pays to buy back a good stock a second or third time. You need courage. But if the fundamentals are superior, and the market remains in a confirmed uptrend, you don't want to miss the potential big move.The chart noted how Abiomed has been showing nice buying support near the 10-week moving average. That's a hallmark of great stocks as they make their big price runs.E-Trade Financial (ETFC), also in the top 10, shows a third-stage base count on the annotations in its weekly chart. The higher the base count, the more risk that a breakout will fail. But the online broker continues to show positive action in the RS line and its tendency to hug its 10-week line.Trade the IBD 50 in one click with the Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) ETF, managed by Innovator Capital.

They might have better brand recognition, but recent earnings and sales growth at Interactive Brokers has been impressive. Strong execution and technology expertise are two big reasons why.The company on Tuesday reported another strong quarter. Adjusted earnings per share jumped 85% from the year-ago quarter. Revenue vaulted 52% to $621 million.Interactive Brokers was a beneficiary of increased market volatility in the first quarter.

20,ETFC,"There's a dirty little secret in investing. It's sort of like those studies that show a pretty woman or a handsome man is more likely to be hired than someone who is ugly.Stocks are no different. A stock will be forgiven chart flaws more readily if the fundamentals are not just good but beautiful. Different rules for different folks? Well, yes. Who said life was fair?Netflix (NFLX) is a good example of a beautiful stock. Earnings grew 191% last year and are expected to surge 118% this year.The stock broke out in January and then advanced more than 60% to a March 12 high. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq scored an intraday high within a day of Netflix's high.The Nasdaq then corrected about 11%. Netflix fell almost 19%.If a stock has so-so fundamentals, then that bigger-than-average pullback might be regarded as a serious flaw. But for a hot growth stock, a sharper correction is accepted, and a quicker rebound is expected.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThere's more.Netflix's decline stopped near its 50-day moving average. The stock bounced off the line Tuesday and added a nice cushion since. This is Netflix's first trip to the 50-day line since its January breakout. The bounce provided a secondary entry, or did it?Volume was quiet on the rebound until Wednesday when turnover was 29% above average. Was the 29% spike in volume sufficient to create a buy area?Many investors would say yes. Why? Because Netflix's fundamentals are beautiful. Shares have continued to climb.Netflix's return on equity, a gauge of financial efficiency, was almost 18% last year — the best in six years.Annual sales jumped 32% in 2017, above the five-year growth rate of 26%. The Street expects sales to jump about 35% this year.Netflix will report Q1 results Monday after the close.The market's new uptrend could create more buy candidates for bulls to corral. Besides Netflix, are there others in the Big Cap 20?Several stocks are well-positioned for possible buys. Let's look at the chart and the fundamentals.Cloud-based tech software developer ServiceNow (NOW) is a tough read chartwise.The stock has made multiple trips to the 50-day line since a July breakout. However, if a chart reader interprets a consolidation from Oct. 23 to mid-December as a flat base, then the recent trip to the 50-day line is its first. The prudent interpretation is to treat the stock as extended.ServiceNow grew earnings 75% and 70% the past two years.Other stocks showing promise are online brokerage E-Trade Financial (ETFC), robotic surgery equipment maker Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) and drugmaker Zoetis (ZTS).Annual EPS growth for those three stocks was 21% to 25%, good but not all that pretty.RELATED:Millionaires Are More Common These DaysOld Advice Is True Advice: Follow The Rules In InvestingWhen To Sell A Great Stock That You Made Money On

21,ETFC,"Online brokers E-Trade Financial (ETFC), TD Ameritrade (AMTD), Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Interactive Brokers (IBKR) look attractive thanks to rising profit estimates and industry tailwinds.E-Trade Financial moved back into buy range on Tuesday, as the stock market moved back into a confirmed uptrend.TD Ameritrade and Interactive Brokers are close to forming bullish consolidations. Along with E-Trade, they boast relative strength lines at record highs. The relative strength line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. The RS line hitting a new high with or ahead of a stock breaking out is a bullish sign.Charles Schwab isn't acting quite as well as the other online brokers, but is still worth watching. Charles Schwab and E-Trade are members of the S&P 500 index.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHere is a closer look at the online brokers:The New York-based discount brokerage boasts double-digit earning growth over the past five years, which is seen to continue over the next two.EPS should climb 42% to $3.30 in 2018, with a 15% gain to $3.78 in 2019.Shares of E-Trade rose 3.1% to 57.26 on Tuesday, back above a 56.10 buy point initially cleared on March 9. The stock peaked at 58.49 before falling back as the stock market entered a correction. E-Trade didn't quite fall 7% to 8% from that entry, so it was still valid. After finding support at the 50-day line, E-Trade had been flirting with the buy zone in recent days.The stock fell 0.2% to 57.14 on the stock market today.E-Trade makes the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks. It plans to acquire 1 million Capital One Financial retail accounts, holding around $18 billion in assets.IBD'S TAKE: Watching a top-rated stock move up in a base and waiting for it to clear a proper buy point can make investors restless. You might think to yourself that you can save a percentage point or two by buying a stock just below a buy point. But this is why breakouts matter.TD Ameritrade also ranks among IBD 50 stocks, with its RS Line signaling outperformance of the broad market.Earnings per share will rise 72% to $3.05 in 2018, according to Zacks, with a 24% jump to $3.79 in 2019.Shares of TD Ameritrade fell 0.7% to 59.48 Wednesday after advancing 3.1% Tuesday. Ameritrade has been finding support at its 50-day moving average over the past few weeks.The stock is working on a flat base that would be valid at the end of the week, with a 63.11 buy point.TD Ameritrade should benefit from rising interest rates, which boost net margins. It generates a lot of its income from asset-based revenue, such as interest on margin loans.But it also depends on trading-related revenue, such as commissions, which were slashed last year amid an industry fee war. The growth of free investing apps is a potential future challenge.Interactive Brokers' RS line continues to make new highs despite the stock's lofty 63% gain in 2017.EPS should jump 40% to $2.13 in 2018 and 13% to $2.40 in 2019.Shares rose 2 cents to 71.09 Wednesday after rising 3% Tuesday.  Interactive Brokers will have a flat base at Friday's close, with a 74.21 buy point.Charles Schwab should see high earnings growth in the next several years thanks to higher interest rates and growth of the brokerage's bank, Morningstar says.EPS is estimated to rise 45% to $2.40 in 2018 and 18% to $2.84 in 2019.Shares dipped 1.1% to 50.93 after Tuesday's 2.6% gain.

22,ETFC,"While the market remains in a confirmed uptrend, solid losses the last two days on the major stock indexes are a bit worrisome. With that weakness, breakouts among top growth stocks like Align Technology (ALGN) over the past several weeks have produced mixed results. The condition of recent breakouts provides a great deal of insight into the strength of the broader market.Among top financial stocks, retail brokerage firms E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and Interactive Brokers (IBKR) both announced strong quarterly earning results during the week, but reactions were mixed.E-Trade topped earnings estimates Thursday, sparking an advance Friday to the highest level since November 2007 and moving the stock out of buy range.The stock broke out on March 9 in heavy volume above a 56.10 cup-shaped base entry. After a brief pullback to the 50-day line, where it found support, the stock is trading out of the 5% buy range that tops out at 58.91.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMeanwhile, Interactive Brokers is just below a 74.24 flat-base entry after a breakout on Wednesday. While the stock's reaction on earnings wasn't great, the stock is still holding up despite the past two days of weakness in the stock market, so patience is justified.Canada Goose (GOOS) surged above a 36.76 cup-with-handle entry Thursday, as volume increased 80% above average. The IPO Leader and SwingTrader idea was trading modestly below the entry Friday afternoon. This is another breakout that may take some patience.Leaderboard member Planet Fitness (PLNT) is trading tightly in its 5% buy range after a solid breakout on April 17. The relative strength line — inked in blue on every MarketSmith chart — is hitting new highs, underscoring the stock's strength.On the downside, Align Technology plunged nearly 9% Thursday after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock from overweight to equal-weight. The stock's fall triggered the 7%-8% loss-cutting sell signal from a 277.42 cup-with-handle entry.However, there were two major flaws in the stock's basing pattern. First, the cup with handle was a later-stage base, which increases the risk of failure. Second, the stock's breakout on April 18 could only be described as meek. The stock briefly poked above the entry before closing just under it, and volume was tepid.The breakout day should leave no doubt as to the stock's strength, with a volume increase of at least 40% above average.Elsewhere, LGI Homes (LGIH) faltered Thursday amid weakness within the overall homebuilder group. Shares were about 1% below the 72.10 cup-with-handle entry.RELATED:S&P 500 Rises On Netflix, Oil, But Chips, Apple Tumble: Weekly ReviewBanks And Financial Stocks: Latest News And Analysis3 Rules For How To Buy Stocks Like Salesforce During Earnings Season

26,ETFC,"Leading stocks near buy points can be hard to find in the later stages of a stock market rally.But two IBD Stock Spotlight names, E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and RingCentral (RNG), were less than 1% from buy points on the stock market today.

Both measures indicate strong participation from institutional buyers.The stock's relative strength line held just below its Friday high – a sign of strength relative to the overall S&P 500.The base was technically a late-stage pattern, however. That means the breakout could carry some added risk. Investors adding to their positions will want to keep their limits on their sell rules tight.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseComputer software developer RingCentral eased 1.5% in soft trade Monday, leaving it 2% above a 65.85 buy point in a three-weeks-tight pattern.The stock is up 34% since its last breakout, from a flat base in mid-January. Investors could have taken some profits starting at around 60. The follow-on opportunity provided by the three-weeks-tight entry is a good place to push some of that capital back in at a reduced-risk entry.Monday's weak-volume pullback was no cause for real concern. A drop all the way to the stock's 10-week line would undercut the 65.86 buy point by 7% to 8%, just a hair shy of triggering the automatic sell rule.Ring's relative strength line is in great shape, just a whisker off Friday's high. Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a solid A-, and its Up/Down Volume Ration reads a powerful 1.9.The company's earnings are rising from low levels, so the percentage gains are big: triple-digit year-over-year percentage gains for the past 10 quarters. EPS is expected to surge 300% to 12 cents in the first quarter.

58,ETFC,"Stocks in the trading business have been hot and cold, but iShares U.S. Broker-Dealers & Securities Exchanges (IAI) has smoothed out the fluctuations to show a respectable gain this year.The fund illustrates how a portfolio that combines various elements of an industry can trend higher even while some stocks or segments fall out of favor. Since at least 2017, the ETF has corrected no worse than 10% and it's maintained a moderate uptrend since the November 2016 election sparked a rally in financials and other sectors.So far this year, iShares Broker-Dealers is up 10%, beating the S&P 500. The average annual returns (as of May 31) are 35.1%, 16.8% and 18.8% over the past one, three and five years.The portfolio breaks down into three parts. Investment banking and brokerages make up 72%, while financial exchanges are a 27% weighting. A tiny 1% is in custody banks and asset management firms. This year's performance among those and related industries has varied.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIBD's specialty financial services industry is up 7%. From that group, the ETF's stocks include exchange operators Nasdaq (NDAQ), CME Group (CME) and IntercontinentalExchange (ICE).The investment bankers and brokers group is up 4%. That includes ETF components such as E-Trade Financial (ETFC), TD Ameritrade (AMTD), LPL Financial (LPLA) and the largest holding of the fund, Charles Schwab (SCHW).But IBD's money center banks, which includes Wall Street veterans Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), is down 4%. Shares of those two institutions remain near the lows of their current price consolidations and underperform other holdings.There's been multiple factors influencing the brokerage and exchange companies this year. Rising interest rates have expanded net interest margins — something noted in Morgan Stanley's Q1 earnings report. The regulatory environment has been easing for banks and other financials. Higher market volatility has resulted in more trading activity — and commissions — for brokers.But financials are lagging several other sectors this year, including software, apparel, health care and semiconductors.To its credit, iShares Brokers-Dealers and Exchanges has a number of solid stocks. Charles Schwab is up about 25% from a breakout to new highs in November. Nasdaq shares are up about 20% from a November buy point. E-Trade has risen some 45% from a Nov. 27 breakout.Among losers, Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) plunged in early February after trading was halted on several inverted volatility products, potentially lowering trading volume at its Chicago Board Options Exchange. The stock has yet to recover. Lazard (LAZ) has been basing most of the year.The ETF itself is forming a cup-with-handle base with a 69.49 buy point.

The stock first tried to clear that level on May 22, but hit resistance and reversed lower.The buy point for Akamai Technologies, which is in IBD's Internet-Network Solutions group, remains valid because the stock only fell as much as 3.5% from that level.

Amazon stock cleared a buy point of 1,617.54 on Wednesday. It eclipsed the old peak of 1,638.10 on Thursday, offering another entry point. Both moves came in light volume. Amazon climbed 1.45% Monday to 1,665.27, a new high.Akamai's key customers include software stocks Salesforce (CRM), Adobe (ADBE) and Autodesk (ADSK), as well as online brokerages Charles Schwab (SCHW) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC).If and when Akamai attempts a breakout, look for heavy volume on the upside as that indicates support from institutional investors. Also keep an eye out for an upward-sloping relative strength line, which measures a stock's price performance vs. that of the S&P 500. Right now the RS line is trading somewhat sideways. An RS line at a new high during a breakout is a bullish indicator.This base has a handle. When a stock forms a handle on a cup base, that's a positive development. It provides a chance to shake out weak holders before the stock moves higher.Akamai earns an IBD Composite Rating of 91 out of 99. The Composite Rating includes a variety of fundamental and technical factors, including earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity, and relative price performance.Last quarter, the company broke a streak of quarterly earnings declines, with growth of 22%. Akamai also saw its second straight quarter of accelerating sales growth. The tech firm is expected to issue its next quarterly report near the end of June.The Internet-Network Solutions industry group ranks No. 35 out of the 197 industries IBD tracks.

114,ETFC,"With a portfolio featuring leading stocks like Amazon (AMZN), Charles Schwab (SCHW), E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) as of Dec. 31, $1.9 billion USAA Growth & Income Fund (USGRX) is going strong after having outperformed both its Morningstar large-cap blend category and the S&P 500 in four of the six most recent full quarters.Its 0.79% gain so far this year going into Thursday — after the market's recent volatility — is also ahead of the big-cap bogey and its peer group.X The fund owes its portfolio firepower to a double-barreled management approach. The fund is run by two groups of managers, who work independently of each other. That doubles their opportunities to generate investment ideas. One group consists of subadvisors Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss, who focus on value-oriented stocks for the fund. The second team works for USAA Asset Management, and they focus on growth stocks.""Using two managers with different approaches can potentially provide more consistent returns over the long term,"" said USAA's Wasif Latif, who oversees the teams running the two sleeves.Currently, Barrow Hanley runs about 40% of fund assets, with the balance run by the USAA team. Parent firm USAA maintains that ratio by allocating new inflows.Although the Barrow Hanley team's mandate is to focus on value stocks, their portfolio sleeve still includes leaders like E-Trade and UnitedHealth, which happen to have several traits of top-notch growth names, such as IBD Composite Ratings of 99 and 94 as well as SMR Ratings of A and B respectively.Amazon and Schwab are in the fund's growth sleeve. Amazon sports a red-hot 99% three-year annual earnings per share growth rate. Its three-year sales growth rate is 26%.IBD'S TAKE: Keep up with news and analysis of Amazon at IBD's web page devoted to the e-commerce and cloud-computing colossus.Schwab's three-year annual EPS growth rate is 22%. Its EPS is expected to grow 45% this year.And if ups and downs in the stock market today presage additional volatility in the near term, the fund's blended approach should serve it well, says Mark Giambrone, head of the Barrow Hanley team. The value sleeve has ""traditionally outperformed (the overall market) during weaker periods in the market,"" Giambrone said.Still, Giambrone blames recent market volatility on program-trading by index funds. Fundamentals are still sound, in his view. ""We have a positive economic backdrop for corporate earnings and cash flows and consumer confidence and spending,"" he said.E-Trade shares are up 46% in the past 12 months. Giambrone's sleeve has owned E-Trade for several years. As a value investor, he seeks to buy stocks when temporary ills have dropped their share prices. He bought his current E-Trade stake when it was trading below book value due to investors' concerns about its portfolio of home-equity loans, he says.Those loan woes have been cleared up, he says. ""They're garnering market share,"" he said. ""They're benefiting from rising rates (which allows its net interest margin to expand on clients' cash in its custody). And we expect consolidation among online brokerage firms.""Dow Jones industrial giant UnitedHealth is the Giambrone sleeve's largest nonbank position. He sees the firm as a health care technology and services provider. Half of its earnings, he says, come from its Optum unit, which provides pharmacy benefits management and technology services and also runs clinics and doctors' offices.Optum's data cache enables UnitedHealth to lower its own costs and its charges to customers. ""Optum is an incredible growth engine and differentiator for UNH,"" Giambrone said. ""It helps current healthcare clients and non-healthcare clients lower cost trends through technological advances. It is a key driver of the investment thesis.""Overall, UnitedHealth has great cash flow and a reasonable valuation. ""It's mostly a U.S. business, so it's helped by recent tax law changes, which can help raise its earnings,"" Giambrone said.Giambrone also likes Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL). Shares in the multi-cruiseline operator are up about 35% in the past 12 months.Royal Caribbean should benefit from expansion of destinations and markets in China and Cuba, Giambrone says. At the same time, industrywide supply of ships shows only modest growth. Giambrone says earnings should grow for years.He added, ""The company has not benefited from tax reform. But once the market settles and focuses on long-term benefits (of tax reform) rather than short-term reform, the company will benefit meaningfully.""Giambrone says regional bank KeyCorp (KEY) benefits from healthy loan growth. ""Credit (risk) is fairly stable, and tax reform will have a big positive impact on the bank,"" he added. KeyCorp's 2016 acquisition of First Niagara should provide economies of scale, he says.He added, ""We think the regulatory environment should get better for banks. The 'SIFIs' threshold may rise to $250 billion, which would make it easier for them to expand.""SIFIs threshold refers to the asset level at which banks are deemed systemically important financial institutions, triggering much stricter oversight, including higher capital buffers.RELATED:2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Price Gains, With A Foreign TiltYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

118,ETFC,"Sometimes a stock will break out, but then soon pull back below the buy point. But if it hasn't fallen too far, the buy point is still valid.

None of them came close to falling 7%-8% below their entry points, which would trigger an automatic sell signal. They are worth watching in case they reenter buy zones, especially in strong volume.Their relative strength lines, which track the stocks' performance vs. the S&P 500 index, are generally at or near the highs of their consolidation.Apple and Microsoft, both Dow components, were roughly 1.5% off their entry points as of Friday's close.

129,ETFC,"Robinhood trained its sights at crypto trading app Coinbase as well as the likes of TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and Charles Schwab (SCHW) Thursday with the move to let investors buy and sell Bitcoin and Ethereum for no extra fee.X But Bitcoin and crypto-related stocks retreated broadly on the news that some of the largest banks are cracking down on credit-card purchases of these volatile virtual assets, as well as signs that the Securities and Exchange Commission may seek to regulate sales of new digital tokens, known as initial coin offerings or ICOs.Here is the latest on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency news and trends:Robinhood, the millennial- and smartphone-friendly app for trading stocks, will allow customers in California, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana and New Hampshire to trade cryptocurrencies for no commission fee starting in February.The zero fee compares with reported 0.5% to 4% fees on Coinbase, a popular crypto-focused trading app.But Robinhood is already offering certain crypto services to all customers. Starting today, its customers can monitor market data and create custom price alerts for 16 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Ripple.Announcing Robinhood Crypto, the company said it will allow users to invest commission-free in cryptocurrencies alongside stocks and ETFs, billing itself the first major online brokerage to support cryptocurrency trading.""We believe that cryptocurrencies have the potential to fundamentally reorganize the way money works from the ground up, putting power previously held by financial institutions directly in the hands of the people,"" the company said.The ability to trade Bitcoin on the Robinhood platform will take place in stages across U.S. states. The later debut of trading is ""to add a level of predictability to the market and not catch the market by surprise, like others have done,"" it added.Robinhood has more than 3 million users and has seen more than $100 billion in transactions on its platform.Brokers such as Interactive Brokers (IBKR), TD Ameritrade and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) allow clients to trade Bitcoin futures, but not the digital currencies themselves. Other brokers such as Ally Financial (ALLY) and Schwab have considered a move to enable Bitcoin futures trading or are watching the space.More than 100,000 people lined up for early access within hours of the unveiling of the Robinhood Crypto website.Bitcoin traded 1.1% lower at $11,277.95 on Coindesk Thursday, off intraday lows. Ethereum was up 1.7% at $1,075.51, and Bitcoin Cash rose 1.6% to $1,663.11.Among Bitcoin-related equities, Riot Blockchain (RIOT) closed down 6.9% on the stock market today, Long Blockchain (LBCC) gave up 7.2%, Overstock.com (OSTK) fell 6.5%, Marathon Patent Group (MARA) dipped 0.3%, while Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) rose 0.9%.IBD'S TAKE: It is crucial for investors to understand the difference between cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and the blockchain software programs that enable them. It is also important to get a feel for just how speculative digital moneys like Bitcoin are right now before investing directly in the currencies or through related exchange traded funds or stocks.The broad crypto decline came as The Wall Street Journal reported that banks such as Capital One Financial (COF) have begun restricting customers' purchases of Bitcoin through its credit cards ""due to the limited mainstream acceptance and the elevated risks of fraud, loss and volatility.""Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C), which allow Bitcoin trades with their credit cards, are said to be reviewing their policies.Meanwhile, Wall Street's watchdog has said it wants to bring ICOs under its authority.""The SEC is devoting a significant portion of its resources to the ICO market,"" commission Chairman Jay Clayton, and J.

Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.While banking giants like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup (C) have seen trading revenue drop amid a general lack of market volatility, individual investors have been encouraged by a market that continues to hit new highs.The frenzy over Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has also drawn in more individual investors though a recent downturn may have cooled the mania.Last month, TD Ameritrade began letting its investors trade Bitcoin futures, making it far easier for millions of investors to take part in Bitcoin.Interactive Brokers also lets its customers trade Bitcoin futures and has said it would let people short Bitcoin futures.MORE YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Traders Eye Results From Interactive Brokers, AtlassianCitigroup Flirts With Breakout On Strong Earnings, But Chart Shows This FlawThese 4 Top Tech Stocks With Strong RS Lines Hit Buy Points

133,ETFC,"As tax preparation season approaches, it makes financial sense to ask yourself what's the best way to use any federal tax refund you may have coming. Or, do you even want a refund?XAfter all, money in a refund constitutes an interest-free loan to the U.S. Treasury. If you're giving those free loans to Uncle Sam year after year, you're committing a financial error. You can break that costly cycle by reducing or eliminating your excess tax withholding. And we can point out ways to use that money for yourself.Refunds typically are not humongous, but they certainly tend to be much more than mere pocket change. And they've crept up in size recently.This year through Sept. 1, the latest date for which the IRS has released data, the average U.S. refund was $2,782. That was up from $2,750 in the same period last year, although slightly down from 2016's year-end average of $2,860. Since 2009, the average refund for an individual's return has been about $2,840.Here are steps you can take to trim or eliminate your refund:But if you adjust your estimated payments, do not end up paying too little. If you end up with an underpayment, that can make you liable for IRS penalties, warns Doug Amis, president and chief operating officer of Cardinal Retirement Planning in Cary, N.C. After you reduce your estimated payment, be ready to reverse course by boosting your payments if your income rises.In addition, here are five financially smart things you can do with a refund once you do receive it. The first three are ways to make a profit. The fourth — funding a health savings account — is also a way to make money while coping with medical expenses. The fifth step — donating to charity — is financially beneficial because it can lead to a tax deduction, but it's also a way to do well by doing good.IBD'S TAKE: If you are a newcomer to stock investing who wants a few pointers, check out IBD's introduction to stock investing or IBD's mutual funds section for tips and strategies.RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

140,ETFC,"Fidelity brokerage, focused on tapping the growing ranks of investors making their own trades and managing their investments, once again ranks among the top brokers in the latest IBD Best Online Brokers survey.X In doing so, it's kept abreast of markets that are becoming more fast-paced, international and complex. The Fidelity Investments unit now has 19.4 million accounts, up 9% from a year earlier.Its combination of customer awareness and product development enabled Fidelity brokerage to nail down a sixth-straight year as a  top-five firm in IBD's annual Best Online Brokers Survey. And for the fourth year in a row, its customers gave it the highest Customer Experience Index rating among all the brokers in the survey.Rather than resting on laurels, the brokerage is fighting to increase its pace of innovation and development, adopting what Head of Brokerage Customer Experience Scott Ignall refers to as ""a spirit of innovation and speed"" injected into the environment over the past couple of years.""We really embrace pace over perfection, knowing that our customers value constant innovation, and they want to get feedback and they want to get features from us on a regular basis, as opposed to waiting for big, long six-month or one-year projects,"" Ignall said.The high-output model led to releases in 2017 of trading account facial recognition security software for Apple (AAPL) iPhone X users, security voice pattern recognition speeding customer service calls, and account monitoring capabilities for Coinbase cryptocurrency traders. Fidelity brokerage also jumped into a price war last February, cutting its commission for online stock trades by nearly 40%, to $4.95 per trade, competing with Charles Schwab (SCHW), TD Ameritrade (TD) and others.Ram Subramanian, Fidelity's head of brokerage services, also emphasizes the company's investment during the past year in upgrading its half-dozen customer service centers spread from Merrimack, N.H., to Salt Lake City. This included improving the associate work experience at those sites by upgrading the centers physically; improving hiring, training and career advancement policies; and implementing new call center technologies.Customer service has been a clear differentiator for Fidelity, which has consistently run at the head of the category for the past four years.One Florida investor interviewed by IBD, Sy N. (who asked that his last name not be used for privacy reasons), is a former CPA and a highly active trader now in his 70s. He says he runs a portfolio of several million dollars through a Fidelity brokerage account, along with accounts at TD Ameritrade, Vanguard, Schwab and eTrade (ETFC).All of these firms have wonderful people in the back office and, for the most part, they all know what they are doing, he says. But Sy says Fidelity is a cut above the others.As the trustee of an estate, Sy N. was trying to do a certain type of 401(k) rollover. He ran into brick walls at several brokerages.""It had a little complication — there was a trust involved — so it made them nervous,"" he said.Fidelity also initially said it wasn't possible, but then transferred him to a specialist who figured it out.""He helped me figure out how to do it, then he went back to the employer people, was with me on the phone, and it ended up getting done,"" he said.Lynn Shelby, a Phoenix investor who retired in September, says Fidelity also outperformed, in her opinion, at the retail level. She switched her trading account funds, a little more than $100,000, from Scottrade to Fidelity brokerage about two years ago.One reason for the switch was because she met an advisor at a Fidelity location near Shelby's home who began paying special attention to her account.""We spent a lot of time. We developed strategies,"" she said.Shelby and Sy N. are very different sorts of investors. Sy N. is moving millions of dollars in and out of stocks at a brisk clip. Shelby is taking advantage of growth stocks moving past buy points, but has really only been focusing seriously on investing since September.But both investors fit what Subramanian calls a ""self-directed investor,"" the type of customer who has become the target market for Fidelity's trading business.""A self-directed customer is someone who likes to broadly engage in the market themselves. What they ask us is 'Provide me the education, the research and the experience at my fingertips so that I can engage,' "" he said.Customers, of course, can pick and choose their tools. Sy N. uses Fidelity brokerage's basic, web-based trading platform to chart stocks and execute trades. He uses Fidelity, Investor's Business Daily and Schwab, where he keeps an account, for the bulk of his research.Shelby uses IBD's MarketSmith premium charting service for charting and tracking stocks and executes trades using Fidelity's online platform. She says she is making up for lost time in her market knowledge, reading books, taking seminars and also looking further into research offerings from the Fidelity brokerage.""Every day we get up at 6:30,"" she said. ""I say I'm not working, but really I have a little part-time job because I'm managing my money on a daily basis.""One aspect of the market that Fidelity is seeing take off among self-directed investors: options trading. The number of new options traders rose 27% in 2017, Subramanian says. Fidelity is piloting its Options Trade Builder program, which was designed to allow novice options traders to gather information and build trades.""But what we are finding now is that even more experienced, self-directed investors are finding it handy,"" he said.Fidelity is linked with both Alexa and Echo Show through Amazon.com (AMZN), increasing the capabilities and functions offered through voice control.Through a partnership with Coinbase, Fidelity brokerage allows customers to include their cryptocurrency account in their Full View monitoring feature. This allows customers to include pertinent data from all their accounts with other banks and brokerages and put it into a single monitoring and tracking application.But while Bitcoin and its digital peers are on Fidelity's radar, Fidelity does not offer access to cryptocurrency trades.""And at this point we don't plan to,"" Subramanian said. ""Our feeling is, we'll have to wait and watch. It is not an appropriate dealer offering,"" he said.Looking further ahead, Subramanian says smartphone and tablet computer-enabled mobile trading is an increasing focus for future trading technologies.""In fact,"" he said, ""a lot of the work we are doing right now, we are telling our teams to focus on build it first in mobile, and then work backwards"" into the web-based and downloadable applications.Ignall says mobile is still comparatively small but is growing quickly. Some 14.2% of all Fidelity's DARTs — daily average revenue trades — were sent via mobile in 2017, up from 11.9% in 2016. He also says there is a link between that number and the rising number of  investors under 35 years old, who constitute 15.5% of account holders now vs. 14.1% in 2015.Given that the number of Fidelity brokerage accounts grew in 2017 by what Subramanian says was more than 8,000 per day, that's a lot of young investors. It is also a fresh, rising source of feedback for the new speed and innovation-oriented Fidelity.""As we roll out new features and new products quicker, and in smaller, bite-size chunks, it allows us to get tighter with our customers to get constant iterative feedback from them,"" Ignall said. ""And (we can) increase that feedback cycle that is so critical to creating great products and services.""Want to read more about the other top brokers, the latest commission trends and more?

Stock and ETF trades are $6.95 at TD Ameritrade.Robinhood described options, like equities, as a ""thing of the past"" in the digital age, when executing a trade is purely electronic.The app maker added that its options move is tied to ""the belief that sophisticated investment tools don't need to be complex or reserved for the wealthy."" It will offer both more and less advanced options strategies, such as buying calls and puts, selling covered calls and puts, and fixed-risk spreads. The different investing strategies allow investors to not only go long on a stock when they expect its value to go up, but also to short a stock when they expect its value to go down, Robinhood said.Tom Sosnoff, a co-founder of Tastyworks, a new options and stock trading platform, welcomed Robinhood's latest move. ""The self-directed investor has been overshadowed for too long by passive, herd-driven investments,"" he said.But Michael Wong, a Morningstar equity analyst, suggested Robinhood might face an uphill task growing its appeal with options traders, who are ""generally more sophisticated than equity investors, so need the better tools and information that the more established players have."" Charles Schwab acquired optionsXpress and TD Ameritrade acquired thinkorswim to have a more sophisticated options trading platform, Wong noted. He added: ""I'm not sure if a slimmed-down options trading tool is what serious options traders are looking for.""Even as investing apps like Robinhood make inroads with investors, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab and E-Trade Financial have enhanced digital offerings for a new and young audience.Shares of TD Ameritrade fell 2.3% on the stock market today, but have advanced 9% from their late September breakout past a 47.36 buy point. Schwab, a top-rated, IBD 50 stock, and E-Trade fell 2.4% and 2.3%, respectively, both also extended from recent buy points. Interactive Brokers (IBKR), which has been running up for several months, slid 1.6%.Online brokerages, including Fidelity, have been cutting stock and ETF trading fees in the past year.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? The IBD 50, which screens for leading growth stocks, is a good place to start.Robinhood is among several new investing apps that began to allow Americans to invest in stocks for free over the past two or three years. Instead of making money with stock trading fees, Robinhood makes money with premium services such as Robinhood Gold, which lets investors trade on margin and during extended hours.Robinhood is not a publicly traded company, but it is growing fast. The brokerage has more than 3 million users, up from 2 million in April, and is valued at $1.3 billion, seeing $100 billion in transaction volume since its 2015 launch.Robinhood, which started as an app, added a web-based platform in November.Clients have saved $1 billion in commission fees by using the smartphone-based platform, which is expanding to the web, Robinhood said.RELATED:These Data Show Why The Fed Doesn't Have To Hike AggressivelyBest Stocks To Buy And WatchBanks And Financial Stocks: Latest News And Analysis

Meanwhile, apparel and shoe retailers, coal producers and oil-and-gas drillers enjoyed a year-end burst of performance. Momentum in those groups is worth watching into 2018.LGI Homes and NVR have surged 161% and 102% this year, while homebuilding peers KB Home (KBH), D.R. Horton (DHI) and Pulte Group (PHM) have fared almost as well, with gains ranging from 81% to 102%. They are benefiting from pent-up millennial demand as well as broad strength in the economy.The residential/commercial-building industry group, as a whole, soared 99.4% for the year and 23.1% in the final quarter of 2017. But headwinds loom.The housing sector tumbled in early November after the GOP tax reform plan set a cap on deductions for mortgages and property taxes.

158,ETFC,"Bitcoin began 2017 trading under $1,000. Then it got much bigger. Investors big and small arrived, sometimes bailed hard — as they did on Friday — then arrived some more. Concerns were raised that Bitcoin barely qualified as money. Concerns were raised that its immense transaction volumes were swallowing up the world's energy. Comparisons to Dutch tulip mania piled up, and a securities regulator in December said ""We've seen mortgages being taken out to buy Bitcoin.""X Which all leads to one question for 2018: Is there any chance Bitcoin's jagged, face-melting run for the stratosphere might become a bit tamer?The advent of Bitcoin futures from Cboe (CBOE), CME Group (CME) and, eventually, Nasdaq (NDAQ), has the potential to reel Bitcoin back into orbit. A Bitcoin ETF in 2018? Certainly not impossible. Greater attention from regulators could help inform investors and stamp out fraud.After a week of some moderation on spot market, volatility has roared back in recent days. Shares of Bitcoin-related stocks like Riot Blockchain (RIOT), Marathon Patent Group (MARA) and Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) are also seeing big daily moves, while companies looking to rebrand themselves with blockchain such as Long Island Iced Tea (LTEA) and Net Element (NETE) keep jumping in. And other cryptocurrencies, especially Ethereum and Litecoin, have shot up in price recently.But most big banks are unlikely, for now, to gorge on the tulips, and it's still debatable whether treating Bitcoin like a normal investment will make it behave like one. Others wonder if investors are prepared for the more complicated world of investing next year that the futures will bring — to a market where 40% of all Bitcoins are reportedly in the possession of 1,000 holders who could, on a whim, lop thousands of dollars off its price.""So, someone who put in $10,000 now has $2 million in his account — does he know how to protect it when trading might go against him?"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, a managing director at financial analytics firm S3 Partners.IBD'S TAKE: Are Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies a speculator's game? Individual investors should be extremely cautious about diving into this new area. Read this feature about Bitcoin risks and potential gains.Those questions were perhaps underscored on Friday, when Bitcoin's price crumbled below $12,000, then picked up another $1,000 later in the day, after a week of warnings from financial officials abroad and worries about possible insider trading. Bitcoin futures contracts from Cboe and CME were tracking close to the price of Bitcoin itself.Futures contracts will allow investors to wager on whether Bitcoin's price will rise or fall without owning the cryptocurrency directly. If more investors, possibly anticipating a bubble, use the futures to bet on a drop in Bitcoin, that might help tap the brakes on cryptocurrency's feverish price increases, the reasoning goes.That short-selling would also allow investors to hedge against their long bets on Bitcoin and make plays in the market more easily.""So if I bought Bitcoin at $200, and it's trading at $15,000, I might want to hedge out some of that without actually selling my Bitcoin,"" Dusaniwsky said. ""And this might be much easier with futures, to get in and out of that position intraday.""The contracts would also have trading and price limits, and could open a pathway for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund that would trade on the stock market — a development Dusaniwsky said was likely in 2018. Cboe this filed with the SEC to list six Bitcoin ETFs. The more securities available overall, the more opportunity to short. Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the company that owns the New York Stock Exchange, also wants to offer a Bitcoin ETF.The massive retail brokerage TD Ameritrade (AMTD) said this month that it will let some clients trade Cboe's Bitcoin futures, and rival E-Trade Financial (ETFC) followed days later. Also this month, Interactive Brokers (IBKR) said it would allow customers to make some bets against those futures.Last week, there were some indications that short-sellers may have moved in and tempered the markets. Bloomberg reported at that time that the price of Cboe's Bitcoin futures, which cost up to 13% more than Bitcoin itself, had over a few days drifted much closer to the spot price of the cryptocurrency.But not everyone is convinced that Bitcoin futures will mellow out cryptocurrency markets.""While the futures markets help bring traditional financial institutions into the space, they do encourage speculation rather than owning the underlying asset and are unlikely to dampen volatility,"" Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research, said in an email, noting that a Bitcoin ETF or mutual fund would instead be more helpful in easing volatility.Any short-sellers would also be betting against a cryptocurrency whose price has ballooned more than 1,300% since the beginning of 2017. While short-selling seems likely, there might not be as much of it as many are anticipating.""Number 1, short-sellers aren't gluttons for punishment,"" Dusaniwsky said. ""With Bitcoin going up $1,000 a day some days, I don't see these guys jumping into the short side, just doing outright short positions, on a whim.""Financial institutions might be fine with letting their customers make futures trades, but the big banks are largely staying away from doing it themselves.But Goldman Sachs (GS) is setting up a trading desk for cryptocurrencies and hopes to have it running by the end of June, sources told Bloomberg Thursday.That would make Goldman the first of Wall Street's top trading firms to jump into the crypto-mania. Peers like Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) are waiting to see what what happens.Bitcoin futures are too new and too small, with too little regulatory underpinning, for the banks to get into right now, said CFRA analyst Ken Leon before the Goldman news broke.The volatile cryptocurrency isn't exactly fodder for banks' wealth management divisions, either. Banks, who have tried to detox from the high-risk investments that battered them during the financial crisis, would also have to calculate the potential loss risk of any asset tied to Bitcoin.""I wouldn't expect to see JPMorgan (JPM) involved anytime soon,"" said Clyde Tinnen, a corporate-finance partner at the law firm Withers Bergman, which advises clients on cryptocurrency markets.But hedge funds are getting in the game. Fortress Investment Group and Horizon Kinetics have purchased Bitcoin recently, while executives from firms like Quantbot Technologies and Steven Cohen's Cubist Systematic Strategies recently met to discuss how they could profit from cryptocurrencies, according to the Wall Street Journal.Still, as Bitcoin's price has scorched higher, and as startup entrepreneurs attach the ""crypto"" prefix to whatever's trending, the Securities and Exchange Commission has started to notice. The agency in December stopped at least two initial coin offerings — a form of digital fundraising — that it deemed suspicious or in violation of securities laws.The SEC has also issued advice to investors to avoid getting conned, and even urged caution when considering celebrities' promotions of things like ICOs — an announcement that came after Floyd Mayweather, Jr., Paris Hilton and a few others have thrown their support behind them. ""Any celebrity or other individual who promotes a virtual token or coin that is a security must disclose the nature, scope, and amount of compensation received in exchange for the promotion,"" the agency warned in November, later adding that those celebrity endorsers ""often do not have sufficient expertise to ensure … compliance with federal securities laws.""But as Bitcoin exchanges strain under the weight of more interest and more serious money, disputes among developers over how best to speed transactions through the network seem likely to resurface in 2018.Disagreement over how to proceed has led two ""fork"" currencies that have formed out of Bitcoin: Bitcoin Cash, in August, and Bitcoin Gold, in October. Those cryptocurrencies use different algorithms and equipment and have different sizes of the blocks of code that store transaction information.As that debate goes on, or as Bitcoin's price drifts out of reach, investors could turn their attention to lower-profile, lower-drama currencies such as Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Ethereum, Litecoin and others.""Some of them could even gain advantage in the future by offering better compliance with regulatory requirements,"" JPMorgan analysts said in a research note in December.As more people have piled into Bitcoin, the doubt from bigger names in the financial world has built up on a daily basis. Most recently, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said Bitcoin's presence in the payments landscape was still very small. But she said, as others have, that it was ""not a stable store of value"" and ""highly speculative."" UBS' global chief economist called Bitcoin the ""bubble to end all bubbles"". Brian Armstrong, the co-counder and CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, said in a December blog post: ""Please invest responsibly.""""Most of the investors that I talk to, they look at Bitcoin truly as a commodity,"" Tinnen said, adding that they tend to guard against the cryptocurrency's occasional stabs downward with defensive investments elsewhere. ""I have to say that they are very enthusiastic, and sometimes that enthusiasm means that they are not always taking as clear-eyed a view as they should in order to hedge it.""Others, Dusaniwsky said, might not be the kind of traders you typically see on the stock market. They might not be familiar with the investment vehicles that are coming into the market. They might not know how to use, say, stop-loss orders, he said, or otherwise trade their positions more professionally, if the up-market this year heads south.""You've got a lot of sheep that are long Bitcoin,"" he said, ""and the wolves might be starting to get into the market.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:SEC Has This Advice For Investors In Bitcoin, Other CryptocurrenciesBefore You Buy Bitcoin, Read ThisStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

183,ETFC,"Two young financial technology companies say they are buddying up to empower tweens and teens ""to get their feet wet in the stock market for free"" — but there's a thing or two to know.XBusyKid, a so-called ""chore app"" that parents use to reward kids for doing household tasks, will offer a free $10 Stockpile e-gift card to every new customer who sets up an account on their online platform. That $10 gift of stock can be used to buy fractional shares in Amazon (AMZN) and other popular companies.For its part, Stockpile is waiving its customary 99-cent fee per stock trade, on the initial $10 free stock purchase as well as for ongoing investments made through the BusyKid platform.""It is a way for us to really attract and bring in families,"" said Dan Schatt, chief commercial officer at Stockpile, which recently won backing from a venture arm of asset manager Fidelity. ""If you get young children connected with saving and investing, it will help them their whole life.""But there is a $14.95 annual subscription fee, per family, to join BusyKid. That fee could wipe out the yearly investment gains on small accounts. BusyKid said allowances on its platform tend to be $10 to $12 a week per child.Around 35% of Stockpile users are children. This makes the micro-investing app a ""complementary fit"" with Busykid, which lets families track chores and allowances via a cutting-edge, digital platform, said Schatt.A BusyKid customer who tries to use the $10 e-gift card will be directed to Stockpile to redeem the stock. The child then gets set up with a custodial account allowing him or her to buy and sell stocks and ETFs.Of course, once the initial free $10 stock gift is used up, children will have to use earned allowance from their parents to buy any additional stock through the BusyKid platform.To electronically fund the allowance, parents must link their bank accounts or spending cards to the BusyKid accounts. Not everyone might feel comfortable doing that on a relatively unknown platform that launched three months ago. And debit and credit cards incur a small fee — 59 cents for a $10 transaction, for example.Still, BusyKid joins a slew of new apps that entice beginners to buy stocks and ETFs by making it simple, cheap or even free to invest.In the process, they're shaking up traditional financial services firms and established online brokers such as Charles Schwab (SCHW), E-Trade (ETFC) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD).BusyKid users don't have to invest their earned allowance, if they don't wish to. They can instead share it with charities or spend it at retailers. But no matter which option they choose — share, spend or save/invest — they learn about work ethic, budgeting and financial decision-making, said BusyKid Chief Executive Gregg Murset, a Utah father of six.There are no hidden fees or transaction fees on the BusyKid platform, but there is a $10 minimum to buy a stock, he added. Also, BusyKid has a $1 minimum to move or pay out an allowance.Among Stockpile's kid users, the three most popular stocks are Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA), according to Schatt.RELATED:How To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For Beginners

188,ETFC,"Buying stocks has never been easier, cheaper or more accessible, as new investment apps target millennials and beginning investors with deep interest in the stock market — but not-so-deep pockets.Robinhood promotes ""free stock trading."" Stash lets you ""start investing with just $5."" Acorns will ""invest spare change from every purchase."" And Stockpile offers ""your favorite stock by the dollar"" — so you can buy fractions of Alphabet (GOOGL) or Amazon.com (AMZN) shares, which are nearly a thousand dollars each.""Micro-investing apps have 'gameified' investing,"" said Lex Sokolin, fintech strategy director at Autonomous Research, in an interview. ""They are more about incentivizing participation in the financial markets — any participation by the younger generation — and making applications engaging and in some ways addictive.""The expansion of micro-investing apps will force the financial establishment to adapt — and could even disrupt traditional brokerages, say fintech and investing experts. But first these startups must show they can hang on to the customers they have acquired and turn a profit. That's no easy matter when incumbents such as Vanguard, Charles Schwab (SCHW), TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) have steadily lowered fees or removed minimums to trade stocks and ETFs, and have improved their digital platforms for a new generation of investors to boot.But in one early sign that these fintech startups are winning over established giants, as well as beginner investors, Stockpile said Thursday it has raised $30 million in its latest round of fundraising, led by a venture capital fund backed by global asset manager Fidelity International, bringing the total it's raised to more than $45 million.In just a few years of existence, micro-investing apps have built a core audience among millennial investors with not much in the way of investable assets.And the generation that came of age with the minimalist simplicity of Apple's iPhone doesn't want to look at screens overflowing with headlines, numbers and scrolling tickers.On Robinhood, which allows people to trade stocks for free and does away with investment minimums, there's no short interest data, analyst ratings or options information. The app is stripped of the bells and whistles found on TD Ameritrade or other fully featured brokerage apps, and doesn't even have ads that clutter the screen. Its design is carefully crafted to inspire — rather than overwhelm — the first-time investor, Robinhood says.Punch a stock ticker into the app, and you see little besides price action, a chart and a buy button. To buy the stock, enter the number of shares, preview the cost, swipe up — and you're done.""Interactions must be small, fun and easy"" for first-time investors, Sokolin said. ""Micro-investing apps nailed it better than online brokers or robo-advisors.""On Stash, you can build portfolios around investment themes like ""Clean And Green"" or ""American Innovators,"" rather than try to choose between less descriptive names like the T. Rowe Price Global Technology Fund or the Red Oak Technology Select Fund.Marie Thomasson, a 37-year-old financial planner in Los Angeles and self-described app junkie, recommends Stash to beginning investors.The app explains ""just what you need to know about investing and no more,"" she said, contrasting it to mainstream brokers' ""white papers"" that are dry, boring, outdated or overwhelming.The average age for Robinhood's 2 million users is 28, and a third of them use the app to make their first-ever stock purchase. If you think that's young, consider Stockpile: 60% of its user base is under 30 and 30% are children, who can get set up with custodial accounts.Stockpile has no account minimums and no monthly fees. And even a high-priced growth stock like Amazon can be bought for $25 or $50 or any dollar amount an investor chooses. Stockpile makes money in part by charging a flat fee of 99 cents a trade.For that amount, investors get fractional shares in the company and, often, their first taste of stock ownership, Stockpile CEO Avi Lele said in a phone call. The brokerage also offers gift cards that can be redeemed for stock, sold online and through outlets such as Target (TGT) and Safeway.But the stock ""gift card fee"" of $2.99 online ($4.95 and up in a store) — another way Stockpile makes money — has drawn flak as a hefty commission. Stockpile argues that it ensures the gift recipient gets the full stock-gift value.Lele said the app was inspired by his own struggles to scrape together a $5,000 minimum investment required by a brokerage firm. Lele was 25 before he had the money he needed to buy the Microsoft (MSFT) stock he badly wanted.""You can buy quality stocks even when you are starting out"" on Stockpile, he added. ""You can't do much with 50 bucks at a traditional brokerage.""And for those old enough to have credit cards, the Acorns app rounds up purchases to the nearest dollar and invests the change in ETF portfolios.University of Wisconsin student James Koenig, 22, estimates that his day-to-day spending nets him a $35-$50 investment every month.""Acorns is hands-down my favorite investing app,"" he said. ""I like the idea of being able to do small amounts that eventually add up to something bigger. You don't need to make a huge commitment.""There are trade-offs, of course. Robinhood, for example, offers fewer investment choices, less robust research tools, and a mobile-only trading platform. Micro-investing apps also get knocked for making stock trading much too easy.Acorns' and Stash's $1 monthly fees sound small, but could erase the yearly gains of a beginning investor who may have a couple hundred dollars or less in the apps, critics note. Jason Kirsch, a fee-only financial planner in California, argues that users have an incentive to overtrade, which can lead to huge losses, especially for novice investors.While apps such as Acorns offer some basic portfolio tracking, Kirsch finds that in more-complex situations — such as tracking individual securities for tax-loss harvesting — ""none of these apps has built-in software that makes this easy.""And Tastyworks, a new platform that enables self-directed investors to trade any investment strategy, be it stocks, options or futures, dings such apps for doing little to build either a robust technological platform or strategic know-how for investing in the stock market.""They may have captured a nice share of the business, but they may as well be selling hot dogs,"" sniffed Tastyworks co-founder Tom Sosnoff.Meanwhile, Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade and E-Trade have slashed trading commissions from $8-$10 per trade to $5-$7, narrowing the advantage that the new apps have on that score. And the incumbents have minimum balances that range from zero at TD Ameritrade to $1,000 at Schwab.In addition to questions about how much money the apps can make for their users, there is the question of how they can make money for themselves while charging nominal fees, or none at all in Robinhood's case.But in September of last year, the company launched Robinhood Gold, a premium product charging $6-$200 a month for added services like buying on margin and extended-hours trading. The service is attracting high-net-worth, active investors and becoming a major revenue driver, spokesman Jack Randall said, with some Robinhood accounts now running into millions of dollars. Robinhood also earns revenue by collecting interest on the cash and securities in user accounts.As for zero-fee trades, the company says it is able to offer this benefit because its all-electronic, tech-driven brokerage platform has slashed overhead costs. Randall dismisses trading fees as arbitrary markups with no place in the digital age, when ""executing a trade is the same as sending an email.""Robinhood is adding 140,000 accounts every month to its 2 million-strong user base, which has made $75 billion in transactions since the app's 2014 launch. But Randall could not say how many accounts are actually funded or used for trading and wouldn't share data on average account size or typical starting balance.The economics of micro-investing apps are extremely challenged, Sokolin acknowledged, while arguing that their true value lies in the opportunity to leverage the attention of audiences they have acquired.""They may offer automated savings, but then up-sell into financial planning, or provide financial literacy, or create video content and add lead-generation into other categories, or sell customer data to other parties,"" he said. ""There are lots of things you can do with a big audience other than getting them to buy funds.""Robinhood says its users check the app 10 times a day on average. That kind of engagement among a highly coveted demographic whose brand loyalties are still up for grabs could be made lucrative, for example, by monetizing users' data or up-selling premium services to them.Robinhood has won $176 million in venture capital funding since its 2012 launch and is now valued at $1.3 billion, PitchBook fintech analyst Evan Morris wrote in a recent report. Stash has raised more than $79 million since its October 2015 launch and has a $264 million valuation.

191,ETFC,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow industrials rose Friday morning after the Senate approved a budget resolution late Thursday, paving the way for up to $1.5 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years.XS&P 500 futures rose 0.2% vs. fair value, while Dow futures climbed 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.25%.It's unclear how much tax cuts are already priced into the stock market, which has rallied significantly since President Trump's election in large part on hopes for lower corporate tax rates and other reforms.Also, Trump and GOP lawmakers may have unrealistic expectations about the size of the tax cuts given the budget constraints. But the budget blueprint, passed by a 51-49 vote, is still a key step. It allows Republicans to push for deficit-financed tax cuts of up to $1.5 trillion without Democratic support, but they can afford only two defections.Before the budget vote, highly rated Celgene (CELG), PayPal (PYPL) and Atlassian (TEAM) were active in late trading on earnings and other news.Meanwhile in Thursday stock market trading, the S&P 500 index and Dow erased losses to close slightly higher, but the Nasdaq retreated as FANG stocks Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) drifted below recent breakout entry points.PayPal, Celgene, E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and Atlassian all have Composite Ratings of 95 or better. The Composite Rating, which runs from 1 to 99, combines several proprietary IBD ratings into one number. All-time stock winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 near the start of their big runs.Facebook fell 0.8% to 174.56, closing off intraday lows for 172.64 but still ending below a 175.59 buy point cleared on Tuesday. Thursday's slide wasn't that impressive, but neither was the breakout, though Tuesday's upside move came on above-average volume.Alphabet dipped 1.1% to 1,001,84 on Thursday, below its 1,006.31 entry topped on Oct. 13. Again, the Google parent's retreat was rather modest, though it did come on volume that was 11% above trend.The problem with lackluster breakouts, which have been all too common in recent months, is that they suggest a lack of institutional support. And by creeping just over buy points and not advancing, stocks such as Facebook and Google are vulnerable to going underwater on modest market, industry or company-specific news.Then again, any piece of good news or market momentum could push these stocks back into buy zones.Facebook rose 0.4% to 175.22 in premarket trading Friday, while Alphabet was up 0.3% to 1,005.11.PayPal, 98 Composite Rating: PayPal reported a 31% earnings per share gain, with revenue up 21% to $3.24 billion, both better than expected. The online payments processor gave Q4 EPS and revenue guidance basically in line with analyst views. PayPal rose 3.9% in early trading. PayPal closed down 1 cent to 67.25 on Thursday, but was up 70% so far in 2017.Celgene, 99 Composite Rating: Celgene announced that it is discounting two trials for a Crohn's disease drug and will not start a third. It said mongersen (GED-301) failed an interim futility analysis. Celgene had spent $710 million in 2014 to obtain mongersen. Shares of the biotech giant tumbled 6.1% early Friday. Celgene undercut a 139.10 buy point about two weeks ago and last Friday fell below its 50-day moving average.Atlassian, 98 Composite Rating: Atlassian earned 12 cents a share in its fiscal Q1, up 20%, with revenue up 42% to $194 million, both topping the consensus. The maker of project-management and collaborative software raised guidance. Atlassian was not yet active Friday morning, but jumped 12.5% in after-hours trading. During Thursday's regular session, the stock dipped to 39.06 intraday, below a recent 39.35 buy point, but rallied to close up 1.1% at 40.25.RELATED:The Big Picture: Bears Lose Their Grip, Stocks Continue To Break OutCelgene Falls After Scrapping Crohn's Disease Drug TrialsPayPal Earnings, Revenue Top Expectations, Shares RiseAtlassian Revenue, Profit Blow Past Estimates, Shares JumpFANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google

Shares closed Friday at 199.49, just within the 5% chase zone that goes up to 195.55.It's better to buy stocks as close to the entry point as possible, especially when the overall market has had a tendency to grind higher, with small uptrends followed by small declines or sideways action.Netflix will release results after Monday's closing bell. Analysts expect Netflix to report third-quarter earnings of 32 cents a share excluding items, up 167%  from 12 cents a year earlier.

Shares nearly became extended a few days later, but have eased back to close Friday at 44.73, just over 1% above the entry.Schwab is a leading online discount broker but a strong presence in wealth management. Schwab recently cut equity commissions to $4.95 per trade. That's part of an industrywide price-cutting spree, though many startup apps such as Robinhood aimed at beginning investors offer trades with no commissions.Charles Schwab likely will release financials Monday morning. Wall Street expects Schwab to report third-quarter earnings of 41 cents, up 21% vs. 34 cents a year earlier. Revenue likely grew 14% to $2.185 billion.Fellow online brokerage E-Trade Financial (ETFC) reports after the market close on Thursday.

E-Trade closed last week at 43.89.Roku came public at 14 a share last month, soaring 68% in its Sept. 28 debut and rising to a record 29.80 the next day. Shares pulled back and began to consolidate, now forming a short IPO base. IPO bases are typically short: usually two to five weeks.Roku closed Friday at 23. The potential buy point is 29.90, 10 cents above the high.Keep in mind that having a potential buy point is no guarantee that a stock will reach and clear it. New IPOs are particularly volatile, so don't try to get ahead of the market and buy a stock early.It's better to wait for a new IPO to prove itself before jumping in. Snapchat parent Snap also had a strong first two days after its IPO. But after peaking at 29.44 on its second day, Snap began retreating, hitting a record-low 11.28 on Aug. 14, well below its 17 offering price. Snap has since rallied to 16.50, but still has not developed a sound base with a proper buy point.Roku is best known for its small set-top boxes for streaming TV used by many to access Netflix, Hulu and other streaming channels. Those Roku devices compete against the Amazon Fire TV stick, Apple (AAPL) TV and the Google Chromecast from Alphabet (GOOGL). But hardware sales are stagnant, so Roku sees the future in advertising and subscription-related revenue.RELATED:Expectations High For This FANG Stock Ahead Of Earnings; CSX Sets UpNetflix, GE, Goldman, PayPal Lead Busy Earnings Week: Investing Action Plan5 Hot Tech Stocks Near Buy Points As Nasdaq Hits New Record HighNetflix Binges On Price-Target Hikes Ahead Of Q3 EarningsFANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Googles

One of the newest is ProShares Equities for Rising Rates (EQRR), which launched July 25.""EQRR is for investors who expect rising interest rates and want to outperform traditional large-cap indexes as rates go up,"" Michael Sapir, co-founder and CEO of ProShare Advisors, said in a statement. ""EQRR takes those sectors most positively correlated with interest rates, then within those sectors invests in the companies that have tended to outperform during periods of rising rates.""The fund, which tracks the Nasdaq U.S. Large Cap Equities for Rising Rates Index, has attracted $14.3 million in assets. The biggest sector weightings as of Aug. 21 were financials at 30%, energy 24%, materials 18% and industrials 16%. Information technology accounted for 12% of assets.Its top holdings included E-Trade Financial (ETFC), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Lincoln National (LNC) and Bank of America (BAC). The top 10 stocks, which account for about 30% of assets, are all banks or insurers.EQRR carries a 0.35% expense ratio.Fidelity Dividend ETF for Rising Rates (FDRR), set to mark its anniversary Sept. 12, has gathered $152.5 million.The fund, which tracks the Fidelity Dividend Index for Rising Rates, invests in large and midcap companies that are expected to keep paying and growing their dividends. The stocks must also have a positive correlation of returns to rising 10-year U.S. Treasury yields. Boston-based Geode Capital Management serves as subadvisor for the fund.Technology led FDRR's sector weights at nearly 22%, followed by a 14% weighting in health care, 11.5% consumer cyclical and 10% in financial services as of Aug. 18, according to Morningstar Inc. It had modest exposure to sectors such as real estate and utilities, which pay big dividends, but can be highly sensitive to increasing interest rates.Six of the fund's top 10 holdings as of Aug. 21 were Dow Jones industrial average components: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Merck (MRK) and Exxon Mobil (XOM). The top 10 comprised nearly a quarter of total assets.The ETF has slightly underperformed the broader market this year with a 7.4% return vs. the S&P 500's 10% gain through Aug. 21. FDRR's expense ratio is 0.29%.Keep in mind that with FDRR still under a year old and EQRR about to mark its first month, there isn't a proven yet track record available.The next Fed monetary policy meeting is scheduled for Sept. 19 and 20. The odds of a rate hike in December are at 40%, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.RELATED:Miss Thursday's Breakouts? 2 Fresh Ideas As Market Hits HighsNext-Gen ETFs For Rising Rates Offer High Yields And Low Volatility

209,ETFC,"The Relative Strength (RS) Rating for Lazard (LAZ) entered a new percentile Tuesday, with an increase from 78 to 81. X IBD's proprietary RS Rating measures market leadership by showing how a stock's price action over the last 52 weeks compares to that of other stocks on the major indexes. History reveals that the stocks that go on to make the biggest gains tend to have an RS Rating north of 80 as they begin their biggest runs.Lazard broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 47.19 entry from a flat base. In the case where a stock breaks out then falls 7% or more below the entry price, it's considered a failed breakout. If that happens, it's best to wait for a new base to take shape. Also keep in mind that the most recent pattern is a later-stage base, which makes it riskier to establish a new position or add shares to an existing one. Earnings growth dropped last quarter from 66% to 61%. But revenue moved higher, from 25% to 34%. The company holds the No. 6 rank among its peers in the Finance-Investment Banking/Brokers industry group. Houlihan Lokey (HLI), E*Trade Financial (ETFC) and B Riley Financial (RILY) are among the top 5 highly rated stocks within the group.RELATED:IBD Stock Rating Upgrades: Rising Relative StrengthWhy Should You Use IBD's Relative Strength Rating?How Relative Strength Line Can Help You Judge A Stock

210,ETFC,"If there was an exchange traded fund for FANG stocks, this one might be it.XFirst Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund (FDN) counts the four FANG stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) — among its six largest holdings. That's more than 30% of the fund's weighting in just those four stocks.FANG is the acronym for four companies that dominate the internet industry. Their shares have been a focal point of this year's strength in internet and other technology sectors, especially the big caps.Although the four stocks have had success this year, their charts at this point are uncertain. Alphabet is trading in the lower parts of a base it's forming. Netflix gapped up sharply July 18 on earnings, but has erased most gains. Amazon is drifting below its 50-day moving average. Facebook is holding up better, still near its highs.The fund started trading in June 2006, long before FANG became an investor buzzword. It's had good long-term performance, with shares rising 7% last year, 21.7% in 2015, 2.4% in 2014, 53.6% in 2013 and 20.7% in 2012, according to Morningstar.com.To be in the fund's underlying index, companies must earn at least 50% of annual sales from the internet. They must also have a three-month average market cap of at least $100 million, and certain liquidity requirements. Stocks are picked using a combination of market capitalization and average share volume, according to the First Trust website.First Trust Dow Jones Internet has more than 40 holdings. Other major components are electronic payments leader PayPal (PYPL), cloud-based business software firm Salesforce.com (CRM) and e-commerce pioneer eBay (EBAY).Of course, the well-known internet brands such as Twitter (TWTR), Expedia (EXPE) and Groupon (GRPN) are also in the ETF.Not all are in the technology sector. Online brokers E-Trade (ETFC) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD), as well as health care technology company Veeva Systems (VEEV) are in the portfolio.First Trust Internet's shares are testing support after pulling back to the 50-day moving average. A good bounce from the line would put the ETF in a buy area. Shares already are near the 98.18 buy point of a flat base from a breakout about a month ago. But market risk is higher than normal right now, and that applies even to a diversified investment such as an ETF.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market. A computer algorithm selects the ETFs based on relative strength and other objective performance ratings, with periodic adjustments for market trends and conditions.

223,ETFC,"Finding the best mutual fund to protect and grow your hard-earned retirement savings can take a little skill and, it might sometimes seem, a lot of luck. Do you put your trust in the latest hot stock picker or seek out superior long-term returns?The IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards, just released for 2017, let you look for both at one time. The awards recognize top-notch funds that beat benchmark indexes in both short- and long-term comparisons. To make the cut, a mutual fund had to outperform in each of the last one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods, through Dec. 31, 2016.Whether you're looking for a new fund for your retirement plan or wondering how the funds you now own stack up, the list can help you create and maintain a high-performance portfolio.The top five funds in each category ranked by 10-year performance are singled out for special recognition.Being a four-time winner is a herculean task. Among 2,813 mutual funds of all kinds that met the criteria of having at least $100 million in assets and 10 years of operation, only 410 beat their benchmark in each period.
"
224,ETFC,"Of 1,104 U.S. diversified stock mutual funds in business for the entire decade tracked by Morningstar Inc., only 44 prevailed as four-time winners.Among 470 growth mutual funds, nine emerged as award winners.The S&P 500's 11.96% gain in 2016 was a difficult hurdle for actively managed growth funds. Many funds' investment styles didn't play well during the early-year sell-off spawned by worries about a sputtering economy, or later during the June Brexit vote sell-off or November election volatility.Blend funds and value funds made big improvements. Blend funds turned in 22 winners vs. 10 last year and value funds paraded 20 funds in the winner's circle vs. three last year.In some categories, beating the benchmark was easy. Out of 428 international stock funds, 129 beat their benchmark, the MSCI EAFE. That was a 30% victory rate. The subdued performance of the EAFE index in 2016, which gained just 1%, made for a low bar for managers to clear.Whether you are looking for mutual funds to strengthen your current portfolio or just starting out, the IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards list is a great place to begin. You can pick among the funds to build core positions in your diversified retirement portfolio. International stock funds, sector funds and bond funds can help you add weight to parts of your portfolio where you want extra emphasis.Before buying remember to check which choices make the best fit in terms of your investment horizon and risk tolerance.You can build your investment profile using a financial advisor or forms provided by major fund companies such as Fidelity, Vanguard and T. Rowe Price (TROW) as well as brokers such as Charles Schwab (SCHW), TD Ameritrade (AMTD), and E-Trade (ETFC). You can get key fund information from fund prospectuses, quarterly reports and manager commentaries.What if a fund you own is not one of the award winners?You may decide to keep it if it's a perfectly good fund run by competent portfolio managers and it fits a unique need of your portfolio. Consider whether it outperformed its benchmark in most periods but narrowly missed in one or two.Some 135 U.S. equity funds came close to winning IBD Best Mutual Funds Award status. They failed to outperform in just one of the four time periods.This year's winner lists differ a lot from last year's. Many great new funds surfaced. Quite a few relatively new funds made their mark this year.Fourteen younger U.S. equity funds topped the bogey over one, three and five years but weren't old enough to have 10-year records. Ninety-two funds in all categories that were less than five years old outperformed in one and three years.It was tough for funds from last year to repeat as winners. Take the U.S. diversified stock fund category. Last year, 101 funds beat the S&P 500 in all four time periods.Of the 49 that managed that feat this year after a tough 2016, a mere four are repeat winners.Some categories were especially hard hit. Growth funds, value and small caps each had zero repeat winners. Midcaps and muni bond funds each managed to return just a single champ to the award winners' ranks.Blend, international stock and international bonds funds each managed to squeak just two 2016 winners to this year's lists.U.S. bond funds had the most success in returning titleholders to the award winners roster. One hundred fifty-nine of them distinguished themselves as four-time winners. And 14 of those were winners last year too. Their benchmark is the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.The stumbling block that prevented so many funds from returning to the best-of-the-best lists and kept many funds from making their debuts was the topsy-turvy 2016 market.This year's winners had to be nimble enough to avoid stumbling in last year's wild and woolly steeplechase.Just because last year's winners didn't earn awards this year doesn't mean they no longer deserve to stay in your portfolio. Take a good look at the funds and see how much they underperformed their benchmark. Find out if there has been a change in fund managers or investing strategy. Watch to see if their relative performance improves.What's the secret to consistent outperformance? For Gary Miller, lead manager of $8.2 billion Victory Sycamore Established Value Fund (GETGX) — this year's top winner in the value category — one key was unwavering focus on bottom-up stock picking.To beat the benchmark, you can't imitate it. ""This means emphasizing the merits of the company-specific dynamics and the willingness to build a portfolio that looks considerably different from the benchmark,"" Miller said.And then have the market move in your favor.The market in 2017 will produce a new crop of best performers. Whether or not the latest winners will repeat, many by virtue of their proven ability to perform over the long term could be excellent choices for your retirement account.Take $3.7 billion Parnassus Endeavor (PARWX), the No. 1 fund in our U.S. diversified equity category.

230,ETFC,"The online brokerage industry's price war escalated into a full-scale shoot-out on Tuesday. In the morning, just as Fidelity Investments' new, lower, base online retail commission for U.S. stock and ETF trades took effect, Charles Schwab (SCHW) blasted back at the Boston-based behemoth by matching its revised $4.95 commission.Tuesday night, TD Ameritrade (AMTD) jumped into the slugfest, hitting back with a new $6.95 base price per trade, which will replace its current $9.99 fee on March 6.Fidelity had started the day by responding to Schwab's Feb. 3 price cut. Fidelity, which lays claim to the mantle of largest online brokerage firm with its 17.9 million accounts and $1.7 trillion in total brokerage client assets, had slashed its commissions by $3 per-trade reduction, or 38%. It was Fidelity's first commission cut in 7 years.Charles Schwab cut its base online equity and ETF trade commission to $6.95 from $8.95 on Feb. 3. Schwab's Tuesday cut lopped $2, or 29%, off its less-than-one-month-old base commission. Schwab also responded to Fidelity's new options price with a lower fee of $4.95 plus $0.65 per contract.

Price improvement reflects the difference between the maximum price a buyer says he will pay and the actual asked price that the broker obtains. For sellers of securities, it means they got more than the bid price on average.Ram Subramaniam, president of Fidelity's retail brokerage business, told IBD that investors should consider its new low price in conjunction with Fidelity's overall services.

What started as one of the leading mutual fund families has now become a force in online trading.Less than two weeks ago, Fidelity released its annual report, showing that 2016 revenue rose 3.4% to $15.9 billion, a record for the privately held company.The combination of revenue growth and slightly lower expenses produced a record profit of $3.5 billion. That was an increase of 19.5% over 2015's $3 billion in operating income.Jim Lowell, editor of the independent Fidelity Investor, said Tuesday, ""(Fidelity's) diversified business model . . . enables them to draw others into siloed price wars at the expense of their competitors' bottom lines while simultaneously creating more immediate top line opportunities and marketshare potential for Fidelity.""Fidelity, Schwab and TD Ameritrade also dropped prices on options trades.RELATED:Charles Schwab Slashes Stock, ETF Trading Fees; TD Ameritrade, E-Trade Hit

235,ETFC,"Shares of Charles Schwab (SCHW) fell Thursday as the leading online broker announced that it will cut its trade commissions on stocks and ETFs starting Friday and lower expenses on its index mutual funds starting March 1.Schwab will reduce its standard online equity and ETF trade commissions from $8.95 to $6.95, making them lowest among rivals such as Fidelity, Vanguard, TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade (ETFC). Commissions at those competitors range from $7 to $20.Expenses on Schwab's cap-weighted index mutual funds also will be aligned with their ETF counterparts, putting them among the lowest in the industry. Investment minimums are being eliminated for those Schwab funds and a single share class will be used, enabling even the smallest investor to pay the lowest possible fees, according to Schwab.""Any investor will pay the same best rate across the board,"" Schwab CEO Walt Bettinger said in a call with analysts. He described his firm's latest moves as ""critical for growth in the future.""The new expense ratios on Schwab S&P 500 Index Fund (SWPPX) and Schwab Small-Cap Index Fund (SWSSX) are 0.03% and 0.06%, respectively. Schwab U.S. Aggregate Bond Index Fund, set to launch Feb. 23, will charge 0.04%.Competing index funds from Fidelity and Vanguard cost anywhere from three to five times more for a $5,000 investment, Bettinger pointed out.The moves build on the firm's history of shaking up an industry where steep commissions and pricey investment products were the norm. Schwab ranked among the top brokerages in IBD's fifth annual survey of online brokers.In response to an analyst question Thursday, Bettinger rebutted the notion that the firm's moves target any particular competitor.""The outstanding growth we have delivered on both the top and bottom lines will continue into 2017 without respect to the moves we have announced today,"" he said. ""Investors have entrusted us with tremendous amounts of incremental assets. We wanted to combine the benefits of scale they have created with the discipline we have created around operating efficiency, and share those benefits with our clients.""In the analyst call, Bettinger described 2016 as an ""outstanding year"" for Schwab and estimated  that the next Fed rate hike could generate $300 million to $400 million incremental revenue for his company.""The environment appears to be more optimistic than it has been in recent years"" for the financial services industry, he added.Schwab, a member of the IBD 50 list of market-leading growth stocks, finished 5.3% lower on the stock market today and has sliced through its 50-day moving average for the first time since November. But it has nearly doubled in price from the market bottom of Feb. 11, 2016.The slide in Schwab shares on the stock market today came amid a broad financial sector sell-off, a day after the Federal Reserve offered little clue about the timing of its next interest rate hike. Banks and other financial services firms benefit from higher rates, which boost their margins.In the wake of Schwab's latest move, shares of TD Ameritrade and E-Trade sank around 9% each on Thursday. Schwab depends less on trading commissions for its revenue than rival brokerage firms.Vanguard, Fidelity, iShares and State Street have all chopped fees on their ETFs and mutual funds in recent years as the so-called fee war heats up.RELATED:Schwab CEO: 'We Will Continue To Modernize And Disrupt The Industry'Charles Schwab Slashes Stock, ETF Trading Fees; TD Ameritrade, E-Trade Hit

236,ETFC,"Alex Vlasov hardly fits the stereotype of the millennial who is averse to stock market risks and skeptical of Wall Street. ""Put spreads,"" ""options monitoring"" and ""algorithm design"" are commonplace terms in his investing vocabulary.He describes his generation as ""shifting the paradigm"" to get more control over their investments. Vlasov uses TD Ameritrade's (AMTD) Thinkorswim platform for its robust analytics and options monitoring tools. And the 20-something New Yorker,  a Citigroup vice president, switches to Interactive Brokers to design algorithms and execute the most cost-efficient trades.Vlasov bears out what data from IBD's fifth annual Best Online Brokers survey indicate: Millennial investors have high expectations and seek sophistication from their online brokers.Investor's Business Daily and polling partner TechnoMetrica asked thousands of investors about their experience with their primary online broker. Millennials, those who are between age 18 and 34, made up about 9% of the survey respondents.A complex portrait of the millennial investor emerges from the survey. Among key findings, millennials are trading stocks, ETFs and other investments almost as enthusiastically as older investors. Yet they are cost conscious and the least satisfied with their broker experience among all age groups.As a result, millennials are far less likely to promote their brokers to a friend or colleague. And they are more likely to switch brokers, citing cost as the main reason for switching.Survey respondents were asked about their experiences at brokerages in the 13 categories that investors in the study deemed most important. The categories covered everything from fees, site performance and trading platforms to planning and research tools, educational help and customer service.Across every single category, millennials rated their experience lower than others.Brokers appear to face a challenge with this age group, or an opportunity, depending on how you look at it. Either way, the importance to the financial industry of what the Pew Research Center says is now the largest living American generation is clear.With the generational transfer of wealth at an inflection point, and the earnings of many millennials starting to accelerate, brokers are fervently courting this demographic.Leading online brokers are increasingly focused on their mobile platforms to capture the youngest investors.Among 415 millennials in the survey, TD Ameritrade, Interactive Brokers[ticker symb=IBKR] and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) were the most popular brokers. Just over a third, or 34%, said one of the three firms was their main broker.Online brokers like TD Ameritrade and Interactive appeal to more adventurous investors, on-the-move investors and amateur professional traders, relative to rivals whose images are tied to wealth management, says Morningstar (MORN) equity analyst Michael Wong.He notes that these brokerage firms specifically showcase mobile trades, options trades, algorithm testing and high-frequency trading in their marketing efforts.""Mobile is where millennials are — at their phones,"" Wong said. ""Online brokerages recognize increased investor sophistication, and millennials could be at the higher end of that sophistication level, or at least have a different concept of how to invest or what it means to be a more successful investor than other generations.""And though many millennials may seek control of their investing, their taste for technology extends to so-called robo-advice. Among investors who said their broker offered an automated investment advisory service, 56% of millennials said they had placed some assets in it, vs. 29% of investors of all ages.Low commissions and fees mattered most to millennials, as it did to respondents overall, the survey found. But the emergence of TD Ameritrade as the top broker of millennials in the survey suggests they are not just looking for the cheapest deal.Millennials consider the entire value proposition of a broker, and pricing is not the barrier to entry for younger investors that some may assume, says Nicole Sherrod, managing director of trading at TD Ameritrade.""They are big stock pickers — 55% of what millennials are investing in are individual equities,"" Sherrod told IBD in a phone call. ""What good is a cheap trade execution if you are not well-educated on all the risks of the investment you are getting into?""Sherrod describes her firm as a ""premium price player in the space,"" a position that she considers justified given its deep well of free educational content as well as analytical and trading tools.Millennials, she reports, are voracious consumers of TD Ameritrade's online content about stocks, ETFs and derivatives. And as they learn about the more sophisticated strategies, they put them into practice.In 2016, millennials used diversified instruments to invest at TD Ameritrade, including stocks, options, foreign currencies and futures. Futures and foreign-exchange activity jumped 12% over the prior year and was the highest among all age groups.Given their relatively small earnings, young investors are seeking ways to put less of their hard-earned dollars at risk while working to grow assets — with S&P E-Mini futures, for example, according to the broker.That doesn't make them risky thrill-seekers, in Sherrod's view. ""It's actually shrewd,"" she said.Young investors are a major reason why TD Ameritrade aims to make its mobile platform the best in its class, Sherrod told IBD.The firm recently released an in-app messaging feature that allows a service representative to ""take over"" the app at an investor's request — if the customer needs help with their first covered-call trade, for example. Sherrod describes the feature as a big hit with millennials.The leading online brokers may have their work cut out for them as they seek to capture the youngest investors.The millennials in the survey were far less concentrated in the largest online brokers. While 75% of all investors in the survey primarily used one of six major brokers, only 52% of millennials used one of those six brokers. More broadly, 94% of all investors said their primary online broker was one of the 24 brokers specifically named in the survey, but only 77% of millennials did.Put another way, a hefty 23% of millennials are choosing small or obscure names as their primary online broker.Of note, the ironically named Robinhood — a two-year-old stock brokerage app that touts free stock trading — was cited as the primary broker by 6% of the millennials in the survey. That is close to the 7% who cited Fidelity and 5% for Charles Schwab (SCHW), and level with Scottrade.Even TD Ameritrade, which had the highest share of millennials in the survey, was cited by 13% of millennials vs. 20% of all investors in the survey.Do those numbers suggest that the top brokers are struggling to capture this audience? Sherrod thinks not.""It's not that we're struggling to attract millennial investors, but we're attracting them to various degrees,"" she said.Morningstar's Wong points out that an investment or brokerage account is a lower priority for most millennials, who may be living paycheck to paycheck. They put any savings first into emergency funds in banks and 401(k) retirement plans at work, he says.Raghavan Mayur, president of TechnoMetrica, says new players see an opening.""Millennials start trading with small accounts and are attracted to options because of the leverage they offer,"" Mayur said. ""They are commission-sensitive and knowledge-thirsty.""Some new players recognize the opportunity offered by the millennial segment. For example, the financial website Tastytrade, which has copious live shows by millennials, is expanding its operation by launching  a new brokerage firm called Tastyworks this month.""Among other survey findings, 6% of the millennial respondents were women. Millennial investors were more likely than the overall group to have some college education but less likely to have an advanced college degree.Predictably, their household income was less than average and their portfolio size far smaller at a median of $35,900. Half the millennials surveyed had been investing for less than three years.Eighty-one percent of millennials in the survey owned individual stocks and 33% owned exchange traded funds — the top two types of investments among this age group.Growth stocks were most popular, owned by 70% of millennials, followed by stable, long-term performers at 38%. Defensive stocks were among the least popular, owned by 9% of this cohort.Half the millennials traded at least five times a month, roughly in line with the overall average.RELATED:TD Ameritrade's Focus On Technology, Innovation Pays OffMillennial Investors Are Here, And Wall Street Will Never Forget ItThe Only Thing Investors Have To Fear Is No Fear Itself

Construction stocks may benefit from President Trump's plans to ramp up infrastructure projects and build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border.A handful of chips stocks consistently show up on the new buys list, including Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS), Inphi (IPHI), Applied Materials (AMAT) and Nvidia (NVDA), which boasts an estimated $449 million invested by 46 top-notch funds.

Forty-three leading funds added big bank Morgan Stanley (MS), investing an estimated $402 million. Investors also like regional banks, such as Citizens Financial Group (CFG), SVB Financial Group (SIVB) and  Zions Bancorp (ZION).Financial investment banks and brokers Evercore Partners (EVR), Raymond James Financial (RJF) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) were solid performers.IBD noted 20 top-performing funds buying GrubHub, investing an estimated $27 million in their latest reporting periods.

241,ETFC,"Shares of financial institutions — ranging from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) to Charles Schwab (SCHW) — jumped as President Trump signed executive orders ordering a review of Dodd-Frank regulations as well as a halt to a rule that would require some retirement advisors to put their clients' needs over the bottom line.The bank rally pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average back over 20,000 Friday. JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs (GS) are part of the Dow industrials.Meanwhile, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and other business leaders including the heads of BlackRock (BLK), Tesla (TSLA) and General Motors (GM) also met Trump at the White House to discuss tax policy, trade, infrastructure and women in the workplace.Trump signed an order directing government agencies to plan changes to the Dodd-Frank overhaul put in place after the financial crisis. He also requested a pause to the fiduciary rule, set to take effect in April.Shares of JPMorgan rose 3.1% on the stock market today, rebounding from the 50-day line. Bank of America (BAC) climbed 2.5%, Citigroup (C) added 3.2%.Investment banks were big winners, with a possible ban on proprietary trading among the possible Dodd-Frank provisions that could be rethought: Morgan Stanley (MS) jumped 5.5% and Goldman Sachs rallied 4.6%, both gapping above their 50-day lines.Charles Schwab added 2.55%, E-Trade Financial (ETFC) gained 1.5% and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) rose 1.1%. All three online brokerages fell sharply Thursday after Schwab slashed stock trading commission fees.Even as the Trump administration stacks its ranks with Goldman Sachs (GS) alumni, White House National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn said in a Wall Street Journal article early Friday that the moves had less to do with helping banks and more to do ""with being a player in a global market where we should, could and will have a dominant position as long as we don't regulate ourselves out of that.""Cohn said Dodd-Frank constrains lending and the scope of financial products that banks could offer, while the fiduciary rule restricts consumer options. He also argued that regulations put in place after the housing bust were ineffective.IBD'S TAKE: With financial-management rules likely to change, read this story for more information about the best online brokers this year. Despite the Dodd-Frank criticisms, Trump's regulatory rollback comes after U.S. banks have scooped up market share in Europe as lenders there still try to regain composure after the financial crisis. And Citigroup last year said Mexico had ""tremendous untapped potential,"" setting its sights on Asia as well. But some analysts have expressed concern that trade restrictions could hurt banks' operations in Mexico.After the election, bank stocks soared on deregulation hopes and expectations that faster economic growth would spur wider yield spreads due to higher inflation and Federal Reserve rate hikes. Bank stocks have traded flat to slightly down in 2017, though.Cohn said the White House could try to install a new head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and added that the Treasury Department would try to make sweeping changes at mortgage giants Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC).RELATED:Banks Among Few S&P 500 Beneficiaries As Higher Rates Loom

Additional details were outlined in a Schwab news release on the commission cut.Brian McDonald, senior vice president of service and support, says customer service is ""the biggest part of the culture"" at Schwab.""Everything we do starts with: 'See through the client's eyes,' "" McDonald said in a phone interview with IBD.While the motto might sound like something most companies would pay lip service to, Schwab has walked the walk from the company's beginnings.""Our primary audience is the individual investors,"" McDonald said.The rankings are based on a major annual survey by Investor's Business Daily and TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence in which thousands of investors evaluate how well their own brokers measure up in 13 critical performance areas. The best brokers overall are determined based on their ratings across all of the categories.Schwab has placed as one of the top two brokers in Overall Customer Experience in all five years of the study.Schwab also ranked in the top three this year in 11 of the 13 performance categories, including the highest ratings in four of them.Forty or 50 years ago, Wall Street brokerages played a crony-capitalism game that favored the big players and the brokerages themselves. The idea that the individual investor mattered was laughable.But when the Securities and Exchange Commission deregulated the brokerage industry in May 1975, Charles R. Schwab grabbed the opportunity. Schwab developed and popularized the discount brokerage, making himself a hated man on Wall Street.Schwab unleashed a trend that accelerated. With the latest cut in commissions to $6.95, Schwab has now undercut many of its major rivals, including Fidelity, TD Ameritrade (AMTD), E-Trade (ETFC) and Vanguard. In stock market trading Thursday, online broker shares fell sharply on the potential for a price war. The stocks recouped some of  their losses early Friday.Low fees was one area where Schwab was not in the top three in the IBD-TIPP survey. The action to cut fees improves Schwab's position.Another critical area is trade reliability, one of the categories where Schwab received the highest rating in the IBD-TechnoMetrica survey.Many companies nowadays try to do customer service on the cheap, which seldom works out. Nearly every consumer can tell a frustrating story about dealing with an outsourced customer service department in a foreign country.Schwab avoids that problem by providing multilingual international services including Mandarin, Cantonese, Vietnamese and Spanish, and by not outsourcing U.S. customer service.""Our approach is that we want to have a great deal of control on the service experience,"" McDonald said. The goal at Schwab is to build a team of ""financial service professionals,"" he said. Passion and integrity is what Schwab looks for and works to develop in the team.The website is another area where many a company can fumble. This is another area where Schwab wins a top score from its clients.""We focus on simple, intuitive, powerful research — up and running,"" McDonald said.The Keynote Brokerage Performance Index confirms IBD's findings. Keynote measures how well and how fast an online transaction is handled. In the week ended Jan. 8, for example, Schwab was No. 1 among brokerages with a total response time of 4.26 seconds.Schwab clients also gave it especially high marks in ETF choices. Bloomberg recently noted Charles Schwab has lured more than $10 billion to its exchange traded funds this year. Five years ago, Schwab wasn't even in the top 10 of ETF managers by assets. Now it's ranked fifth, with $54 billion in its 21 ETFs.Today Schwab is a more far-reaching company than it was in the 1970s. Services offered now include financial consulting, retirement tools, helping clients find an independent advisor, assistance for employers, and even instruction on becoming a Schwab franchisee.A version of this story was published Jan. 30, 2017.RELATED:Charles Schwab Top Ranked In Customer ServiceMillennial Investors Seek Sophistication From Online Brokers -- ReallyThe Only Thing Investors Have To Fear Is No Fear Itself

249,ETFC,"A federal appeals court on Thursday declined to slap down the Department of Labor's new fiduciary rule, which is intended to minimize conflicts of interest by brokers and financial advisors dealing with clients' retirement accounts.The court action was a setback for opponents of the DOL and Obama administration rule, which requires brokers and advisors to recommend investments that are in the best interests of clients, not merely suitable for them. As a result, the new rule will require brokers and advisors to put their clients' best interest before their own profit.Discount brokers like Charles Schwab (SCHW), TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) are expected to benefit from the rule. A Goldman Sachs report said the rule will likely heighten investors' concern about fees, accelerating the shift to ETFs and passive mutual funds. That should benefit iShares and PowerShares parent asset managers BlackRock (BLK) and Invesco (IVZ) as likely beneficiaries. State Street (STT) and WisdomTree Investments (WETF) should also benefit.IBD's TAKE: This IBD report analyzes the financial impact of the fiduciary rule on workers and on the financial services industry.In its Thursday ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied a request by the National Association for Fixed Annuities for an emergency injunction against the DOL and Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez.In their order, D.C. Circuit judges Karen LeCraft Henderson, David Tatel and Sri Srinivasan said NAFA ""has not satisfied the stringent requirements for an injunction pending appeal.""The Justice Department had asked the court to not enjoin regulations that had been issued after six years of public comment, which the government called essential to the nation's retirement security.The department had described NAFA's accusation that the new regulations will cause irreparable harm to members of the annuities group as speculative.Critics of the new rule say it will make some retirement investment advice unaffordable by middle-income families.More lawsuits against the fiduciary rule are still pending in Texas, Kansas and Minnesota federal district courts.How President-elect Donald Trump will deal with the fiduciary rule is a wild card.

251,ETFC,"TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and its largest stakeholder, Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD), agreed to buy Scottrade Financial Services for $4 billion, combining two of the largest online brokerages while expanding the U.S. operations of Canada's second-largest lender.TD Ameritrade agreed to acquire Scottrade's brokerage operations for about $2.7 billion. Toronto-Dominion, which owns about 42% of TD Ameritrade, will purchase Scottrade's banking operations for $1.3 billion, adding to its U.S. branch network that stretches from Maine to Florida.The acquisition of Scottrade adds to a flurry of recent deals in an industry that's facing pressure from lower trading volumes and sluggish revenue growth. E-Trade Financial (ETFC) bought Aperture New Holdings, parent of the futures and options trading platform OptionsHouse, in a $725 million cash deal in July, and Ally Financia (ALLY) purchased TradeKing Group for about $275 million a month earlier.Toronto-Dominion extends its U.S. acquisition streak with this deal. The Toronto-based bank has spent more than $17 billion building a U.S. branch network since 2005 and has sought to fortify its wealth management business since buying New York money manager Epoch Investment Partners in 2013 to attract more wealthy American clients. The lender has more recently focused on buying credit-card portfolios, though Chief Executive Officer Bharat Masrani said as recently as September that he's still interested in ""tuck-in acquisitions"" and other U.S. assets if they make strategic sense.IBD'S TAKE: Federal Reserve plans to tighten policy this year are seen as good news for banks, but brokerages are another interest-rate play.TD Ameritrade, based in Omaha, Nebraska, has a market value of $19.5 billion. Closely held Scottrade, based in Town & Country, Missouri, had $1.04 billion of revenue in 2015, Wells Fargo & Co. analysts led by Christopher Harris said in a report this month.Online platforms are used by consumers, wealth advisers and other investors to trade securities outside of traditional brokerages. The brokerages have been squeezed in recent years amid competition from automated investment systems known as robo-advisers and a shift away from stock picking and day-trading toward passive vehicles.TD Ameritrade was created in January 2006 when the former Ameritrade Holding Corp. bought Toronto-Dominion's U.S. network of independent advisers, TD Waterhouse. In exchange, the bank received a large stake in the combined firm. The companies have maintained close business ties. Last year, Tim Hockey left the Toronto-based lender, where he ran Canadian banking and wealth management, and became TD Ameritrade's CEO.

252,ETFC,"If low volatility ETFs provide a zip line for investors to make it safely across choppy markets, their mirror opposite rips off the harness and pulley.A high beta exchange traded fund scoffs at the safe style of investing. It is a product for extreme stock market bulls, piling on risk instead of fleeing it.Tellingly, there's just one high beta ETF across a landscape of nearly 2,000 exchange traded funds listed in the U.S., and at least 18 low or minimum volatility ETFs. Right now, the high beta ETF is signaling investors are more ready for risk -- a word they loved to loathe early this year.Beta measures how much a security moves up or down relative to a benchmark.PowerShares S&P 500 High Beta (SPHB) invests in the 100 most volatile stocks in the S&P 500, giving the fund a beta of 1.59. That means the fund's returns make far sharper up- and-down moves than the broad market. The ETF debuted alongside PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV) on the same day in May 2011 but has gathered a fraction of that popular peer's $6.59 billion in assets.However, the high beta ETF has brought in $225 million in new money so far in October, helping it double assets to $450 million.""With the 10-year Treasury yield rising, the U.S. economy improving, and expectation of stronger 2017 earnings from cyclical sectors, investors have recently been gravitating toward higher beta securities,"" Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for CFRA, wrote in an Oct. 17 note.Investors took note of SPHB as it started to significantly outpace the underlying S&P 500 index starting in the third quarter. The ETF sits 3% below its Oct. 10 peak, but is rallying again.The sector tilts in this fund aren't timid. Financials account for nearly 32% of assets, energy 29% and technology 15%. It holds white-knuckle names such as Chesapeake Energy (CHK), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) from these economically sensitive sectors.It has low or no stakes in defensive, income-oriented sectors such as health care, consumer staples and utilities.So why would ETF investors want to grab the most volatile S&P names? To add equity risk to a portfolio if they're feeling bullish on stocks, Rosenbluth told IBD in a phone call.IBD'S TAKE: Investors looking for signals on when to buy or sell a high beta fund should look at indicators predicting profit growth and economic growth. Favorable signs include upward revisions to analyst profit outlooks, an increase in economic surprise indexes, rising treasury yields, rising commodity prices and a rising trend in the ISM surveys as has been seen recently.The ETF's sector bets look attractive given the higher odds of a near-term Fed rate hike. ""Higher bond yields have caused, and could continue to cause, investors to rotate away from income-oriented sectors,"" Rosenbluth said.So far this year, the ETF's strategy of dialing up risk has been rewarded.SPHB was up 10.9% through Oct. 18 on the back of an outstanding Q3, vs. a 7.1% gain for its low volatility sibling and 6.5% for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY).Higher risk stocks tend to perform best when economic growth is accelerating, credit spreads are narrowing, and volatility is falling or low, said Nick Kalivas, senior equity product strategist at PowerShares.However, people who equate high beta with stocks going in one direction -- up, a lot -- may be in for a shock.""Volatility cuts both ways,"" Kalivas cautioned.In 2013, SPHB jumped nearly 41%, while SPY gained 32%. In 2015, when SPY eked out a roughly 1% gain, SPHB tanked 13%.""It's important to know what you are getting yourself into,"" Kalivas told IBD in phone call. Unlike low volatility, high beta is not a rewarded factor providing excess returns over time.""It's a much more tactical strategy to express a short-term view of strong market conditions,"" Kalivas said. That may make it a powerful tool for successful ETF investing looking ahead.However, investors feeling aggressive may wish to consider other factor-based ETFs as buy-and-hold investments.""Value and size allow investors to capture a more bullish outlook and be rewarded over the longer time,"" said Kalivas. Both factors are generating considerable interest in the current market, he added.Value tends to have more beta than more conservative factors like quality and low volatility. And PowerShares FTSE RAFI US 1500 Small-Mid Portfolio (PRFZ) is a way for ETF investors to capture the historical outperformance of smaller caps relative to large-cap companies over time.RELATED:Investing In Quality ETFs That Do Well In Both Good And Bad Markets

And it dwarfs the 3.00% gain by iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA), which tracks developed markets around the world.EEM also outpaces the S&P 500 and EFA over the past 12 months.So emerging markets can and should be a part of most ETF investment strategies.The question is how should long-term ETF investors put their money to work in emerging markets?Not without caution, says Rich Messina, senior vice president and head of investment products at E-Trade Financial (ETFC).""A lot of moderate investors have a 60-40 portfolio, with 60% in equities,"" Messina said. ""Emerging markets should be maybe 4 percentage points of that 60% for diversification.""Douglas Cote, chief market strategist for Voya Investment Management, urges investors to include emerging markets in their portfolios to capture future gains as well as to hedge against setbacks in other markets.""The S&P 500 went on a run in 1995 through 2000, then globally diversified portfolios beat the S&P 500 for many years,"" Cote said. ""So by adding emerging markets to your portfolio, you will reduce your risk and increase your returns over the long run.""That's especially true since investors cannot count on U.S. stocks to outperform as they have historically.""Before, the U.S. economy was the lion's share of the world economy,"" Cote said. As recently as 2003, developed markets including the U.S. accounted for 80% of the world's $38.1 trillion GDP. By 2015 that was down to 60% of $75 trillion in global GDP, with emerging markets generating the other 40%.The simplest way for long-term investors to invest in emerging markets using ETFs is through EEM, Cote says. ""It is mostly China, South Korea, Brazil, Taiwan and India,"" Cote said.To lower economic risk, investors should focus on countries that have current account surpluses, Cote says.A current account surplus basically shows whether a country has a positive foreign trade balance rather than a deficit. ""If you run a surplus, you likely have a stronger currency, lower debt-to-GDP ratio and lower volatility,"" Cote said. ""Those countries generally can fund themselves and don't need external funding.""If a country does not have a current account surplus, it's generally wise to avoid its sovereign debt. Ditto for stock or debt from companies in those countries. Operating in a less healthy economy, it is harder for them to grow.""It's more likely that bad things will happen,"" Cote said, citing Brazil, South Africa and India as victims of weak fundamentals. In Turkey, politics are adding risk.In contrast, Cote says improving fundamentals give Peru, Indonesia, Vietnam, Oman and parts of subsaharan Africa potential for higher returns, although with risk.Those local hazards include political and economic risks as well as liquidity risk in local capital markets, Cote says.  In exchange, you get the benefit of lower correlation to the S&P 500, which should increases the return and reduce risk in your overall portfolio, he adds.And, he adds, Argentina is much more appealing now that the new president, Mauricio Macri, has started market-friendly reforms.E-Trade's Messina says investors should understand differences between ETFs they might think are similar. For example, Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO) and EEM are both broad-based emerging markets ETFs. But they track different indexes. And VWO held 3,973 stocks and 102 additional securities as of July 31. EEM held 839 stocks and 6 additional securities as of Sept. 13.Weightings in names they share tend to differ. But both have more than 25% of assets in China stocks.A bigger difference in the two ETFs is expense ratio. VWO has an annual expense ratio of 0.15%, a fraction of EEM's 0.69%.In this case, though, tracking different indexes and having different expense ratios hasn't let to a big divergence in performance. Both performed similarly through market cycles, Messina says.Investors looking for more subtle adjustments to their portfolios or more tactical trades might fill their needs with ETFs that focus on a single nation, like VanEck Vectors Russia (RSX); or just one type of company, such as Schwab Fundamental Emerging Markets Large Company (FNDE); or that addresses a specific investor goal, such as iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Minimum Volatility (EEMV).You can also target a particular region or category of emerging markets with ETFs like Guggenheim BRIC (EEB), which holds Brazilian, Russian, Indian and Chinese stocks.And investors should weigh the impact of macro factors on their investment goals. If you want a high dividend yield, for instance, beware of an ETF whose total return might be hurt by its exposure to an ailing sector, Messina says. Low oil prices can hurt energy stocks, and rising interest rates can hurt financials.WisdomTree Emerging Markets High Dividend Fund (DEM) weights holdings by dividend yield and total dividends paid. The fund has 21% of its assets in financial companies and 17% in energy stocks. It's up about 23% this year, but down an average annual 6.73% the past three years. It yields 4.9% now.And don't overlook emerging markets debt. Sovereign debt yield is in the 5% to 6% range, says Kristin Ceva, co-manager of $1.1 billion Payden Emerging Markets Bond Fund (PRMEX). ""In developed markets sovereign debt, 70% of that market yields less than 1%,"" she said. ""And 30% to 35% of that market is in negative yields.""Several nations' sovereign debt yields are in the high single digits or low double digits. ""Some are turnaround stories like Ghana and Argentina,"" she said. But be wary. ""Higher yields indicate higher default risk.""Ceva likes the yield outlook for countries that have undertaken political reforms or currency devaluations, like Argentina, Peru, Brazil and Colombia.Due to a lack of single-emerging-market debt ETFs, Ceva's co-manager Arthur Hovsepian advises ETF investors to consider iShares JPMorgan USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF (EMB). ""It covers the whole emerging markets debt universe,"" he said.Other markets that benefit from macro trends: Honduras and the Dominican Republic are energy importers that benefit from low oil prices.Investors who want to simplify their decisions should aim for debt that is dollar-based. Then, your only risk is that the local currency rises against the dollar. ""But if that's because local fundamentals are improving, that should cut your default risk,"" she added.Still, investing in emerging markets ETFs is no cure-all for all market obstacles, says Jonas Krumplys, manager of $580 million Ivy Emerging Markets Equity Fund (IPOAX), which competes with ETFs and other mutual funds for shareholder dollars.Because most ETFs track an index -- even when they are spiced up by a dollop of active management -- your returns can be diluted by exposure to other securities, including laggards, he says.But that has not kept EEM from outperforming emerging markets mutual funds as a group tracked by Lipper Inc. year to date through Sept. 22. EEM also led over the past 12 months, but by less than one percentage point.In technology, Krumplys says, that would mean dilution of exposure to names like China's Alibaba (BABA), a provider of online and mobile retail marketplaces, which is up 29% this year going into Sept. 19; Taiwan's Largan Precision, whose lenses are used in iPhone dual cameras, and which is up 58% this year; and Dutch-based internet search and web content provider Yandex (YNDX), which is up 31% this year.RELATED:Latin American Stocks Are Hot, Hot, Hot ...

256,ETFC,"The financial services industry breathed a sigh of relief when the Department of Labor (DOL) issued its new rule last week. That rule aims to shield individual investors from retirement plan advice by brokers who put their own profits ahead of their clients' financial interests.The sigh of relief was because the DOL's new restrictions on brokers' conflicts of interest was less onerous than the industry had expected. The DOL imposed a fiduciary standard, but provided exemptions and a slower implementation timetable.Still, the industry does stand to feel a megabuck impact. The rule could fuel as much as trillions of dollars in client asset shifts -- mainly from high-cost actively managed mutual funds -- with hefty losses of fees and commissions. It will also likely impose billions of dollars in upfront and subsequent annual compliance costs.In the $23 trillion U.S. retirement market, much of that impact will be in the $7.3 trillion IRA market, says a new report by Goldman Sachs. About $5 trillion of that will not be affected by the new rule. That's because that money was already subject to the fiduciary rule or is in self-directed accounts that don't use a financial advisor's recommendations or for some other reason, Goldman says.That leaves about $2.2 trillion in mutual funds where advisor-aided buy-sell decisions could change due to the new rule. And financial firms could be hurt by the loss of sales commissions -- also known as loads -- as well as by the loss of annual fees, as shareholder investments into those accounts slow or as assets are shifted into other, lower-cost types of assets such as index funds and ETFs, Goldman says.Mutual fund front-end loads -- commission paid when the fund is bought -- range from 0.50% to 5.75% of the value of the shares purchased, Morningstar Inc. says. Deferred loads, -- paid when shares are sold -- range from 1% to 4%.The average annual expense ratio, or percent of assets paid by the shareholder to the fund manager, is 1.18%. Stock funds bear an average annual cost of 1.25%. Bond-fund shareholders pay 0.96% on average.At 1.18%, $2.2 trillion in at-risk IRA assets would generate $39.6 billion in annual fees alone.Shareholders have been shifting to no-load share classes for years, says the Investment Company Institute, an industry group.And shareholders are already voting with their wallets against what is perceived to be higher cost mutual funds. Those $2 trillion in retail mutual funds that generate brokerage commissions account for 20% of active mutual fund assets under management. That's down from a 37% share in 2007.And where are those assets going? Individual investors are not putting them under their mattresses. They're shifting them into lower-fee ETFs and index mutual funds. Boosted by this rotation, ETF assets could mushroom to $7 trillion globally by 2020, up from $2.8 trillion today, Goldman says.In addition, the industry will also be hit by compliance costs: costs of revamping procedures to comply with the new rule, costs of retraining staff. Goldman says annual compliance costs will be more than $13 billion in upfront costs and more than $7 billion in annual costs.Retail brokers, asset managers and life insurers face swirling crosswinds of benefits and financial harm as shareholders shift existing assets and shift future asset allocation strategies, Goldman warns.""We see discount brokers like SCHW, AMTD and ETFC as relative gainers, likely gaining share as FAs"" -- financial advisors -- ""seek new platforms built for a fiduciary world and smaller accounts migrate to self-directed IRAs (and/or) auto-advisors,"" a Goldman report readers, referring to publicly traded brokerages Charles Schwab (SCHW), TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC).""Furthermore, we believe the end result will likely be further pressure on fees, accelerating the shift to ETFs/passive (mutual funds),"" Goldman's report added, citing iShares and PowerShares parent asset managers BlackRock (BLK) and Invesco (IVZ) as likely beneficiaries. State Street (STT) and WisdomTree Investments (WETF) should also benefit.In addition, Goldman predicts that rollovers to IRAs from 401(k)s by retirees will slow. Because that process will be subject to the fiduciary rule, brokers will simply avoid it. Instead, financial advisors may advise their clients to leave assets in their 401(k) accounts. That should help a fund family like T. Rowe Price (TROW), Goldman says. T. Rowe Price does much more business running 401(k) accounts than it does as an IRA custodian, according to Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren.The largest players in the 401(k) business should gain, Goldman says. Among publicly traded companies, that includes BlackRock, State Street, Prudential Financial (PRU), Northern Trust (NTRS), Principal Financial Group (PFG) and Bank of New York Mellon (BK).T. Rowe Price and AllianceBernstein (AB) are also positioned to gain market share in the target-date fund business.Image provided by Shutterstock.

271,ETFC,"Want to build your retirement nest egg as large as possible? Of course you do. A key to reaching your goal is to avoid one very common — and very costly — retirement preparation mistake: Don't withdraw money before retirement.Pulling out money early can cost you big bucks in retirement, undermining the hard work you put into retirement planning.Investors saving for retirement commit that gaffe more often than you might expect. According to a new survey of experienced investors by E-Trade Financial (ETFC), early withdrawals were made by:• 27% of the women• 22% of the men• 34% of the millennials• 24% of the active, self-directed investorsIt's an error that many people saving for retirement come to regret.Fifty-nine percent of the women who made early withdrawals eventually regretted their move a lot or somewhat, and 53% of the men said they regretted it.People took money out of their retirement accounts early for various reasons, including job loss and medical emergency. They also tapped their accounts early to help pay for vacations and entertainment.The reason that investors soon regret early withdrawals is the huge impact on their nest egg.If an investor withdraws $10,000, that missing money would have grown to $76,000 in 30 years, assuming an average annual return of 7%, according to Lena Haas, E-Trade senior vice president of retirement, investing and savings.Overall, owners of 401(k) accounts and IRAs took 1.5% out of their accounts on average each year, as of 2013, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.E-Trade surveyed 1,000 experienced, self-directed investors, ages 18 to 75, last month.Follow Paul Katzeff on Twitter: @IBD_PKatzeff.

Charles Schwab (SCHW) and ETrade Financial (ETFC) staked out the low end, with losses of 7% and 6%, respectively.On the Nasdaq 100, Gilead Sciences (GILD), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Keurig Green Mountain (GMCR) fell more than 3%.Wynn Resorts (WYNN) surged 11%, nearly erasing its loss for the week. The stock is down 77% from its March high, after falling 27% in August and 29% in September.Micron Technology (MU) jumped 5% after its fiscal fourth quarter earnings and revenue declined less than expected by analysts.On the IBD 50 list, Signature Bank of New York (SBNY) fell more than 3%. The stock has been meeting resistance at its 10-week moving average as it attempts to climb the right side of an 11-week consolidation.Telecom engineering firm Dycom (DY) slumped almost 3%, slipping below its 10-week moving average. The stock has turned a 14% advance past a 70.90 buy point into a 3% decline — a signal to sell the stock, particularly in a correcting market.Sucampo Pharmaceuticals (SCMP) was the only stock on the list to post an early gain, up 0.4% as it attempts to rebound off its 200-day moving average.

286,ETFC,"A week that started off with business as usual ended on a tumultuous note, with the market swinging wildly in response to the Fed's statement Thursday.Stocks initially rose Thursday afternoon following the Federal Reserve's decision not to raise interest rates, then sold off late in the session to end mixed.On Friday, the major indexes sank early before paring some of their losses.Some industry groups were particularly affected by the Fed decision. The super regional banks group reversed sharply lower Thursday afternoon and closed down nearly 3%. On Friday, it lost another 3%.Super regionals ranked No. 126 among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, down from No. 63 six weeks ago. Go to Investors.com to view the full industry group list and rankings.Most of the stocks in the group, including Northern Trust (NTRS), PNC Financial (PNC) and U.S. Bancorp (USB), fell further below their 200-day moving averages. They've been toiling below the support line since last month's big market sell-off.Banks benefit from higher interest rates because they can get bigger net margins. When rates are low, their borrowing costs are low. But the amount they can charge on loans, and banks' earnings from other investments, are also low.Money center bank stocks are taking a hit, too. The group reversed Thursday for a more than 1% loss, and fell north of 2% Friday. It fell to No. 123 from No. 70 six weeks ago.UBS (UBS) gapped down Friday, breaching its 200-day moving average for the first time since March.It's now 13% below a 22.27 cup-with-handle buy point cleared in mid-July. UBS, with a 67 Composite Rating, is the top stock in the group based on that metric.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) also gapped down Friday. The stock is holding above its Aug. 24 low, when it triggered the 8%-loss sell rule as it sank as much as 21% during the session. It's now 3% below a 62.97 buy point initially cleared in April.Also among financials, investment bankers and brokers (No. 121) lost further ground Friday.Charles Schwab (SCHW), Credit Suisse (CS), E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and Cowen (COWN) each gave up more than 3%.Utility stocks, which are sensitive to interest rates, rose both sessions. They tend to outperform when bond yields are low, as they are now.But if rates go up, utility stocks face more competition from bonds because bond yields typically rise.The water supply group (No. 102) was one of the few gainers Friday. The gas distribution utilities group (No. 72) was nearly flat. (For more on utilities, see today's Income Investor column on Page B15.)Real estate investment trusts also tend to move with rates. Investors like them for high yields, but not as much when bond yields go up.Property REITs (No. 128) and mortgage REITs (No. 132) were also among the day's better performers, relative to other groups.

306,ETFC,"The hedge fund industry notched a 2.2% return in February — the highest in two years — but still underperformed the S&P 500, which rose 5.5% that month, according to BarclayHedge and TrimTabs Investment Research.So despite all the hedging and supposed know-how from activist money managers, casual investors who parked cash in an S&P 500 index fund via Charles Schwab (SCHW), TD Ameritrade (AMTD) or E-Trade (ETFC) accounts now look like market wizards.February also saw the hedge fund industry take in $7.2 billion, its best inflow in six months and a partial reversal of January's $11.2 billion in outflows.February's inflow comprised 0.3% of assets, compared to the outflow of 0.5% of assets during the previous month. Still, hedge funds have seen weaker inflows for months as market sentiment wavers.""The redemptions of $4.1 billion in the first two months of this year stand in dramatic contrast to the inflow of $31.6 billion in the same period last year,"" said Sol Waksman, president and founder of BarclayHedge, in a statement.

318,ETFC,"The stockbrokerage and investment bank industry group is rich with stocks carrying solid profit margins.Five stockbrokers' stocks posted quarterly after-tax margins of 15% or higher in recent quarters. Two of them are among the top five stock brokers in IBD's Best Online Brokers 2015 survey:• MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX), an electronic bond-trading platform provider, delivered after-tax margins of 26% to 30% in the past dozen quarters.• TD Ameritrade (AMTD), a brokerage and financial services provider, pegged margins in a range of 24% to 28% in the past six quarters.• Charles Schwab (SCHW), a brokerage and financial services provider, served up after-tax margins of 21% to 22% in the past six quarters.• E-Trade Financial (ETFC), an online brokerage and banking services provider, turned in after-tax margins of 14% to 17% in the past four quarters.• Lazard (LAZ), an asset manager and merger adviser, posted after-tax margins of 15% to 17% in the past four quarters.All percentages are rounded to the nearest whole number. Results for the quarter ended in December were not yet available.How do these stocks stack up on other growth-stock criteria?• Revenue growth: MarketAxess takes the pole position with five- and three-year sales growth rates of 18% and 15%, respectively. Schwab is second at 8% and 10%.• Earnings growth: MarketAxess is No. 1 here too. The five- and three-year EPS growth rates are 35% and 18%. Lazard split the leadership with a lower five-year rate of 16% and a higher three-year rate of 28%.• Return on equity: This figure measures financial efficiency. Historically, elite stocks have scored 17% or better on the ROE gauge. Among the five stocks, Lazard leads with an ROE of 48%. MarketAxess is second at 24%.• Supply and demand: MarketAxess and Ameritrade were tops early this month. MarketAxess has an A- in Accumulation and 1.1 in up-down volume. Ameritrade has a B in Accumulation and 1.0 in up-down volume.• Institutional support: Fund activity isn't especially high right now in either a positive or negative direction. All five showed small changes or stand-pat numbers from Q3 to Q4.Three of the five stocks sport youthful base counts. The current or most recent base for MarketAxess, TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab are first stage. E-Trade and Lazard are consolidating in third-stage patterns.As a stock advances, it pauses to form consolidations or bases. Breakouts are less likely to work after the first two stages.Many investors restrict their buys to first- and second-stage breakouts.Income InvestingAnother way of looking at the brokerage industry group is from the perspective of income investors.First, a qualifier: The best strategy for culling income from stocks is to use CAN SLIM to buy the best stocks and then take income from the profits. Yes, like farming, some years will be plentiful and others not. But over time, investors will have more profits to slice than if they rely on dividends from conservative stocks.Realistically, though, some conservative investors have no interest in learning CAN SLIM and can't handle the uncertainty and close monitoring associated with growth stocks.So for those investors, let's look at which brokerage stocks are suitable for a more traditional dividend strategy. Stocks listed are only those trading at $12 or more per share.• Top dividend yields: Calamos Asset Management (CLMS), 4.5%; Greenhill (GHL), 4.6%; Credit Suisse (CS), 3.5%.• Top dividend growth rate: TD Ameritrade, 53%; Ameriprise Financial ([STOCK[AMP]]), 34%; and MarketAxess, 33%. The percentage is calculated over a three-to five-year period.• Five-year earnings Stability Factor: Ameritrade, 7; LPL Financial (LPLA), 12; and Raymond James (RJF), 12.The scale for earnings Stability runs from 0 (calm) to 99 (wild).

Soon you'll be able to check the stock price of Alibaba or buy that GoPro breakout with a turn of the wrist. Just like you're checking the time.These are the kinds of innovations that investors look for in their stockbrokers. The Mobile Platforms/Mobile Trading Opportunities category was ranked 1-4 in importance by customers of three of the top five brokers in IBD's Best Online Brokers 2015 survey.Back in the 1990s, a long-ago epoch young stock investors only read about in books, they let us log on to our brokerage accounts by phone, punching a complicated sequence of numbers that stood for letters of the alphabet to get quotes or make a trade. A mechanical voice read back stock prices.Along came the BlackBerry and other primitive smartphones followed by the iPhone and Android tablets and phones. They gave us apps designed to let us check our portfolios and make trades over cellphone lines or Wi-Fi. That is, if we were brave. Connections were slow and uncertain. Did that trade go through or not?As connections improved and processing power grew, so did the apps that online brokers put so much effort into designing, providing real-time quotes and news, streaming charts, technical studies, brokerage reports and ratings, text-message alerts and just about anything else we need to stay in touch with our money while we're on the go.The next step is the Apple Watch, announced in September by Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook and said to be ready for a March release. For $349, you'll be able to wear your stock brokerage account around your wrist.""Our customers are asking for it,"" said Nicole Sherrod, who runs the trading group at TD Ameritrade (AMTD). ""The day it was announced, we were getting tweets and emails about it. It's generated more interest than just about anything we've been doing. One gentleman told us he hoped it wouldn't turn red on a day when his stocks were down. That could be embarrassing for him.""It's a complicated business designing an app for a watch. The amount of real estate the designers have to work with is limited, so they must be clever. Sherrod notes that 40% of TD Ameritrade's trades are options, and option plays can get complicated.Other leading stockbrokers are cagey. They don't want to tip off the competition or raise customers' hopes unrealistically high.""We think watches are the big thing coming down the pipe, and we're eagerly watching and planning,"" said Kunal Vaed of E-Trade (ETFC).E-Trade boasts of being at the forefront of Internet and mobile trading from the beginning.It had apps for the BlackBerry and was ready when the iPhone and iPad were released, Vaed said. When iOS8 was announced last year, E-Trade was a featured app in Cook's presentation, Vaed said.E-Trade strives to make the most of the iPhone's innovative features, such as trading using Touch ID, the biometric feature of newer iPhones, and the use of a software widget to give customers a view of their stock watch lists and the market without having to unlock their phone.Brokers work hard to produce cool, easy-to-use apps because that's where the customers are. ""We want to be where our customers are living their digital lives,"" Vaed said.Every broker is reporting an increasing percentage of trades made via mobile devices.Sherrod of TD Ameritrade, which has 6.3 million accounts, said that in the last quarter, 1 million users logged on through a mobile devise. Three quarters of mobile trades are made from iOS devices like iPads and iPhones. Mobile trades have grown 25% in the past year.""Google's Android dominates by market share,"" she said. ""But our customers are loyal to Apple.""Just about all brokers have mobile offerings that including trading, [PAGE[research]], news, charts with complex studies and mobile alerts.TD Ameritrade distinguishes itself with multiple platforms. TD Ameritrade Mobile offers what most traders would need on the go. TD Ameritrade Mobile Trader offers more sophisticated technical analysis and the ability to made complex option trades or futures or forex trades ""until your figures bleed,"" as the iTunes blurb boasts.USAA Brokerage is focusing on having each of its platforms, be it phone, tablet or website, look the same. It plans to have that in place by the end of the year.""We'll have the same simplified experience across all channels,"" said Art Garcia , director of investment solutions. USAA has a large component of military families among its customer base, so that makes mobile more important.USAA customers can conduct all their business on any platform or start on one and finish on another. That includes communications with any of the broker's 1,500 financial advisers.Charles Schwab (SCHW) is moving in the same direction. ""Our goal is to make it so seamless an experience that whether you're using a phone, a tablet or a PC, you don't have to relearn to get competent,"" said Kelli Keough, VP of client experience.

322,ETFC,"The Super Bowl is becoming a game of soaring costs and more conservative game plans for tech companies.As usual, few tech companies are playing the ad game for the show that consistently is the most viewed of the year. That viewership carries a price: The cost of a 30-second ad in this year's game telecast is $4.4 million to $4.5 million, up from $4 million last year.Longtime players GoDaddy and Intuit (INTU) are in, but are cutting back. Regular big-game advertisers BlackBerry (BBRY) and Cars.com are staying on the sidelines for a second straight year. (Past advertisers E-Trade (ETFC), Hulu and Best Buy (BBY) declined to say if they would, or wouldn't, run ads this time.)But the Feb. 1 telecast is attracting some tech rookies. Recent IPO Wix.com (WIX) and privately held Mophie are making their Super Bowl ad debuts. Privately held Squarespace is suiting up for a second consecutive appearance.Last year's game, won handily by the Seattle Seahawks over the Denver Broncos, scored a record audience of 111.48 million viewers, edging the previous record of 111.34 million who tuned in to watch Super Bowl XLVI in 2012, says market tracker Nielsen.GoDaddy has been one of the Super Bowl's most consistent tech advertisers. The Web domain and services company has paid for two 30-second ads in most years since it began backing the game 11 years ago, but will run just a single 30-second spot this time.GoDaddy Focuses ElsewhereThe company still believes in the Super Bowl, but for now it's focused on directing more of its marketing budget to expand its business offshore, says Barb Rechterman, GoDaddy's chief marketing officer.""We have expanded our international footprint, with Q4 2014 and Q1 2015 marketing spends in Latin America and Europe, as well as India,"" she told IBD. ""As we grow globally, we're more focused on sharing the marketing dollars.""Intuit also is scaling back for an event well-timed for the company, as it comes near the start of the tax season.The business and tax software maker will have just one 60-second spot this year vs. one 60-second and one 30-second ad last year.Intuit's single ad will focus on its TurboTax tax preparation software, Intuit spokeswoman Colleen Gatlin said via email. ""Last year was a strong year where TurboTax units grew 14% year-over-year, as the do-it-yourself category grew 6% over the prior year, making tax software the fastest-growing tax preparation choice for U.S. taxpayers,"" she wrote.Cars.com dropped out last year after running ads the previous six games, and it's idle again this year.Closing the door on the Super Bowl opens opportunities elsewhere, Linda Bartman, Cars.com's chief marketing officer, said in an email.""By shifting our spending away from the Super Bowl, it allowed (us) to be on air, in front of even more car shoppers more frequently throughout the entire year,"" she wrote. ""We saw very positive results from our efforts and want to exceed those in 2015.""The Super Bowl, though, continues to attract some new tech players.Squarespace, a Web services company, is returning with one 30-second ad after backing the game for the first time last year, according to Advertising Age magazine.The two known rookie tech advertisers, Mophie and Wix.com, each plan to run one 30-second ad.Mophie sells battery cases and related accessories for mobile devices, while Wix helps its customers develop websites and Web services.Like other advertisers, Mophie is counting on the Super Bowl providing immediate consumer awareness for its products, says Kevin Malinowski, Mophie's marketing manager, in an email.""Most mobile users today are unaware these products even exist,"" he said. ""Broadcast advertising is one avenue we haven't taken in the past, but it's certainly one that amplifies the loudest. As a brand, Mophie is bold. So when discussions began around broadcast advertising, we naturally honed in on the biggest, boldest spot available.""Wix has no misgivings about the Super Bowl's costly entry fee, says Eric Mason, Wix's director of strategic marketing and communications.""We didn't set the price,"" Mason told IBD. ""We wanted to tell our story and find the biggest stage in which to do it, and this is the logical place to be.""Targets Only Helena, Mont.The Verge, the technology news website owned by privately held digital publisher Vox Media, is also running a Super Bowl ad, but just in one small market, Helena, Mont., population 28,000. It will pay $700 for the ad. Vox confirms the ad but isn't saying much about what could be sort of a test. The ad is already up on The Verge's YouTube channel. The commercial shows The Verge as part of ""the future.""Comcast's (CMCSA) NBC is televising this year's game and is making it a free streaming event for all, with hopes the move will promote the cable giant's ""TV Anywhere"" initiative.

It has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 2.6%.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc Price and EPS Surprise  The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc Price and EPS Surprise | The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc QuoteHowever, activities of the company in the to-be-reported quarter were not adequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $2.58 has been revised marginally downward over the past 30 days. Nonetheless, the figure reflects year-over-year improvement of 22.9%.Notably, the company’s price performance in the past three months has not been impressive. Its shares have lost 5.3% compared with 0.4% decline of the industry.Now, before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts, let’s discuss the factors that are likely to impact PNC Financial’s second-quarter results.Factors to Impact Q2 ResultsNet Interest Income to Improve: The second quarter has witnessed a modest improvement in commercial as well as consumer lending. Also, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest-earning assets of $331.4 billion for the to-be-reported quarter reflects growth of 2.3% year over year. Thus, given the improvement in the lending scenario PNC Financial’s net interest income (NII) is expected to improve while flattening of yield curve will likely somewhat hurt.Management expects NII to grow in the low-single digit, on a sequential basis.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII for the second quarter is $2.4 billion, which reflects an improvement of 6.2% year over year.Non-Interest Income to Rise: Although the performance of the equity markets was not very impressive during the second quarter, the company’s asset management revenues are expected to witness a rise, supported by higher earnings from its equity investment in BlackRock. Consensus estimates for asset management revenues are $459 million, which reflects growth of 15.3% year over year.Moreover, given the continued momentum in customer activity, in terms of using credit and debit cards, PNC Financial’s consumer services revenues are likely to improve. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for consumer services revenues of $372 million reflects growth of 3.3% year over year.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for corporate services revenues is $471 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 8.5%. Also, estimates for service charges on deposits are $174 million, reflecting 2.4% rise on a year-over-year basis.Additionally, despite a slowdown in refinancing activities during the quarter under review, due to the continued rise in rates, mortgage originations were decent. Thus, residential mortgage revenues are also expected to witness a modest improvement. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $106 million, reflecting growth of 1.9% year over year.With the improvement in all components of fee income, total non-interest income is expected to rise. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-interest income is $1.8 billion, indicating 1.4% rise on a year-over-year basis.Thus, given the rise in both NII as well as fee income, total revenues are likely to improve. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for the second quarter is $4.3 billion reflecting an improvement of 4.7% year over year.Controlled Expenses: While management expects non-interest expenses to be up by low-single digits on a sequential basis, the company’s continued efforts toward its cost-saving program is likely to keep overall expenses under control.Now, let’s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of PNC Financial beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for PNC Financial is -0.23%.Zacks Rank: PNC Financial currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3. While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Jul 17.

384,ETFC,"During the Q1 earnings season, financial stocks put up a decent show. Notably, one such investment bank — E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ETFC  -  Free Report) — has rallied 10.5% quarter to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s decline of nearly 6%.This price performance is backed by the gradually improving operating environment and rate hike scenario, which is beneficial for brokerage business. Furthermore, anticipated improvement in trading activities and several of the company’s ongoing initiatives bode well for E*TRADE.This apart, E*TRADE is part of the industry, which has a Zacks Industry Rank #64 (top 25%).Moreover, the stock seems undervalued on the basis of its PEG and price-to-book (P/B) ratios. E*TRADE has a PEG ratio of 1.03 compared with the S&P 500 average of 1.77. Also, the company’s P/B ratio of 2.67 is below the S&P 500 average of 3.17.Additionally, estimates for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock have been on an upswing. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved up slightly for 2018 and 1.2% for 2019.Fundamentally, E*TRADE’s earnings have jumped 30.32% annually over the last three to five years. The earnings growth momentum is anticipated to continue in the near term as well. The company’s projected EPS (earnings per share) growth (F1/F0) is 66.21% for 2018 and (F2/F1) around 12.24% for 2019.In the last three years (2015-2017), the company has recorded a benefit to provision for loan losses, with the trend continuing into first-quarter 2018 as well. We believe this benefit is driven by the company’s efforts to shrink its balance sheet.Further, with a rise in rates, brokerage firms are likely to engage in more investment activities. As brokerage firms earn interest income on un-invested cash in customer accounts, the rate hikes will enable these firms to invest at higher rates. As E*TRADE currently derives nearly 60% of its total net revenues from net interest income, the company is poised to benefit from the recent rate hikes.Additionally, E*TRADE is focused on derivatives mix, with a target of increasing it to 35% of daily average revenue trades and also set managed account assets under management target of $6 billion within the next two years. The company aims to achieve 2-3% improvement in its rate of annual organic growth, across accounts, assets and trades. Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the same space include LPL Financial Holdings Inc.

386,ETFC,"The Charles Schwab Corporation’s (SCHW  -  Free Report) efforts to strengthen trading income and higher interest rates position it well for growth. However, mounting expenses remain a key concern.Schwab is focused on augmenting trading revenues. For this, it announced several initiatives including lowering basic online equity and ETF trade commissions and reducing fees for the Schwab market cap-weighted index mutual funds. While the initiatives are expected to hurt revenues in the near term, these are aimed at building client base and improving the company’s trading income.Apart from this, management’s aggressive efforts to expand client base in advisory solutions have been fruitful.

390,ETFC,"Per a Bloomberg article, Nomura Holdings (NMR  -  Free Report) has laid off about 28 sales and trading employees from its U.S. branch. The job cuts are expected to be linked with cost cutting targets to combat low volatility prevailing in the market.Per people familiar with the matter, jobs have been trimmed in the global markets division, which consists of equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities. The decision to cut jobs has been induced by lower trading revenues as the market is experiencing low volatility despite rising interest rates. At its investors day held in late May, the company laid down plans to cut costs while reinvesting in areas that might help it grow. Nomura seeks to simply its structure and optimize its medium term operating model across front and back office functions.Recently, Italy’s watchdog imposed a combined fine of $2.7 million on three companies — Deutsche Bank (DB  -  Free Report), Nomura and Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA — for using two trades that led to a misrepresentation of Paschi’sfinances in the period between 2008 and 2012.Paschi’s accounts are alleged to have been misrepresented by 13 managers at these companies who gave false information by using complex transactions dubbed Alexandria and Santorini.

391,ETFC,"Raymond James Financial’s (RJF  -  Free Report) mounting expenses are likely to hurt bottom-line growth in the quarters ahead. Further, the lack of geographic diversification remains a concern as it might hamper the company’s financials and limit flexibility.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s earnings for for fiscal 2018 have witnessed a marginal decline over the past 30 days. As a result, Raymond James currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Continuously rising operating expenses is a major challenge for Raymond James. Non-interest expenses have increased at a CAGR of 9.5% over the last four fiscal years (2014-2017). The same trend continued in the first six months of fiscal 2018 as well. Persistently rising compensation costs and higher bank loan loss provisions are the primary reasons behind the mounting expenses. Going forward, regulatory changes and a highly competitive environment is likely to lead to further increase in expenses.Moreover, the company is yet to diversify its footprint successfully. Raymond James derives a major portion (more than 90%) of revenues from its U.S. operations. Though it has operations in Canada and Europe along with joint ventures in Latin America, these contribute a much lesser proportion of revenues in comparison with the U.S. Consequently, exposure to concentration risks could weigh on the company’s financials in the future.Thus, given the concerns surrounding the company and downward estimate revisions, we believe that the stock has limited upside potential.Nevertheless, Raymond James has accomplished several strategic deals over the last few years, given its strong liquidity position. Such acquisitions place the company well for future growth. Also, management expects to continue growing inorganically in the future. These initiatives are expected to offer support to the company’s bottom line to some extent.Further, shares of the company have rallied 32.7% over the past 12 months, outperforming 27% growth registered by the industry.Stocks to ConsiderA few stocks in the same space worth considering are E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ETFC  -  Free Report), LPL Financial Holdings Inc.

394,ETFC,"Whether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios. Simultaneously, it is important to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average.On such comparison, if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples, it may be better to avoid it.However, those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio, since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns. Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures that you have a winning option on your hands.Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies.

For 2019, management expects 2 cents earnings accretion with an IRR of approximately 20%, assuming modest expense synergy. Additionally, when full synergies are achieved in 2019, management expects TCA to contribute around $80 million in revenue and be slightly accretive to overall operating margins.

402,ETFC,"Investors in E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ETFC  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the April 27, 2018 $51 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for E*TRADE Financial shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, E*TRADE Financial is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in the Financial - Investment Bank industry that ranks in the Top 27% of our Zacks Industry Rank.

404,ETFC,"On May 17, we issued an updated research report on People's United Financial (PBCT  -  Free Report). The company has witnessed solid organic growth over the last few years. Further, its involvement in capital deployment activities continues to enhance shareholders’ value. However, consistently rising expenses and significant exposure to commercial loans remain major concerns.Nevertheless, opportunistic acquisitions, improvement in asset quality and strong loans and deposits balances have aided the stock’s rally of 12.1% in the past year compared with 11.4% growth recorded by the industry.Further, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has remained stable, over the last 60 days. As a result, it currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).People’s United’s strong balance sheet position along with sound inorganic growth strategies have bolstered its revenues. In July 2017, it acquired LEAF Commercial Capital, an independent commercial equipment finance provider. In April 2017, the company completed the $391 million all-stock deal to acquire Riverhead-based Suffolk Bancorp, which is set to fortify its footprint in the New York Metro region. Moreover, these transactions are anticipated to be accretive to earnings.Further, driven by a robust capital position, the company remains committed to enhance shareholders’ value. In April 2018, it raised its quarterly dividend by 1.4%, marking the 25th consecutive annual dividend hike. Further, given its favorable debt/equity ratio, these capital deployment activities are sustainable, going forward.Moreover, consistently improving credit quality acts as a tailwind. The company’s non-performing assets have declined at a five-year CAGR of 9.3% in 2017, with the trend continuing into first-quarter 2018 as well.However, despite undertaking a number of expense-saving initiatives, People’s United’s elevated operating expenses remain a headwind. Over the last five years (ended 2017) costs have witnessed a CAGR of 3.4%. Though the company is focused on optimizing its branch network and has initiated installation of technology to improve efficiencies and reduce costs, high expense levels are likely to limit bottom-line expansion.Also, majority of People’s United's loan portfolio — nearly 73% as of Mar 31, 2018 — comprises total commercial loans (commercial and industrial lending as well as commercial real estate lending). Such high exposure to commercial loans remains a concern.Stocks to ConsiderBOK Financial Corporation (BOKF  -  Free Report) has witnessed a 4% upward estimate revision in the last 30 days.

405,ETFC,"During the last earnings season, performance of the financial stocks was decent. One such investment bank — E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ETFC  -  Free Report) — has rallied 12.1% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s slight decline.This price performance is backed by the gradually improving operating environment and rate hike scenario, which is beneficial for brokerage business. Furthermore, anticipated improvement in trading activities and several of its ongoing initiatives bode well for E*TRADE.Apart from this, E*TRADE is part of the industry, which has a Zacks Industry Rank #88 (top 34%).Moreover, the stock seems undervalued on the basis of its price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios. E*TRADE has a P/E ratio of 16.26 compared with the S&P 500 average of 16.61. Also, the company’s P/B ratio of 2.27 is below the S&P 500 average of 3.11.Additionally, the estimates for this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock have been on an upswing. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved up 3.8% and 1.4% for 2018 and 2019, respectively.Fundamentally, E*TRADE’s earnings have jumped 29.5% annually over the last three to five years. The earnings growth momentum is anticipated to continue in the near term as well. The company’s projected EPS (earnings per share) growth (F1/F0) is 49.3% for 2018 and (F2/F1) nearly 13% for 2019.Over the last three years (2015-2017), the company recorded a benefit to provision for loan losses. We believe that this benefit is driven by the company’s efforts to shrink its balance sheet. Its provisions will likely trend at normalized levels, thereby supporting the bottom line.Further, with a rise in rates, brokerage firms are likely to engage in more investment activities. As brokerage firms earn interest income on un-invested cash in customer accounts, the rate hikes will enable these firms to invest at higher rates. As E*TRADE currently derives nearly 60% of its total net revenues from net interest income, the company is poised to benefit from the recent rate hikes.Additionally, E*TRADE is focused on derivatives mix with a target of increasing it to 35% of daily average revenue trades and also set managed account assets under management target of $6 billion within the next two years. The company aims to achieve 2-3% improvement in its rate of annual organic growth, across accounts, assets and trades.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the same space include Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.

410,ETFC,"One of the best possible ways to assess a company’s ability to offer desirable returns, after meeting all its business-related expenses, is profitability analysis. The stock performance is highly dependent on strong company fundamentals including profitability. In fact, multiple studies have underlined that a company with a high level of profitability is capable of providing huge gains to its investors.The best accounting tool to understand a company’s profitability position is ratio analysis. Generally, there are four key profitability ratios — gross income ratio, operating income ratio, pre-tax profit margin and net income ratio. Here, we have used the most effective and frequently used profitability ratio — net income ratio.Net Income RatioNet income ratio gives us the exact profit level of a company. It reflects the percentage of net income to total sales revenues. Using net income ratio, one can determine a company’s capability to meet operating and non-operating expenses with its sales revenues. A higher net income ratio usually implies a company’s ability to generate ample sales revenues and successfully manage all business functions.Screening ParametersNet income ratio is not the only indicator of future winners. So, we have added a few more criteria to arrive at a winning strategy.Zacks Rank equal to #1: Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks are allowed.

411,ETFC,"Raymond James Financial Inc. (RJF  -  Free Report) announced second-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Mar 31) earnings per share of $1.63, which was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. On a year-over-year basis, the bottom line jumped 27%.Results were primarily driven by an increase in net revenues, reflecting solid investment banking strength. Also, growth in assets acted as a tailwind. However, higher expenses were on the downside. Net income for the quarter totaled $242.8 million, up 29% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues Improve, Costs RiseNet revenues for the quarter amounted to $1.81 billion, rising 16% year over year. The rise was attributable to an increase in almost all the revenue components except net trading profits. Further, the reported figure marginally topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Segment wise, in the reported quarter, RJ Bank registered an increase of 26% in net revenues. Further, Asset Management and Private Client Group depicted top-line improvement of 40% and 17%, respectively. However, Capital Markets witnessed a decline of 10% in net revenues, while Others reported improved revenues against negative revenues in the prior-year quarter.Non-interest expenses increased 6% year over year to $1.48 billion. The rise was largely due to increase in all cost components, except for the absence of acquisition-related costs and losses on extinguishment of debt as well as lower other expenses and bank loan loss provision.As of Mar 31, 2018, client assets under administration increased 14% on a year-over-year basis to $729.5 billion, while financial assets under management surged 55% to $132.3 billion.Strong Balance Sheet, Capital Ratios ImproveAs of Mar 31, 2018, Raymond James reported total assets of $36 billion, relatively stable sequentially.

Also, lack of geographic diversification remains a major concern for the company as it might hamper its financials and limit flexibility, going forward.Raymond James Financial, Inc.

416,ETFC,"E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ETFC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19. The company is expected to witness year-over-year growth in revenues and earnings.The stock is currently enjoying investors’ attention and has been touching new 52-week highs for quite some time.E*TRADE has robust organic growth prospects, and its inorganic growth efforts during the quarter are expected to keep driving the stock. Further, the company is likely to have benefitted from significant volatility and revival of client activities in the last two months of the first quarter.Moreover, E*TRADE’s majority of revenues comes from net interest income (NII) (around 65% of total revenues as of Dec 31, 2017). A rise in this component due to rising interest rates will boost the company’s overall top line.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might be in store, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.Last quarter, E*TRADE pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 3.2%, supported by increased net revenues and benefit from provisions. Further, the quarter witnessed an increase in daily average revenue trades along with growth in customer accounts.

This is likely to benefit the New York-based e-broker’s revenues.Further, with growth in net brokerage accounts, E*TRADE’s trading revenues might have witnessed improvement in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for these accounts is 60,000, a sequential increase of 30.4%.Revenues Likely to Increase: As NII constitutes a significant part of E*TRADE’s revenues, expanding net interest margin on the back of rising interest rates will likely lend support this quarter as well.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $681.7 million, indicating improvement of 23.3% year over year.Expenses Might Trend Up: The company plans to make several investments in 2018 along with spending money on marketing. This might lead to an increase in expenses during the quarter.Though estimates for the to-be-reported quarter have remained stable over the last seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 78 cents reflects growth of 62.5% year over year.Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, we cannot conclusively predict an earnings beat for E*TRADE in the upcoming results. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better for this to happen, which is not the case here as elaborated below:(You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.)Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for E*TRADE is -0.06%.Zacks Rank: The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks worth considering, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.BOK Financial Corporation (BOKF  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.24% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

421,ETFC,"Ratings of The Goldman Sachs Group (GS  -  Free Report) and its subsidiaries have been affirmed by the Moody's Investors Service. The outlook for the parent holding company has remained stable. Also, the company’s senior debt rating has been affirmed at A3.However, outlook on the operating subsidiaries has been lowered from stable to negative. Ratings of deposits at Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Goldman Sachs International Bank has been affirmed at A1 while senior debt of Goldman Sachs International has been rated A1. The rating agency had also upgraded the baseline credit assessment of Goldman Sachs International Bank to baa2 from baa3.Reasoning Behind the RatingsThe ratings affirmation is indicative of Goldman Sachs consistent quarterly performance despite pressure on revenues and wise decision-making measures. Capital ratios declined further in late 2017 due to the impact of tax reform as a result of which the company would be repurchasing lesser shares in the first six months of 2018 than what was authorized as part of its 2017 Capital Plan. Per Moody’s, this is likely to benefit the capital ratios.On the other hand, negative outlook on the subsidiaries is reflective of the revenue challenges it faces in its Institutional Client Services segment (contributed 37% of revenues in 2017) due to low volatility in capital markets. Though efforts to control expenses, increasing revenues in other segments along with growth in loans balance had offset the negatives to some extent, Moody’s feels that Goldman Sachs’ loan growth strategy would have an impact on the stability of its earnings.Further, Moody’s downgraded the outlook due to a decline in Goldman Sachs’ share of revenues in the sales and trading business among its peers, owing to a lesser diversified client base. However, the rating agency feels the decline is temporary. It expects that increase in volatility will boost trading volumes among its active investor clients and Goldman Sachs’ initiatives to build client base.The outlook for the parent holding company has been left unchanged on the back of a potential benefit to its senior creditors of a lower severity of loss in the event of breakdown due to the significant increase in the company’s debt outstanding over the last two years. The larger amount of debt would provide greater loss absorption capacity at such times.Per Moody's advanced loss-given-failure analysis, this will benefit the holding company’s senior creditors and could provide an additional uplift if it is sustained, going forward. While the increased loss absorption capacity would also benefit creditors of the operating subsidiaries, these ratings already receive the maximum uplift of three notches from the baseline credit assessment allowed under Moody's Banks rating methodology.What Could Make Moody's Change the Ratings?Ratings of Goldman Sachs' operating subsidiaries are not likely to be ungraded in absence of a significant reduction in the firm's dependence on earnings from its capital markets business. However, the rating outlook on the operating subsidiaries could return to stable from negative if loan growth slows and it recovers its lost market share in sales and trading without significantly increasing market risk. If, at the same time, the level of the holding company’s debt is sustained at current levels as a proportion of tangible banking assets, then its senior debt could be upgraded one notch.On the flip side, Goldman Sachs' ratings could be downgraded if it is unable to recover the temporary loss of market share in its sales and trading businesses or continues to grow its loans aggressively at the same rate as it did in 2017. Also, if the firm fails to strengthen its capital ratios above the level reported at 2017 end, or if there are any indications of control or risk management failures, a marked increase in risk appetite, any deterioration in its liquidity profile, or a decline in profitability, ratings can be lowered.The company’s shares have rallied 20% in the past six months, underperforming 28.9% gain of the industry.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

424,ETFC,"Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc.’s (WDR  -  Free Report) issuer rating has been downgraded from Baa3 to Ba1 and the company has been assigned a Corporate Family Rating (CFR) of Ba1 by Moody's Investors Service, a rating arm of Moody's Corporation. Simultaneously, the company’s outlook has been changed to stable from negative.Reasons for the Rating Downgrade & Stable OutlookOwing to a challenging business environment and continuous net outflows across all of its distribution channels, Waddell & Reed has been reporting a fall in its assets under management (AUM) since the past few years. Over the last five years (2013-2017), AUM decreased at a CAGR of 10.5%. As a result, its competitive position within the industry weakened.Adding to this, the presence of substantial intangibles on the company’s balance sheet increases risk. Moreover, looking at the company’s recent investments, the reinvestment of $300 million of its cash reserves into a portfolio of investment grade fixed income securities with a one-year average duration increases its market risk.It is because of the above-mentioned reasons that Moody’s went for a rating downgrade. Moreover, Moody’s believes that though the company is taking several initiatives to improve efficiency, optimize operations and modernize its Retail Broker-Dealer channel by providing additional support to its advisors through training opportunities and enhanced technology tools, these are not sufficient to improve its credit profile that has been impacted negatively because of the deterioration in its investment management business' competitive position.Additionally, because of an increased focus toward passive investment management, regaining its competitive position, particularly within the Retail Unaffiliated Distribution channel, is not expected in the near future, according to Moody’s.Nevertheless, Moody’s upgraded the company’s outlook from negative to stable as it believes that the steps taken to modernize the Broker-Dealer channel would lead to slight improvement in margin and it would help the company’s fundamental business model to diversify economically. This is because, going forward, a portion of the company’s assets will become less dependent on the investment performance of its funds for asset retention and replacement.What Can Drive the Ratings UpPer Moody’s, a rating upgrade can take place if the company witnesses sustained rise in net flows with replacement rates of more than 100%, has retention rates of more than 80% and delivers continued growth in revenues with investment performance improvement.What Can Bring the Ratings DownOn the other hand, a downward pressure on ratings can occur if there is an increased decline in AUM, if losses develop in the company's corporate bond investments or the company is unable to improve its investment performance materially.Shares of Waddell & Reed have gained 14.7% in the past six months, marginally outperforming 14.3% growth for the industry.The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

425,ETFC,"Barclays’ (BCS  -  Free Report) senior unsecured debt and the Baa2 long-term issuer ratings, and the Prime-3 short-term issuer ratings have been placed under review for possible downgrade by Moody's Investors Service, a rating arm of Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report).Additionally, the baa2 standalone baseline credit assessment (BCA), the A1 long-term deposit and senior unsecured debt ratings, the Prime-1 short-term deposit ratings and the A1 (cr) long-term Counterparty Risk (CR) assessment of the bank’s operating entity Barclays Bank PLC are under review for probable downgrade. Nonetheless, Barclays Bank's Prime-1(cr) short-term CR assessment has been reiterated.Reasons for Probable Ratings DowngradeAndrea Usai, Senior Vice President at Moody's said, “The review for downgrade on Barclays reflects the group's ongoing credit weaknesses and likely impact of ring-fencing implementation, which have been the main drivers for the negative outlook since last September.”Barclays is restructuring its operations given the impending requirement to separate its domestic retail and business banking operations from other business, per the U.K.'s ring-fencing rules. The company intends to fulfil this by April 2018 with Barclays Bank becoming its non-ring-fenced bank.Therefore, Barclays’ existing U.K. retail and business banking operations will be transferred to the newly created ring-fenced bank — Barclays Bank U.K. As this new entity will become more dependent on risky wholesale and capital markets activities, it will lead to rise in risk profile and earnings volatility. Overall, these would result in “a weaker standalone credit profile for Barclays Bank.”At present, Barclays Bank’s ratings are supported by Barclays’ strong businesses, solid loan growth and diversified funding sources, partially offset by weaker net profitability (expected to continue over the next few quarters) and capital markets activities.What Will Moody’s Review?As part of review, Moody’s intends to reassess the standalone credit profiles of Barclays Bank (following the rind-fencing) and broader Barclays. This will include whether business diversification going forward will support stable profits “sufficient to maintain the one-notch positive adjustment for Business Diversification, currently included in the BCA for Barclays Bank.”Moody’s also plans to assess the expected loss for each instrument class issued by Barclays, Barclays Bank and Barclays Bank U.K. through its advanced Loss Given Failure analysis. Further as a result of implementation of ring-fencing, Moody’s for the first time will provide “separate notional BCA to the broader Barclays group.”Our TakeBarclays’ restructuring and business simplifying efforts have ended successfully and will likely continue to result in decrease in expenses. Also, driven by these efforts, the company intends to announce dividend of 6.5 pence per share (subject to regulatory approvals) in 2018.While Moody’s review (expected to be completed over next few weeks) may weigh on the stock in the near term, improving global economy will support Barclays’ profitability.Over the last six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 17.9% on the on the NYSE, outperforming the industry’s growth of 10%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereNotably, other than Barclays, the rating agency have put some other finance companies including E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ETFC  -  Free Report) and U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) under review.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

426,ETFC,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ETFC  -  Free Report).

The reported quarter recorded lower commissions, partially offset by higher fees and service charges.Total non-interest expenses flared up 13% year over year to $364 million. The increase was due to rise in almost all the expense components.Improved Trading PerformanceTotal DARTs increased 26% year over year to 236,000 in the reported quarter, including 29% in derivatives. At the end of the quarter, E*TRADE had 5.4 million customer accounts (including 3.6 million brokerage accounts), up 4% from the year-ago quarter.Additionally, DARTs for the full year were 214,000, up 30.5% year over year, including 30% in derivatives.Further, the company’s total customer assets were $383.3 billion, up 23% year over year.

The cash deal is worth $170 million.The deal is expected to be neutral to earnings in 2018 and accretive by 6 cents in 2019 on achievement of full run-rate synergies. Existing corporate cash is likely to fund the transaction. The acquisition, which awaits certain customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, is anticipated to conclude in third-quarter 2018.OutlookFor 2018, management targets an adjusted operating margin of 43%, with the assumption of no increase in the Fed benchmark rate from current levels and incorporates management plans to increase investments in the business over the course of 2018, including a ramp-up in marketing spend to a total of around $200 million and some level of deposit repricing.Management expects net interest margin (NIM) to be in the low-to-mid 280s in 2018, with assumption of customer margin balances to be flat at current levels and no Fed funds increases during the year.Management projects effective tax rate to be approximately 27% for 2018, with some quarterly volatility due to the impact of share-based compensation awards and future revaluations of state deferred tax assets.For 2018, the TCA acquisition deal is likely to be neutral to bottom-line results, including cost of the issue of preferred stock which is planned to fund the transaction.

Also, the figure was higher than prior-year quarter’s figure of 34 cents per share.Results benefited from an improvement in revenues and rise in DARTs. Further, the Electronic Brokerage segment continued to perform decently. However, higher expenses were the undermining factor.The company reported comprehensive income available to common shareholders of $47 million or 65 cents per share, up from $28 million or 40 cents per share reported in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Improve, Expenses EscalateTotal net revenues for the quarter increased 40.9% year over year to $527 million.

The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $477.5 million.Total non-interest expenses increased 16.1% from the year-ago quarter to $187 million. The increase was primarily due to higher execution and clearing expenses, employee compensation and benefits costs, general and administrative costs, and customer bad debt.Income before income taxes was $340 million in the quarter, up from $213 million in the prior-year quarter. Similarly, the pre-tax profit margin was 65% compared with 57% in the prior-year quarter.Quarterly Segment PerformanceElectronic Brokerage: Net revenues increased 48.1% year over year to $465 million.

With the completion of the sale of its U.S. options-market-making business, the company plans to focus on strengthening its Electronic Brokerage segment. These restructuring efforts will likely support its financials in the future.However, the company’s high dependence on IBG remains a concern. If IBG LLC fails to provide sufficient funds to pay taxes or for any other purpose, its financial condition may suffer.Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.

429,ETFC,"The banking industry remains well positioned for growth, supported by benefits from a stabilizing economy and an improving interest-rate scenario. Also, the tax overhaul and expected ease in regulations are likely to bring in more benefits for banks.Moreover, during the first quarter of 2018, investment banks, in particular, benefited from higher trading activities as volatility was back in the markets.Thus, it seems to be a wise idea to add some banking stocks to your portfolio now. Today, we bring to you one investment banking stock, Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), which, given its strengthening balance sheet and cost-reduction initiatives, is well poised for growth.The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has been revised 4.2% upward over the past 30 days, reflecting analysts’ optimism, regarding its earnings growth potential. Thus, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The company’s shares have gained 5.3% so far this year, underperforming the 7.4% growth recorded by the industry. Nevertheless, given the strength in fundamentals and positive estimate revisions, this price performance is expected to improve in the quarters ahead. Here are some other factors that make Morgan Stanley an attractive investment option right now.Earnings per Share (EPS) Strength: Morgan Stanley’s earnings have grown at the rate of 14.3% over the last three to five years, higher than the industry average of 10.5%. This momentum is expected to continue in the near term as evident by its projected EPS growth rate of 31.2% and 6.4% for 2018 and 2019, respectively.Further, the company’s long-term projected EPS growth rate of 12.7% promises reward for shareholders.Revenue Growth: Morgan Stanley’s organic growth remains strong. Revenues witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.4% over the last four years (2014-2017). Driven by a steady focus on wealth management operations, the top line is projected to increase 6.2% in 2018, higher than 4.6% growth recorded by the industry.Prudent Cost Control: Morgan Stanley’s efforts to restructure and streamline its operations have helped  lower expenses. As part of its cost-saving plan — Project Streamline — the company successfully achieved the cost-saving target of $1 billion by 2017. While expenses may rise as the company continues to invest in franchises, overall costs are expected to be manageable in the quarters ahead.Impressive Capital Deployment: Morgan Stanley’s capital deployment plan is commendable. Its 2017 capital plan included a 25% dividend hike and $5-billion share-repurchase authorization. Given its solid liquidity position and earnings strength, the company is likely to be able to sustain this level of capital deployments.Stock Looks Undervalued: Morgan Stanley looks undervalued with respect to its price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios. The company’s P/E (F1) and P/B ratios of 11.7 and 1.4, respectively, are below the industry averages of 16.6 and 1.7.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks in the finance space worth a look are E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ETFC  -  Free Report), Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.

434,ETFC,"Stocks opened higher on Monday as investors seem to think the U.S.-led air strikes on Syria won’t lead to a much larger conflict. The strikes also coincided with the real start of first quarter earnings season, which investors should use as a way to fight off the volatility that has plagued markets recently.Earnings season kicked into gear last Friday when banking giants, JPMorgan Chase (JMP  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), and PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report), reported their Q1 financial results. Going forward, investors should use this highly anticipated period to try to recoup any losses they might have suffered during the extended bearish run.With that said, investors still need to be selective during earnings season and hunt for stocks that look poised to top quarterly earnings estimates. Conversely, investors should stay away from any companies that might disappoint by reporting lower-than-expected earnings results.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, in one way or the other.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Today, we are giving our readers a free look at three stocks that look ready to post an earnings beat this week.Check them out now: 1.     Honeywell International (HON  -  Free Report)Shares of Honeywell climbed on Monday, which might signal that investors have reason to be excited about the company famous for its thermostats and other control technologies for buildings, homes, and industries. Honeywell is indeed expected to see its revenues climb by 4.7% to reach $9.94 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, the company’s earnings are projected to climb by 13.9% to $1.89 per share.Honeywell is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of 0.46%. Diving a little deeper, HON’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for earnings of $1.90 per share, which comes in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate. This means that Honeywell could be ready to top Q1 earnings estimates when it reports its financial results before the market opens on Friday, April 20.2.       E-Trade Financial (ETFC  -  Free Report)Volatility might not be great for investors, but online brokerage firms such as E-Trade can benefit hugely. This has been reflected in E-Trade’s stock price, which is up 71% over the last year, and also managed to come out of the recent market downturn nearly unscathed. E-Trade is expected to see its first quarter revenues climb by 23.3% to reach $681.74 million. The company’s bottom line is projected to hit $0.78 per share, which would mark stellar 62.5% expansion from the year-ago period. Better still, E-Trade is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks an Earnings ESP of 1.14%, with its Most Accurate Estimate coming in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate. Therefore, investors should consider E-Trade a stock that looks poised to beat earnings estimates when it reports its Q1 financial results after market close on Thursday, April 19.3.       Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report)Shares of Abbott popped on Monday morning just a couple of days before the diversified healthcare company is set to report its first quarter earnings results. And it looks like Abbott investors have reason to be excited, with the company’s quarterly revenues projected to surge by more than 14% to hit $7.26 billion.Meanwhile, Abbott’s earnings are expected to expand by 20.8% to reach $0.58 per share. The company is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and boasts an Earnings ESP of 0.75%. This means that investors might see Abbott top Q1 earnings estimates when the company reports its financial results before the opening bell on Wednesday, April 18.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

435,ETFC,"Charles Schwab’s (SCHW  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings of 55 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Also, earnings surged 41% from the prior-year quarter.Schwab’s shares were up more than 2% in early market trading. Rise in trading revenues was perhaps the primary reason that cheered investors. Notably, price reaction during the full trading session will provide a better idea about how investors accepted the results.Revenue growth (driven by a rise in interest income and trading revenues) and absence of fee waivers were among the positives. Further, there was an impressive rise in total client assets and new brokerage accounts. However, higher expenses remained a headwind.Net income available to common shareholders was $746 million, up 42% year over year.Revenue Improvement Offset by Expense RiseNet revenues were $2.40 billion, climbing 15% year over year. Growth was supported by asset management and administration fees (up 3%), net interest revenues (up 26%), trading revenues (up 5%) and other revenues (up 26%). The reported figure outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.37 billion.Total non-interest expenses rose 13% year over year to $1.40 billion. All expense components increased on a year-over-year basis.Fee waivers were nil in the reported quarter.Pre-tax profit margin improved to 41.8% from 40.5% recorded last year.At the end of the first quarter, Schwab’s average interest-earning assets grew 10% year over year to $238.5 billion.Annualized return on equity as of Mar 31, 2018, came in at 18%, up from 15% in the year-ago quarter.Other Business DevelopmentsAs of Mar 31, 2018, Schwab had total client assets of $3.31 trillion (up 13% year over year). Also, net new assets — brought by new and existing clients — were outflows of $18.8 billion against inflows of $38.9 billion in the prior-year quarter.In addition, Schwab added 443,000 new brokerage accounts in the reported quarter.

444,ETFC,"During the last earnings season, performance of the financial stocks was decent. One such investment bank — TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (AMTD  -  Free Report) — has rallied 11.9% quarter to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s slight gain of 1.1%.This price performance is backed by the gradually improving operating environment and rate hike scenario, which is beneficial for brokerage business. Furthermore, anticipated improvement in trading activities and several of its ongoing initiatives bode well for TD Ameritrade.Moreover, estimates for this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock have been on an upswing. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved up 2.7% and 1.6% for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, respectively.TD Ameritrade’s debt/equity ratio is 0.35 compared with the S&P 500 average of 0.69, displaying low debt burden relative to the industry. It highlights the financial stability of the company even in an unstable economic environment.Also, TD Ameritrade’s ROE of 18.27% compared with the industry average of 10.07%, indicates the company’s commendable position over its peers.Fundamentally, TD Ameritrade’s earnings have jumped 9.3% annually over the last three to five years. The earnings growth momentum is anticipated to continue in the near term as well. The company’s projected EPS (earnings per share) growth (F1/F0) is 65.2% for fiscal 2018 and (F2/F1) nearly 24% for fiscal 2019.TD Ameritrade’s trading volumes have been displaying an uptrend in the last few years with an increase in average client trades per day. We believe that in the near term, the company will be able to grow its trading volumes due to expected improvement in equity markets, rising rate environment as well as its innovative trading platforms. Additionally, the company continues to undertake investment spending in technology and advertising that are likely to enhance the overall business.Further, with a rise in rates, brokerage firms are likely to engage in more investment activities. As brokerage firms earn interest income on un-invested cash in customer accounts, the rate hikes will enable these firms to invest at higher rates. As TD Ameritrade currently derives nearly 35% of its total asset-based revenues from net interest income, the company is poised to benefit from the recent rate hikes.Additionally, TD Ameritrade remains a leading asset gatherer with nine consecutive years of double-digit asset growth since fiscal 2008 in net new client assets. Also, the company’s net revenues have been improving as it recorded 5.6% compound annual growth rate over the last four years ending fiscal 2017.

445,ETFC,"Investors in E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ETFC  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 19, 2018 $18.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for E*TRADE Financial shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, E*TRADE Financial is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Financial - Investment Bank industry that ranks in the Top 22% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 58 cents per share to 59 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about E*TRADE Financial right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

448,ETFC,"The Driehaus strategy is one of the best investment approaches for those with a high-risk appetite. Using this strategy, investors can pick momentum stocks, in order to get great returns. Richard Driehaus formulated this strategy using the buy high and sell higher principle, which eventually helped him secure a place in Barron’s All-Century Team.The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII’s portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five and 10-year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% returns registered by the S&P 500. Thus, investors with a high risk appetite might give the Driehaus strategy a thought to boost returns.A Brief Note on Driehaus’ StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In keeping with his insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before designing a portfolio.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator – positive relative strength – has also been included. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focused on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.Screening Parameters Our research shows that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A or B offer the best upside potential.• Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through.

457,ETFC,"E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ETFC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 19. While the top line is expected to grow year over year, earning per share will likely remain flat.In the last reported quarter, E*TRADE Financial reported a positive earnings surprise of 8.3%, supported by increased net revenues and benefit from provisions. Further, the quarter witnessed an increase in daily average revenue trades along with growth in customer accounts. However, the positives were partially offset by higher expenses.Notably, E*TRADE Financial delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 17%.The stock has gained 26.3% year to date, outperforming the industry’s rally of nearly 7%.E*TRADE Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise E*TRADE Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | E*TRADE Financial Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to E*TRADE stock? A lot depends on whether the firm posts a beat for the fifth straight quarter. However, our quantitative model does not conclusively predict a beat. Here’s why:E*TRADE doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for E*TRADE is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: E*TRADE currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Also, activities of E*TRADE during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter remained stable over the last seven days. Factors That Might Influence Q3 ResultsMargin Pressure Likely to Ease: The June 2017 rate hike is expected to make a full-quarter impact on net interest margin. However, a flat yield curve during the quarter might curb this improvement to some extent.Interest Expense Savings: The company’s expenses are expected to reduce on the back of its restructuring moves to lower debt level.Revenues Likely to Improve: Continued momentum in investment banking business is likely to support E*TRADE’s top line. Also, the revenue synergies from OptionHouse acquisition is expected to be partly reflected in the upcoming results. However, owing to low volatility in the bond and equity markets during the quarter, trading revenues are likely to remain low.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected to be $596.3 million, up 22.7% year over year.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks worth considering, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (AMTD  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter results on Oct 24.

While Intel crushed estimates on both top- and bottom-lines on slightly more modest guidance, Starbucks slightly missed revenue estimates, and its stock is down 3% in late trading.For Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Intel, it posted $1.08 per share — a 25% positive surprise over the Zacks consensus 86 cents. This also accounts for a 15 cent-per-share charge on the new tax laws, and still was a blowout headline. Revenues of $17.05 billion also beat the $16.31 billion we had been expecting, and represent 8% growth year over year.Yet Q1 guidance was modest: 70 cents per share on $15.0 billion in revenues are both below Zacks consensus, as are the fiscal year projections of $3.55 and $65.0 billion.

461,ETFC,"The Charles Schwab Corp.’s (SCHW  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 44 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents. Results exclude one-time tax expense of 3 cents per share related to the tax act. Also, earnings increased 22% from the prior-year quarter.However, Schwab’s shares were down nearly 1.3% in early market trading. Persistent fall in trading revenues remains a major concern for Schwab. Notably, the price reaction during the full trading session will provide a better idea about how investors accepted the results.Revenue growth (driven by a rise in interest income), absence of fee waivers and provisions were among the positives. Further, there was an impressive rise in total client assets and new brokerage accounts. However, higher expenses and a decrease in trading revenues remained the headwinds.After considering tax act related charge, quarterly net income available to common shareholders was $550 million, up 14% year over year. For 2017, it was $2.18 billion, up from $1.75 billion in the prior year.Revenue Improvement Offset by Expense RiseNet revenues were $2.24 billion for the reported quarter, climbing 14% year over year, supported by asset management and administration fees (up 8%) and net interest revenues (up 26%) and other revenues (up 26%). These were partly offset by a 24% fall in trading revenues. The reported figure was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.For 2017, net revenues grew 15% from the prior year to $8.62 billion. The figure was on par with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Total non-interest expenses rose 12% year over year to $1.30 billion.

Also, net new assets — brought by new and existing clients —surged 112% from the prior-year quarter to $78.1 billion.In addition, Schwab added 386,000 new brokerage accounts in the reported quarter. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had a total of 10.8 million active brokerage accounts, 1.2 million banking accounts and 1.6 million corporate retirement plan participants.Our TakeFocus on low-cost capital structure will continue supporting Schwab’s performance in the quarters ahead.

462,ETFC,"At the Barclays PLC Investors Conference in New York on Sep 12, 2017, the president of Goldman Sachs Group (GS  -  Free Report), Harvey Schwartz, unveiled the company’s latest growth plan. The company aims to add $5 billion in revenues annually, which will, in turn, contribute up to $2.5 billion in pre-tax earnings.Goldman typically keeps its plans secret, but disclosed this plan in the hope of regaining the lost confidence of its investors after two poor quarters in a row. The company witnessed a 40% year-over decline in fixed income trading in the last reported quarter, which turned its investors away.The firm plans to boost revenues through a variety of ways. Some of these include, increasing the number of asset managers and banks they work with, by trading more in fixed income securities, commodities and currencies. These could help in adding $1 billion in revenues. Goldman also wants to grow its lending and financing portfolio and expects to add $2 billion in revenues through that. Investment banking and equity clients would add $0.5 billion each and the investment management division is expected to contribute $1 billion to the growth.Analysts don’t seem hopeful about the company’s ability to achieve the target. While an improving industry backdrop might help it executing its plans to great extent, we don’t think it would be easy for the firm to meet the target by offsetting its underlying weakness, at least in the first year.Shares of Goldman gained around 36% over the past 12 months compared with the industry’s rally of 30.6%.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsidersCurrently, Goldman carries a Zack Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the finance space are E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ETFC  -  Free Report), Moelis & Company (MC  -  Free Report) and Raymond James Financial (RJF  -  Free Report) each carrying a Zacks Rank #2.

463,ETFC,"Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (IBKR  -  Free Report) released its fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results. Adjusted earnings for the quarter came in at 43 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents. Also, earnings came in higher than the prior-year quarters figure of 7 cents per share.Results benefited from improvement in revenues, lower operating expenses and a rise in DARTs, while lower trading volumes were the undermining factor. Further, the Electronic Brokerage segment continued to perform decently.For the quarter, the company reported comprehensive net loss of $2 million or 2 cents per share, compared with loss of $3 million or 5 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.For 2017, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.53, increasing from $1.25 registered in the prior year. However, the figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.65 per share. Comprehensive net income for the year came in at $87 million, up from $80 million reported in 2016.Quarterly as well as full-year earnings per share were negatively impacted by 45 cents and 46 cents, respectively, as a result of the Tax Act.Revenues Improve, Expenses DecreaseTotal net revenues for the quarter increased significantly year over year to $515 million. The rise was primarily driven by an increase in commission fees and interest income, partially offset by a decline in trading gains. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $399 million.For 2017, total net revenues came in at $1.7 billion, up from $1.4 billion registered in the previous year. Also, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.6 billion.Total non-interest expenses fell 8.5% from the year-ago quarter to $151 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower execution and clearing expense, and employee compensation and benefits costs.Income before income taxes came in at $364 million in the quarter, surging from $28 million in the prior-year quarter. Similarly, pre-tax profit margin was 71% compared with 15% in the prior-year quarter.Quarterly Segment PerformanceElectronic Brokerage: Net revenues increased 32.7% year over year to $390 million. Pre-tax income rose 50% to $252 million. Total DARTs for cleared and execution-only customers were 730,000, up 14% from the year-ago quarter. Pre-tax profit margin improved to 65% from 57% in the prior-year quarter.Market Making: Net revenues plunged 44.4% year over year to $25 million. Pre-tax income was $8 million, down 33.3% from the year-ago quarter. The decline was mainly due to lower trading gains, partly offset by lower operating costs, as the company completed the winding down of its U.S. options market making business. Pre-tax profit margin improved to 32% from 27% in the prior-year quarter.Moreover, the Corporate segment reported net revenues of $100 million against negative revenues of $146 million in the year-ago quarter. Pre-tax income was $104 million compared with pre-tax loss of $152 million in the prior-year quarter.Capital PositionAs of Dec 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents (including cash and securities set aside for regulatory purposes) totaled $22.0 billion compared with $25.9 billion as of Dec 31, 2016.

465,ETFC,"Shares of Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (IBKR  -  Free Report) jumped 3.2% in after-hours trading following the release of third-quarter 2017 results. Adjusted earnings of 43 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents. Also, earnings were 43% above the prior-year quarter figure of 30 cents.Results benefited from improvement in revenues, lower operating expenses and a rise in DARTs while lower trading volume was the undermining factor. Further, Electronic Brokerage segment continued to perform decently and divestiture of the company’s U.S. options market making business acted as a tailwind.Comprehensive net income available to common shareholders amounted to $32 million or 44 cents per share, up from $20 million or 30 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.Rise in Revenues, Lower Costs Support ResultsTotal net revenues jumped 23% year over year to $426 million. The rise was primarily driven by significant increase in commission fees and interest income, partially offset by a decline in trading gains (down 71%). The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $375 million.Total non-interest expenses fell 2% from the year-ago quarter to $158 million. The decrease was mainly due to lower general and administrative costs, and absence of consumer bad debt.Income before income taxes came in at $268 million in the quarter, surging 46% year over year. Similarly, pre-tax profit margin was 63% compared with 53% in the prior-year quarter.Segment Performance ImproveElectronic Brokerage: Net revenues increased 27% year over year to $367 million. Pre-tax income rose 13% to $142 million. Total DARTs for cleared and execution-only customers were 695,000, up 14% from the year-ago quarter. Pre-tax profit margin improved to 61% from 56% in the prior-year quarter.Market Making: Net revenues plunged 30% year over year to $30 million. Pre-tax income was $11 million, up 57% from the year-ago quarter. The improvement was mainly driven by decline in operating costs, as the company completed the winding down of its U.S. options market making business. The segment’s results included a $10 million net recovery of exit costs. Pre-tax profit margin improved to 37% from 16% in the prior-year quarter.Moreover, the Corporate segment reported net revenues of $29 million, significantly up from $14 million in the year-ago quarter. Pre-tax income was $32 million, up drastically from $14 million in the prior-year quarter.Capital Position StrengthensAs of Sep 30, 2017, cash and cash equivalents (including cash and securities set aside for regulatory purposes) totaled $25.6 billion compared with $25.9 billion as of Dec 31, 2016.

466,ETFC,"The Charles Schwab Corp.’s (SCHW  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of 42 cents per share were a penny above the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, it increased 20% from the prior-year quarter.However, Schwab’s shares were down nearly 1.5% in early market trading. Steady fall in trading revenues remains a major concern for Schwab. Notably, the price reaction during the full trading session will provide a better idea about how investors accepted the results.Revenue growth (driven by a rise in interest income), lower level of fee waivers and no provisions were among the positives. Further, there was an impressive rise in total client assets and new brokerage accounts. However, higher expenses and a decrease in trading revenues remained the headwinds.Net income available to common shareholders was $575 million, up 22% year over year.Revenue Improvement Offset by Expense RiseNet revenues were $2.17 billion, climbing 13% year over year, supported by asset management and administration fees (up 8%) and net interest revenues (up 28%). These were partly offset by a 21% fall in trading revenues and 7% decline in other revenues. The reported figure was below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.19 billion.Total non-interest expenses rose 9% year over year to $1.22 billion. All expense components, except advertising and market development expenses, and communication costs, increased on a year-over-year basis.Provision for loan losses was nil as against $5 million in the year-ago quarter.Fee waivers were $1 million, down 98% from the year-ago quarter.Pre-tax profit margin improved to 43.6% from 41.5% recorded last year.At the end of the third quarter, Schwab’s average interest-earning assets grew10% year over year to $214.3 billion.Annualized return on equity as of Sep 30, 2017, came in at 15%, up from 14% a year ago.Other Business DevelopmentsAs of Sep 30, 2017, Schwab had total client assets of $3.18 trillion (up 17% year over year). Also, net new assets — brought by new and existing clients —  jumped 72% from the prior-year quarter to $51.6 billion.In addition, Schwab added 336,000 new brokerage accounts in the reported quarter. As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had a total of 10.6 million active brokerage accounts, 1.2 million banking accounts and 1.6 million corporate retirement plan participants.Our TakeFocus on low-cost capital structure will improve Schwab’s performance in the quarters ahead. Also, initiatives to strengthen market share will likely support its profitability over the long term, despite the expectation of near-term reduction in trading revenues.However, continuous rise in expenses remains a key concern for Schwab. Further, significant dependence on fee-based revenue streams makes us apprehensive.The Charles Schwab Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The Charles Schwab Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Charles Schwab Corporation QuoteCurrently, Schwab carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

467,ETFC,"Welcome to Episode #102 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.In this episode, Tracey is joined by Zacks ETF Strategist Eric Dutram and by Zacks Podcast Producer Danny MacPherson, two Millennials, to discuss how they started investing and what apps and platforms are out there for new investors.With the S&P 500 (SPY  -  Free Report) and the small caps (IWM  -  Free Report) hitting new highs nearly every day recently, many Millennials are starting to wonder if they shouldn’t be investing.But where do you start?Millennials may think they don’t have enough money to invest. But many of these platforms don’t have a minimum requirement and are fairly low cost.Here’s some ideas for those who want to invest, not simply trade.For Those Who Don’t Want to Think About Anything1.      AcornsBoth Eric and Danny use acorns.com. Their tagline is “automatically invest spare change.”It operates only as an app. You link it to your credit or debit card and it will round up to the next dollar amount. For example, if you buy a coffee that is $3.75, it will round up to $4.00 and take the $0.25 and put it into your investing account. You can also set up a recurring investment, either daily, weekly or monthly, to boost your balance.It has pre-set ETF portfolios you can invest in that range from aggressive to conservative.The cost is $1 a month up to $5,000 in the account wherein there’s a yearly fee of 0.25%.2.      StashStashinvest.com allows you to buy into pre-set ETF portfolios including ones titled “The Activist”, “The Techie”, “The Globetrotter” and “The Trendsetter.”This is thematic investing.Stash also offers ROTH IRA accounts that you can start with as little as $50.Similar to Acorns, it also charges $1 a month and the 0.25% yearly fee when the account reaches $5,000.Want to Move Up to the Next Level?Motif offers investing in portfolios, trading and IPOs so it is more advanced than the other two platforms.Through its portfolio program, you can invest in a preset plan or you can create your own. This means you already have to know something about stocks.It appears to have a minimum of $1,000 and the cost is $9.95 a month.Actual Trading PlatformsAlready have an idea of stocks or ETFs you want to buy?You probably need a platform that allows you to trade.Capital One (COF  -  Free Report) offers the Sharebuilder Plan which allows you to do a recurring investment each month in stocks, ETFs or mutual funds for just $3.95 per investment.For example, it can buy $100 worth of shares of Alibaba on the third Tuesday of every month.Tracey has used this plan for nearly 17 years. You might be surprised at how quickly this type of investing adds up to something substantial if you do it a few years in a row.For those who want to do more active trading, Capital One Investing has a trading platform as well, as do the well-known brokerage firms such as eTrade (ETFC  -  Free Report) and Schwab (SCHW  -  Free Report).That’s where you put in an actual order on the open market to buy, for example, Alibaba.This is more advanced investing and trading.The Hardest Part is StartingThere are a lot of investing platforms available now and it may seem confusing.But as Eric and Danny discuss, the key is to just start.Eager to Learn How to Trade Options?Have you always wanted to trade stock options but are unsure where to begin or what to look for?Each week, Zacks’ Dave Bartosiak will bring you a detailed explanation of the trades “live” on YouTube.Watch him go through the trade as he answers your questions in real time.Become one of Dave’s minions.

468,ETFC,"Improving operating backdrop, rising rate environment, expectations of lesser regulations, lower tax rates and strengthening domestic economy have driven investors’ optimism on banking stocks. Therefore, some of these stocks are profitable picks, due to strong fundamentals and solid long-term prospects.One such investment bank — E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ETFC  -  Free Report) — has rallied 14.2% quarter to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 11.1%.This price performance is backed by the gradually improving operating environment and rate hike scenario which is beneficial for brokerage business. Furthermore, anticipated improvement in trading activities and several ongoing initiatives will bode well for E*TRADE. Notably, the bank has recorded upswing in Daily Average Revenue Trades (DARTs) in the first two months of the current quarter.Apart from this, E*TRADE is part of the industry, which has a Zacks Industry Rank #81 (top 31%).Moreover, the stock seems undervalued on the basis of its Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio. E*TRADE has a P/B ratio of 2.16 compared with the S&P 500 average of 3.27.Additionally, the movement in earnings estimates for this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock have been decent. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged at $2.26 for 2017 and moved up 1.2% for 2018.Fundamentally, E*TRADE’s earnings have surged 29.56% annually over the last three to five years. This impressive earnings growth momentum is anticipated to continue in the near term as well. The company’s projected EPS (earnings per share) growth is 22.16% for 2017 and 14.79% for 2018.Further, with a rise in rates, brokerage firms are likely to engage in more investment activities. As brokerage firms earn interest income on un-invested cash in customer accounts, this rate hike will enable these firms to invest at higher rates. As E*TRADE currently derives nearly 60% of its total revenues from net interest income, the company is poised to benefit from the recent rate hikes.Additionally, E*TRADE is focused on derivatives mix with a target of increasing it to 35% of DARTs and also set managed account assets under management (AUM) target of $6 billion within the next two years. The company aims to achieve 2-3% improvement in its rate of annual organic growth, across accounts, assets and trades.E*TRADE did not repurchase shares during the second half of 2016, due to the OptionsHouse acquisition. However, following the acquisition, management resumed share repurchases in third-quarter 2017, with buyback of 4.6 million shares at an average price of $40.64. We believe, as the company strengthens its overall performance, it may gradually enhance shareholders’ value with a dividend payment as well.Other Stocks to ConsiderFederated Investors, Inc. (FII  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the past 60 days. In six months’ time, the company’s share price has been up more than 30%.

470,ETFC,"E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ETFC  -  Free Report) and E*TRADE Bank’s ratings are under review for upgrade by Moody's Investors Service. In July 2016, following the acquisition of OptionsHouse, Moody’s had affirmed the company’s rating as stable.Per Moody’s, E*TRADE is well poised to benefit from the increasing interest rates. Higher rates supported the company’s revenues when a pricing cut in early 2017 led to lower commission income. Also, the company’s effort to expand its balance sheet is encouraging.  Further, E*TRADE’s strong credit position displays its hold on strategies for overall growth.Moody’s is of the opinion that E*TRADE’s effort toward conservative use of leverage in acquisitions and shareholder distribution policies is a key positive. Also, it expects E*TRADE to maintain this approach while undertaking inorganic growth strategies in the future.While reviewing E*TRADE's ratings for upgrade, Moody’s is expected to analyze the key headwinds to credit profile along with the competitive scenario in commissions and deposit pricing. Also, the company’s revenue growth prospects along with financial metrics for inorganic growth and capital deployment activities will be considered. Lastly, E*TRADE Bank's funding profile and stability of its cash sweep deposits will be reviewed.What Can Drive the Ratings UpE*TRADE's ratings might get upgraded if Moody's feels that the impact of future competitive pressures on commission and deposit pricing will not have a significant impact on its performance and that the company is successful in expanding its profits without hurting its credit profile.What Can Drive the Ratings DownThe ratings will be affected if the company undertakes a debt-funded approach for inorganic growth strategies, especially if debt/EBITDA rises to about 2.5x, with no concrete plan to return to low debt leverage position.Also, a significant deterioration in franchise value through a security breach of client accounts, a significant legal or compliance issue resulting in reputational damage, loss of customers and litigation costs pressuring profit margins, might lead to a fall in ratings.Shares of E*TRADE have gained 43.5% over the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 19.1%.Currently, the stock sports a Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy).

472,ETFC,"Armed with cost-reduction initiatives and balance-sheet strengthening, Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) appears a promising pick right now. Moreover, it is well positioned to capitalize on the rising rate environment.A positive trend in estimate revisions reflect optimism over the company’s earnings growth prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Morgan Stanley’s current-quarter earnings has moved up 2.4% over the last 60 days. Also, the current year’s earnings estimates have climbed 3%. As a result, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The stock has surged 36.5% over the past 12 months, widely outperforming the industry’s gain of 23.1%. Here’s What Might Drive the Stock Higher Earnings Strength: Morgan Stanley recorded an earnings growth rate of 17.1% over the last three to five years compared with 11.7% for the industry it belongs to. The earnings growth rate for the current and the next year is anticipated to be 18.6% and 15%, respectively.Further, the company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate consistently in each of the trailing four quarters. The average beat was 18.8%.Revenue Growth: Organic growth remains strong at Morgan Stanley. Revenues witnessed a compound annual growth rate of 7.2% over the last five years (2012-2016). Further, the top line is expected to increase 8.2% in 2017 compared with no growth for the industry.Impressive Capital Deployment: Morgan Stanley’s capital deployment plan is commendable. Its 2017 capital plan includes a 25% dividend hike and a $5-billion share repurchase authorization. Given its solid liquidity position and earnings strength, the company should be able to sustain this level of capital deployments.Favorable ROE: Morgan Stanley’s return on equity (ROE) supports its growth potential. Its ROE of 9.83% compares favorably with the industry’s 9.18% average, implying that it is efficient in using its shareholders’ funds.Prudent Expense Management: Morgan Stanley launched a company-wide cost savings plan — Project Streamline — to discover and implement considerable infrastructure expense reductions by 2017. Though the company witnessed rising expenses for the last several years, a number of recent strategies and the above-mentioned plan have reversed the trend. Expenses declined in 2015 and 2016. Despite a rise in expenses in the first half of 2017, the company is headed in the right direction to achieve its expense-savings target of $1 billion by 2017.Stock Looks Undervalued: The stock currently has a Value Score of B. Also, it looks undervalued with respect to its price-to-earnings, price-to-book and PEG ratios. The company’s trailing 12-month P/E, P/B and PEG ratios of 12.73, 1.13 and 1.03, respectively, are below the industry averages of 17.32, 1.50 and 1.44.

473,ETFC,"In basketball, when a player hits a few shots in a row, he is said to have a “hot hand.” In finance, we call it “momentum.”Momentum is basically the tendency of winning stocks (i.e. stocks that have outperformed the market in recent times) to keep winning and losing stocks to keep losing. It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction instead of moving against the drift.At the core, momentum investing works on the principle of “Buy High, Sell Higher.”Thus, this strategy calls for hitching a ride on an already fast-moving train, without fretting about valuations or growth prospects. But why does momentum strategy work?There is a simple reason behind this. It works because we are humans!There’s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason for momentum strategy to work. For instance, we all know of investors who are afraid to book losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hoping that they will spring back to their original prices. On the other hand, many investors sell their winners way too early.Furthermore, investors initially tend to under-react to news, events or data releases. However, once things gain clarity, they tend to go with the flow and overreact, causing dramatic price reactions.These behavioral problems extend trends, and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players. So basically, it’s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future.Momentum investing is based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs, i.e. before prices become rational again.Also, unlike other investment styles, momentum premium has stood the test of time, remaining remarkably robust and persistent ever since it was identified by financial academics in the 1990s. This is especially important as academics are of the opinion that once research on factor premiums (like size and value) becomes known to public, the investment world catches on and the premium gradually erodes.Obviously, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child’s play. Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over long periods of time and across markets, and we have devised a strategy that will help investors get in on these trades and make handsome gains.Our screen will help you take advantage of both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price, which would reflect some profit-taking in the stock.Screening ParametersPercentage Change Price (52 Weeks) = Top #50: This item selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Momentum Style Score of B or better: A top Momentum Style Score cuts short the screening process as it takes into account several factors including volume change and performance relative to its peers. It indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success. Stocks with a Momentum Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) handily outperform other stocks.Current Price greater than 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5.Market Capitalization = Top #3000: We have chosen stocks that are among the top 3000 in terms of market value to ensure strong liquidity.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume shows that these stocks are easily tradable.Here are four of the seven stocks that made it through this screen:Triton International Limited (TRTN  -  Free Report), which offers acquisition, leasing, re-leasing, and sale of intermodal containers, has rallied more than 132% in the past year.

475,ETFC,"Growth stocks can be some of the most exciting picks in the market, as these high-flyers can captivate investors’ attention, and produce big gains as well.

Further, the figure was significantly higher than 57 cents earned in the prior-year quarter.The results largely benefited from top-line growth. The company’s credit quality was mixed. However, a rise in expenses and increase in provisions were the undermining factors.On a GAAP basis, Stifel Financial reported net income available to common shareholders of $50.5 million or 63 cents per share compared with $9.7 million or 13 cents in the year-ago quarter. The results included certain non-recurring items.Increased Revenue Offsets Higher ExpensesNet revenue came in at $725.6 million, up 11.3% year over year. The increase was mainly driven by higher net interest income along with higher investment banking revenues as well as asset management and service fees. Further, the revenue figure breezed past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $686.1 million.Global Wealth Management segment’s net revenue increased 17.1% year over year. Also, Institutional Group’s net revenue rose 5.8%.Stifel Financial’s non-interest expenses were $642.5 million, 1% higher than the year-ago quarter.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagAllowance, as a percentage of loans, increased to 0.88% from 0.86% in the prior-year quarter.

Also, earnings were 20% below the prior-year quarter figure of 40 cents. Higher expenses and lower trading volume hurt the results.

The rise was mainly due to significant jump in general and administrative costs.Income before income taxes came in at $204 million in the quarter, down 4% year over year.

Pre-tax loss was $24 million as against pre-tax income of $5 million a year ago.

480,ETFC,"The Charles Schwab Corp.’s (SCHW  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings of 39 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. It increased 30% from the prior-year quarter.Schwab’s shares were down nearly 1.1% in early market trading. Notably, the price reaction during the full trading session will provide a better idea about how the investors accepted the results.Revenue growth, lower level of fee waivers and no provisions were among the positives. Further, there was an impressive rise in total client assets and new brokerage accounts. However, higher expenses and a decline in trading revenues remained the headwinds.Net income available to common shareholders was $530 million, up 31% year over year.Revenue Improvement Offset by Expense RiseNet revenue was $2.13 billion, climbing 17% year over year, supported by asset management and administration fees (up 12%), other revenues (up 7%) and net interest revenues (up 32%). These were partly offset by a 22% fall in trading revenues. The reported figure was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Total non-interest expenses rose 10% year over year to $1.22 billion. All expense components, except communication costs, increased on a year-over-year basis.Provision for loan losses was nil as against $2 million in the year-ago quarter.Fee waivers were $1 million, down 98% from the year-ago quarter.Pre-tax profit margin improved to 42.7% from 39.4% recorded last year.At the end of the second quarter, Schwab’s average interest-earning assets jumped 17% year over year to $215.76 billion.Annualized return on equity as of Jun 30, 2017, came in at 15%, up from 13% a year ago.Other Business DevelopmentsAs of Jun 30, 2017, Schwab had total client assets of $3.04 trillion (up 16% year over year). Also, net new assets – bought by new and existing clients – jumped 142% from the prior-year quarter to $64.5 billion.In addition, Schwab added 357,000 new brokerage accounts in the reported quarter. As of Jun 30, 2017, the company had a total of 10.5 million active brokerage accounts, 1.1 million banking accounts and 1.5 million corporate retirement plan participants.Our TakeWhile focus on low-cost capital structure will improve Schwab’s performance in the quarters ahead, current equity market volatility is expected to continue driving its daily trading volumes. Also, initiatives to strengthen market share will likely support its profitability over the long term, despite the expectation of near-term reduction in trading revenues.However, continuous rise in expenses remains a key concern for Schwab. Further, significant dependence on fee-based revenue streams makes us apprehensive.The Charles Schwab Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The Charles Schwab Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Charles Schwab Corporation QuoteCurrently, Schwab carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

494,ETFC,"Frost Investment Advisors, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. (CFR  -  Free Report), announced considerable reduction of management fees in quite a few mutual funds that it manages. Frost's Value, Growth and Mid Cap Equity funds lowered fees to 0.50%, a reduction of 15 basis points (bps). Frost’s Credit Fund dropped its fees 10 bps to 0.50%. This change was effective from Sep 1, 2017. The move was the result of a decision passed in 2015 to remove sales charges or front-end loads on its Investor Class shares.According to Tom Stringfellow, president and chief investment officer of Frost Investment Advisors, the decline in fees was in line with its “effort to offer excellence at a fair price.” The reduction was also done with the aim to attract investors.As of Jun 30, 2017, Frost Investment Advisors managed mutual fund assets worth $3.47 billion. In April 2008, it started offering mutual funds to institutional investors and then stretched out its offer of retail shares in June 2008. It now offers 10 different managed strategies as mutual funds to both institutional and retail investors.A key strength at Cullen/Frost, the parent company of Frost Investment Advisors, is organic growth as reflected by the company’s revenue growth story. Revenues witnessed a compound annual growth rate of 5.9% over the last five years (2012-2016), with the trend continuing in first six months of 2017 as well. Moreover, we believe that lowering of fees by the subsidiary will attract more clients, pushing the total volume higher. This is expected to boost the non-interest income and margin. Hence, we believe the company is well positioned to maintain its increasing revenue trend going forward.Shares of Cullen/Frost have gained 26.6% over the last 12 months compared with the industry’s rally of 21%.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Cullen/Frost carries a Zack Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks from the finance space are E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ETFC  -  Free Report), AeroCentury Corp.

498,ETFC,"E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ETFC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20. While top line is expected to grow year-over-year, earning per share will likely remain flat.In the previous quarter, E*TRADE Financial’s earnings had surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 cents. Increased net revenue and a benefit from provisions aided results. Further, the quarter witnessed an increase in daily average revenue trades along with growth in customer accounts. However, the positives were partially offset by higher expenses.Notably, E*TRADE Financial delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 20.7%.The stock has gained 8.6% over the last six months versus the Zacks categorized Financial - Investment Bank industry’s decline of nearly 1%.E*TRADE Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise E*TRADE Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | E*TRADE Financial Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersWill the upcoming earnings release give a further boost to the E*TRADE’s stock? A lot depends on whether the firm posts a beat for the fifth straight quarter. However, our quantitative model does not conclusively predict a beat. Here’s why:E*TRADE doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for E*TRADE is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate matches the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents.Zacks Rank: E*TRADE’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise. Factors Influencing Q2 ResultsMargin Pressure to Ease: The rate hikes in 2017 are likely to ease margin pressure. However, lower treasury yields might curb this improvement to some extent.Growth in Client Assets: On the back of decent equity performance in the quarter, evident from 3% growth in the S&P 500 Index, it is likely that the company will experience a rise in client assets.Lower Trading Revenues: Owing to low volatility in the bond and equity markets, E*TRADE Financial’s trading revenues might decline in the second quarter.Activities of E*TRADE during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained stable over the last seven days.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some stocks worth considering, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Artisan Partners Asset Management Inc.

499,ETFC,"The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) is on track to develop and build a successful smart-beta investing strategy, which is more complex but cheaper than the conventional indexes that are weighed according to market capitalization, per a Bloomberg report. As part of this effort, the asset management division of the company has lowered the fees for its smart-beta funds.The company is offering a new fund to its clients, where investors need to pay only 0.09% to gain exposure to a portfolio of equal-weighted large-cap stocks.With this, the company’s funds will become cheaper than any other comparable fund that is weighed equally.It goes without saying that asset managers have finally realised that investors get more attracted toward low-cost products. Hence, they need to develop alternate strategies, which can assure better business from their clients.Smart-beta investing strategies offer better risk and return trade-off to clients by using objective factors such as volatility or dividends and not market cap to weigh indexes.Given that investors are getting obsessed with cost, Goldman Sachs now dreams of being at the forefront of smart-beta investing by coming up with products that are cheaper than any other asset managers’ products.However, this is not the first time that the company has taken such a drastic step. Two years ago, the company developed its first fund, which also charges 0.09%, and is skewed toward large-cap stocks with value, momentum, low volatility and quality.The company’s shares have gained 32.4% in the past 12 months, outperforming the 28.3% growth for the industry it belongs to.Currently, Goldman Sachs carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the same space are Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ETFC  -  Free Report) and LPL Financial Holdings Inc.

501,ETFC,"During the last earnings season, the Financial stocks were among the best performers. One such investment bank — E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ETFC  -  Free Report) — climbed 9% in second-quarter 2017. It significantly outperformed the industry’s gain of 1.5%.This price performance is backed by the gradually improving operating environment and rate hike scenario which is beneficial for brokerage business. Furthermore, anticipated improvement in trading activities and several of its ongoing initiatives will bode well for E*TRADE.Apart from this, E*TRADE is part of the industry, which has a Zacks Industry Rank #69 (top 26%).Moreover, the stock seems undervalued on the basis of its Price-to-Earnings (P/E) and Price-to-Book (P/B) ratios. E*TRADE has a P/E ratio of 18.05 compared with the S&P 500 average of 18.59. Also, the company’s P/B ratio of 1.79 comes below the S&P 500 average of 3.08.Additionally, the estimates for this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock have been on an upswing.

502,ETFC,"In the Q2 earnings season, the Finance sector turned out to be one of the best performers. So, we thought of bringing up a stock from the sector that reflects strong fundamentals and solid long-term growth opportunities.Synovus Financial Corporation (SNV  -  Free Report) is one such stock. Interest income growth, pruning of assets, improving credit quality and a strong capital position are major driving factors. However, escalating expenses remain concerns.Continued loan growth and expansions aided the company to surge 29.9% compared with 24.5% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.Further, the company’s earnings estimates remained unchanged for the current year, for the last seven days. As a result, it carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Synovus is focused on its organic growth strategy. This is reflected by consistent loan growth over the past few years, along with net interest income (NII), partly driven by the acquisitions completed during this period. Further, the company is well poised to enhance its NII in the quarters ahead, driven by steady growth in loan demand and gradual economic recovery. Notably, the rising interest-rate environment has eased margin pressure to an extent.Synovus remains committed to creating value for its shareholders through dividend hikes, share buybacks and acquisitions, thereby reflecting a strong balance-sheet position. In October 2016, the company acquired Entaire Global Companies, Inc. The deal is anticipated to be immediately accretive to its earnings per share, return on equity and return on assets (excluding merger-related costs). Recently, the company agreed to buy Cabela's banking operation. Further, the board of directors plans to repurchase up to $200 million shares in 2017. Also, in March 2017, a 25% hike in quarterly dividend was announced.Synovus has been substantially reducing the percentage of loans in its residential construction and development, and land acquisition portfolios. Also, credit quality trends though volatile, are expected to display broad-based improvement. This is likely to continue with relatively flat non-performing assets and net charge-offs expected within the 15-20 basis points (bps) range in 2017.Despite certain cost-saving initiatives, Synovus has been witnessing a rise in expenses. Also, management expects expenses to rise (2-4% in 2017) further with continued investments in technology, talent and to improve customer experience.Stocks to ConsiderLPL Financial Holdings Inc.

504,ETFC,"On Aug 21, 2017, we issued an updated research report on T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (TROW  -  Free Report). The company’s shares have gained 9.5% so far this year, underperforming the 16.5% growth of the industry it belongs to. This dismal performance stemmed from escalating expenses and near-term concerns related to investment advisory fees (comprising 88% of total revenue) as changes in the assets under management (AUM) due to market fluctuations and foreign exchange translations could hurt this revenue source of the company.Here are a few concerns forcing the stock to underperform the broader industry so far:  Firstly, growing operating expenses remain a major concern for T. Rowe Price. The company incurs significant expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from the existing ones. Notably, due to several planned strategic initiatives, T. Rowe Price projects operating expenses to rise 10% for 2017 (excluding the charge tied with Dell appraisal rights matter) and 7% for 2018.Secondly, in order to maintain a positive yield for fund investors, the company continues to waive fees in its money market mutual funds and trusts, which is likely to continue in 2017 at a very minimal level.Finally, over the last seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock remained stable at $5.77 for the current year.However, revenue growth, debt-free position with substantial liquidity and strong capital deployment activities are key strengths of T. Rowe Price. Investment in international growth funds is also likely to diversify the company portfolio, increasing both revenues and the investment management margin.In addition, the company remains focused on fortifying business via several initiatives namely, launching investment strategies and vehicles, enhancing client engagement capabilities in each distribution channel, strengthening distribution channels in the U.S., EMEA and Asia Pacific, improving technology platform and deriving long-term cost efficiencies.Currently, T. Rowe Price carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderLPL Financial Holdings Inc. (LPLA  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

505,ETFC,"Franklin Resources (BEN  -  Free Report) recorded second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings per share of 78 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents. Further, the bottom line compared favorably with the prior-year quarter figure of 74 cents per share.The results reflect Franklin’s top-line strength, supported by higher investment management fees. Nevertheless, elevated operating expenses remained a headwind. Also, net outflows and lower assets under management (AUM) were the undermining factors.The company reported net income of $443.2 million, up 5.3% from the prior-year quarter.Revenues Rise, Costs IncreaseTotal operating revenues increased 1% year over year to $1.62 billion in the quarter, mainly due to higher investment management, shareholder servicing fees and other fees, partly offset by lower sales and distribution fees. Also, revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.59 billion.Investment management fees climbed 3% year over year to $1.12 billion while sales and distribution fees declined 5% to $409.8 million. Shareholder servicing fees rose 9%, on a year-over-year basis to $61.3 million while other net revenues jumped 24% to $29.6 million.Total operating expenses flared up 2% to $1.06 billion. The increase resulted from rise in almost all components of expenses.As of Mar 31, 2018, total AUM came in at $737.5 billion, down slightly from $740 billion as of Mar 31, 2017. Notably, the quarter recorded net new outflows of $10 billion compared with outflows of $11 billion in year-ago quarter. Simple monthly average AUM of $751.8 billion advanced 3% on a year-over-year basis.Stable Capital PositionAs of Mar 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents, along with investments were $10.1 billion, compared with $9.9 billion as of Sep 30, 2017. Furthermore, total stockholders' equity was $10.4 billion compared with $12.9 billion as of Sep 30, 2017.During the reported quarter, the company repurchased 11.1 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $432.6 million.Our ViewpointFranklin increasing revenue base remains a tailwind. The company’s global footprint is an exceptionally favorable strategic point as its AUM is well diversified. However, regulatory restrictions might impede its AUM growth and escalate costs. Also, the company continues to witness net outflows, which remains a concern.Franklin Resources, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Franklin Resources, Inc.

The company’s strong trading volumes, client focus and cross-selling opportunities are anticipated to yield positive results for the stock.Further, the recent interest rate hikes are likely to bring further stability to top-line generation, in turn, creating buying opportunity for long-term horses. Though lack of diversity is visible, as TD Ameritrade’s operations are mainly concentrated in the U.S. and escalating costs might lead to operational inefficiency, sharper focus on organic growth will likely make the growth path smoother for the company.With net new client assets of about $22 billion as of Jun 30, 2017, TD Ameritrade’s strengths include a sturdy top line and earnings growth, trading activities, as well as steady capital deployment actions.Why is TD Ameritrade an Attractive PickBenefit from Rate Hike: With a rise in rates, brokerage firms are likely to engage in more investment activities. As brokerage firms earn interest income on un-invested cash in customer accounts, this rate rise will allow the brokerage firms to invest at higher rates.

Earnings are expected to exhibit an upswing in the near term as the company’s projected EPS growth (F1/F0) is 6.82%.Strong Trading Activity: TD Ameritrade’s trading volumes have been graphing an uptrend. On a year-over-year basis, the company’s average client trades per day increased 4%, 14% and 8% in fiscal 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, benefiting from the volatility in markets.
