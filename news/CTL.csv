10,CTL,"Internet users have an insatiable need for speed — and that's been a boon for telecom infrastructure firms like Dycom Industries (DY).The voracious appetite for faster wireline and wireless networks is fueling the market that Dycom serves. Video, cloud-computing and Internet of Things applications are driving demand for more bandwidth on communications networks.So Dycom is benefiting from communications firms installing fiber-optic networks and wireless carriers upgrading to faster cellular networks like 5G.""Several industry participants have articulated plans to deploy multigigabit speeds, while others are preparing to do so,"" Dycom CEO Steven Nielsen said on a recent call with analysts. ""These industry developments have produced opportunities across a broad array of our existing customers, which in aggregate are without precedent for the industry in our experience.""For Dycom, that should mean an extension of its winning streak. The Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.-based company — a provider of specialty contracting services in the U.S. and Canada to telecom companies as well as electric and gas utilities — has posted 20% or greater year-over-year sales growth for the last seven quarters.In its fiscal second quarter ended Jan. 28, Dycom earned 82 cents a share excluding items, up 52% from the year-earlier period, on sales that rose 25% to $701 million. The company's results were boosted by deployments of 1-gigabit wireline networks for key customers.Dycom's biggest customer is AT&T (T), which accounted for 28% of revenue in the second quarter. Other major clients include Comcast (CMCSA), CenturyLink (CTL), Dow Jones industrial average component Verizon Communications (VZ), Windstream (WIN) and Charter Communications (CHTR).The split of its business last quarter was 68.1% in telecom, 24.4% for cable, 4.9% in facility-locating services, and electrical and other making up the rest.But Wall Street is forecasting Dycom's growth to slow during the near term. It seems the company has been on such a roll, it's going up against difficult comparisons.For the April quarter, analysts are modeling Dycom to earn $1.19 a share, up 10%, on sales of $736.7 million, up 11%. For the July quarter, Wall Street is looking for Dycom to earn $1.79 a share, up 9%, on sales of $849.4 million, up 8%.Still, Dycom sees opportunities in emerging wireless technologies, such as 5G networks, over the near to intermediate term. In a plus for the company, the deployment of faster wireless networks also leads to a boost in associated fiber-optic wireline deployments at those locations.For instance, Verizon has embarked on a major, multi-city fiber deployment with the aim of building out a fiber network that will support all of the company's businesses, including the deployment of 5G wireless.""We roughly size the initial phase of Verizon's fiber deployment at $5 billion to $7 billion over the next three years, which we believe could translate into $300 million-plus of annual incremental revenue opportunity for Dycom,"" Stifel analyst Noelle Dilts said in a report April 19. ""This could translate into $47 million in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and 64 cents of EPS.""And Verizon's project could be just the start, she said.IBD'S TAKE: Dycom Industries has an IBD Composite Rating of 97, meaning it has outperformed 97% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more information on Dycom, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.""While the size of the opportunity associated with a Verizon fiber rollout is important, the implications for the competitive dynamics of the industry are arguably of greater significance, as AT&T, Comcast, Charter and others will have to respond to Verizon's move,"" Dilts said.Dilts rates Dycom stock as buy with a price target of 120.Investors have driven Dycom stock to record highs. Dycom hit an all-time high of 109.65 on April 25. It broke out of a cup base with a 98.57 buy point on April 18. Shares ended trading Friday up 2.3% to 107.84.Canaccord Genuity analyst Bobby Burleson also is bullish on Dycom. He rates the stock as buy with a price target of 120.""Based on recent customer and supply-chain commentary, we believe Dycom is likely to continue to operate in a strengthening environment for fiber demand,"" Burleson said in an April 12 report. ""Customers maintain healthy fiber deployment schedules, with multiyear build plans at cable (operators) and telcos still in early stages.""Dycom expects to see initial deployments of 5G wireless systems this year and then ramping, Burleson said.Finally, FBR analyst Alex Rygiel rates Dycom as outperform with a price target of 120.The wireline infrastructure upgrade cycle is ""in the early innings of increased spending"" by telecom carriers and cable operators on 1-gigabit-per-second network deployments, Rygiel said in a note to clients.The analyst also raised his price target to 120 from 115 on March 2 after Dycom's second-quarter report, which beat consensus estimates for earnings per share and sales.""The quarter was positively affected by strong 1 Gbps (gigabit-per-second) fiber deployments and market-share gains,"" Rygiel wrote. ""The telecom wireline industry remains robust, with 1 Gbps deployments and the development of 5G technologies. We continue to believe that Dycom is the best-positioned contractor to benefit from these telecom trends, given its scale, market position, customer relationships and financial strength.""

12,CTL,"Comcast (CMCSA), Charter Communications (CHTR) and other cable TV firms are becoming broadband-first companies as they take away internet customers of AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ).The top cable companies added 3.3 million broadband subscribers in 2016 — similar to the gains in 2015, and the most net additions in any year since 2007, says Leichtman Research Group. Cable TV firms, meanwhile, lost 278,000 pay-TV video subscribers in 2016, although Comcast added 161,000.Comcast had 24.7 million broadband subscribers vs. 22.5 million video customers at the end of 2016. The broadband gap is wider at Charter, which acquired Time Warner Cable. Charter had 22.59 million broadband subscribers vs. 17.2 million video subscribers as of Dec. 31.The top cable TV firms followed by LRG had 58.4 million broadband subscribers vs. 48.6 million video subscribers at the end of 2016. Top telephone companies — including AT&T, Verizon and CenturyLink (CTL) — had 34.5 million broadband subscribers, down 599,000 from a year earlier. In 2015, phone companies lost 185,000 broadband subscribers, says LRG.With more internet video services rolling out in 2017 and next year, pay-TV industry subscribers could fall further, analysts say. As cord-cutting goes on and the traditional video business for cable providers shrinks, their No. 1 product will be broadband and internet access. So even if internet video takes off, they still have broadband dominance.IBD'S TAKE: Verizon and AT&T have been favorites of investors looking for high dividends, but there are other options, such as banks, industrials and real estate investment trusts (REITs).

This week, Fabrinet (FN) Q2 earnings topped views, while Lumentum stock popped to record highs on both Wednesday and Thursday after executives on its earnings call made comments that led analysts to expect the company will ramp up 3D sensor products for customers such as Apple (AAPL).IBD'S TAKE: Weibo, Alibaba, Netflix and Glaukos are on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.Lumentum stock rose 1.% on Friday, while Ciena rose 2.4%. IBD's 14-company Telecom-Fiber Optics group rose more than 2%, but it ranks just No. 160 out of 197 groups, down from No. 36 eight weeks ago.Infinera, meanwhile, reported that its Q4 swung to a 12-cent per-share loss minus items from a 5-cent profit in Q4 2015. Revenue fell 30% to $181 million. Analysts, though, had projected a 13-cent loss and revenue of $175.3 million.""We sense the tone of business has shifted toward becoming more bullish with management noting several large wins in data center interconnect and metro this quarter,"" William Blair analyst Dmitry Netis said in his research report. ""We continue to see the re-emergence of top-line growth and operating margin expansion in the second half of this year and into 2018.""For the current quarter, Infinera forecast revenue of $167 million to $178 million, down from $249 million in Q1 2016, the midpoint just ahead of analyst consensus estimates of  $170.7 million. Infinera said it expects a loss of 16 cents per share as it hikes investments. Analysts had been modeling an 11-cent loss.George Notter, a Jefferies analyst, maintained a hold rating on Infinera stock.""The organization is still emerging from a perfect storm of M&A-induced spending slowdowns affecting their largest customers,"" said Notter in a report. ""We'll remain on the sidelines regarding the stock until we get better visibility into these fundamental product and customer improvements.""RELATED:Lumentum Stock Breaks Out On Apple iPhone 3D Sensor Speculation

14,CTL,"Stock funds seemed only slightly less frenetic than President Trump setting policy in his first 100 days, as the average domestic stock fund rose 1.83% in January, padding gains of 1.46% in December and 10.81% in 2016.World equity funds did even better in January, advancing 3.86%, according to Lipper Inc.Taxable bond funds rose 0.76%, while municipal bond funds rose 0.46%.The S&P 500 rose 1.90% last month.Not all of the young year's gains are attributable to the new president and new Congress, say stock fund managers and strategists.""Regardless of who was elected, the economy was already improving,"" said Kimberly Scott, lead manager of $2.4 billion Ivy Mid Cap Growth (WMGAX) and co-manager of $288 million Ivy Mid Cap Income Opportunities (IVOAX) funds. ""The trajectory of corporate profits had already turned up. The outlook for corporate profits for the end of 2017 into 2018 was already quite strong. The policy changes concerning taxes, repatriation of overseas corporate cash (and) unwinding some onerous regulations that President Trump talked about could boost corporate profits more. But the economy was already getting stronger.""And mutual fund professionals expect the uptrend to continue this year.""The market could go in two very different ways,"" said Omar Aguilar, Charles Schwab Investment Management's chief investment officer of equities. ""On the one hand, there is a very powerful combination of factors that could translate into record levels for equities.""On the other hand, the market could go south. ""The attempt at reforms (of taxes, corporate cash repatriation and regulatory burdens) could increase the federal budget deficit,"" Aguilar said. ""There is a potential for trade wars. Emerging markets are still landing. A strong U.S. currency could hurt exports. Those headwinds could backfire into our economy and markets.""On balance, Aguilar is guardedly bullish. ""On a net basis we will see the market trend up,"" he said. ""But it will be volatile.""Scott is favoring stocks in sectors that typically benefit at the outset of a rally. ""Many think we're in the midcycle of a recovery,"" she said. ""But we had a significant corporate-profits recession. So to me this feels like an early-stage economic recovery, and that's when you want to shift more asset weight into technology, financials, energy and industry.""Consumer discretionary is usually part of that early-stage recovery party. But this time brick-and-mortar retailers are battling digital retailers. Brick-and-mortar retailers are being forced to spend on their own websites and low-cost delivery services, Scott says, which will continue to sap their earnings.Large-cap growth mutual funds' 4.10% gain on average in January led all U.S. diversified stock fund categories.Yet investors were still jittery enough at times to drive precious-metals funds, a defensive category, up 14.94% last month, higher than any other sector. That beat basic-materials funds, which gained 7.31%.Latin American funds paced foreign stock fund categories by tacking on 7.67%.Taxable bonds were led by flexible-income funds 1.61% gain. Treasury funds inched up 0.36%.Trailing precious metals and several other sector fund categories, tech funds notched a 5.13% January gain. IPG Photonics (IPGP) is a technology name that John Barr, manager of $60 million Needham Aggressive Growth (NEAGX) — whose 9.32% average annual gain over the past 10 years topped 96% of its small-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. — likes in a market poised to continue higher but with volatility. The company makes fiber-optic lasers, which can be used for cutting and welding in industrial applications. As costs fall, laser systems become increasingly attractive, especially in welding, Barr says. ""Big automotive makers are quite interested in using this for welding,"" he said.Revenue grew 19% and 17% in the two most recent years. Earnings grew an average of 18% annually from 2014 to 2016. ""It has a long runway ahead, with great returns and great management,"" Barr said.PDF Solutions (PDFS) is another tech name Barr likes. The firm produces software that's the core of electrical testing of newly made semiconductors. It has the potential for taking share from more conventional optical testing systems, Barr says.Two major chipmakers signed on as customers in 2016. PDF's service is delivered on a subscription basis. ""So it has high margins and could double company earnings"" in the near term, Barr said, especially if it wins customers in China as the Middle Kingdom builds out its own semiconductor manufacturing industry between now and 2020.Ivy's Scott likes MercadoLibre (MELI), an Argentina-based online retailer that offers an electronic payment service. ""It's still in an earlier phase of development than Amazon (AMZN) is here,"" said Scott. ""There is no reason to think that demand for online buying and payment will not be as attractive to Latin Americans as it is in the U.S. and Asia.""Video-game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) is another of Scott's favorites. The video-game publisher benefits from a console-upgrade cycle and the shift to digital game downloads, which carry higher profit margins, as IBD has reported. Scott says now, ""I continue to like the tremendous changes in the products and innovation there. They make games that consumers love. And the way that these products are developed and distributed digitally is such a profit enhancer. We think that story continues.""Among financial services stocks, Scott likes regional banks such as First Republic (FRC) and Signature Bank (SBNY), which should benefit from rising rates and from a reduction in their regulatory burden. Trump targeted the Dodd-Frank Act for review on Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Midsize regional banks have gotten a boost from congressional moves to raise the threshold of the Dodd-Frank Act's systemic risk designation. The existing rule applies to banks with at least $50 billion in assets, subjecting them to costly regulations. As IBD recently reported, Congress is looking at raising that to $250 billion.Scott also likes MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX), an electronic bond-trading exchange that claims cheaper transaction costs than traditional investment-bank bond trades, easier odd-lot trading and specialization in corporate credit. ""There are others trying to do this, but none has gained the traction that MarketAxess has,"" she said.Amid the rally in energy stocks, Stephen DeNichilo, co-manager of $2.9 billion Federated Kaufmann Large Cap (KLCAX), likes small-cap Independence Contract Drilling (ICD). The company offers customers of energy exploration and production very sophisticated drilling rigs. ""They're on the leading edge of what E&P companies want,"" DeNichilo said. ""They have only 12 working rigs, so essentially they are fully utilized. They have leverage to the U.S. shale-pad drilling rally. They have a clean balance sheet. They are trading below their $10-a-share replacement value. And they could be a takeout candidate.""In addition to trading below 10, earnings per share growth has declined at triple-digit paces the past four quarters.Among industrials, DeNichilo likes Dycom Industries (DY). ""We like long-term investment themes,"" DeNichilo said. ""Dycom is the largest specialty contractor for fiber-(optic cable). They're the only national specialty contractor that puts fiber into the ground at a time when AT&T (T), CenturyLink (CTL), Charter (CHTR), Verizon (VZ) and other (telecoms) are about to ramp up.""That cycle will be sparked, DeNichilo says, by AT&T embarking on a massive plan to lay fiber so the telecom giant can offer customers high-speed internet service. ""Their plan is to bring 1-gigabit speed to (at least) 12 million customers by 2019,"" DeNichilo said. The industry has seen that when dramatically higher speeds are offered at the same or comparable cost, customers switch providers. ""Competitors will have to follow,"" he said. ""This will be a big cycle for Dycom. Also, fiber investments could be part of any large infrastructure (upgrade) plan by the government.""At the average U.S. broadband speed of about 18 megabits, downloading a two-hour movie takes more than 10 minutes. It takes eight seconds via 1-Gig fiber, according to fastmetrics.com. And AT&T's speed upgrade can be achieved solely through street-side fiber, and will not require any in-home rewiring or cable replacement, DeNichilo says.Dycom's earnings grew an average of 74% annually over the past three years. ""Despite earnings growth way above the market, they are trading below the market multiple,"" DeNichilo said.DeNichilo also likes Martin Marietta Materials (MLM). As the U.S. economy heats up, demand for construction aggregates will grow. ""Even without Trump's Mexican wall, nonresidential construction — which is the bulk of aggregate consumption — is still below its 55-year normal level,"" he said. ""This company has essentially doubled earnings per share over the past three years, so its outlook is fantastic whether there is a (federal government) infrastructure plan or not.""Ivy's Scott likes water-heater-maker A.O. Smith (AOS). ""There isn't a lot of cyclicality in their business,"" Scott said. ""Homeowners have to replace their heaters every 10 to 12 years. And they have a growing business in China for water heaters and water-purification systems. It's a nice growth engine for Smith.""Smith's average annual earnings growth rate was 24% from 2014 through 2016. ""They're a consistent grower and reliable payer of dividends,"" Scott added. The company's dividend yield is 1.1%. ""We're not a dividend fund, but it's nice to have on top of everything.""RELATED: Where Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock Gains In 20172017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewClick Here To See A List Of New Buys Of Top Mutual FundsClick Here To See A List Of Latest Sells Of Top Mutual Funds

15,CTL,"The buildout of fiber-optic networks by Verizon Communications (VZ), Comcast (CMCSA) and Frontier (FTR), as well as the growth of cloud- computing data centers, has boosted revenue growth at CommScope Holding (COMM), says Citigroup, which initiated coverage on the maker of data connectivity products with a buy rating.""We believe fiber to the home (FTTH) trends in North America and Western Europe support our thesis of a turnaround in the Connectivity division, with around 50% of its sales related to telcos,"" Citigroup analyst Stanley Kovler said in his research report Tuesday. ""We believe CommScope is levered to the fiber builds at Verizon, Frontier, and other a large telcos, along with cable companies.""Kovler set a price target of 45 on CommScope stock. Kovler says he expects double-digit revenue growth from CommScope.Shares of CommScope closed up 0.5% at 37.21 in the stock market today after rising 1.5% on Monday. CommScope stock, which debuted in 2013, touched an all-time high of 38 on Dec. 12.IBD'S TAKE: CommScope ranks No. 28 in the IBD 50, while Ubiquiti Networks, also part of the Telecom-Infrastructure group, is No. 4. Chipmaker Nvidia tops the IBD 50, which is well-represented by semiconductor, optical and wireless firms.Hickory, N.C.-based CommScope ranks No. 28 in the IBD 50. CommScope stock has shot up 42% in 2016. Shares are trading above its 50-day moving average and are extended beyond a buy point of 33.19 first touched on Nov. 8.CommScope in 2015 acquired TE Connectivity's Broadband Network Solutions (BNS) business, expanding into the ""hyper-converged"" data center cabling market. Kovler says CommScope might have upside from the buildout of 4G wireless networks in India.IBD's Telecom-Infrastructure group ranks No. 122 out of 197 industry groups. Ubiquiti Networks (UBNT) is the top-ranked stock in the group.BroadSoft (BSFT), a company in the same group, could get a boost from a contract win by customer CenturyLink (CTL), said Jefferies, in a separate report. RELATED:Quietly, Telecom System Builders Emerge As LeadersAs Networks Speed Up, Arista Gains Ground On Giant Cisco

16,CTL,"Earnings and revenue growth might play a secondary role for telecom stocks in 2017 amid speculation over a potential burst of mergers and acquisitions, but T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Charter Communications (CHTR) stand out for the possible growth of their bottom lines.""2017 is setting up to be potentially one of the most dramatic years in recent memory in terms of reshaping the telecom sector,"" Simon Flannery, Morgan Stanley's longtime telecom analyst, said in a mid-December research report.T-Mobile, controlled by Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY), figures in many M&A scenarios, along with Sprint (S), Comcast (CMCSA), Verizon Communications (VZ), Dish Network (DISH) and Charter.AT&T (T), meanwhile, is seeking regulatory approval to buy media giant Time Warner (TWX).""The prospect for a sizable number of announced and potential future M&A deals could significantly benefit some companies, while challenging others in the sector,"" Flannery wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Verizon and AT&T have been favorites of investors looking for high dividends, but there are other options, such as real estate investment trusts (REITs) and banks. Check out IBD's Income Investor for high-dividend-paying stocks.T-Mobile and Sprint stocks have jumped 49% and 140%, respectively, in 2016 through Tuesday, owing partly to their improved operating performance but also on views they could try to merge during a Trump administration. T-Mobile and Sprint, controlled by Japan's SoftBank, are the Nos. 3 and 4 U.S. carriers, behind AT&T and Verizon.""We see T-Mobile as being in a strong strategic position, with multiple options, each of which could have very different implications for other industry players,"" Flannery said. ""While we expect a more deregulatory climate, there are significant questions about how accommodative a new DoJ and FCC would be to further industry consolidation.""We continue to believe that four-to-three wireless consolidation would be challenging.""Wells Fargo's Stephanie Fritzsche on Wednesday became at least the second analyst to lower Q4 subscriber growth estimates for Sprint. She cited aggressive holiday season promotions by Verizon and T-Mobile.Sprint is expected to lose 20 cents per share in the fiscal 2017 ending March 31; but for fiscal 2018 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate a profit of 3 cents.T-Mobile's 2017 earnings are expected to grow 21% to $1.85 per share. Charter's EPS is expected to rise 33% to $5.01 per share, including the acquisition of Time Warner Cable, analysts estimate.Observers speculate Verizon could set its sights on Charter or forge a deeper partnership with the two biggest cable TV firms, Comcast and Charter.Verizon's 2017 EPS is expected to edge up just 2.8% to $4 per share, and AT&T's 4.5% to $2.97 per share, analysts estimate.Comcast will end 2017 with EPS up 8% to $3.77, analysts estimate, while Dish Network's profit is expected to fall 11% to $2.69 per share.Satellite broadcaster Dish, which has amassed 77 MHz of radio spectrum, has been unable to find a wireless partner to sell mobile video services as its core pay-TV business stagnates.CenturyLink's (CTL) 2017 EPS, meanwhile, is expected to slip 4% to $2.30. CenturyLink has agreed to merge with Level 3 Communications (LVLT).AT&T and Verizon stocks have each formed cup bases. AT&T has a buy point of 43.99; Verizon's is 57.05.

17,CTL,"Data, data and more data.Many companies looking to scale-up in today's tech-focused business landscape are creating, manipulating or leveraging data of some kind, and fiber-infrastructure company Zayo Group Holdings (ZAYO) thinks it's at the center of this growing data network.On the company's quarterly earnings call earlier this month, Zayo Chief Executive Dan Caruso touted the company's prospects. He said that with such technologies on the market as augmented reality, cloud computing, data analytics, cybersecurity or — in the near future — quantum computing, there is a huge demand for ""tons"" more bandwidth.""In no scenario does anyone describe there being a technology other than fiber that will be the workhorse of solving for that,"" Caruso said.One of Zayo's largest customers is Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google Fiber, according to Cowen. And with seemingly endless opportunities to expand its clientele on the horizon, Zayo, one of the only independent nationwide owners of fiber assets, wants to make dark fiber its bread and butter.Dark fiber is essentially unused fiber that is controlled by the purchasing company. That segment accounted for almost 30% of total revenue last quarter, with the fattest adjusted earnings margin at 73%.Barclays analyst Amir Rozwadowski says Zayo's standing in the telecom and cloud ecosystem is strengthening because of fiber. When it comes to the cloud, much of the demand in that space is driven by major public cloud providers Microsoft (MSFT) Azure, Amazon (AMZN) Web Services, Salesforce (CRM) and Google Cloud.""The secular demand for fiber remains robust, and management has taken several steps that should position the company well over the longer term,"" Rozwadowski said in a Nov. 9 report.One of the most important steps the company has taken strategically is to beef up its local ground game while continuing its focus on attracting bigger, national customers.""We've changed the way we approach our local dark-fiber opportunities to have strong multifunctional regional teams under regional leaders, for them to work hard in the local markets in all the nooks and crannies of what it takes to exploit those opportunities,"" Caruso said on the call. ""At the same time, you're continuing to be real strong on the more national opportunities that allow us to win the bigger deals and further build out the network.""Zayo also has been aggressive with its capital expenditures, with a focus on fiber. JPMorgan analyst Philip Cusick notes that the company's capital program began to accelerate six to eight quarters ago, with expenditures hitting a new high of $208.3 million in the most recent quarter.""There is no end in sight to Zayo's aggressive build,"" Cusick said in a Nov. 9 report. ""While revenue has lagged given the long lead time of fiber and small cell programs, we are now approaching the end of some projects and should begin to see the fruits of the labor in the next few quarters.""The company's long-term growth prospects have certainly boosted the stock. Its October 2014 initial public offering has been on a steady climb this year, surging more than 75% since hitting an all-time trading low of 19.59 in February.In its latest breakout in September, shares dipped back below the buy point and tested support at the 50-day line before continuing to move higher — similar to action seen among other breakouts this year.The stock hit an all-time high of 35.33 on Nov. 21. Shares ended trading down 1% Monday to 34.70 on the stock market today and are currently 16% past a flat-base entry of 29.86. Once a stock is 20% to 25% past a buy point, that's a signal to take at least partial profits.IBD'S TAKE: While Zayo's stock movement has been strong lately, it still isn't at the top of IBD's computer-networking group. Zayo ranks fourth, with Arista Networks now at the top spot. Shares have been particularly resilient over the past few weeks as the major indexes dropped to nearly four-month lows ahead of the election. And though the company reported a revenue miss when it reported earnings on Nov. 8 — with a 38% gain to $505 million, missing views for $511 million — the stock didn't take much of a hit.Zayo also said in its fiscal first-quarter report that it swung to a profit of 6 cents a share vs. a 6-cent loss last year, beating expectations.But with the bar set high for the company's growth opportunities, analysts have the company's net new-installations figure in focus. For the most recent quarter, Zayo logged $2.3 million in installations, missing forecasts.""We believe the dark fiber business segment has been and will be what gets investors excited about Zayo,"" said Pacific Crest Analyst Michael Bowen in a recent report. ""However, we have seen dark fiber consensus estimates move lower for several quarters in a row.On the call, Caruso set a goal of consistently achieving $3 million in net installations. But how long it will take the company to get there is uncertain, and Barclays' Rozwadowski says ""the potential for accelerating growth seems to be shifting to a mid-to-long-term prospect (as opposed to within the next few quarters).""JPMorgan's Cusick believes Zayo is on track to reach double-digit revenue growth in the next year. He and Rozwadowski agree that record net bookings of $7.2 million last quarter can be used as a measure of healthy growth prospects.""As these bookings are converted to installs, and assuming Zayo's churn levels remain steady, the business could see an increase in its quarterly net install rate,"" said Rozwadowski.Other companies in the telecom-infrastructure space have been making acquisitions. Verizon Communications (VZ) in February agreed to buy XO Communications for $1.7 billion. And last month CenturyLink (CTL) and Level 3 Communications (LVLT) announced a $34 billion cash-and-stock merger deal.Rozwadowski sees the Century Link-Level 3 as another reason that points to ""fiber's rising value proposition to the market.""Caruso isn't concerned about the deal.""It leaves us as the only independent provider who has significant fiber across the broadly defined U.S., with deep, dense fiber network and intercity fiber, and across many of the city routes,"" he said on the call. ""I think that's really good for Zayo.""
"
18,CTL,"The Federal Communications Commission could get involved in the review of AT&T's (T) proposed acquisition of media giant Time Warner (TWX), joining the Department of Justice, says Oppenheimer, which downgraded the telecom conglomerate's stock.Oppenheimer analyst Time Horan says AT&T stock will likely be range bound during the regulatory review, which he expects to drag on into 2018. MoffettNathanson on Monday also forecast that the AT&T-Time Warner review would continue into early 2018. While the DOJ looks at mergers on antitrust grounds the FCC determines whether deals are in the public's interest. MoffettNathanson, like Oppenheimer, also says there's a good chance the FCC will push its way into the AT&T-Time Warner review.Horan, meanwhile, upgraded CenturyLink (CTL) to outperform. CenturyLink last week agreed to acquire Level 3 Communications (LVLT) in a $34 billion cash and stock merger. CenturyLink's stock sold off more than 20% since the deal was announced.IBD'S TAKE: Some investors like telecom companies because many pay high dividends, but there are other options at IBD's Income Investor. ""We are downgrading AT&T from outperform to perform as we believe CenturyLink's dividend is relatively more attractive,"" said Horan in a research report. ""We also see the Time Warner merger as facing higher regulatory hurtles and taking more like 15 months to complete vs. nine for CenturyLink-Level 3.""AT&T agreed to pay $85.4 billion in cash and stock for Time Warner. Time Warner shareholders will own about 15% of the combined company.If regulators approve the Time Warner acquisition, AT&T will have a national wireless network plus the assets of satellite broadcaster DirecTV, acquired in 2015, and the programming of Time Warner to whisk content to mobile devices.""We see the DOJ suing DTV over the Dodgers as an ominous sign,"" added Horan. ""Also, the FCC may initiate a formal review with an eye toward its zero rating (data billing) policy.""AT&T's stock tends to take a pause when the company is in the process of closing on a major acquisition, and we suspect a similar outcome and see a better opportunity in CenturyLink currently.""AT&T stock rose 0.54% to 37.01 in the stock market today, while CenturyLink stock jumped 3.6% to 24.15.Time Warner's media empire includes HBO and Turner Broadcasting, which has rights to sports telecasts.

19,CTL,"Zayo Group Holdings (ZAYO) said it swung to a 6-cent per-share profit in the September quarter vs. a 6-cent loss in the year-earlier period, edging views, but revenue missed consensus estimates.Zayo stock was down a fraction in after-hours trading, after the company released its earnings. Shares rose 1.2% to 32.74 in the regular session in the stock market today.Boulder, Colo.-based Zayo said fiscal Q1 revenue increased 38% to $505 million including acquisitions.Analysts had forecast a 5-cent profit on revenue of $511 million.Zayo operates fiber-optic networks in metropolitan areas, as well as between cities. It leases fiber-optic cables to wireless phone companies and other customers. It also operates data centers.IBD'S TAKE: Some investors like telecom companies because many pay high dividends, but there are other options at IBD's Income Investor. Zayo's shareholders include private equity firms M/C Partners, GTCR, Oak Investment Partners and Columbia Capital.Two firms similar to private equity-controlled Zayo have recently been acquired. Verizon Communications (VZ) agreed to buy XO Communications in February for $1.7 billion, while CenturyLink (CTL) last month announced a merger with Level 3 Communications (LVLT) for $34 billion in cash and stock.

20,CTL,"CenturyLink (CTL) agreed to buy Level 3 Communications (LVLT) for about $34 billion cash and stock in a deal that will create a more formidable competitor in the market for business telecommunications services.The acquisition values Level 3 at $66.50 a share, the companies said in a statement Monday. That's about 42% above where the Broomfield, Colorado-based company was trading last week, before reports surfaced of a potential acquisition by CenturyLink, which is based in Monroe, Louisiana. The value of the deal includes assumed debt.Level 3 is one of the largest providers used by internet services including Netflix Inc. and Google to route traffic across the web, operations that would bolster CenturyLink's core offerings to businesses. The deal also promises to help CenturyLink by giving it access to about $10 billion in tax credits that Level 3 is carrying on its books, Jennifer Fritzsche, an analyst with Wells Fargo Securities LLC, said last week.""Together with Level 3 we will have one of the most robust fiber network and high-speed data services companies in the world,"" CenturyLink Chief Executive Officer Glen Post said in the statement. He will remain CEO of the combined company, while Level 3 Chief Financial Officer Sunit Patel will be CFO of the new company.CenturyLink, which has been exploring the sale of its data center business, is one of the biggest phone companies in the U.S., formed after CenturyTel bought Embarq in 2009 and acquired Qwest Communications International two years later.The company on Monday reported third-quarter profit of 56 cents a share, after one-time items, beating the average estimate of 55 cents from analysts polled by Bloomberg, on revenue of $4.38 billion, which matched analysts' views. But CenturyLink guided fourth-quarter estimates lower.IBD'S TAKE: CenturyLink is getting a major content-deliver network (CDN) provider, which serves Netflix. Akamai, another big CDN that serves Netflix, had outperformed shares of Level 3. Last week, Akamai reported strong earnings and guidance last week, sending shares soaring.Both companies have contended with growing competition from cable providers and other smaller rivals offering internet and phone connections for businesses. CenturyLink, which also offers residential landline phone and internet services, gets about two-thirds of its revenue from business customers.The acquisition is one of the biggest telecommunications deals of the year. Level 3 had a market value of $19.4 billion at Friday's close and has about $11 billion in debt. CenturyLink was valued at about $16.6 billion and has about $19 billion in debt.CenturyLink shares plunged 12.5% to close at 26.58 on the stock market today. Level 3 jumped nearly 4% to 56.15.Level 3 provides so-called content-delivery network services, particularly to Netflix (NFLX). With more people streaming TV shows and movies over the web, distributors like Netflix have to arrange with a content delivery network to set aside enough servers and transportation capacity for faster load times. By moving the content closer to users and managing traffic patterns viewers can benefit from less delays and buffering of shows.Bank of America and Morgan Stanley advised CenturyLink on the deal. Those two banks have committed to lending the company about $10.2 billion in new secured debt. Evercore Partners issued a fairness opinion while Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Jones Walker provided legal advice.Level 3 was advised by Citigroup, with a fairness opinion from Lazard Ltd., and Wilkie Farr & Gallagher LLP gave legal advice.

""Finally, we would also expect the combined company to continue to pay Windstream's annual 60-cent-per-share dividend, which has a current yield of 8%, compared to EarthLink's annual 20-cent-per-share dividend, which has a current yield of about 3%.""Little Rock, Ark.-based Windstream in April spun off its network assets into a real estate investment trust called Communications Sales and Leasing, in which it retains a nearly 19% stake.""The (Windstream-EarthLink) merger would mark another step toward consolidation in the enterprise communications space in an effort to benefit from scale and synergies,"" said UBS analyst Batya Levi in a research report.Telecom takeovers have heated up.

27,CTL,"Shares in local phone company CenturyLink (CTL) and Level 3 Communications (LVLT) spiked on reports they're in advanced talks to merge.Broomfield, Colo.-based Level 3 operates one of the world's largest internet backbones. Level 3 in 2014 acquired TW Telecom, becoming a stronger rival to AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) in providing telecom services to businesses. A deal could come within weeks, the Wall Street Journal reported.CenturyLink morphed into the nation's third largest local phone company, behind Verizon and AT&T, by purchasing Qwest and Embarq. Centurylink's data center business has been up for sale. Verizon is reportedly close to selling off its data centers to Equinix (EQIX).Neither CenturyLink or Level 3 Communications owns a wireless phone network. Comcast (CMCSA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google has also been viewed as a possible buyer of Level 3 Communications.The deal may be structured as a merger of equals. Level 3 Communications has a market cap of around $18 billion, while CenturyLink's is over $17 billion.CenturyLink jumped 9.7% to close at 31.00 on the stock market today, hitting 33.45 intraday.

"
28,CTL,"AT&T (T) grabbed the headlines last month with its proposed $85 billion acquisition of media giant Time Warner (TWX), but the future of the telecom industry also is riding on what happens next among Verizon Communications (VZ), Comcast (CMCSA), satellite broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) and fast-growing wireless firm T-Mobile US (TMUS).How federal regulators would view proposed mergers among these companies figures heavily into the industry's future, analysts say, and talks figure to heat up early next year with the ending of a government spectrum auction that prohibits strategic talks among any bidders.Among the big questions is whether the status quo will be shaken up — cable TV firms dominate in providing high-speed internet services to homes while phone companies AT&T and Verizon generate the lion's share of wireless industry profits.IBD'S TAKE: AT&T stock has shed 16% since Oct. 1 amid speculation over rising interest rates and reaction to the Time Warner takeover bid. Look for news about other dividend paying stocks at The Income Investor.In one scenario, Verizon could deepen its partnership with Comcast, Charter Communications (CHTR) and other cable TV firms. In that case, Verizon and the cable TV firms would update a wireless network access and marketing deal born in 2011, says Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson.If that happens, Verizon could drop its much touted plans to unleash superfast 5G wireless services vs. cable firms in the residential broadband market. Verizon is testing 5G services and could roll out wireless broadband within two years, and it's considered to be ahead of rivals in 5G.""Verizon's entry into fixed wireless broadband is a clear threat to cable — and cable's entry into wireless is a clear threat to Verizon,"" Moffett told IBD. ""Each has a fair amount of leverage with the other.""If Verizon and the cable industry form an alliance, a Comcast acquisition of T-Mobile or Sprint (S) and a Verizon purchase of Dish Network — deals that have been subject of hot and cold rumors in recent years — would likely be off the table, analysts say.Another wild card in the industry's future is a government auction of radio spectrum owned by TV broadcasters. Begun in March, it's expected to end in early 2017. Companies that filed as bidders will once again be allowed to engage in strategic talks, as anti-collusion rules go away.If Comcast acquires substantial spectrum in the auction, that could be a precursor to buying a wireless firm such as T-Mobile around 2018, one theory goes. On the other hand, Comcast also might gain more spectrum to trade in a network-sharing deal with Verizon, so it wouldn't need T-Mobile.Dish Network has a big stake in the auction's outcome, analysts say. Depending on the results, Verizon could have more reason to acquire Dish Network and its nearly 80 MHz of wireless airwaves, says Citigroup analyst Michael Rollins.""As the 600MHz auction winds down, Dish may be a logical acquisition for Verizon,"" Rollins wrote in a research report. ""Dish helps Verizon close its spectrum gap vs. rivals.""Second, if Verizon deploys nationwide fixed wireless for in-home broadband (vs. cable), it will need a nationwide team of techs and trucks for installs. Dish has this. Third, Dish could help Verizon bundle video/mobile nationally at scale.""AT&T acquired satellite broadcaster DirecTV in 2015 to boost its mobile video strategy, he noted. If Verizon buys Dish Network, it could structure a stock and cash deal to ease concerns over its credit rating and tax worries for Dish founder Charles Ergen, Rollins says.Where do T-Mobile and Sprint fit into merger scenarios? T-Mobile has openly courted cable TV partners on its earnings calls. But amid intensified wireless competition, the most profit-margin-friendly deal remains a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile, many analysts say.Such a deal, though, would reduce the number of national wireless firms from four to three. The Obama administration blocked AT&T's proposed acquisition of T-Mobile in 2011, saying it wanted to retain a four-player national market.It's unlikely a new Democratic administration would be more friendly to a Sprint merger with T-Mobile, analysts say. Both companies are foreign-controlled. Japan's SoftBank owns 83% of Sprint, while Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) owns a two-thirds stake in T-Mobile.T-Mobile and Sprint, however, could have a better argument to present to regulators if their rivals continue to get bigger.AT&T and CenturyLink (CTL) didn't wait to find out how a Clinton-led or Trump-led Department of Justice would view telecom and media mergers.AT&T's agreement to acquire Time Warner, announced Oct. 22, bears similarities to Comcast's 2011 purchase of NBCUniversal from General Electric (GE), analysts say. Conditions that federal regulators set on the Comcast-NBCU deal might serve as a blueprint for the AT&T-Time Warner deal, though the Internet video market has evolved over the past five years, says Jefferies analyst Mike McCormack.Time Warner's assets include HBO and Turner Broadcasting, which has rights to sports telecasts. It also owns Warner Bros. film studio and cable networks TNT, TBS and CNN, as well as a 10% stake in internet video provider Hulu.CenturyLink (CTL), meanwhile, on Oct. 31 announced an agreement to buy Level 3 Communications (LVLT) for about $34 billion cash and stock. The combined company will be a stronger rival to AT&T and Verizon in the market for business services.Broomfield, Colo.-based Level 3 operates one of the world's largest internet backbones. CenturyLink morphed into the nation's No. 3 local phone company, behind Verizon and AT&T, by purchasing Qwest and Embarq. Neither CenturyLink or Level 3 owns a wireless network.AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner plays into its mobile video strategy, says UBS analyst John Hodulik.""It's a watershed event for the communications ecosystem,"" said Hodulik.Regulators are certain to look at whether AT&T aims to provide some of Time Warner's content exclusively to its customers. Netflix (NFLX) has stated it's fine with the deal as long as AT&T provides equally speedy internet access for its streaming video as its does for rival HBO.The AT&T and CenturyLink acquisitions announcements came amid slowing growth for each of them.AT&T's third-quarter revenue missed analysts' expectations, as it posted a net loss of 268,000 postpaid phone accounts amid intensified wireless competition.Buying Time Warner will boost AT&T's free cash flow to support its dividend payments, as did its 2015 purchase of satellite TV broadcaster DirecTV Group, says Hodulik. Level 3's cash flow, meanwhile, will support CenturyLink's dividends.The current low interest rates will help both AT&T and CenturyLink finance their acquisitions.""Cheap debt makes the numbers work,"" Hodulik said. ""For CenturyLink, keeping the dividend safe was the main concern along with establishing a path to growth.""RELATED:How Aggressive AT&T Has Out-Maneuvered Verizon, Comcast

Cloud computing — especially whisking data to mobile devices or PCs — has increased demand for data center space.Equinix customers include Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing business of Amazon.com (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT).Equinix stock fell 1.2% in the stock market today, to 349.03. Shares touched an all-time high of 391.07 on July 11. Verizon stock fell a fraction Wednesday, to 50.27.RELATED: How Amazon, Microsoft, Google Crushed Verizon, AT&T In The CloudVerizon's Armstrong On Yahoo Breach: Focus Is On 'Consumer Trust'

31,CTL,"In the pantheon of cloud computing, consider Amazon Web Services the Zeus-like leader, with Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and IBM (IBM) also ranking among the top service providers.Not found in the cloud hierarchy, however, are telecom companies AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and CenturyLink (CTL).While telecom leaders in other markets have surfaced as cloud-computing services leaders, that's not so in the U.S. -- not that AT&T, Verzon and CenturyLink didn't try.But they failed, and observers point to cloud vendors ramping up security faster than the telecoms expected, outspending the telecom firms in key areas and being quicker to help app developers.For telecom firms, their chances for cloud dominance are gone, as the kingpins scale up, says Dave Bartoletti, an analyst at Forrester Research.""At this point, it's over for anyone to break into a competitive, global, hyper-scale mega-cloud with the scale and feature-breadth of AWS, Microsoft, Google and IBM,"" Bartoletti said.AWS, part of e-commerce leader Amazon.com (AMZN), battle for supremacy along with Microsoft's Azure and Google in what's called infrastructure-as-a-service. IaaS is the fast-growing business of renting out computing resources -- number-crunching machines, data storage and software tools -- to companies and other enterprises.IBD'S TAKE: Make no mistake, despite its huge growth in e-commerce, Amazon's AWS cloud business has become another huge growth driver for the company, boosting its outlook and helping it take up residence among the select IBD Leaderboard companies. IBD scans all of our proprietary data to find stocks with the most potential for big gains, and only those companies make Leaderboard.There's room in the cloud assemblage for data center operators and co-location companies such as Equinix (EQIX). The Redwood City, Calif.-based company provides space, power lines, cooling and access to high-speed internet connections. Customers bring their own computer servers. Equinix runs data centers globally for corporate customers, including internet companies like Facebook (FB), as well as the IaaS players such as Amazon.In the data center part of the cloud field, too, telecom firms have come up short.Yet Japan's leading fixed-line telecom NTT (NTT) and Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) have made inroads in cloud services, says Camille Mendler, an analyst at U.K.-based research firm Ovum.""NTT has built and acquired vast global data center assets as part of a wider strategy to become a digital services provider,"" Mendler said. ""NTT is doing this not just in the developed economies of North America and Western Europe, but also in emerging markets.""U.S. telecom firms had their own aspirations. Verizon acquired cloud service firm Terremark in 2011 for $1.4 billion, while CenturyLink that same year acquired another cloud services/data center company, Savvis, for $2.5 billion. But both Verizon and CenturyLink have put their data center operations up for sale, and AT&T is said to be looking to sell its data centers as well.Verizon CFO Fran Shammo said last month that the telecom firm is close to decisions on its data centers. The Verizon data center assets that are widely considered to be the most desirable are in Miami and Culpeper, Va., near Washington, D.C. Observers say demand might be tepid, however, for much of the former Terremark assets.Analysts say Verizon's data centers might attract interest from private equity firms, but probably not from AWS, Microsoft or Google. The technologies and approaches don't mesh well.CenturyLink, meanwhile, is expected to announce a deal by year-end. And according to analysts, AT&T's 35 data centers also have been ""available"" at an asking price of around $2 billion. It's unclear if there's been any interest.The telecom firms might be unable to find a single buyer who wants all their data center assets and might instead be forced to sell them off separately, Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche said in a research report.Equinix has expressed an interest in some of these data center assets.Cloud services have a stormy history with telecom firms.AT&T acquired USinternetworking, a co-location provider, in 2006 for $300 million, but it missed a chance to take the next step and buy its way into the cloud when IBM gobbled up Softlayer for $2 billion in 2013. Instead of buying Softlayer, AT&T a year later settled for a consolation prize -- a marketing partnership with Softlayer.""IBM is a player in the public cloud market only because of their Softlayer acquisition,"" Bartoletti said. After buying Softlayer, IBM spent billions to build more data centers.Both Verizon's Terremark and CenturyLink's Savvis had sizable web hosting businesses when acquired. With the acquisitions, Verizon and CenturyLink aimed to be bigger players in the co-location business and the public cloud, where customers rent computing resources via the internet.Verizon in 2011 bought CloudSwitch, whose technology makes it easier for companies to run business applications in the public cloud. Verizon built up a cloud IaaS offering using technology from VMware (VMW). In February, though, Verizon shut down its public cloud services, crushed by AWS and Microsoft's Azure.Verizon and AT&T, analysts say, aimed to set themselves apart by packaging their cloud services with private internet networks, security, data storage and service guarantees. AT&T's Synaptic compute-as-a-service business combined virtual private networking and enterprise-class cloud services, rivaling that of AWS. AT&T also sells cloud data storage services, mainly to government agencies.Many corporations were at first leery of the public cloud because of security concerns, but more are now shifting even their most important workloads to the public cloud offerings from AWS and Microsoft's Azure. ""I think the telcos were caught by surprise as security in the public cloud dramatically improved,"" said Forrester's Bartoletti.As public cloud security worries ease, Verizon and AT&T have one less argument to make with potential customers, analysts say.""The market changed,"" said Lydia Leong, an analyst at tech research firm Gartner. AT&T, Verizon and CenturyLink haven't provided tools to help software developers create new apps and services in the cloud, she says.""It's not an asset game. You need capital to compete, but it's not just about data centers,"" Leong said. ""Verizon tried to build the next-generation cloud with CloudSwitch, but that project failed.""AT&T and Verizon aren't the only ones to struggle vs. Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Shares of Rackspace Hosting (RAX) have plunged. Rackspace put itself on the market in 2014 before pulling itself off the market. But early Friday, Rackspace announced an agreement to be acquired by private equity firm Apollo Global Management (APO) for $32 a share, or $4.3 billion, and the company will go private. Rather than compete in IaaS, Rackspace has shifted to providing support services for AWS and other cloud computing providers.The telecom firms may have underinvested to compete with the likes of Amazon and Google, whose capital spending on warehouse-sized data centers has soared. Amazon, Microsoft and Google are among the few firms that are bigger -- their market caps are $100 billion or more larger -- than even telecom leaders AT&T and Verizon.If that's the case, then it's not a mistake for Verizon to want to repeat in digital media and advertising. After acquiring AOL in 2015 for $4.4 billion, Verizon has doubled-down by agreeing to purchase Yahoo (YHOO) for $4.8 billion. Verizon has made other digital media acquisitions as well.Gartner's Leong says it's not only the millions of computer servers packed into data centers that sets Amazon apart.""The IaaS market rewards intellectual property and the ability to leverage software developers,"" she said. ""Carriers are capital assets companies, they're not IP companies. Amazon has invested enormously in software, automation and engineering.""Amazon stock finished Monday trading up 0.3% to 771.29 on the stock market today. Alphabet gained 0.3% to 795.82 while Microsoft edged up 7 cents to 58.10. Verizon added 0.8% to 52.50 as AT&T climbed 0.8% to 41.RELATED:How Amazon, Microsoft Can Unlock Small-Business Market For SaaSRackspace Accepts $4.3 Billion Buyout From Apollo Global

32,CTL,"When AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ), Comcast (CMCSA) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) report earnings, there's a good reason why analysts that follow Dycom Industries (DY) sit up and take notice.Dycom, an installer of fiber-optic wiring, has prospered as phone and cable TV companies hurry to deploy super-fast, one gigabit-per-second internet services to homes. Dycom digs small trenches where fiber-optic wiring is buried, breaks up and repairs sidewalks if needed, or strings the fiber wiring aerially to homes and business via utility poles.AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and Google, as well as CenturyLink (CTL), are Dycom's biggest customers. Any updates on the capital spending plans of phone and cable TV firms are key for Dycom. If new projects are signaled on earnings calls, Dycom and rivals rev up to bid on contracts in local markets.Web video is driving the need for faster internet speeds now, with virtual reality expected to push broadband speeds higher. There's plenty of talk about faster, fifth-generation wireless networks, but fiber optic broadband speeds are forecast to evolve from 1 gigabit -- or 1 billion bits of information -- per second to 10 gigabits per second.""As much as everyone thinks about wireless usage, people are realizing the need for fatter pipes in the ground, and the foundation of that plumbing is fiber,"" said Jennifer Fritzsche, analyst at Wells Fargo.Dycom's stock has climbed more than 20% in 2016, with surging revenue from telecom customers driving earnings growth.Internet companies like Google rely on fast broadband connections. Aiming to pressure telecom firms into upgrading broadband networks to higher speeds, Google has ramped up its own superfast fiber-optic services to homes and businesses.Dycom management has never named Alphabet as a customer. Analysts contend, though, that Alphabet is Dycom's ""unnamed"" customer in earnings releases and accounted for 7% of fiscal-third-quarter revenue.Where Google is heading with its broadband strategy has been a worry for Dycom shareholders. On Alphabet's second-quarter earnings call in July, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said it may use innovative wireless technologies to speed up its roll-out of gigabit internet services. In early August, Alphabet said it would put on hold plans to expand Google Fiber to new markets.Right now, Google Fiber is available only in San Antonio; Austin, Texas; Provo, Utah; Kansas City, Mo., and neighboring Kansas City, Kan.  Alphabet plans to test wireless broadband in up to 24 markets over the next 18 months.Dycom stock fell last week on the news over Google's building ""pause"". But, some analysts say there's still plenty growth coming from AT&T, Verizon, CenturyLink and Comcast. And, Fritzsche says Google will need to deploy some fiber-optic plant in neighborhoods, even if wireless links reach homes directly.IBD'S TAKE: Dycom gapped out of a cup-with-handle base after reporting earnings in late May, jumping into IBD's Leaderboard for a while.  Shares fell below its 50-day moving average last week amid speculation over Google's plans. Dycom is No. 2 on  IBD's Telecom-Infrastructure group with a 96 Composite Rating, just behind Ubiquiti Networks.AT&T has touted plans to expand its GigaPower broadband service to some 12.5 million homes and businesses by the end of 2019. In January, AT&T signaled it may target 14 million homes or more, up from its current 2.2 million.More than 26% of Dycom's first-quarter revenue came from AT&T alone. In the first quarter, AT&T revenue rose 70% to $178 million.To hit or exceed its 2019 goals for GigaPower, AT&T needs to step on the accelerator, says Adam Thalhimer, analyst at BB&T Capital Markets. AT&T plans to expand GigaPower from 20 markets to 56 markets across the country.""If you look at the math, it's suggesting some very intense construction years in 2017 and 2018, and Dycom should benefit,"" Thalhimer said.Then there's Verizon. On its first-quarter call in April, Verizon touted plans to expand its FiOS services to Boston and, perhaps, other East Coast cities. The FiOS network now reaches 18 million homes and buildings, but Verizon had stopped expanding that service in 2010.And don't forget Comcast, which was Dycom's second-biggest customer in its fiscal third quarter. Aside from its consumer-focused gigabit push, Comcast has been expanding its high-speed internet network to small and medium-sized businesses. Dycom's second-quarter revenue from Comcast rose 47% to $96 million.Charter Communications (CHTR) is another customer ramping up business services. Cable TV firms in general are pushing optical fiber deeper into networks, replacing the old ""coaxial"" lines.Analysts say there's also upside for Dycom from the Connect America Fund program -- federal government funding aimed at bringing speedier broadband services to rural areas. On Dycom's first-quarter earnings call, Nielsen described it as a $150 million to $200 million annual opportunity through 2020. Phone companies that get Connect America funding include AT&T, Frontier Communications (FTR), CenturyLink and Windstream (WIN).One issue for investors, though, is whether the potential upside from companies deploying super-fast internet services is already built into Dycom's stock. Short interest in Dycom stock is high.On Dycom's fiscal third-quarter earnings call, Chief Executive Steven Nielsen said Dycom's revenue from the gigabit gold mine hasn't peaked.""We're in the early stages,"" he said, referring to a new upgrade cycle in wireline networks. Nielsen wasn't available for an interview.Analysts look at Dycom's backlog to sift out data on new contracts. Dycom ended its fiscal third quarter with a total backlog of $5.65 billion, up 97% from a year earlier, and a 12-month backlog of $2.2 billion, up 37%.""Backlog has been inflecting very positively over the past couple of quarters, the trend is good,"" said Bobby Burleson, analyst  at Canaccord Genuity. ""Backlog is projects that have been bid and won. Eventually they come off backlog as projects go live. It might take three years to complete. It's a forward indicator of revenue.""Another issue for investors is whether Dycom's EBITDA -- earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- will shrink as the company adds labor and equipment for new projects. Working capital costs rise as it wins new business. With 12,500 employees, Dycom could add thousands more over the next three to four years, some analysts say.""What we've said, and what we've executed against, is that we think a mid-teens EBITDA business is attainable,"" CEO Nielsen said on Dycom's first-quarter call.Based in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., Dycom is slated to report fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings in late August. Dycom's profit should jump 60% to $1.55 per share, with revenue growing 33% to $771 million, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Phone companies account for nearly two-thirds of Dycom's revenue, and cable TV firms makes up about one-fourth. Dycom also performs construction, engineering and maintenance services for electric and gas utilities and other customers.Dycom competes with Mastec (MTZ), Emcor Group (EME) and many small, local specialty contractors. But Dycom is a more specialized contractor than bigger Mastec.""Dycom sticks to what they know best, which is telecom networks,"" BB&T's Thalhimer said.

33,CTL,"Comcast's (CMCSA) broadband prowess makes it a top pick of Morgan Stanley, which also raised its price targets on AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ).AT&T and Verizon stocks have jumped in 2016 amid growing investor demand for high-dividend-paying stocks as global interest rates fall.Morgan Stanley recently lowered its estimate for the 10-year Treasury rate to 1.25% by year-end 2016 and 1.10% by Q2, 2017. On Monday, Morgan Stanley hiked its PT on AT&T to 45 from 35 and on Verizon to 59 from 50, but noted that Comcast has an edge over telecommunication giants.""Comcast remains a top pick,"" Simon Flannery, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a report. ""On broadband, Comcast has taken around 45% to 50% of industry net adds since 2014, and we expect share gains to continue given its current and expected future speed advantage over telco competitors.""AT&T stock edged down 4 cents to 42.85 on the stock market today, while Verizon inched up 0.2% to 55.93 at the close.. Comcast stock, which recently hit an all-time high, ticked 2 cents higher to 66.86.IBD's TAKE: Shares in real estate investment trusts (REITs) have also done well in the low-rate environment. Check out the IBD 50 for REIT stocks.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley cut its rating on CenturyLink (CTL) to underweight from hold and on Frontier Communications (FTR) to equal-weight from buy, partly owing to their geographic overlap with cable TV firms Comcast and Charter Communications (CHTR).Flannery says CenturyLink and Frontier may need to increase capital spending to be more competitive.Flannery upped his Windstream (WIN) PT to 9 from 7. He increased Cincinnati Bell's (CBB) PT to 5 from 3.70.

34,CTL,"Cable TV companies will continue to dominate the consumer broadband market -- a trend which AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) can buck with wireless services, but which leaves smaller CenturyLink (CTL) and Frontier Communications (FTR) vulnerable, says Macquarie Securities.Amy Yong, a Macquarie analyst, initiated coverage Monday on CenturyLink with a neutral rating. Yong started Frontier, which earlier this year acquired residential landline assets in three states from Verizon, with an underperform rating.Shares of Comcast (CMCSA), the biggest cable TV firm, hit an all-time high of 67.69 early Monday, closing up 0.4% to 67.41 in the stock market today.Both CenturyLink and Frontier will be pressured as Comcast and Charter Communications (CHTR) continue to boost broadband speeds, says Macquarie's Yong.""By the end of the decade, we estimate 65% of broadband share will be in the hands of cable, up from 59% currently,"" Yong said in a research report. ""CenturyLink and Frontier are the most susceptible to cable competition, convergence of wireline/wireless, and the potential threat of wireless substitution.""IBD's Telecom Services-Integrated group ranks No. 31 out of 197 industry groups. AT&T leads with an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of a possible 99, while Verizon sports a CR of 94.Shares of AT&T and Verizon have jumped amid growing investor demand for high-dividend-paying stocks as global interest rates sag.CenturyLink stock also has gained this year, up 20%, but Frontier stock is near even. CenturyLink rose 0.4% on Monday, but Frontier stock was down 1%.CenturyLink, like Verizon, is mulling a sale of its data centers amid fierce competition with Amazon Web Services, part of e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN).""(CenturyLink's) dividend support is solid but unlikely to grow, pending strategic review of data centers,"" added Yong.

35,CTL,"Verizon Communications (VZ) stock was flat and shares of AT&T (T) were down just a fraction Friday amid the broad Brexit global market sell-off, as investors looked for safety in U.S. telecommunications firms.Britain's vote to exit the European Union, however, slammed U.K.-based telecom giant Vodafone (VOD) and German telecom giant Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY). U.S. shares of Japan's Nippon Telegraph & Telephone (NTT) lost 0.7% in the stock market today. NTT is viewed as a safe-haven, defensive stock similar to high-dividend-paying AT&T and Verizon.Both AT&T and Verizon are expected to notch healthy free-cash-flow growth through 2020, as IBD has reported. AT&T stock is up 21% in 2016, while Verizon has gained 18%. AT&T slid 0.9% Friday while Verizon lost 0.4%.The Standard & Poor's utility and telecom sectors held up Friday, with the utility sector slightly higher. The S&P's other sectors were mostly hard hit, including the technology sector.Deutsche Telekom's U.S. stock tumbled 8.3% on Friday, hitting a 17-month low. Vodafone's U.S. stock was down 7.1%.Jefferies, in a research report, said European regulators could take a hard look at any merger between Vodafone and John Malone's Liberty Global (LBTYA) in the wake of the Brexit vote. Liberty Mobile fell 13.1%.T-Mobile US (TMUS) stock was down 5.9% Friday. Nomura downgraded T-Mobile to neutral on views that its subscriber growth will cool off.Buckingham Research, meanwhile, downgraded AT&T to neutral.Shares of CenturyLink (CTL), another dividend telecom stock, were down 2.1% Friday.
"
36,CTL,"The Federal Communications Commission moved ahead on Thursday with a proposal to regulate prices in the $20 billion market for business data services, drawing criticism from AT&T (T) and cable TV rivals.The FCC rules would regulate new entrants in the market -- cable TV firms such as Comcast (CMCSA), Charter Communications (CHTR) and Time Warner Cable (TWC) -- as well as the biggest providers of  business data services, including AT&T, Verizon Communications (VZ) and local phone companies CenturyLink (CTL) and Frontier Communications (FTR).""The FCC is likely doing this as long-term insurance in case cable does eventually become dominant in any business markets,"" said Paul Gallant, analyst at Guggenheim Partners, in a report.The high-speed connections are used for retail outlets, ATM machines and cell towers. Smaller telecom firms such as Level 3 Communications (LVLT) and Cogent Communications (CCOI) sometimes rent the ""special access"" lines to serve their customers. Some of these have complained over long-term contracts and termination fees.AT&T has lobbied against the new price regulation, while Verizon has been less opposed. Verizon plans to deploy 5G wireless services and may gain from lower prices for cell tower connections, analysts say.“Never before has the FCC sought to saddle new entrants with such heavy-handed pricing mandates -- in any arena, let alone the broadband marketplace, (FCC) Chairman (Tom) Wheeler promised to shield from such regulation,” David Cohen, a Comcast executive VP, said in a blog.Wheeler’s FCC last year approved new “net neutrality” rules opposed by the cable TV industry. Cable TV firms have been been squabbling with the agency over broadband privacy issues, as well as the agency’s plans to open up the set-top box market to more competition.The new rules for business data services could be approved by the end of 2016.“Cable’s entry into the market for business data services over the last few years has resulted in improved services and lower prices for businesses all across America,” said the National Cable & Telecommunications Association in a statement. “It is disappointing that Chairman Wheeler is responding to this unquestionably positive development by asking the commission to consider imposing onerous new rate regulation on these competitive services.”

37,CTL,"With Verizon Communications (VZ) stock up nearly 17% and AT&T (T) soaring over 14%, the S&P telecommunications services sector is poised to lead the S&P 500’s 10 sectors in Q1 performance.As of afternoon trading in the stock market today, the S&P telecom services sector ranked tops, with utilities the only other sector posting a double-digit gain, for the first three months of 2016.“Absent some blow-away window dressing late in the session, that’s the way"" the quarter will end up, S&P analyst Howard Silverblatt told IBD.The S&P telecom services sector is up over 15% in Q1.High dividend-paying Verizon and AT&T are among the best-performing stocks in the S&P 100 this year.Smaller phone companies also have outperformed, with CenturyLink (CTL) jumping 26%, Frontier Communications (FTR) up 20% and Windstream Holdings (WIN) gaining nearly 17%.Among wireless-only service providers, shares of  T-Mobile US (TMUS) are down about 2% and Sprint (S) stock is near down 4.5%. Neither T-Mobile nor debt-laden Sprint pay dividends.Though they’re not in the S&P telecom services group, cable TV companies also posted solid returns in Q1. Shares of Charter Communications (CHTR)  and Time Warner Cable (TWC), which plan to merge, are both up 10% in Q1. Analysts expect the Charter-TWC deal to close in May.Comcast (CMCSA) stock is up 8% this year, and shares of Cablevision Systems (CVC) have edged up over 3%.The Q1 laggards have been the financial, health care and consumer discretionary sectors.Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, says Verizon and AT&T have benefited from global interest rates falling and “risk appetites withering.”“Whether the telco rally has legs will depend on fundamentals and growth and perhaps a change in industry structure,” Moffett said in a research report.Federal regulators, though, have been opposed to wireless consolidation, such as a Sprint and T-Mobile merger.AT&T has also been boosted by its purchase of satellite TV broadcaster DirecTV Group, analysts say.At Barclays, analyst Amir Rozwadowski in a report said that while the “flight to safety trade” isn’t showing signs of dispersing, investors may look at fundamentals more, going forward.IBD’s Telecom Services-Integrated group ranks No. 39 out of 197 industry sectors.

38,CTL,"GTT Communications (GTT) is getting a lift as large companies use its Internet and ethernet networking connections for cloud-based services, say analysts.GTT, which has made two acquisitions since September, on Thursday reported Q4 revenue and adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) that topped views. December-quarter revenue rose 83% to $114.8 million vs. analysts' consensus estimate of $114.4 million.“We believe organic revenue growth could accelerate as cloud adoption, increasing bandwidth usage and salesforce hiring continues,” said Michael Bowen, a Pacific Crest Securities analyst in a report.In the U.S., McLean, Va.-based GTT competes with Level 3 Communications (LVLT), CenturyLink (CTL), and Verizon Communications (VZ). GTT garners nearly 40% of revenue overseas, where it competes with KPN, Colt Technology, Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) and Orange (ORAN) business services.“GTT’s goal is to provide connectivity for customers to any location in the world with any application in the cloud,” said Jonathan Charbonneau, a Cowen & Co. analyst, in a report.GTT’s stock was up 2% on the stock market today, after popping 12.5% on Thursday. Shares are about even in 2016, but they are down from a high of 25.7 in mid-September. GTT has an IBD Composite Rating of 60. It’s in IBD’s Internet Network-Solutions group, where Gigamon (GIMO) is tops with a CR of 93. IBD's Internet Network-Solutions group is ranked No. 107 out of 197 industry groups.“GTT continues to be a beneficiary of the shift to cloud services, and the need for managed network services from multinational enterprises,” said Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan in a report.GTT agreed to buy Telnes Broadband for $18 million in February.

39,CTL,"When an ETF invests in the S&P 500 while offering less risk and a big yield, what’s not to love?PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility (SPHD) filters the iconic index for 75 companies with the highest dividend yields, then extracts 50 of those that are least volatile.SPHD was up 5.99% this year through March 2 vs. a 2.39% loss for SPY. It has also outperformed SPY, the largest and oldest U.S. exchange traded fund, over the past three years. On Thursday, it briefly hit an all-time high of 35.42.Launched in 2012, SPHD combines two popular and important defensive factors, notes Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P Global Market Intelligence.""In general, for investors who want to stay in the equity market but take on less-than-normal risk, dividend and low volatility products are compelling,"" Rosenbluth said.This investing strategy's distillation of the S&P 500 index is resonating with investors.SPHD's assets have swelled more than 200% to $836.8 million since the end of 2015. Investors poured in $172.1 million of fresh money in the first two months of this year.What they're getting are top-notch stocks such as AT&T (T), a member of the elite IBD Leaderboard. Stocks on this hand-picked list offer superior fundamentals and technicals, which enhance their potential for explosive gains.AT&T is a top 10 holding in the SPHD stock portfolio. The telecom giant, a defensive play, is holding up well even as the broad market starts to gain some steam.The company reported strong earnings Jan. 26 and the stock has since soared. It hit a 52-week high of 38.11 on the stock market today.SPHD yields 3.48% vs. 2.17% for SPY. Its dividend factor recognizes companies for their dividend yield -- AT&T's is 5% -- and not the longevity of dividend payments, Rosenbluth notes.That tasty income is a big lure for investors at a time when capital appreciation is hard to find.The defensive tilt to SPHD gives investors more exposure to some of this year's top-performing sectors. Utilities have the top weighting, at 18% of assets. By comparison, the S&P 500 benchmark has 3% in utilities.The ETF also overweights the real estate sector, which has been showing momentum.SPHD makes large sector bets, but they tend to be in lower-risk sectors such as utilities and consumer staples, said Rosenbluth.""The risk is more toward underperforming when the broader market moves higher,"" he added. Low volatility ETFs protect on the downside, but tend to rise less in a rising market too.Rosenbluth suggested investors could consider combining an ETF such as SPHD with peers such as SPY or Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO) ""to overweight their exposure to lower risk stocks.""The top three stock holdings in SPHD include CenturyLink (CTL), Iron Mountain (IRM) and Spectra Energy (SE).CenturyLink ranks No. 5 in IBD's integrated telecom services industry group. It boasts a strong Composite Rating of 88 and has two straight quarters of accelerating earnings growth.Iron Mountain, which helps companies manage records and protect data, ranks No. 2 in its industry group. It has a dull 68 Comp Rating, but sports two quarters of improving profits.Spectra Energy, an oil-and-gas pipeline company, lags in its industry group and has a poor 48 Comp Rating. But it has eight quarters of increasing fund ownership.SPHD rebalances and reconstitutes twice a year, in January and July.It provides income investors a steady source of income, by paying out dividends monthly.The ETF has a 0.30% expense ratio. For SPY, it's 0.09%.

40,CTL,"The “stand-alone trajectory” of T-Mobile US (TMUS)  “looks very bright” while long-term prospects for a deal with Dish Network (DISH), Sprint, or a cable TV firm are still alive, says Deutsche Bank, which initiated coverage with a buy rating.Matthew Niknam, a Deutsche Bank analyst, also started coverage on AT&T (T), rural phone company Frontier Communications (FTR) and cell tower companies American Tower (AMT) and Crown Castle (CCI) with buy ratings.He initiated Verizon Communications (VZ), Sprint (S), CenturyLink (CTL), Windstream, and SBA Communications (SBAC) with hold ratings. T-Mobile, with its Uncarrier-branded marketing strategy, has gained market share vs. bigger rivals.Controlled by Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile has “strategic appeal to potential industry partners,” wrote Niknam.“With video increasingly going mobile, and reports that Comcast (CMCSA) has recently triggered its (wholesale) agreement with Verizon, we believe cable companies may increasingly view mobile network ownership as a longer-term strategic option.”While Comcast has plenty financial muscle to pull off an acquisition, Dish Networks’ stock has dropped while Sprint holds more than $32 billion in debt.AT&T’s acquisition of satellite TV broadcaster DirecTV, meanwhile, has bolstered its competitive position, says Niknam.“We believe AT&T is best positioned strategically, given AT&T’s presence across each of the key distribution platforms (mobile, video, wired broadband/phone), and its leadership position (#1 or #2 share) across each market,” he said.Frontier stock was up about 4.5% in afternoon trading on the stock market today. Sprint and CenturyLink were up more than 2%, and SBA more than 3%.

41,CTL,"The FCC’s Broadband Progress Report is drawing fire from the telecom industry just days after cable TV companies led by Comcast (CMCSA) criticized the agency’s proposal for set-top boxes.The Federal Communications Commission approved the broadband report -- which said that 10% of Americans and 39% of rural Americans do not have sufficient high-speed Internet services -- along party lines, with its three Democrats in favor and two Republicans against.The FCC in January 2015 raised the definition of high-speed Internet service to 25 megabits per second, up from the prior 4 Mbps. The reset of broadband to 25 Mbps increased the market share of cable TV firms. That's because phone companies still provide Internet access via slower DSL copper lines in rural areas.USTelecom, a phone industry lobbying group representing AT&T (T),  Verizon Communications (VZ), and many small phone companies, says that the FCC’s broadband report is flawed.“It is unfortunate that the FCC’s annual broadband report seems to have become a cynical, fact-starved exercise with a conclusion that is contrived to justify a continuing expansion of regulatory authority,” said USTelecom in a press release.CenturyLink (CTL), in a statement, said: “The commission's latest broadband progress report ignores the billions of dollars we invest annually to provide high-speed Internet service, under whatever definition the FCC uses, that our customers want and need.”In a letter to the FCC this month, six Republican Senators argued that the broadband definition should be lowered because consumers can watch Web video from Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon.com (AMZN) at speeds of around 5 Mbps.The FCC on Wednesday announced a new initiative aimed at making it easier for consumers to switch from set-top boxes rented from cable TV companies to app-driven devices sold by consumer electronics or Internet companies.Comcast, in a blog post on Thursday, said that if the FCC set-top box proposal is approved, “consumer costs would rise, content security would weaken, and consumer protections such as privacy would erode. It would undermine intellectual property rights and content licensing agreements.”

Verizon (VZ) increased its dividend 2.7% in September, but has forecast flat 2016 earnings.Besides Verizon and AT&T, Horan's top telecom stock picks include Cogent Communications (CCOI).He ranks cash-short Sprint (S), CenturyLink (CTL), Level 3 Communications (LVLT) and smaller Internap (INAP) and RigNet (RNET) at the bottom.Debt-laden Sprint, controlled by Japan's debt-laden SoftBank, plans job cuts, according to reports.Junk-rated bonds have been yielding 6%, but Sprint's bonds are trading at 11%, Horan wrote.Horan said: ""High-yield rates broke 8% this week. ...

Morgan Stanley surveyed 2,500 U.S. households during August and September on broadband and TV services.""U-verse and AT&T DSL had especially weak satisfaction results, and satellite pay-TV subscribers' broadband satisfaction fell materially year over year,"" said the Morgan Stanley report.

AMN Healthcare Services (AHS) and Dycom Industries (DY) are two such issues.Both top- and bottom-line growth are accelerating for San Diego-based AMN, which provides health-care industry staffing as well as workforce products and services. The firm's earnings growth picked up from 0% to 35% to 67% and to 81% in the latest quarter.Sales, which dipped in the first and second quarters of 2014, have since grown 3%, 12%, 36% and 40%.Factors such as the health care law, an improving economy and more people turning 65 are driving AMN's growth. Buyouts are also helping the pickup in business. AMN announced four acquisitions in December.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see more acceleration for its current-quarter earnings. Profit is slated to grow 89% to 34 cents a share.Based in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., Dycom Industries provides specialty contracting services to telecom providers and utilities. In recent quarters, top-line growth has gone from 0% to 13% to 16% and to 20% for its fiscal Q4, which ended July 25. It has now posted three straight periods of double-digit gains after some lackluster quarters last year.In the latest quarter, the company saw strong demand from telecom giants such as AT&T; (T), CenturyLink (CTL), Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon Communications (VZ). Business from the four accounted for 56% of the $578.5 million in total revenue in the latest quarter.While organic growth has been strong, the company is also benefiting from acquisitions. Contributions from buyouts, however, have been small. In the latest period, $11.8 million came from acquired businesses.

96,CTL,"Follow Donna Howell on Twitter @IBD_DHowell.Back to normal?Last week's wild stock market trading provoked stock brokerage site outages while computer glitches in systems tied to the market compounded the financial world's woes. Getting the technical matters resolved is continuing into this week, and sorting out the ramifications to investors could take even longer.Reports circulated of customer difficulties with aspects of using the TD Ameritrade (AMTD), Charles Schwab (SCHW), Vanguard, Fidelity and Scottrade websites at various times last week after U.S. stock markets rocked following a stocks meltdown in China.While retail brokerage operators appeared back to business as usual this week, it has taken longer to fix a computer problem that disrupted pricing of U.S. mutual funds and exchange traded funds, affecting how billions of dollars in asset values are calculated.ETFs And Mutual FundsToday the custody bank, Bank of New York Mellon (BK), put out a fund accounting issue update indicating that it's back to a normal operating schedule now: ""BNY Mellon has completed production of system-generated net asset values (NAVs) for all exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds through Monday, August 31, 2015.""Getting things resolved ""has taken far longer than any of us would have expected,"" BNY Mellon CEO Gerald Hassell said on a Sunday-night conference call.An operating system change with financial technology firm SunGard's widely used InvestOne platform went awry on Aug. 22, resulting in a corrupted computing environment; ditto the backup environment.""This prevented failover (to a workable computing environment) and extended any potential recovery time,"" Hassell said, noting that about 1,200 fund structures were affected. ""We do not yet know the root cause.""SunGard said that the technical problem was unrelated to ""the recent turmoil in the equity markets.""Investor Fallout?The magnitude of the impact on investors is still murky, the Wall Street Journal noted in a Sunday report. The Journal had previously indicated that the affected funds ranged from U.S. money-market mutual funds run by Goldman Sachs Group (GS) to exchange-traded funds offered by Guggenheim Partners and mutual funds sold by Federated Investors (FII).On Aug. 24, the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight (RSP) ETF saw extreme price swings — from a low of 43 to a high of 75, as IBD reported. Guggenheim was among the fund companies that applied workarounds to the pricing problems during the week.Beyond those issues, a problem with a cooling system at a CenturyLink (CTL) New Jersey data center affected some financial trading industry clients last week.

145,CTL,"The Federal Communications Commission could raise the U.S. broadband standard as soon as January, a move that's aimed at increasing network investments but that also might have implications for Comcast's proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable.
"
146,CTL,"Internet service providers oppose increasing the broadband standard from the current 4 megabits per second (mbps) to 10 or higher.
"
147,CTL,"For one thing, most ISPs would need to step up investments to reach that speed, mainly DSL upgrades in rural areas. ISPs want to decide what ""broadband"" is, not have regulators impose it on them.
"
148,CTL,"And while an increase to 10 mbps appears most likely, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler hinted at raising the bar much higher in an Oct. 1 speech when he said, ""Table stakes for the 21st century is 25 mbps.""
"
149,CTL,"Wheeler says that U.S. households need faster Internet connections for high-definition video streaming and emerging apps. He adds that faster broadband would boost education, health care and the economy.
"
150,CTL,"AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and the National Cable and Telecommunications Association in September asked the FCC to keep the standard at 4 mbps.
"
151,CTL,"The Comcast (CMCSA)-Time Warner Cable (TWC) merger is another element of the issue. Opponents of the merger have cited Comcast's broadband market share as a reason why regulators should block the deal or impose tough conditions. Comcast says that the combined company would have 35% of U.S. broadband subscribers.
"
152,CTL,"If the broadband threshold is increased to 10 mbps from 4, then Comcast's broadband market share would rise. Many slower DSL phone lines in rural areas, owned by telecom ISPs, would not reach 10 mbps. And even bigger market share for the combined Comcast-TWC, in theory, lowers the chances that regulators will approve the merger without stringent conditions — if they approve at all.
"
153,CTL,"The merger of the Nos. 1 and 2 cable TV firms, though, isn't the target of the FCC's move to refine broadband, Guggenheim Partners analyst Paul Gallant told IBD via email.
"
154,CTL,"""It's something they've said for a while they want to do,"" he said. ""But nonetheless, it would have the effect of making Comcast look more dominant in broadband, which in turn strengthens the FCC's leverage over the companies for more extensive conditions.""
"
155,CTL,"Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, agrees.
"
156,CTL,"""Comcast would be viewed as having materially higher market share if broadband were to be defined as 10 mbps or 25 mbps (rather) than under today's definition,"" Moffett said in a research report. ""This would bolster the FCC's and Department of Justice's 'moral authority' to impose more significant conditions on the transaction or perhaps even to block the deal outright.""
"
157,CTL,"Jeff Wlodarczak, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, speculates that the FCC could require Comcast to provide minimum guaranteed download speeds of 60 mbps to 100 mbps within five years as a condition of the TWC deal.
"
158,CTL,"On Oct. 22, the FCC paused its review of the Comcast-TWC merger as well as AT&T's proposed acquisition of DirecTV Group (DTV). The FCC said that it will decide how to handle highly confidential documents related to agreements with media companies.
"
159,CTL,"Comcast expects approval of the TWC acquisition in early 2015, but some analysts say that the review could stretch until Q2.
"
160,CTL,"The timing is important because if the FCC adopts a new broadband definition in January, it still might be able to apply the new threshhold to the Comcast-TWC review.
"
161,CTL,"""Wheeler has laid the groundwork for aggressive action against Comcast/TWC, portraying the key broadband market as speeds of 25 mbps or more,"" research firm The Capital Forum said in a report. ""This view aligns with those of merger opponents, not Comcast.""
"
162,CTL,"Conditions imposed on Comcast-TWC could involve net neutrality.
"
163,CTL,"David Cohen, Comcast executive vice president and chief lobbyist, told IBD that the FCC's broadband speed standard has no relevance to the Time Warner Cable deal.
"
164,CTL,"""It is not analytically connected to our transaction,"" Cohen said. ""The definition of broadband is all about the government's aspirational goals. In a transaction review, the government looks at relevant markets. There has never been a relevant market analysis within the antitrust, FCC or DOJ purview that relied on a definition of broadband speeds.""
"
165,CTL,"Nor does Comcast believe that its broadband market share should be looked at nationally. The service areas of Comcast and TWC do not overlap.
"
166,CTL,"""Relevant markets are defined by consumer choice and consumer options,"" Cohen said. ""Broadband is sold in local and regional markets. It's not sold on a national basis.""
"
167,CTL,"In 2010, the FCC raised the definition of broadband to 4 mbps from 200 kilobits per second. The FCC in June proposed to redefine broadband to 10 mbps or higher for purposes of its Connect America Fund (CAF) broadband build-out initiative, which provides subsidies to rural phone companies.
"
168,CTL,"Wheeler has aimed to promote ""municipal broadband,"" a term for local governments partnering with the likes of Google (GOOGL) or others, in order to build high-speed networks. Gallant says that Wheeler hopes Google or others offering superfast Internet services will pressure cable TV companies broadly, not only in top U.S. markets.
"
169,CTL,"Speaking at the National Association of Telecommunications Officers and Advisors annual conference on Oct. 1, Wheeler said: ""We need faster networks in more places ... . Unfortunately, today there is an inverse relationship between competition and throughput. Three-quarters of American homes have no competitive choice at 25 mbps. That includes almost 20% who have no option at all at those speeds.""
"
170,CTL,"Comcast's Cohen says that the TWC merger would not reduce competition.
"
171,CTL,"""Chairman Wheeler notes accurately that as you move up the speed ladder, there is less and less competition. There's no way to dispute that,"" Cohen said. ""The next question is whether there is anything in our transaction that reduces the level of competition in a relevant market at any speed level, and the answer is there's nothing.""
"
172,CTL,"Consumer group Public Knowledge and video streamer Netflix (NFLX) in filings have asked the FCC to increase the broadband threshhold to 25 mbps. Dish Network (DISH) opposes the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal, saying that the combined firm would have 50% of residential broadband connections if the 25 mbps standard is used.
"
173,CTL,"Telecom companies such as CenturyLink (CTL) and AT&T, meanwhile, could be impacted if the FCC adopts at least a 10 Mbps standard.
"
174,CTL,"""This adds more pressure to AT&T to upgrade their DSL network broadband speeds,"" said Amy Yong, analyst at Macquarie Capital.
"
175,CTL,"AT&T had 14.84 million consumer broadband connections as of Sept. 30, including 12 million customers on its U-Verse high-speed Internet network. The others are either DSL residential lines or satellite broadband customers.
"
176,CTL,"In a regulatory filing, AT&T said: ""Given the pace at which the industry is investing in advanced capabilities, there is no present need to redefine advanced capabilities. Consumer behavior strongly reinforces the conclusion that a 10 mbps service exceeds what many Americans need today to enable basic, high-quality transmissions.""
"
177,CTL,"AT&T has stepped up broadband investments. AT&T said in September that it has completed rolling out its 1 gbps ""GigaPower"" service to parts of the Austin, Texas, area. AT&T GigaPower is also available in parts of Dallas and Fort Worth.
"
178,CTL,"AT&T plans to also launch the high-speed service in eight North Carolina cities, including Greensboro, plus Cupertino, Calif.; Houston; Jacksonville, Fla.; Miami; Nashville; St. Louis; and San Antonio.

Opponents of the merger have cited Comcast's broadband market share as a reason why regulators should block the deal or impose tough conditions. Comcast says that the combined company would have 35% of U.S. broadband subscribers.If the broadband threshold is increased to 10 mbps from 4, then Comcast's broadband market share would rise. Many slower DSL phone lines in rural areas, owned by telecom ISPs, would not reach 10 mbps. And even bigger market share for the combined Comcast-TWC, in theory, lowers the chances that regulators will approve the merger without stringent conditions — if they approve at all.The merger of the Nos. 1 and 2 cable TV firms, though, isn't the target of the FCC's move to refine broadband, Guggenheim Partners analyst Paul Gallant told IBD via email.""It's something they've said for a while they want to do,"" he said. ""But nonetheless, it would have the effect of making Comcast look more dominant in broadband, which in turn strengthens the FCC's leverage over the companies for more extensive conditions.""Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, agrees.""Comcast would be viewed as having materially higher market share if broadband were to be defined as 10 mbps or 25 mbps (rather) than under today's definition,"" Moffett said in a research report. ""This would bolster the FCC's and Department of Justice's 'moral authority' to impose more significant conditions on the transaction or perhaps even to block the deal outright.""Jeff Wlodarczak, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, speculates that the FCC could require Comcast to provide minimum guaranteed download speeds of 60 mbps to 100 mbps within five years as a condition of the TWC deal.On Oct. 22, the FCC paused its review of the Comcast-TWC merger as well as AT&T's proposed acquisition of DirecTV Group (DTV). The FCC said that it will decide how to handle highly confidential documents related to agreements with media companies.Comcast expects approval of the TWC acquisition in early 2015, but some analysts say that the review could stretch until Q2.The timing is important because if the FCC adopts a new broadband definition in January, it still might be able to apply the new threshhold to the Comcast-TWC review.""Wheeler has laid the groundwork for aggressive action against Comcast/TWC, portraying the key broadband market as speeds of 25 mbps or more,"" research firm The Capital Forum said in a report. ""This view aligns with those of merger opponents, not Comcast.""Conditions imposed on Comcast-TWC could involve net neutrality.David Cohen, Comcast executive vice president and chief lobbyist, told IBD that the FCC's broadband speed standard has no relevance to the Time Warner Cable deal.""It is not analytically connected to our transaction,"" Cohen said. ""The definition of broadband is all about the government's aspirational goals. In a transaction review, the government looks at relevant markets. There has never been a relevant market analysis within the antitrust, FCC or DOJ purview that relied on a definition of broadband speeds.""Nor does Comcast believe that its broadband market share should be looked at nationally. The service areas of Comcast and TWC do not overlap.""Relevant markets are defined by consumer choice and consumer options,"" Cohen said. ""Broadband is sold in local and regional markets. It's not sold on a national basis.""In 2010, the FCC raised the definition of broadband to 4 mbps from 200 kilobits per second. The FCC in June proposed to redefine broadband to 10 mbps or higher for purposes of its Connect America Fund (CAF) broadband build-out initiative, which provides subsidies to rural phone companies.Wheeler has aimed to promote ""municipal broadband,"" a term for local governments partnering with the likes of Google (GOOGL) or others, in order to build high-speed networks. Gallant says that Wheeler hopes Google or others offering superfast Internet services will pressure cable TV companies broadly, not only in top U.S. markets.Speaking at the National Association of Telecommunications Officers and Advisors annual conference on Oct. 1, Wheeler said: ""We need faster networks in more places ... . Unfortunately, today there is an inverse relationship between competition and throughput. Three-quarters of American homes have no competitive choice at 25 mbps. That includes almost 20% who have no option at all at those speeds.""Comcast's Cohen says that the TWC merger would not reduce competition.""Chairman Wheeler notes accurately that as you move up the speed ladder, there is less and less competition. There's no way to dispute that,"" Cohen said. ""The next question is whether there is anything in our transaction that reduces the level of competition in a relevant market at any speed level, and the answer is there's nothing.""Consumer group Public Knowledge and video streamer Netflix (NFLX) in filings have asked the FCC to increase the broadband threshhold to 25 mbps. Dish Network (DISH) opposes the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal, saying that the combined firm would have 50% of residential broadband connections if the 25 mbps standard is used.Telecom companies such as CenturyLink (CTL) and AT&T, meanwhile, could be impacted if the FCC adopts at least a 10 Mbps standard.""This adds more pressure to AT&T to upgrade their DSL network broadband speeds,"" said Amy Yong, analyst at Macquarie Capital.AT&T had 14.84 million consumer broadband connections as of Sept. 30, including 12 million customers on its U-Verse high-speed Internet network. The others are either DSL residential lines or satellite broadband customers.In a regulatory filing, AT&T said: ""Given the pace at which the industry is investing in advanced capabilities, there is no present need to redefine advanced capabilities. Consumer behavior strongly reinforces the conclusion that a 10 mbps service exceeds what many Americans need today to enable basic, high-quality transmissions.""AT&T has stepped up broadband investments. AT&T said in September that it has completed rolling out its 1 gbps ""GigaPower"" service to parts of the Austin, Texas, area. AT&T GigaPower is also available in parts of Dallas and Fort Worth.AT&T plans to also launch the high-speed service in eight North Carolina cities, including Greensboro, plus Cupertino, Calif.; Houston; Jacksonville, Fla.; Miami; Nashville; St. Louis; and San Antonio. AT&T is studying whether to expand the GigaPower service to 25 more markets nationwide.

The company has struggled vs. bigger rivals like Amazon Web Services, the cloud services unit of Amazon.com (AMZN), amid intensifying price competition.""We believe that if Rackspace announces it is selling, a deal would be done for at least 43 (per share), which would represent 10 times estimated 2014 EBITDA, but if it announces it is not selling the stock, could reach as low as 26, which would mirror its previous 52-week low,"" Colby Synesael, a Cowen analyst, wrote in a research report Monday.Rackspace's high market value, near $4.8 billion, is a drawback for most possible buyers, say several analysts, including Mark Kelleher of DA Davidson.""We do not believe Rackspace Hosting possesses enough proprietary intellectual property to motivate a buyer to spend over $5 billion to purchase the Rackspace Hosting cloud business,"" he wrote in a research note Monday.

194,CTL,"Cloud vendors have a new growth sector: financial institutions.More investment banks, hedge funds, asset managers and exchanges are expected to begin adopting cloud services after dismissing such a move in the past, mostly because of security concerns, says a report released last month.Financial firms have many reasons to adopt cloud services, but the biggest is the bottom line, says Virginie O'Shea, an analyst for Aite Group, the research and consulting firm that issued the report.""Cost pressures have gotten to such a point that it's a natural move for them to evaluate this,"" she told IBD. ""The financial markets are a tough place to be at the moment.""Other reasons why financial firms are turning to cloud services, Aite found, include the need to process more data with fewer staff. The industry has had tens of thousands of layoffs since the 2008 financial crisis.Aite culled its findings from interviews with 21 financial firms in March and April.By 2017, financial institution spending on cloud services will reach $3.2 billion, says the research firm, up 45% from 2013 and up 28% from the $2.5 billion expected this year.Still, only 5.7% of the total $43.5 billion in information technology spending expected by banks and related companies this year is going to cloud services, says Aite. That's up from 5% last year.The industry has been slow to adopt the cloud in part because of security concerns. By turning to vendors who provide services via the Internet cloud, financial institutions feared a lack of control.There are also concerns about performance issues in the cloud vs. using on-premises legacy software systems.But security and other issues have waned since 2008, O'Shea says, while the need to control costs has increased.Financial institutions for the most part ""are not making the money that they were used to pre-2008,"" she said. ""Previously, people were more willing to suck up those costs. Now, margins are so thin that the companies have to think about the long-term costs of everything and whether (their systems are) scalable for the future.""Industry Seeks Faster LaunchesFinancial firms say that their biggest data-management issues are the time that it takes to launch new services, the cost of storing data and the operational risks with their older processes.Many investment banks and other financial firms spread data management among several different legacy systems, O'Shea says, so storing and accessing all of it in a centralized cloud system will likely speed up the information flow. Using the cloud gives the institutions more transparency and flexibility, she says.Using cloud services can also improve efficiency and keep customers happy, says Robert Mahowald, an analyst for market tracker IDC.""It's the ability to do very quick transactions, such as fraud detection and pattern recognition,"" Mahowald told IBD.Moving to cloud services has become a competitive necessity, he says.Financial firms using the cloud are nearly equally divided among public cloud services hosted by outside firms, private cloud services where the companies maintain total control and hybrid cloud mixtures of the two.Many bigger institutions are testing the public cloud for some of their least important tasks.One example is Fidelity Investments. The financial services company has used a public cloud for testing data storage and access as it develops a private cloud for permanent use, Mahowald says.""They are OK with doing some of the burden and load function testing in the public cloud, but when they get to production scale, they want to bring it back in-house,"" he said.Much financial-institution cloud spending will focus on developing private cloud services, where security threats are less of an issue, O'Shea says.""That tends to be top-tier firms spending multimillions (of dollars), with the view that it will bring down the cost of ownership,"" she said.By 2017, global spending on private cloud system hardware and software will reach $22.2 billion, up from $12.3 billion in 2013, with a compounded average growth rate of 17.6% from 2012 to 2017, says IDC.IBM (IBM), Oracle (ORCL), SAP (SAP) and Microsoft (MSFT) are among the cloud-services providers most likely to benefit from the increased spending by financial firms on private clouds, says Mahowald.In public clouds, vendors likely to benefit include Amazon.com (AMZN), IBM, Rackspace Hosting (RAX) and Savvis, a unit of telecom firm CenturyLink (CTL).Besides public cloud offerings, all four sell dedicated, private cloud services that offer customers the greatest amount of control over the service and their stored data.One of the biggest drivers for private cloud services among financial firms is the ability to limit distribution of certain data to only certain offices or departments, O'Shea says. ""They want to keep control over it at a business level or at a business-unit level,"" she said.

That is because the Feb 23rd, 2018, $13.50 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for CenturyLink shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, CenturyLink is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the  Wireless National industry that ranks in the Bottom 27% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, none of the analysts have raised their estimates, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 35 cents per shareto 20 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about CenturyLink right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay.

Cash selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses are projected be approximately 21% of revenues.Our TakeEquinix reported stellar fourth-quarter results. Revenues were mainly driven by strong demand for cloud services from corporations and benefits of Equinix's global platform. The company witnessed revenue growth across all three geographic regions and verticals. Further, the company provided encouraging revenue guidance for the first quarter and full-year 2018.The company is currently focusing on improving customer experience through the Equinix Customer One program. We are also optimistic on its recurring revenue model and expansion plans announced in March last year.Further, it operates across various geographical regions and is becoming increasingly popular among major players in the tech industry for data management, which should drive revenues in the near term.Notably, acquisitions have been a major growth driver for Equinix. We expect the company’s buyouts of Telecity Group, Bit-isle and Nimbo to prove conducive to growth.Expansion in important markets and consolidation of facilities in existing ones are important components of Equinix's core strategy. We believe the company’s focus on offering upgraded technology to attract clients will bolster revenues and profitability, going forward.However, intensifying competition from established Internet data-center operators, such as AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and CenturyLink Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report), might impact product pricing, consequently denting the margins.A highly leveraged balance sheet and industry consolidation add to its woes.Equinix carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

208,CTL,"Global Payments Inc. (GPN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 15. We expect the company to report higher revenues in the fourth quarter a trend seen in the first nine months of 2017 (up 21%), driven by the synergies from the merger with Heartland Payments.The company’s consistent acquisitions, alliances and joint ventures fuel business growth and add to its top line. Moreover, there is ever-increasing demand for electronic payment transactions, which provide it with abundant scope for growth. We thus expect to see increased revenues in the fourth quarter.Other Drivers of 4Q ResultsAccretion from ACTIVE Network Buyout: In the third quarter of 2017, the company completed the acquisition of the communities and sports divisions of ACTIVE Network, which provides cloud-based, mission-critical enterprise software solutions to event organizers. This acquisition will be highly complementary to Global Payments’ gaming business and expand its existing suite of innovative products and solutions.For the fourth quarter of 2017, the company expects ACTIVE Network to contribute revenues in the range of nearly $40 million to $45 million. However, due to the seasonality of the ACTIVE Network business, the company is forecasting this transaction to reduce margin expansion in the fourth quarter. The takeover will be immaterial to fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share.Superior Performing International Business: The company’s international business led by Europe and Asia-Pacific remains strong. Given its favorable performance in e-commerce and omni-channel solutions business in Europe, we expect the strength to continue.High Interest Expense: Nevertheless, the bottom line may suffer from an increase in interest cost due to high debt incurred to fund its acquisitions.GuidanceFollowed by strong earnings performance and closure of the ACTIVE Network acquisition, the company raised its 2017 adjusted earnings guidance to a range of $3.94 to $4.02 per share (from $3.85 to $4.00 guided previously), which reflects growth of 24% to 26% over 2016. Adjusted net revenues are expected between $3.505 billion and $3.53 billion (versus $3.40 billion and $3.48 billion), reflecting an increase of 23% to 24% from 2016.Earnings WhispersAs per our proven model, Global Payments is poised to beat estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Global Payments has an Earning ESP of +0.62%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Global Payments carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  WEX (WEX  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 21.

209,CTL,"CenturyLink (CTL  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 14, after the market closes. Based in Louisiana, the company is a leading regional wireline service provider in the United States.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $5.69 billion, reflecting year-over-year improvement of 32.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 22 cents per share, indicating a year-over-year decline of 59.3%.Meanwhile, the company has a negative earnings surprise history. Earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the previous four quarters, with an average miss of 4.56%Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that CenturyLink is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of the two key elements.Zacks ESP: CenturyLink has an Earnings ESP of +14.87%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 26 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 22 cents. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CenturyLink has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of CenturyLink’s favorable Zacks Rank and positive ESP indicates a likely positive surprise.CenturyLink, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  CenturyLink, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | CenturyLink, Inc. Quote What is Driving the Better-than-Expected Results?CenturyLink remains focused on establishing itself as a global leader in cloud infrastructure and hosted IT solutions arena for enterprise customers. It continues to invest in fiber-to-the-tower (FTTT) expansion and has expanded its fiber-based backhaul services. Acquisition of Level 3 Communications will increase CenturyLink's network by 200,000 route miles of fiber. The new company will be a formidable force in the fiber-based metro-Ethernet and Internet market. Moreover, thecompany is focused on bringing improved operating efficiencies through a number of methods including network simplification and rationalization. Further, the growing momentum of CenturyLink’s Prism IPTV service has prompted it to unveil a beta version of over-the-top (OTT) TV services. By foraying into the OTT space, the company has joined the likes of DISH Network’s (DISH  -  Free Report) Sling TV and AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) DirecTV Now. We also appreciate CenturyLink’s quarterly dividend payout of 54 cents per share, paid on Dec 11, 2017, to shareholders of record as of Nov 27, 2017.On the flip side, CenturyLink continues to suffer from declining access lines and broadband subscriber losses. This is primarily due to the substitution of traditional wireline telephone services by wireless and other competitive offerings and lower long distance minutes of use.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total access lines in fourth-quarter 2017 is pegged at 10,361 million. The estimate indicates a decline from 10,506 million and 11,090 million reported in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.High-speed broadband customer count estimate for the quarter stands at 5.699 million. The figure lags 5.767 million and 5.945 million in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.Additionally, high debt levels and decreasing cash flows are likely to affect the company's margins. Technological changes compel large investments, which can dilute cash flow.RevenuesWe expect CenturyLink to see an improvement in revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues in fourth-quarter 2017 is pegged at $5.69 billion, showing a year-over-year increase of 32.6%. The estimate also shows an improvement from $4.03 billion reported in third-quarter 2017.Strategic revenues are estimated to be $2,225 million, above $1,892 million and $2,016 million in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.The consensus estimate for Data Integration revenues of $139 million is higher than $134 million and $131 million in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.Legacy revenue estimate of $1,683 million, however, is lower than $1,705 million and $1,846 million in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.However, segmental revenue estimates paint a dismal picture for the to-be reported quarter.Business segment revenue estimates of $2,155 million lag $2,171 million and $2,545 million reported in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.Consumer segment revenue estimates of $1,364 million are lower than $1,387 million and $1,448 million in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.Price PerformanceCenturyLink’s stock price performance has been impressive. In the past three months, the stock has rallied 16.4% compared with the industry’s gain of 6.1%.  When compared with the market at large, the stock has outperformed the S&P 500 index’s rise of 1.6% in the same time frame.  Key PickWindstream (WIN  -  Free Report), from the broader Computer and Technology sector has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in fourth-quarter 2017, when it reports on Feb 22.

210,CTL,"America Movil (AMX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 13, after the market closes.The company portrays a negative earnings surprise history. Earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters, with an average miss of 29.17%Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors Likely to Influence Q4 EarningsAmerica Movil’s efforts to systematically enrich spectrum portfolio with the acquisition of wireless spectrums instill optimism. The acquisition of 60 MHz of wireless spectrum (airwave) in the 2.5 GHz band from Grupo MVS (in July 2017) has enhanced the company’s high-speed data service. Last year, the company gained additional spectrums in Uruguay and Costa Rica. Moreover, the wireless roaming agreement with U.S. telecom giant AT&T (T  -  Free Report) should help the company retain position in the Mexican market. Meanwhile, regulatory approval from Argentina's National Communications Agency (Enacom) to enter into the pay-TV market in Argentina is a major positive for the company. Notably, the company has already established wireless and wireline operators in Argentina. Joint venture with JCDecaux should boost the company’s out-of-home advertising businesses.On the flip side, America Movil’s aggressive promotional strategies (like discounts and subsidized offers), aimed to increase penetration in the smartphone market, are concerns. These efforts may cause decline in margins with increased cost and expenses, affecting overall profits in the near term.America Movil’s second-largest wireless market — Brazil — has become increasingly competitive. The company’s Brazilian operation (Claro) faces competitive threat from Vivo, owned by Telefonica Brazil SA (VIV  -  Free Report). Meanwhile, AT&T’s entry into the Mexican telecom industry with the acquisition of Gurpo Iusacell and Nextel de Mexico pose severe competition for the company. To this end, the company’s focus on shifting base from Mexico to Brazil in the wake of declining quarterly revenues looks viable.Accumulating debt and decreasing cash flows may pose problems for the company’s credit ratings.Price PerformanceAmerica Movil portrays an impressive price performance. In the past three months, the stock has rallied 2.9% against the industry’s decline of 4.1%.  When compared with the market at large, the stock compares favorably with the S&P 500 index’s rally of 1.4%.  Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that America Movil is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Different network service providers are merging with the company for the deployment of the Infinera Cloud Xpress, regionally and globally, to reach out to customers with higher scalability and reliability. In November 2017, online streaming service provider, Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), deployed the Infinera Cloud Xpress 2 to expand delivery capacity for streaming videos.Further, Infinera collaborated with CenturyLink (CTL  -  Free Report) to deliver 2.5 terabits per second of capacity to connect research and education community around the world, leveraging the CenturyLink core network.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

213,CTL,"T-Mobile US (TMUS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8, before the market opens.The company has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the previous four quarters, the average positive surprise being 53.97%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to Influence Q4 EarningsT-Mobile Us is expected to deliver solid performance in the fourth quarter. In January 2018, the company revealed preliminary subscriber statistics for the to-be-reported quarter and 2017. The company gained a net of 5.7 million customers in 2017, which includes 3.6 million net customer additions in the postpaid segment. T-Mobile US exited 2017 with a total of 72.6 million customers. It was also the fourth consecutive year when the company gained more than 5 million subscribers. In the quarter under review, the company added a net of 1.9 million postpaid customers, making it the 19th straight quarter of more than 1 million net subscriber additions. In fourth-quarter 2017, customer churn was 1.18%, improving 10 basis points (bps) year over year and 5 bps sequentially.Meanwhile, the company’s share repurchases look encouraging. In 2017, the company repurchased approximately 7.0 million shares at an average price of $63.34 per share. The total purchase price was around $444 million. On Dec 6, 2017, the company’s board of directors approved a $1.5-billion share repurchase program. Notably, the stock buybacks were backed by the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flow generation. The company is likely to maintain the flexible liquidity scenario in the upcoming quarter.Additionally, the company’s rating was upgraded to Ba2 by Moody's, with its rating outlook being confirmed stable. The company decided to roll out 600 MHz wireless spectrum in its footprints and has conducted successful Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) tests, live on its commercial network. T-Mobile US is also planning to team up with dark fiber partners to backhaul small cell densification project.On the flip side, the company continues to struggle in a highly competitive and saturated wireless market where success depends on technical superiority, quality of services and scalability. Moreover, the domestic wireless industry is likely to become more competitive in 2018 with the entry of cable operators like Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications (CHTR  -  Free Report). Launch of several low-priced service plans for individual consumers and small business entities lead to high cash burn for the company.RevenuesWe expect T-Mobile US to see an improvement in revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Services revenues is pegged at $7,796 million. The estimate shows an improvement from $7,629 million and $7,245 million in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.Within the Service segment, branded postpaid revenue estimate of $5,044 million is higher than $4,920 million and $4,680 million in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.Branded prepaid revenues estimate of $2,409 million is higher $2,376 million and $2,227 million in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.Wholesale revenues estimate of $262 million lags $274 million reported in the last quarter.Roaming & other services revenues estimate of $74 million is higher than $59 million reported in the last quarter.Equipment revenues estimate of $2,809 million is above $2,118 million and $2,740 million in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.Price PerformanceT-Mobile US portrays an impressive price performance. In the past three months, the stock has rallied 8.2% compared  with the industry’s gain of 6.8%.  When compared with the market at large, the stock compares favorably with the S&P 500 index’s rally of 2.2%.  T-Mobile US' innovative network expansion methodologies and improvement plans, stellar network performance, deployment of LTE-U technology and offering of attractive unlimited data are key factors behind the mounting performance. This is supported by improving scale, healthy free cash flow generation, strong liquidity and valuable spectrum assets that also provide credit support.Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that T-Mobile US is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: T-Mobile US has an Earnings ESP of -6.73%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at 34 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 37 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with the Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: T-Mobile US has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

214,CTL,"Infinera Corp. (INFN  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 7, after the market closes. The company is a provider of digital optical networking systems to telecommunications carriers, cable operators and other service providers worldwide.Infinera has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 11.30%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayInfinera portrays a dismal price performance in the past six months. The stock has declined 32.4% against the industry’s gain of 20.6%.  Moreover, stiff competition from peers like Lantronix, Extreme Networks (EXTR  -  Free Report), NETGEAR (NTGR  -  Free Report) and Brocade Communications Systems in the digital optical networking market is a concern. This might hamper the company’s fourth-quarter results.Meanwhile, we are impressed with Infinera’s strategic business moves which include new launches and alliances. Different network service providers are merging with the company for the deployment of the Infinera Cloud Xpress, regionally and globally, to reach out to customers with higher scalability and reliability. Online streaming service provider, Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), has deployed the Infinera Cloud Xpress 2 to expand delivery capacity for streaming videos.Meanwhile, the company introduced the Infinera Instant Network, the next generation of software defined capacity (“SDC”) for cloud scale networks. The launch is expected to meet the needs of the emerging 5G mobile services, the Internet of Things (IoT), video streaming, Ethernet and cloud-based on-demand business services. Infinera’s decision to power cloud scale networks will boost its cloud suite. We believe that this will help the company improve the top line and lend it a competitive edge in the to-be-reported quarter.Further, Infinera collaborated with CenturyLink to deliver 2.5 terabits per second of capacity to connect research and education community around the world, leveraging the CenturyLink core network.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Infinera is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Infinera has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 13 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Infinera has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Infinera Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Infinera Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Infinera Corporation Quote Key PickCenturyLink (CTL  -  Free Report) from the broader Computer and Technology sector has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in fourth-quarter 2017 results, slated to release on Feb 14.

215,CTL,"The fourth-quarter earnings season is picking up pace, with multiple companies reporting earnings each day. Per the latest Earnings Preview, approximately 400 companies, including 121 S&P 500 members, will report earnings this week. To date, 26% of the S&P 500 members have already reported results, with another 24% slated to release results this week.Generally, earnings releases are quite scattered this quarter. Moreover, the earnings calendar is not the same for all companies.Let’s take a look at two stocks — AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) — which will release results on Jan 31, after market close. While, AT&T will report fourth-quarter 2017 results, Qualcomm is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 numbers.Notably, the companies are grouped under the Computer and Technology sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors).Here, we discuss the price performance and fundamentals (financial and non-financial) of the companies to gain an idea about how they will fare this earnings season.We rely on our Zacks methodology to help investors choose the better stock. Our quantitative model states that a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better to deliver earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Let’s take a closer look at each of the aforementioned factors.Price Performance We have compared the price performances of AT&T and Qualcomm with the broader sector and the S&P 500 index for the October-December 2017 period.Shares of Qualcomm returned 23.5% outperforming the broader sector’s and S&P 500 index’s rally of 6.3% and 5.5%, respectively. However, AT&T’s shares declined 0.7% over the same time frame.  AT&TAT&T is one of the leading telecommunication service providers in the United States. The company’s wireless opportunities from the launch of standards-based mobile 5G services in 2018 and the FirstNet project look impressive. Meanwhile, its move to raise quarterly dividend by 2% to 50 cents per share (annualized $2.00 per share) is encouraging. In December 2017, AT&T’s over-the-top (OTT) online streaming service — DIRECTV NOW — reported more than 1 million subscribers, despite cord-cutting. The company reported a net gain of approximately 0.213 million DIRECTV NOW connections, since Sep 30, 2017. It is to be seen whether the company can maintain subscriber gain in the to-be-reported quarter.AT&T is expected to earn 65 cents per share on $41.2 billion in revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The company has a mixed earnings surprise history. In two of the previous four quarters, the company’s bottom line met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one of the four, the average beat being 1.36%.However, AT&T has an Earnings ESP of -0.15%. This negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult despite the company’s favorable Zacks Rank #3. (Read more: What's in the Cards for AT&T This Earnings Season?)AT&T Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  AT&T Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AT&T Inc. Quote QualcommQualcomm is one of the largest manufacturer of wireless chipset based on baseband technology. The company has been trying to retain its leadership in 5G, chipset market and mobile connectivity with multiple technological achievements and launches. On the flip side, the company has been involved in various legal brawls related to unfair business practices or licensing royalty payments.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, Qualcomm is expected to earn 90 cents per share and $5.95 billion in revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Segment-wise, revenues in Qualcomm Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) Technologies (QCT) are estimated at $4,648 million, up from $4,650 million and $4,101 million reported in fourth-quarter 2017 and first-quarter fiscal 2017, respectively. Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL) revenue estimate of $1,228 million is above $1,800 million and $1,811 million reported in fourth-quarter 2017 and first-quarter fiscal 2017, respectively.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company’s prospects in the to-be-reported quarter based on certain non-financial metrics look encouraging. Qualcomm is expected to ship approximately 230 million CDMA-based MSM (Mobile Station Modem) chipsets in the quarter, up from 220 million reported in the previous quarter. The estimate is in line with management’s previous chipset outlook of 220-240 million for first-quarter fiscal 2018.Qualcomm has a mixed earnings surprise history. In the trailing four quarters, the company’s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two and beat the same in the other two. The average positive surprise for the last four quarters is 6.31%.Moreover, the company has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP (both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 90 cents) makes surprise prediction difficult. (Read more: Qualcomm to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in Store?)QUALCOMM Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  QUALCOMM Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | QUALCOMM Incorporated QuoteOur TakePer our proprietary model, AT&T and Qualcomm are unlikely to post earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter. However, Qualcomm’s Earnings ESP of 0.00% lends it an edge over AT&T’s -0.15%.Irrespective of an earnings beat or miss, investors should focus on the companies’ fundamentals to take a  decision.

216,CTL,"Sprint Corporation (S  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Feb 2, before market opens.In the trailing four quarters, the company’s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two and beat the estimate in the other two. The average positive surprise for the last four quarters is 131.25%Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors Likely to Influence Q3 EarningsSprint continues to fortify its position in the wireless industry with network modernization and integration efforts, attractive unlimited data plans and promotional offers in its postpaid and prepaid plans. These offerings have helped the company register an impressive number of customer additions during second-quarter fiscal 2017.Sprint witnessed net additions of 3,78,000 wireless customers, including net gain of 1,68,000 postpaid customers. Prepaid net additions totaled 95,000, while wholesale and affiliate net additions were 1,15,000 compared with net gain of 35,000 prepaid and 65,000 wholesale and affiliate in first-quarter fiscal 2017. Sprint's focus to deliver the most attractive value proposition in wireless resulted in a net gain of 2,79,000 postpaid phone subscribers, marking the ninth consecutive quarter of net additions. In second-quarter fiscal 2017 results, the company witnessed the highest retail phone net additions in more than two years. Backed by such subscriber gain, Sprint has maintained its previous outlook for 2017. It is to be seen whether the company can maintain subscriber gain in the to-be-reported quarter.Sprint unveiled the Sprint MultiLine solution which allows businesses to add a company-owned number to their employees' personal phones for better operations. Meanwhile, the company is planning to offer free access to online video streaming service provider, Hulu. Its basic service includes TV series, movies, original content and other programming with limited or no commercials.The alliance with telecom service provider — Ericsson — to launch massive MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) radios bodes well for Sprint. Notably, the companies are planning to launch Massive MIMO radios across the United States by 2018. These devices are expected to raise the network capacity of Sprint by up to 10 times and will also influence Gigabit LTE services, boosting the company’s 5G networks prospects.Of late, Sprint has been trying striving to check churn and fend off competition. Also, the company has been continuously making efforts to lure customers from rival carriers such as AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Verizon Communications (VZ  -  Free Report) by offering attractive promotional plans and discounts. This has led to high cash burn and heavy losses. Notably, with more smartphone launches coming up, specifically iPhone 7, we expect the promotional offers to dent margins.Further, Sprint has a debt-laden balance sheet and has been witnessing losses each year since 2007. As of Sep 30, 2017, Sprint had $4,802 million of cash and marketable securities compared with $2,870 million at the end of March 2017. Total debt outstanding was $34,236 million compared with $35,878 million at the end of March 2017. Additionally, in the reported quarter, free cash flow was $420 million compared with $707 million in the year-ago quarter. Such high debt levels, declining cash flows and liquidity pressure may affect the company’s cost of capital to raise funds for network expansion.Affected by the headwinds, Sprint’s shares have lost 32.7% compared with the industry’s decline of 0.3% in the past six months.  Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Sprint is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Sprint has an Earnings ESP of -40.35%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at a loss of 5 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 4 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with the Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Sprint has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Sprint Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Sprint Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Sprint Corporation QuoteKey PickCenturyLink (CTL  -  Free Report) from the broader Computer and Technology sector has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in fourth-quarter 2017 results, slated to release on Feb 14.

217,CTL,"AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 31, after the market closes.In two of the previous four quarters, the company’s bottom line met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one of them, with an average beat of 1.36%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayAT&T’s wireless growth opportunities from the launch of standards-based mobile 5G services in 2018 and the FirstNet project look impressive. The project is the first dedicated nationwide wireless network for first responders, which is likely to drive the company in 2018. Recently, AT&T and the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) revealed the inclusion of 50 states, two U.S. territories and Washington DC in the FirstNet project.Since 2017, AT&T has been striving to lay the foundation for mobile 5G network. The company has completed network upgradation in 23 major cities. Notably, the completion of 3rd Generation Partnership Project’s (3GPP) first implementable 5G New radio (NR) specification has set the stage for the global mobile industry to initiate full-scale development of 5G NR for large-scale trials and commercial deployments in 2019.AT&T’s move to raise quarterly dividend by 2% to 50 cents per share (annualized $2.00 per share) is encouraging. The dividend will be paid on Feb 1, 2017 to shareholders of record as of Jan 10, 2018. This marks the 34th annual dividend hike by the company. The hike was backed by strong cash flows and business outlook.  Notably, in third-quarter 2017, AT&T generated $11,114 million of cash from operations compared with $10,995 million from the prior-year quarter. Free cash flow in the reported quarter was $5,863 million compared with $5,182 million in the year-ago quarter. Management expects free cash flow to be enough to pay debt and return cash to shareholders. It is to be seen whether the company will be able to continue to garner strong cash flow in the upcoming quarter.In December 2017, AT&T’s over the top (OTT) online streaming service — DIRECTV NOW — reported more than 1 million subscribers, despite cord-cutting. The company reported a net gain of approximately 0.213 million DIRECTV NOW connections, since Sep 30, 2017. It is to be seen whether the company can maintain subscriber gain in the to-be-reported quarter.Further, AT&T and Verizon teamed up with Tillman to build cell towers in the United States. AT&T’s NetBond is gearing up to offer multiple cloud connections. AT&T is exploring a strategic option to sell a major part of its Latin American pay-TV operations.Backed by such prospects, AT&T’s shares have returned 10.4% compared with the industry’s rally of 4.9% in the past six months. On the flip side, AT&T continues to struggle in the competitive and almost-saturated U.S. wireless market with incumbents like Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) and Sprint Corp. (S  -  Free Report). The industry is likely to witness more competition in 2018 with the entry of cable MSOs (multi service operators). Comcast already entered this space with Xfinity Mobile offering. Charter Communications reiterated its plans of launching wireless service in the first half of 2018. Adoption of several unlimited data plans resulted in a reduction of wireless service revenues and average revenues per user (ARPU).Moreover, AT&T’s wireline division suffers from persistent losses in access lines, thanks to competitive pressure from voice-over-Internet protocol (VoIP) service providers and aggressive triple-play (voice, data, video) offerings by cable companies. These are likely to weigh on the company’s revenues and margins.Operating expenses, marketing costs associated with attractive discounts, regulatory norms and union issues are other headwinds. Regulatory hurdle for the pending AT&T-Time Warner deal has become a major concern for the telco. This is the fourth instance when the company has changed the closure date to Jun 21, 2018 to clear regulatory issues.Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that AT&T is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: AT&T has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 65 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with the Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: AT&T has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.AT&T Inc.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Let’s take a look at the company’s Wireline segment as well as its operations, revenues, operating margins and subscriber count to gain an idea about how the company will fare this earnings season.(See more in Verizon Communications Q4 Earnings: What's in Store?)(To know more about Verizon’s Wireless Segment, read Will Verizon Gain Postpaid Wireless Subscribers in Q4?)Wireline Segment OperationsVerizon has been striving to enhance its wireline segment operations. The company has launched FiOS Instant Internet services along with fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) in greater New York City/northern New Jersey, Philadelphia and Richmond. Verizon has also sweetened its SMB (small and medium-sized business) services with a new video service, Fios Current TV.Verizon has been aggressively expanding fiber optics networks to support 4G LTE, upcoming 5G wireless standards and wireline connections. Through multiple acquisitions, the company has strengthenedfiber-optic network assets. In many cities like Boston and Sacramento, Verizon has already started upgrading the city’s aging copper network infrastructure with fiber and wireless network to support high-end mobile and wireline services for smart city, residential and business applications. Besides Verizon, other major wireline operators, such as AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), Frontier Communications Inc. (FTR  -  Free Report) and CenturyLink Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report) have also decided to migrate to fiber-based network from copper. Verizon has been leasing this fiber network, which provides connectivity to more than 1,000 cell sites of different scales.RevenuesVerizon’s Wireline segment accounts for almost one-third of its total revenues, evident from $7,662 million revenues reported in the third-quarter 2017 (24.16% of total revenues). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2017 total wireline operating revenues is pegged at $7,676 million.Verizon Communications Inc. Revenue (TTM)  Verizon Communications Inc.

The figure marks an improvement over 4.648 million and 4.694 million video subscribers in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.In the to-be-reported quarter, the company is expected to suffer a loss of 13,120 FiOS video subscribers compared with a loss of 18,000 in the previous quarter. However, the company had gained a net of 21,000 FiOS video subscribers in fourth-quarter 2016.FiOS Internet subscriber count is estimated at 5.860 million, reflecting an increase over 5.803 million and 5.653 million subscribers in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.Net FiOS Internet subscriber addition is estimated at around 57,000 compared with the addition of 66,000 and 68,000 subscribers in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.Meanwhile, FiOS digital voice residence connections are estimated at 3.934 million, reflecting an increase over 3.920 million and 3.895 million subscribers in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.Net FiOS digital voice residential connections gain is forecasted around 13,500 compared with the addition of 11,000 and 13,000 connections in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.High-speed internet connection will drop to 1.143 million compared with 1.175 million and 1.385 million in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively. The company will lose 70,000 connections in the to-be-reported quarter compared with a loss of 76,000 connections in the last quarter.Total broadband connections are expected to reduce to 6.966 million from 6.978 million and 7.038 million connections in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively. The company is likely to lose 15,070 connections in fourth-quarter 2017 compared with a loss of 10,000 connections in the last quarter.Primary residence switched access connections are expected to decline to 2.716 million from 2.830 million and 3.230 million connections in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively. The company is likely to suffer a loss of 115,000 connections compared with a loss of 132,000 and 129,000 connections in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.Primary residence connections count is estimated at 6.647 million, reflecting a drop from 6.750 million and 7.125 million connections in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.

In the past six months, shares of Verizon have rallied 16.6% compared with the industry’s gain of 1.7%.  When compared with the market at large, the stock looks good as the S&P 500 index has gained 13.3%.  Our TakeVerizon’s persistent efforts to reinforce its wireline operations look impressive. Despite losses in FiOS video subscribers, the company has always enjoyed massive gain of FiOS digital voice residential connections and FiOS Internet subscribers. Per our estimates, the upcoming quarter is likely to witness the same.Verizon’s FiOS technology is likely to witness considerable demand from residential customers once 4K video technology and Internet of things (IoT) technology gain popularity.Accumulation of dark fiber will bolster Verizon’s cell network density and boost mobile backhaul network. The densification of cell network will help the company install and build its upcoming 5G network.

The contract expires on Feb 12, 2021.With the new agreement, AT&T reached 32 different labor agreements since 2015 covering about 165,000 employees.

220,CTL,"A successful portfolio manager is aware of the importance of having well-performing stocks in one’s portfolio. Indicators of a stock’s continued performance include a rise in share price and strong fundamentals.One such stock that investors need to hold on to right now is Equinix Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report). Though there are a few concerns, these are short lived. The stock has the potential to perform well over the long run.Equinix’s share-price movement has been quite encouraging. Over the past year, its shares have gained 25.1%, while the industry, to which it belongs to, witnessed a decline of 9.9%.What’s Driving Equinix?Equinix is a global provider of network-neutral data centers and internet-exchange services for enterprises, content companies, systems integrators and network service providers. The company is on a growth trajectory, gathering momentum from its positive earnings surprise history and robust fundamentals.It delivered a positive earnings surprise in three out of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 6.8%.Last quarter, Equinix reported solid year-over-year improvement in revenues as well as earnings. The year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by strong booking activity, Equinix's global platform, continued enterprise momentum and synergies from acquisition. The company witnessed revenue growth across all three geographic regions and verticals.Acquisitions have been a major contributor to growth at Equinix. The company has made several buyouts to continue expanding its data-center capacity in many of its key markets since 2003. Last year, the company bought various assets, including Itconic and Zenium businesses, and data-center assets from IO UK and ICT-Center AG.Furthermore, the company completed the pending acquisition of 24 data-center sites, which consist of 29 data-center buildings across 15 metro areas, in operation from Verizon Communications (VZ  -  Free Report) for a total cash consideration of $3.6 billion in 2017. Other notable acquisitions in the recent past include Telecity Group Plc, Bit-isle and Nimbo. All these acquisitions are making decent contributions toward total revenue growth.Bottom LineExpansion in important markets and consolidation of facilities in the existing ones are important parts of Equinix's core strategy. The company strives to boost its revenue base and profitability by offering upgraded technology to clients. Moreover, its recurring revenue model has provided the much-needed support to the company's revenue stream over the years. The company's cloud and IT service businesses are its fastest growing segments, and account for roughly one fourth of its total revenues.Further, Equinix remains positive on the growing demand for data centers. To meet the rising demand for cloud services, this global interconnection and data-center company is expanding its IBX data centers globally, and gaining popularity among tech companies looking for data management.Additionally, the company’s earnings are projected to grow 15.3% over the long term and it has a Growth Style Score of B.Nonetheless, we are slightly concerned about the company’s growing debt burden, which will affect operating results as interest expenses are likely to flare up. Also, intensifying competition from established internet data-center operators such as AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and CenturyLink Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report) might affect product pricing, thereby denting Equinix’s margins.Equinix has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

222,CTL,"Leading wireline and wireless service providers that are interested in extending their reach in rural United States with high-speed broadband services will get a chance to bid for an additional $2 billion in government’s Connect America Fund II (CAFII) subsidy.In 2015, the Federal Communications Commission had (FCC) offered more than $10 billion over the next six years in CAFII subsidy to deploy high-speed Internet connections through rural United States.  In May 2016, the FCC had approved a reverse auction to provide an additional $2 billion in funds to rural broadband providers through its CAF II program in an effort to accelerate growth.The FCC will adopt four technology neutral service standards: (1) delivering 10/1 Mbps speed (2) delivering 25/3 Mbps and offering a usage allowance of 150 GB a month (3) meeting an above baseline tier that requires bidders to provide 100/20 Mbps and (4) an unlimited monthly usage allowance and meeting a Gigabit performance tier that requires bidders to provide at least 1 Gbps downstream and 500 Mbps upstream and offer an unlimited monthly usage allowance.In 2015, several large wireline operators including AT&T Inc.

The two pro-growth agendas of Trump, namely, significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the U.S. economy.  The proposal to reduce corporate taxes from their current 35% to 20% is likely to bring corporate tax rate at its historic low in 78 years. The tax proposal is likely to provide incentives to companies to repatriate accumulated profits from overseas with an even lower tax rate.Additionally, Trump has stated that he wants to do away with nearly 75% of all governmental regulations during his term as President. Major proposals like a pledge to spend $1 trillion in infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years coupled with the above-mentioned policy changes are likely to spur higher consumer spending that may create about 25 million new jobs over a decade. This in turn will fuel long-term economic growth.Bottom LineThe telecommunications industry is witnessing rapid technological improvement. A growing economy speeds up the demand for real-time voice, data, and video manifold. The escalation in demand for telecom services in the rural areas has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

228,CTL,"T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) recently requested for Special Temporary Authority (STA) from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to test microwave radio spectrum bands in two sites in Bellevue, WA.The third-largest wireless operator in the United States has plans to evaluate microwave radio spectrum with integrated antenna for the 71-76 GHz and 81-86 GHz bands. Spectrum bands in the above-mentioned range are commonly known as “lightly licensed” E-band frequencies. The manufacturer of the equipment is Ceragon Networks Ltd.The company aims to initiate full-phased 5G deployment from around 2020. T-Mobile US, plans to use new 600MHz spectrum assets alongside mid-band airwaves and 200MHz of spectrum in the 28GHz and 39GHz bands. The company has started the densification of the network as part of the 5G effort. The company plans to roll out 2,000 more small cells in 2017 and an additional 25,000 by the end of 2018.The company is likely to use unlicensed or lightly-licensed millimeter wave frequencies, such as the 60 GHz V-Band or 70/80 GHz E-Band, which is a cost-effective choice for deploying fiber like 5G fixed wireless access (FWA).T-Mobile US is planning to team up with dark fiber partners to backhaul small cell densification project. Dark fiber provides abundant bandwidth which is of utmost necessity for the smooth functioning of super-fast wireless networks such as 4G and 5G. Dark fiber based backhaul provides scalability and efficiency to bandwidth management. This will enable the company to significantly reduce backhaul costs.In October 2017, T-Mobile US requested for STA from the FCC to test pre-commercial LTE Advanced (LTE-A) in El Paso, TX, and Augusta, GA. The trial was conducted using multiple spectrum bands, 700 MHz, PCS and AWS spectrum licensed to T-Mobile US as well as AWS-3 spectrum that is held by the FCC. In the Augusta and El Paso markets, the company planned to use the base stations of Nokia Corp. (NOK  -  Free Report) and Ericsson AB (ERIC  -  Free Report), respectively.Recent Trial Permit From FCCIn October 2017, CenturyLink Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report) sought permission from the FCC to conduct trials of fixed wireless spectrum bands in the range of 3.54-3.70 GHz frequency band.

229,CTL,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is CenturyLink, Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in CTL.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen eight estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $1.94 a share a month ago to its current level of $1.60.Also, for the current quarter, CenturyLink has seen seven downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 22 cents a share from 48 cents over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 22.4% in the past month.CenturyLink, Inc.

The company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in only one of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 788.46%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayTelephone & Data Systemscontinues to compete with the likes of CenturyLink Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report) and Frontier Communications Corp. (FTR  -  Free Report), to name a few. Additionally, the company’s wireless division – United States Cellular Corp. (USM  -  Free Report) – continues to operate in an intensely competitive wireless market and remains significantly challenged by the offering of service plans from lower-cost mobile operators. We further believe that high costs associated with network integration and construction of new cell sites, aggressive equipment pricing, increasing capacity in existing cell sites, wireless technology upgrades and spectrum licensing will put considerable pressure on the company’s finances.Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. QuoteWe believe these headwinds have led to the dismal price performance of Telephone & Data Systems. Over the past three months, shares of Telephone & Data Systems have lost 5.0% compared with the industry’s decline of 4.5%.Meanwhile, Telephone and Data Systems is looking out for opportunities to bring more fiber in order to better address services, both in its current footprint and adjacent areas. By leveraging on fiber, the telco is trying to meet the growing demand for TV and broadband services. The company continues to expand its business in the managed hosting and cloud service market. Launch of Shared Data plans at nominal prices should help the company gain consumers. It continues to experience strong smartphone demand at its wireless wing — U.S. Cellular.At the end of the last reported second-quarter 2017, the service provider claimed to have expanded about 19% of its network route miles with fiber. The telco’s fiber network investments are also driving positive results in consumer services like Internet Protocol TV (IPTV). Its IPTV connections grew 12.1% year over year to 46,200, with a net addition of 5,000 connections compared with the prior-year figure. Additionally, more customers are opting for higher speeds, including 1 Gbps, in the company’s FTTH-enabled markets.Total cable connections were 297,000, up 3.3% year over year. Broadband Connections totaled 140,300, up 11.6%. We expect this trend to reflect in the upcoming quarterly results.Dividend PaymentWe appreciate Telephone and Data Systems’ decision to reward shareholders with a third-quarter 2017 dividend of 15.5 cents per Common Share and Series A Common Share, payable on Sep 29 2017, to shareholders of record as of Sep 15 2017. The move indicates the company’s commitment to create value for shareholders and underlines its confidence in business growth.As investors prefer an income-generating stock, a high dividend-yielding firm is much coveted. Investors are always on the lookout for companies with a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments.Key PickHere is a company in the broader Utilitiessector – which houses Telephone and Data Systems–that has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.TELUS Corporation (TU) has an Earnings ESP of +1.80% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

235,CTL,"CenturyLink Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 numbers on Nov 8, after market close.The leading regional wireline service provider has a negative earnings surprise history. The company lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 2.44%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayCenturyLink remains focused on establishing itself as a global leader in cloud infrastructure and hosted-IT solutions arena for enterprise customers. The company is opting for managed Wi-Fi services to cater to the demands of small and mid-sized business (SMBs) and to lure customers from cable-TV operators and Competitive local exchange carriers (CLEC). CenturyLink has also unveiled Dedicated Cloud Compute (DCC) Foundation, which is an updated version of private cloud service. CenturyLink is investing in fiber-to-the-tower (FTTT) expansion and has expanded its fiber-based backhaul services. The company is focused on bringing improved operating efficiencies through a number of methods including network simplification and rationalization.Further, the growing momentum of CenturyLink’s Prism IPTV service has prompted it to unveil a beta version of over the top (OTT) TV services in June 2017. By foraying into the OTT space, the company has joined the likes of DISH Network Corp.’s (DISH  -  Free Report) Sling TV and AT&T Inc.’s (T  -  Free Report) DirecTV Now. CenturyLink’s efforts to fortify itself in the enterprise-wide business segment and boost its fiber and cloud suite, by inking different deals also look impressive.We also appreciate CenturyLink’s quarterly dividend payout of 54 cents a share on Sep 15, 2017, to shareholders of record as of Sep 5, 2017.However, the company continues to face persistent losses in access lines and legacy voice services, on an organic basis. Further, decline in subsidy payments by the Federal Universal Service Fund, tough competition, federal regulations, labour union issues andIn the past three months, shares of CenturyLink have lost 26.7% compared with the industry’s decline of 10.0%.  Expected Subscriber Statistics and Segmental RevenuesIn third-quarter 2017, total access lines were 1.567 million compared with 10.7333 million in the last reported quarter.  High-speed broadband customer count is expected around 5.832 million in the to-be reported quarter, down from 5.868 million in the prior-year quarter. Business segment revenues are pegged at $2,199 million in third-quarter 2017 compared with $2,215 million in the year-ago period. Consumer segment revenues are expected at $1,391 million compared with $1,402 million in the previous quarter.Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show a beat for CenturyLink this quarter.

237,CTL,"Equinix Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1.We believe expansion in important markets and growing demand for data centers along with synergies from acquisition are likely to drive the company’s overall third-quarter results.Let’s discuss them one by one.Expansion StrategiesExpansion in important markets and consolidation of facilities in existing ones are crucial parts of Equinix's core strategy. Further, the companyremains positive on growing demand for data centers. To meet the rising demand for cloud services, this global interconnection and data center company is expanding its IBX data centers globally, and gaining popularity among tech companies looking for data management.In doing so the company recently announced that it has opened the 13th International Business Exchange (IBX) data center — SV10 — in the Silicon Valley. The new center will enable itto meet the growing demand for data center services in theregion. We believe that expanding its facility in the Silicon Valley will attract more enterprises to opt for Equinix’s data center services, in turn, boosting the revenues.Going forward, the company also has plans to build the its fifth IBX in Hong Kong. The new IBX infrastructure will be known as HK5. With an area of over 48,000 square feet, the HK5 facility will accommodate about 1,200 cabinets.The recent expansion plan is in sync with Equinix’s $1-billion investment plan announced in April 2017. According to the plan, the company is slated to open five IBX data centers this year, one each at Sao Paulo, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Silicon Valley and Washington D.C. Apart from this, it also intends to make expansion at 14 of its existing data centers.In the last reported quarter, Equinix witnessed strong demand for cloud services from corporations interested in enhancing their networks. The company witnessed revenue growth across all three geographic regions and verticals. Robust growth in the global Colocation and Interconnection platforms gave a boost to the top line.We expect the momentum to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, consequentlyboosting its top-line performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.138 billion, up 23% year over year.AcquisitionsAcquisitions have been a major contributor to growth at Equinix. Worldwide, itowns 180 IBX data centers across 44 countries. The company hascompleted acquisition of Verizon Communications’s (VZ  -  Free Report) 29 data centers. The deal will expand its global reach by boosting operations in the United Statesand Latin America. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in United Statesis pegged at $543 million.Most recently, the company in a move to spread its European operations, completed the acquisition of an Istanbul-based data center from Zenium. The takeover will significantly expand Equinix’s presence in Turkey as well as Europe, where Zenium enjoys a significant presence.   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in Europe is pegged at $33 million. We believe that the deal will help the company reinforce its global footprint and bring in additional revenues.Also, the company had announced an agreement to acquire certain businesses — Itconic and its subsidiary CloudMas — from The Carlyle Group. The deal marks the company’s third European buyoutthis year. Notably, earlier this year, Equinix acquired IO UK's data center operating business in Slough, U.K.and ICT-Center AG’s Zurich-based data center operating business in Switzerland.All these acquisitions have made decent contributions toward total revenue growth.Equinix, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Equinix, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Equinix, Inc. QuoteHigh Debt Burden to Remain Overhang Escalating interest expenses due to increased debt burden may dampen the company’s profitability. It should be noted that at the end of second-quarter 2017, Equinix had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.068 billion, while the total debt principal outstanding was $9.37 billion as of Jun 30, 2017.Moreover, intensifying competition from established internet data center operators such as AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and CenturyLink Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report) may affect product pricing, consequentlydenting Equinix’s margins.However, we expect a year-over-year improvement in the bottom-line results, mainly due to higher top-line expectation. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at $4.69, up from the year-ago figure of 68 cents.Currently, Equinix carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

238,CTL,"The third-quarter 2017 earnings seasons is picking pace with results from 229 S&P 500 members, accounting for 48.1% of the index’s total market capitalization (based on our latest Earnings Outlook). Total earnings for these companies are up 7.7% from the same period last year on 5% higher revenues, with 75.5% beating EPS and 65.1% beating revenue estimates.Notably, 271 companies are yet to release their quarterly numbers. Total third-quarter earnings are expected to be up 4.1% from the prior-year quarter on 5.2% higher revenues.With this overview of the third-quarter 2017 earnings season, let’s look at the ongoing trends in the telecommunications industry. So far, we have results from four major telecommunication companies — Verizon Communications Inc (VZ  -  Free Report), AT&T Inc (T  -  Free Report), Sprint Corp (S  -  Free Report) and T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS  -  Free Report).Verizon and Sprint delivered mixed third-quarter financial results, with a massive gain of postpaid and prepaid wireless subscribers. T-Mobile US delivered strong third-quarter 2017 financial results with 1.329 million net customer addition, signifying the 18th successive quarter of over 1 million net customer additions. We believe that the company’s network modernization and integration efforts, unlimited data plans, promotional offers in both postpaid and prepaid plans have paid off in terms of the huge subscriber gain in the reported quarter.However, AT&T posted weak third-quarter 2017 financial results with 44.8% year-over-year fall in the net gain of postpaid wireless subscribers. The company also lost 89,000 video customers in the reported quarter due to cord-cutting.We appreciate the companies’ success in maintaining their subscriber gain momentum despite operating in a competitive and saturated domestic wireless market. But, we are concerned about the increasing competition from the online video streaming service providers, which have become a direct threat to the pay-TV businesses of these stocks.With such mixed thoughts, we keenly await results from other telecommunication stocks on Oct 30. We will study the fundamentals (both financial and non-financial metrics) of these stocks to aid investment decision.Stocks to Watch for Q3 Earnings on Oct 30Our quantitative model offers some insight into stocks that are about to report their earnings. Per the model, a stock needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, to deliver earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Meanwhile, we also caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Investors interested in the telecommunication stocks can watch out for the three companies that are expected to report their third-quarter 2017 numbers on Oct 30.SBA Communications (SBAC  -  Free Report), a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure in the United States, is slated to report after the closing bell.Improvement in revenues holds promise for SBA Communications’ segments. While revenues for the Site Leasing segment is estimated around $408 million by the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the same for Site Development segment is anticipated at $23.79 million. In the third quarter of 2017, Domestic Site Leasing revenues are expected at $330 million and International Site Leasing revenues are projected at $77 million.Per estimates, the company has plans to construct 114 towers and purchase 211 towers in the to-be-reported quarter. The company will acquire 52 domestic sites and 106 international sites in the said quarter. The increase in the number of towers and sites to be purchased portrays an improvement in the company’s operations.Moreover, the chances of this company beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the quarter under review are high. The company has an Earnings ESP of +12.00% (as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 28 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents). A favorable Earnings ESP indicates a positive earnings surprise. Moreover, SBA Communications currently has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of the ESP. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Notably, a positive Earnings ESP along with a Zacks Rank #3, makes us confident of an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter (read more: Can SBA Communications Deliver a Beat in Q3 Earnings?)CenturyLink Inc.’s (CTL  -  Free Report) Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter Business Segment - Data Integration revenues is pegged at $145 million, which is above $123 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. The same for Legacy Services revenues is pegged at $1,087 million, below the figure of $1,107 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. Strategic Services revenues are pegged at $972 million which is also below the $985 million reported in second-quarter 2017.Under the Consumer segment, the Legacy Services revenues are pegged at $623 million, below the figure of $633 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. Strategic Services revenues are at $769 million compared with the $768 million reported in second-quarter 2017.This leading U.S. regional wireline service provider displays a negative earnings surprise history, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters, with an average miss of 2.44%. Moreover, the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 45 cents.Despite a favorable Zacks Rank #3, the company’s 0.00% ESP dims the possibility of an earnings beat in the to-be reported quarter.For Level 3 Communications Inc. , improvement in revenues from different regions marks a major positive in terms of geographic expansion. The company’s North America, EMEA and Latin American operations account for a major portion of its organic core revenue growth. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company will generate $147 million from the Enterprise segment and $35.75 million from the Wholesale segment of Latin America.Meanwhile, EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) revenues are estimated at $176 million, with $108 million from the Wholesale channel, $13.95 million from the U.K. Government channel and $55 million from the Wholesale channel. Estimated revenues from Latin America and EMEA have been consistent with what was reported in the last quarter.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter North American Enterprise segment revenues is pegged at $1,210 million as against $1,192 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. The same for the Wholesale segment is at $405 million compared with $415 million reported in the second quarter of 2017.In the last quarter, Level 3 Communications delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.53%. Moreover, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters, with an average beat of 6.86%.Despite such favorable revenue growth, positive earnings surprise history and a favorable Zacks Rank #3, the chances of this company beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter are low. This is because the company’s 0.00% Earnings ESP (as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 38 cents) acts as a spoiler.All the above-mentioned telecommunications stocks are grouped under the broader Computer and Technology sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors).Irrespective of an earnings beat or miss, investors should focus on companies’ fundamentals to make investment decisions. Therefore, don’t forget to check our full write up on earnings releases of these stocks later.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

239,CTL,"Though last week wasn’t been too eventful for telecom companies, a few developments were worth noting.Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) is reportedly launching customer-friendly prepaid family plans to attract more subscribers. Prepaid lines include unlimited talk, text and data tiers along with 3GB, 7GB, 10GB and Unlimited data. Each data size is priced separately for the first line, followed by discounted rate from second to fifth lines to help cut down on costs.  With Verizon’s new service, customers can choose a single specific plan for each member of the family, enabling them to customize individual monthly data plans.Moreover, the U.S. telecom behemoth is reportedly merging its video-streaming service, Go 90, into other digital platforms. Go90’s primary content strategy is now focused on video content that slots between the less-than-10-minute clips, which dominate social media and the more-than-30-minute shows and films popular on SVODs (subscription video-on-demand) like Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), Hulu and Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report).Meanwhile, Verizon and T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) are offering latest versions of Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL to attract customers.

In April, Verizon introduced its unlimited prepaid plan with unlimited data, talk and text for $80 a month. Video streaming was limited up to 480p. The wireless prepaid industry is getting more competitive with every passing day. The industry is also struggling with saturation issues. The gap between prepaid and postpaid average revenue per user has narrowed significantly, forcing telecom biggies to turn their attention to domestic prepaid mobile service business.

Till date, almost 15% of Go90's content (mostly originals) has been distributed to AOL Video. AOL Inc. — a major player in the digital content and online advertising space — was acquired by Verizon in June 2015. Verizon has further plans to expand this effort to Yahoo's brands before the end of the year. In fact, the company is beginning to distribute Go90 content across some of its Oath brands. (Read more:  Verizon on Track to Merge Go90 Under Oath Brands)3.    On Oct 27, 2016, Qualcomm entered into a definitive agreement with the Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant NXP Semiconductors to buy it. In June 2017, the EC had launched a thorough investigation into the proposed acquisition. The EC will probe in depth to see if the deal will lead to higher prices, exclusion of rival chipset suppliers and reduced innovation in the semiconductor industry. The merged entity is likely to command strong market positions with an extensive portfolio of baseband chipsets and chips for near-field communications.

240,CTL,"CenturyLink Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report), a leading regional wireline service provider, is reportedly seeking permission from the U.S.  telecom regulator, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to conduct trials of fixed wireless spectrum bands in the range of 3.54 GHz to 3.70 GHz frequency band.The trial is aimed to check the utilization of wireless bands to provide better broadband services and further extend broadband services to those rural areas where it’s tough to make wireline facilities available. The testing seeks to understand the viability of new technologies in this band that may be useful in providing fixed broadband services.CenturyLink has also requested FCC to grant confidential treatment in relation to its trials. This is because the trials include confidential commercial information, technical data and trade secrets concerning CenturyLink services under development and related testing processes, all of which the company wants to customarily guard from public disclosure.Besides the trial of 3.4-3.7 GHz wireless spectrum bands, CenturyLink is looking to work with other providers rolling out future 5G wireless networks. CenturyLink is gearing up to align with 5G providers and other wireless providers aiming to bring higher speeds to customers at less costs. The service provider has also expressed its desire for any new partnerships under the Connect America Fund Phase II (CAF-II) program.CAF-II is an FCC reform initiative that promises to bring broadband to an estimated 23 million Americans in rural uncovered areas as the service has been deemed a necessity in today's technology environment.CenturyLink is not the only service provider trying to deploy fixed broadband wireless to accelerate rural broadband expansion. Other rural-centric providers like Frontier Communications Corp (FTR  -  Free Report), Consolidated Communications Holdings Inc (CNSL  -  Free Report) and Windstream Holdings Inc (WIN  -  Free Report) are also witnessing similar opportunities via the FCC’s CAF-II funds.Recent EventsThe much-hyped merger between CenturyLink and Level 3 Communications Inc  received regulatory approval from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), subject to outlined conditions, including court approval of certain provisions.However, the pending merger still awaits regulatory approval from the FCC and the California Public Utilities Commission, along with other customary closing conditions. The deal is anticipated to close in the third quarter of 2017, subject to customary regulatory approvals.Price Performance and Zacks RankIn the past month, shares of CenturyLink have rallied 9.1% compared with the industry’s increase of 5.4%.   Currently, CenturyLink is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

After meeting all of the CAF-I requirements in the third quarter of 2015, the company now looks to expand into new markets using the CAF-II funds.The $283 million under CAF-II was given to supply broadband services to over 6,50,000 rural locations that could not be reached previously, economically. Overall, Frontier remains on track with its CAF-II obligations.As of June 2017, Frontier has reached 40% of its target in nine states. They include Arizona, Connecticut, Georgia, Montana, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Washington and West Virginia. By 2017 end, Frontier claims to reach over 500,000 homes and businesses, while trying to explore all possible avenues for further expanding broadband in high-cost rural areas, including through the CAF Phase II Auction.Frontier is not the only service provider trying to deploy fixed broadband wireless to accelerate rural broadband expansion. Fellow rural-centric providers like CenturyLink Inc (CTL  -  Free Report), Consolidated Communications Holdings Inc (CNSL  -  Free Report) and Windstream Holdings Inc (WIN  -  Free Report) are also witnessing similar opportunities to conduct trials of fixed wireless spectrum in the range of 3.54-3.70 GHz frequency band.Allowing greater success connecting homes and businesses through obstructions such as trees and buildings is what make these spectrum bands perfect for rural areas as against 5 GHz and higher bands.Overall, the three service providers are on track to expand broadband services to more homes via the CAF-II program through these spectrum bands. In particular, the companies are in the process of investing more than $3 billion to provide broadband to more than a million homes and businesses (representing more than two and a half million Americans) each year as part of CAF-II programPrice Performance and Zacks RankIn the past month, shares of Frontier have declined 8.4% as against the industry‘s increase of 3.7%.  Currently, Frontier is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Recent EventsIn September, Frontier Communication sought permission from the FCC to retire copper networks in a portion of its Spencerport, New York, central office service area. The company wants to migrate its customer base in these regions to high-speed fiber-optic networks. All customers will be shifted to the FTTH (fiber-to-the-home) network architecture.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

Moreover, President Trump’s new tax code has boosted broad based gains for the markets. Such enthusiasm in investors over-shadowed the mass shooting incident at Las Vegas on Sunday evening — described by Trump as an act of “pure evil.” Meanwhile, Fed Presidents Neel Kashkari and Rob Kaplan cautioned the Fed to wait until inflation rate touches the 2% level, before hiking interest rates.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 22,557.60, gaining 0.7%.

This incident has been described as the worst shooting incident in the history of the United States since the terror attacks of September 11, 2001.Gun stocks surged following such an incident. Shares of Sturm Ruger (RGR  -  Free Report), American Outdoor Brands (AOBC  -  Free Report) and Olin (OLN  -  Free Report) rose 4%, 3% and 6%, respectively.Expectation of Trump’s Tax Reforms Keep Investors EnthusedIn an announcement last week, Trump and his aides unveiled new reforms in tax policies which effectively lower taxes on businesses and individuals. The proposal seeks to decrease the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%. Moreover, the pass-through business taxes — currently categorized under the individual tax code — would be slashed to 25%.Subsequently, the plan also revealed that the current seven personal tax slabs would be reduced to only three at 12%, 25% and 35%, respectively. This boosted gains for the broader markets as investors remained highly hopeful about the new tax code to be signed into law. This overshadowed the effect of the mass shooting incident at Las Vegas.Neel Kashkari Warned Fed not to Hike RatesOn Monday, the Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, cautioned the Fed not to be hasty in raising interest rates. He opined that Fed should wait until inflation reaches the targeted 2% level, before the rates are hiked. Kashkari happens to be one of the voting members of the Fed’s interest rate policy committee and had demurred Fed’s two rate hike this year, citing the same reason.Moreover, in a Q&A at the Fed’s El Paso branch, Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan also commented that the Fed should not hurry in raising interest rates and instead wait for the inflation rates to go up.Economic Data Construction Spending surged 0.5% in the month of August, surpassing the consensus estimate of an increase of 0.2% for the period.

CenturyLink currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Level 3 Communications is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Approval-Granting ConditionsAs per the statutory decisions, the combined entity plans to divest certain Level 3 Communications’ metro network assets and certain dark fiber assets. These divestitures will not affect the pro-forma operating revenue and operating cash flows of the combined company. Notably, Level 3 Communications is one of the largest Internet provider in the world and the leading U.S. fiber-optic network service provider.The combined company is required to divest Level 3 Communications’ metro network assets in three metro areas which include Albuquerque, NM; Boise, ID and Tucson, AZ. The combined company will continue to serve all current Level 3 Communications’ customers unless they choose to be served by the buyer of divested assets in each metro area.CenturyLink retains all of its existing networks and business operations in these three metro areas. The company will continue to provide a full suite of telecommunications and data services to residential and business customers.The clause also states that the combined company will divest 24 strands of dark fiber, which will connect 30 specified city-pairs across the country. Presently, the fibers are not being used for any commercial purpose. Hence, this divestiture will not affect any current customers or services.  The Pending DealThe proposed merger, which was announced in November 2016, has already received approvals from almost 24 states and territories. The combined company will offer customers a broader and more complementary range of services and solutions, and enable the advanced technology and growing bandwidth needs of its business, government and consumer customers.The completion of the proposed merger will increase CenturyLink's network by 200,000 route miles of fiber including 64,000 route miles in 350 metropolitan areas and 33,000 subsea route miles connecting multiple continents. CenturyLink's on-net buildings are expected to increase nearly 75% to approximately 75,000. This includes 10,000 buildings in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and Latin America. Therefore, the merged entity will become a formidable challenger to their peers.Meanwhile, CenturyLink and Level 3 Communications are also struggling to maintain their business momentum owing to severe competitive threats from large telecom operators like Verizon Communications Inc (VZ  -  Free Report), AT&T Inc (T  -  Free Report) and Comcast Corp (CMCSA  -  Free Report).The total deal size is approximately $34 billion including debt. The equity value of this deal is approximately $25 billion. The combined entity is likely to generate $975 million of annual cash synergies. The new company will be a formidable force in the fiber-based metro-Ethernet and Internet market. Price PerformanceIn the past month, shares of CenturyLink have declined 3.4% as against the industry’s increase of 2.1%. Meanwhile, shares of Level 3 Communications have lost 1.7% compared with the industry’s decline of 2.3%.  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

(CTL  -  Free Report) have also decided to migrate to fiber-based network from copper.At the recently concluded Goldman Sachs 26th Annual Communacopia Conference, Verizon’s chairman and CEO Lowell McAdam stated that the company is no longer interested in acquiring big cable MSOs (multi service operators). Instead, it will strengthen its fiber-based networks. In the cities of Boston and Sacramento, Verizon has already started upgrading the city’s aging copper network infrastructure with fiber and wireless network to support high-end mobile and wireline services for smart city, residential and business applications.Meanwhile, in August 2017, Verizon stated that it would spend $225 million to acquire a high-capacity fiber network in the Chicago area belonging to WideOpenWest Inc. (WOW  -  Free Report). Verizon has been leasing this fiber network, which provides connectivity to more than 1,000 cell sites of different scales.Price Performance of VerizonVerizon’s shares have increased 7.75%, outperforming the industry’s gain of a mere 1% over the past 90 days.

250,CTL,"Although most major telecom stocks lost value in the last week, the sector witnessed a number of important events.Securing mobile devices has become important in recent years as the number of devices in operation and their purpose have expanded drastically. Despite such high-level securities and safe-guarding options, hackers can engineer passwords from users, leaving consumers and enterprises vulnerable to identity theft, bank fraud and fraudulent purchases and data theft.To address such issues, four major wireless carriers – Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) and Sprint Corp. (S  -  Free Report) – are teaming up to provide a new method of mobile security solution through the creation of Mobile Authentication Taskforce. This mobile authentication solution will be offered to consumers and enterprises in 2018.Two important developments have taken place in the merger and acquisition front. Per a recent report by Forbes, U.S. mobile chipset giant, Qualcomm Inc.’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) proposed acquisition of Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report) is facing a few problems. Per the report, hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. and two other large shareholders of NXP have approached the company to renegotiate the terms of the deal, which they consider grossly undervalued. Moreover, in June 2017, the telecom regulatory body of the European Union, the European Commission (EC), launched a thorough investigation into the proposed acquisition.Meanwhile, CenturyLink Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report) has postponed the closing of the Level 3 Communications Inc.  acquisition till the end of October. This is because the much-hyped merger between CenturyLink and Level 3 Communications is still awaiting approvals from the State of California, the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission.Two important developments have also taken place in the new plan offering on the part of wireless operators. T-Mobile US is making its unlimited postpaid wireless service, T-Mobile ONE, more attractive with the inclusion of services from online video streaming service provider, Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report).On the other hand, AT&T is extending its free HBO offer to its new and existing wireless customers on its Unlimited Choice plan. The company is targeting customers who purchase a combo of wireless and video services. While doing so, AT&T plans to not only put a check on the postpaid churn rates but also plans to boost revenues from its wireless business.Broadband communications and video services provider, Altice USA Inc. (ATUS  -  Free Report) and business software & services provider, Amdocs Ltd. (DOX  -  Free Report) recently announced the extension of their partnership. The companies have inked a multi-year deal to expand their key business and operational support systems.Outside the United States., Mexican telecom behemoth America Movil SAB (AMX  -  Free Report) recently received regulatory approval from Argentina's National Communications Agency (Enacom) to enter into the pay-TV market of that country. Notably, the company has already established both wireless and wireline operators in Argentina.

Wireless operators have decided to combine their respective technologies and resources to develop an advanced, mobile authentication solution. This solution is expected to help reduce mobile identity risks by analyzing data and activity patterns on a mobile network using network-based device authentication, geo-location and SIM card recognition. They intend to use this information to predict the identity of the user. In simpler words, they are aiming to improve the already existing two-factor authentication (2FA) security with some add-ons.

The company has a strong clientele serving more than 25,000 customers through its direct sales channel and global network of distribution channel partners. The combined entity of Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors is expected to generate annual revenues of more than $30 billion. (Read more: Is Qualcomm's Merger With NXP Semiconductors Facing Trouble?)3. In November 2016, CenturyLink entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Level 3 Communications in a cash and stock transaction. The combined entity is likely to generate $975 million of annual cash synergies. If the proposed merger finally materializes, it will increase CenturyLink's network by 200,000 route miles of fiber including 64,000 route miles in 350 metropolitan areas and 33,000 subsea route miles connecting multiple continents. (Read more:  CenturyLink Defers Level 3 Communications Acquisition)4. For customers that already have Netflix accounts, T-Mobile US has promised to cover the cost of subscription — a deal that’s worth $120 every year. The promotion is part of what the company calls its “Un-carrier” strategy, which is an effort to challenge mobile carrier conventions. The latest offering is one of the several low-priced service plans and promotional moves which T-Mobile US has undertaken to lure more subscribers from competitors like AT&T and Verizon. (Read more:  T-Mobile US' Unlimited Plan to Offer Free Netflix)5. Post-paid churn is one of the most important metrics in the wireless industry. It denotes the percentage of subscribers in a given time frame that cease to use the company's services for one reason or another. Post-paid subscribers are the largest revenue segment for major domestic wireless telecom companies. They have a significant lifetime value for these companies. The lower the churn rate, the better the outlook is for the company.

252,CTL,"On Sep 7, we issued an updated research report on Telecom service provider, Cincinnati Bell Inc. (CBB  -  Free Report). Cincinnati Bell continues to experience erosion in high margin local access lines. With Digital Subscriber Line and cable modems gaining widespread acceptance, customers are deactivating the extra phone lines that were used to access the Internet via dial-up modem.In addition, the company is confronting competitive threats from local cable operators that aggressively deploy local phone service besides television. This has already resulted in the loss of major business customers. Moreover, improved housing market in Greater Cincinnati has led residents to switch homes, thus increasing multi-tenant Fioptics churn.Going forward, intense competition in this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s operational region can be a drag on its pricing power, which might induce downward pressure on its margins.In the second quarter of 2017, the company reported lower-than-expected earnings per share. Quarterly adjusted earnings per share were 7 cents (excluding special items), which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Operating income was $20.9 million compared with $27.4 million in the year-ago quarter.Markedly, the company has an unimpressive earnings history. Also, it has failed to outpace the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters.Furthermore, Cincinnati Bell faced opposition to its Local Area Service discontinuation within the Kentucky region, from consumers and industry groups, citing concerns over the shutdown of plain old telephone service. CenturyLink Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report) and Windstream Holdings, Inc. (WIN  -  Free Report) also faced similar issues from consumers and clients regarding their requests to liquidate Frame Relay and small to medium-sized business digital subscriber line services.Though shares of Cincinnati Bell have gained 5.4% it failed to beat the industry’s growth of 6.8%, over the last six months.Stock to Consider                          Investors interested in the broader Utilities sector may consider TELUS Corp.

253,CTL,"CenturyLink Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report) recently unveiled Dedicated Cloud Compute (DCC) Foundation, which is an updated version of private cloud service.This enhanced cloud service is currently moving to a converged, software-defined data center (SDDC) model, based on VMware, Inc.’s (VMW  -  Free Report) Cloud Foundation and Hewlett Packard Enterprise ProLiant server.

254,CTL,"On Aug 25, one of the leading regional wireline service providers in the United States, CenturyLink Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report), was downgraded to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Shares of the company have underperformed the industry’s gain in the last month. The stock price decreased 12.3%, as against the industry’s gain of 2.6% in the same period.Meanwhile, the company continues to face depreciation in its access lines on an organic basis. As a result, CenturyLink’s core local phone business has slowed down significantly.As of Jun 30, 2017, total access lines were 10.733 million, down 5.95% year over year. This decline was mainly due to the substitution of traditional wireline telephone services by wireless and other competitive offerings, and lower long-distance minutes of use.Additionally, decrease in subsidy payments by the Federal Universal Service Fund, tough competition, federal regulations and labor union issues remain headwinds.Notably, the dynamics of the communication industry are significantly governed by technological innovations. Therefore, changes in technology compel large investments that can dilute cash flow. This could substantially impact its ability to meet debts and other obligations. Alternatively, if CenturyLink fails to adopt new technology or network upgrades, it might result in greater subscriber loss to larger competitors, going forward.CenturyLink’s cash and liquidity position seems to be a major concern for the company. In fact, accumulating high debt levels and decreasing cash flows may pose threat to the company's margins in the near term.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Computer and Technology sector may consider better-ranked stocks like Arista Networks, Inc. (ANET  -  Free Report), America Movil SAB (AMX  -  Free Report) and I.D. Systems, Inc. (IDSY  -  Free Report).

256,CTL,"Per a recent report by, Leichtman Research Group Inc. (LRG), the cable multi-service operators (MSOs) in the U.S. have successfully maintained their lead over telecom operators in the high-speed broadband (internet) market. This comes as a respite, especially at a time when cable TV operators have been losing their foothold in the core video market to fiber-based telecom operators and online video streaming service providers.According to data compiled by LRG, 14 prime cable TV and telecom operators jointly had approximately 94.1 million high-speed internet subscribers at the end of the second quarter of 2017, representing more than 95% of the country’s total broadband market. Of the count cited, cable MSOs commanded nearly 59.91 million subscribers (63.6%) while the remaining 34.24 million customers (36.8%) were serviced by telecom operators.Nevertheless, the LRG report also stated that despite strong showing, the growth rate of residential high-speed internet for the cable TV industry has actually declined significantly year over year in the second quarter of 2017. Per LRG, the top seven U.S. cable MSOs added a net 461,997 high-speed broadband customers in the second quarter of 2017, a significant deceleration of 16.5% year over year.In the second quarter of 2017, the top two cable MSOs, namely, Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) added 267,000 and 175,000 high-speed broadband subscribers, respectively.

Moreover, the strong presence of online video streaming providers is posing a significant threat to the existing pay-TV business model. Video offering, which represented the core business function of cable TV operators, seems to be slipping out of their hands fast.However, of late, with the deployment of the next-generation DOCSIS 3.0 and DOCSIS 3.1 technologies, cable TV operators have extensively penetrated into the high-speed internet market. In an attempt to capitalize on this technology, leading cable TV operators are increasingly emphasizing on the broadband market.

257,CTL,"A successful portfolio manager is aware of the importance of having well-performing stocks in one’s portfolio. Indicators of a stock’s consistent performance include a rise in share price and strong fundamentals.One such stock that investors need to hold on to right now is Equinix Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report). Though there are a few concerns, these are short lived. The stock has the potential to perform well in the long run.Equinix’s share price movement has been quite encouraging. Year to date, its shares have gained 25.9%, while the industry to which it belongs to recorded a decline of 7.7%.What’s Driving Equinix?Equinix is a global provider of network-neutral data centers and internet exchange services for enterprises, content companies, systems integrators and network service providers. The company is on a growth trajectory, gathering momentum from its positive earnings surprise history and robust fundamentals.It delivered a positive earnings surprise in three out of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 5.5%.Last quarter, Equinix reported solid year-over-year improvement in revenues as well as earnings. The year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by strong booking activity, Equinix's global platform, continued enterprise momentum and the acquisition of 29 Verizon data centers. Equinix witnessed revenue growth across all three geographic regions and verticals. Equinix, Inc. Price and Consensus Equinix, Inc. Price and Consensus | Equinix, Inc. Quote Acquisitions have been a major contributor to growth at Equinix. The company has made several moves for expanding its data center capacity in many of its key markets since 2003. In Dec 2016, it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 24 data center sites, including 29 data center buildings in operation across 15 metro areas, from Verizon Communications (VZ  -  Free Report), for a total cash consideration of $3.6 billion.Bottom LineExpansion in important markets and consolidation of facilities in existing ones are important parts of Equinix's core strategy. The company strives to boost its revenue base as well as profitability, by offering upgraded technology to clients. Moreover, its recurring revenue model has provided the much-needed support to the company's revenue stream over the years. The company's cloud and IT service businesses are its fastest growing segments, and account for roughly one fourth of its total revenue.Further, Equinix remains positive on the growing demand for data centers. To meet the rising demand for cloud services, this global interconnection and data center company is expanding its IBX data centers globally, and gaining popularity among tech companies looking for data management. Thus, the company expects its total addressable market for retail data centers to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8% from 2013 to 2017 and reach $24.0 billion. Based on this, Equinix projects revenue growth rate of 10% through 2017.Additionally, the company’s earnings are projected to grow 15.3% in the long term and it has a Growth Style Score of B.Nonetheless, we are slightly concerned about the company’s growing debt burden, which will affect operating results as interest expense are likely to go up. Moreover, intensifying competition from established internet data center operators such as AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and CenturyLink Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report) may affect product pricing, thereby denting Equinix’s margins.Equinix has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

259,CTL,"U.S. telecom behemoth, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), has teamed up with online retailing giant, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) to deliver virtual network services at a global scale. The partnership is aimed to help enterprises and government agencies manage the performance and security of their cloud-based transactions. Recently, Verizon unveiled its plans regarding the availability of its Virtual Network Services (VNS) on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform, a subsidiary of Amazon.com.AWS provides on-demand cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies and governments to run applications using compute, storage and database services on a pay-as-you-go basis. Verizon’s VNS, launched last year, virtualizes services like WAN routing, security and WAN optimization using network functions virtualization (NFV) and software-defined networking (SDN) technologies. NFV and SDN are two approaches to simplifying networks through virtualization.We believe that the availability of VNS on AWS will complement Verizon’s vision and investment in the SDN and NFV ecosystem by enabling global enterprise customers to securely connect, deploy and manage virtual networks. Further, the offering will help the company’s enterprise customers to balance agility, performance, cost and security necessitated by the growth of mobile-to-cloud applications and the Internet of Things (IoT).A Report from the telecommunications market research and consulting firm, Infonetics Research (now acquired by IHS Markit Ltd.) states that the NFV and SDN hardware and software market will expand from less than $500 million in 2013 to over $11 billion in 2018, globally.Verizon’s venturing into the AWS cloud follows the selling of its cloud services businesses, Terremark (acquired in 2011) to International Business Machines Corporation (IBM  -  Free Report) in Mar 2017. Failure in achieving the status of a major cloud and data center player, led to this shift in focus.Verizon isn’t the only telco provider to move away from the cloud space. AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), CenturyLink, Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report) and many others are making similar efforts. AWS’ dominance as the market leader in the data center and cloud services market, is a major player to compete with. Per a Synergy Research firm report, AWS holds around 33% of the worldwide market share. Other major cloud infrastructure service providers that are competing head-to-head with AWS include Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), International Business Machines Corporation, Alibaba and Oracle.Zacks Rank and Price Performance Over the last three months, shares of Verizon have inched up 7.48%, outperforming the 2.48% gain of the industry  it belongs to.

260,CTL,"CenturyLink Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report), a leading regional wireline service provider in the U.S, is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Aug 2, after market closes.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 1.89%. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 0.79%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayThe price performance of CenturyLink has been depressing over the last three months. The stock lost 7%, whereas the industry declined 0.2% over the same time frame.The company continues to face persistent losses in its access lines and legacy voice services on an organic basis. This is primarily because, in addition to large telecommunications providers, the company faces intense competition from cable TV operators and other wireless companies that aggressively offer traditional voice service over their networks. Improvements in the quality of VoIP services have enabled cable TV, internet, and telephone companies to offer services at attractive price points.Decline in subsidy payments by the Federal Universal Service Fund, tough competition, federal regulations, labor union issues and the need to upgrade technology remain headwinds. CenturyLink unveiled disappointing guidance for certain important metrics for the second quarter of 2017 compared with the last reported outlook for the first quarter of 2017.However, the company remains focused on establishing itself as a global leader in cloud infrastructure and hosted IT solutions arena for enterprise customers. Recently, it unveiled a beta version of its over-the-top (OTT) TV service. By foraying into this space, the company has joined the likes of DISH Network Corp.’s (DISH  -  Free Report) Sling TV and AT&T Inc.’s (T  -  Free Report) DirecTV Now. Moreover, CenturyLink is investing in fiber-to-the-tower (FTTT) expansion and has expanded its fiber-based backhaul services.Earnings Whispers      Our proven model does not conclusively show that CenturyLink is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: CenturyLink has an Earnings ESP of -2.04%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 48 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands higher at 49 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CenturyLink has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s -2.04% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.CenturyLink, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  CenturyLink, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | CenturyLink, Inc. QuoteStock to ConsiderVishay Intertechnology, Inc. (VSH  -  Free Report) from the broader industry has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat when it expectedly reports second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3. The company has an Earnings ESP of +6.06% and a Zacks Rank #1.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

262,CTL,"Telephone and Data Systems Inc. (TDS  -  Free Report), a leading regional wireline voice and video service provider, is forging ahead with plans to expand its business in the fiber space. Toward this end, the company’s wireline subsidiary, TDS Telecommunications Corporation (""TDS Telecom""), is inking deals with various fiber providers and cable companies.Moreover, TDS Telecommunications plans to leverage different government programs like Connect America model (A-CAM) and its own capital to expand its fiber network within the existing ILEC (incumbent local exchange carrier) territory and other nearby markets.Vicki Villacrez, SVP of finance and CFO for TDS Telecommunications, stated (during the company’s second-quarter earnings call) that these programs are part of a broader platform it is implementing to equip more of its network with fiber.Buyouts to Expand Fiber Network TDS Broadband Service LLC (operated by TDS Telecom) recently inked a deal to acquire Central Oregon-based Crestview Cable Communications. If this proposed acquisition goes through, it will add more than 21,000 service addresses to the adjacent BendBroadband system, which the telco acquired in 2014. Moreover, this deal goes well with its plans to invest in and expand its FTTH (fiber-to-the-home) footprint in key communities such as La Pine. Per the agreement, the company will enhance broadband speed and modernize its video products in Prineville and across the larger Crestview footprint.The financial terms of the transaction have not yet been disclosed and are subject to regulatory approvals by federal and local bodies. The company is looking forward to three main regulatory approvals, which include Local franchise authority approvals, FCC approval of assignment of Cable Television Relay Service (CARS) license and consents to assignment of various agreements, since the transaction is an asset purchase one.The service provider is also acquiring regional assets like Wisconsin-based Sun Prairie Utilities' (SPU) telecom assets to accelerate fiber-based broadband coverage.  Sun Prairie Utilities serves 242 residents and 31 businesses.In Feb 2017, the company completed the purchase of internet service provider, InterLinx Communications LLC and its unit Tonaquint Networks LLC based in Southern Utah, U.S. The deal added more than 170 route miles of fiber-optic transport of InterLinx to TDS Broadband Services.Although the initial focus of these deals is to serve more residential customers and foster business growth within the city, TDS Telecommunication is exploring business opportunities. These business moves highlight the company’s efforts to diversify its business model from a telecom service provider to fiber provider.Winding UpTelephone and Data Systems is looking for lucrative opportunities to bring more fiber in order to better address services, both in its current footprint and adjacent areas. By leveraging on fiber, the telco is trying to respond to customers' growing TV and broadband service demand. At the end of the reported second-quarter 2017, the service provider claimed to have expanded about 19% of its network route miles with fiber.The telco’s fiber network investments are also driving positive results in consumer services like Internet Protocol TV (IPTV). Its IPTV connections grew 12.1% year over year to 46,200, with a net addition of 5,000 connections compared with the prior year. Additionally, the service provider is witnessing more customers opting to purchase higher speeds, including 1 Gbps, in its FTTH-enabled markets.Zacks Rank and Price PerformanceTelephone and Data Systems currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.

270,CTL,"Telephone and Data Systems Inc. (TDS  -  Free Report), a leading regional wireline voice and video service provider in the U.S., is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 4, before market opens.Last quarter, the company posted a remarkable positive earnings surprise of 3200.00%. Moreover, earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 802.41%.The price performance of Telephone and Data Systems was impressive for the last three months. The stock returned 10.7% against the 8% gain of its industry.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayTelephone and Data Systems continues to compete with the likes of CenturyLink Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report) and Frontier Communications Corp. (FTR  -  Free Report), to name a few. The company’s wireless division – United States Cellular Corp. – also operates in an intensely competitive wireless market and remains significantly challenged by the offering of service plans from lower-cost mobile operators.Roaming revenue woes, costs of network integration and construction of new cell sites, aggressive equipment pricing, wireless technology upgrades and spectrum licensing will have a negative effect on the company’s finances.However, Telephone and Data Systems’ efforts to reward its shareholders with a second-quarter 2017 dividend of 15.5 cents per Common Share and Series A Common Share are impressive. The dividend was paid on Jun 30, 2017, to shareholders of record as of Jun 16, 2017.The company is experiencing strong smartphone demand at its wireless wing – U.S. Cellular. We believe the long-term higher ARPU from smartphone users and full utilization of LTE network capacity on the back of migration of customers from 3G to 4G networks are expected to mitigate the operating cost headwinds arising from higher subsidies on smartphones.Telephone and Data Systems is striving hard to expand its business in the managed hosting and cloud service market. Launch of Shared Data plans for consumers and businesses at nominal prices have helped it gain consumers. The company's IPTV is also doing considerably well.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Telephone and Data Systems is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Telephone and Data Systems has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 5 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The Company has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Telephone and Data Systems, Inc.

Moreover, earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the previous four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 24.11%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayStiff competition from peers like Lantronix, Inc. in the cut-throat digital optical networking market raises concerns and might hamper the company’s quarterly performance.The stock has registered growth of 18.3% against the industry’s decline of 7.2% over the past three months.However, Infinera’s strategic business moves are impressive. These include new launches and alliances. Different network service providers are merging with the company for the deployment of the Infinera Cloud Xpress, both regionally and globally, to reach out to customers with higher scalability and more reliability.The company recently launched the XTM II, a next-generation packet-optical platform delivering rich Layer 0, Layer 1 and Layer 2 services with high density, low latency and low power consumption. It is optimized for bandwidth-intensive cloud-scale applications at the metro edge.Infinera’s decision to power, cloud-scale networks should boost its cloud suite. This is likely to help the company improve its top line in the to-be-reported quarter and lend it a competitive edge.Earlier this year, Infinera collaborated with CenturyLink, Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report) to deliver 2.5 terabits per second (Tb/s) of super-channel transmission capacity in order to support SCinet at the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC16).Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Infinera is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

272,CTL,"Telecom service provider, Cincinnati Bell Inc. (CBB  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter financial numbers on Aug 4, before market opens.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 75%. Cincinnati Bell has failed to outpace estimates in two of the past four quarters, with an average earnings miss of 10.42%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderThe price performance of Cincinnati Bell has not been impressive over the past three months. The stock has lost 2.6% against the industry’s gain of 3.3%.Continuous erosion in local access lines, heavy capital expenditure, legal hurdles, and a weakening cash and liquidity position are headwinds for the company. Cincinnati Bell faced opposition from consumers and industry groups in its Local Area Service (LAS) discontinuation within the Kentucky region, citing concerns over the shutdown of POTS (Plain Old Telephone Services). CenturyLink Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report) and Windstream Holdings, Inc. (WIN  -  Free Report) have faced similar issues from consumers and clients regarding their requests to liquidate Frame Relay and small-to-medium-sized business digital subscriber-line services.However, the company’s efforts to transform itself from a legacy copper-based telecommunications company to an IT firm with contemporary fiber assets are commendable.  Recently, Cincinnati Bell announced that it will buy Hawaiian Telcom Inc. and OnX Enterprise Solutions for $650 million and $201 million, respectively, in order to expand its network and enterprise IT services.

273,CTL,"In order to settle an investigation relating to two call outages in 2017 to emergency number 911, AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) has decided to pay a fine of approximately $5.3 million to the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”). The company has also pledged to take corrective actions to avoid recurrence of the incidents that have hurt its credibility.The outages pertain to two separate events, one in March 2017 that lasted about five hours and the other in May that lasted 47 minutes. While the first incident affected 12,600 unique users, the second affected 2,600, preventing them to make emergency calls to 911. When the charges were levied against AT&T, FCC investigation revealed that the outages were the result of its planned network changes inadvertently interfering with the routing of 911 calls.The FCC further accused the company of failing to clearly notify all the affected users about the cause of the outage after the March incident. Throughout the review proceedings, AT&T actively cooperated with the federal regulator and acknowledged its shortcomings. The company also vouched to provide round-the-clock access to emergency call routing services to 911 and remains committed to its customers.  AT&T is not the only telecommunications firm that has agreed to pay settlement charges to the FCC. In April 2014, several carriers were involved in an outage that affected 11 million users. These included Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) and CenturyLink, Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report) among others. While Verizon agreed to a pay a fine of $3.4 million for a six-hour 911 outage that affected about 750,000 consumers in California, CenturyLink paid $16 million. An FCC probe had revealed that the outage was caused by a preventable software coding error at a call management center in Colorado.T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) was another casualty in this sphere, with two separate outages in August 2014 affecting about 50 million customers. It agreed to pay a fine of $17.5 million to the FCC to amicably settle the issue.AT&T has underperformed the industry in the past year with an average loss of 15.7% compared with a decline of 6.6% for the latter.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is likely to script a turnaround in the future with the successful integration of Time Warner assets like HBO, CNN and TNT.

276,CTL,"In the last five trading days, telecom stocks declined initially but made a steady ascent on some radical policy decisions and game-changing merger news that is likely to redefine the sector dynamics.Last week, the ZTE settlement plans, which included a $1 billion fine and overhaul of its leadership among other conditions, were made public. The strategic move gave a lifeline to the beleaguered firm of China that depended on the supply of several components from U.S. companies to manufacture products. However, the seven-year ban on the company’s products that threatened its survival and crippled operations is yet to be lifted until it pays the fine and places $400 million more in escrow in a U.S.-approved bank.Meanwhile, the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) is striving to free up spectrum for the 5G launch of domestic telecom companies and is mulling to utilize the C-band satellite spectrum, specifically a 500 MHz swath from 3.7 to 4.2 GHz that satellite operators use. Intelsat and SES — two U.S. operators that own more than 90% of this spectrum — have together pledged to yield 100 MHz of the band for 5G use in exchange for appropriate compensation by mobile network operators. The FCC intends to vote in July on ways to open up the spectrum.The FCC also took another major policy decision when it repealed the net neutrality rules put in place by former president Barack Obama in 2015. It argued that the decision will help Internet service providers to significantly invest in the field to boost consumer experience. Service providers are now free to block, slow down, or speed up access to some web sites on the Internet —  a preferential treatment vastly detested by net neutrality proponents.   Regarding company-specific news, technology collaborations, acquisitions and a historic victory against the Department of Justice that paved the way for a strategic merger within the sector ruled the roost over the last five trading days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    AT&T (T  -  Free Report) has received green signal from the court to go ahead with its proposed deal to buy the mass media and entertainment conglomerate, Time Warner for $85 billion.With assets like HBO, CNN and TNT, the deal will allow the power packed combination of AT&T’s data and Time Warner’s content to create new kinds of online videos and sell targeted advertisements to counter Verizon Communications Inc.’s (VZ  -  Free Report) Yahoo and AOL businesses.

Shares have lost about 2.5% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is CTL due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.CenturyLink Q1 Earnings Top Estimates, Revenues MissCenturyLink reported mixed financial results for the first quarter of 2018, the first full quarter of operations following the acquisition of Level 3.    Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, net income for the reported quarter came in at $115 million or 11 cents per share compared with $163 million or 30 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year decrease in earnings despite higher revenues was primarily driven by higher operating expenses. The company’s adjusted earnings were 25 cents per share, which comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents.RevenuesTotal operating revenues increased 41% year over year to $5,945 million, due to incremental revenues from Level 3. The top line, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,963 million.Operating MetricsQuarterly operating expenses totaled $5,195 million, up 45% year over year. Operating income improved 19% to $750 million. Operating income margin was 12.6% compared with 15% in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $2,074 million from $2,140 million in the year-ago quarter, due to an increase in payroll taxes and integration-related expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 34.9% compared with 35.4% in the prior-year quarter.    As of Jan 1, 2018, the company adopted the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606. Overall, the adoption of this new standard negatively affected total revenues by approximately $15 million in the quarter, with $5 million in Business and $10 million in Consumer.Q1 Segmental PerformanceTotal revenues from Business segment were $4,383 million compared with Pro Forma revenues of $4,429 million in the year-ago quarter. The sales figure was affected by slower sales and the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.  Consumer segment revenues were $1,379 million compared with Pro Forma revenues of $1,447 million in the first quarter of 2017.

Free cash flow after dividends is projected between $0.85 billion and $1.05 billion. Capital expenditures are likely to be around 16% of revenues.However, the company has reduced its outlook for depreciation and amortization to $5.1-$5.3 billion from $5.4-$5.5 billion, due to valuation adjustments related to purchase price accounting. It received an anticipated tax refund of $314 million after the close of the just reported quarter.Positioned as one of the world's leading network providers, management believes that there are significant opportunities to grow business and drive long-term shareholder value. It remains focused on sales force integration and driving profitable revenue growth while improving customer experience.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.

280,CTL,"Investors in CenturyLink, Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 15, 2018 $16.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for CenturyLink shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, CenturyLink is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Wireless National industry that ranks in the Bottom 20% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, six analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 18 cents per share to 23 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about CenturyLink right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

281,CTL,"In the last five trading days, telecom stocks declined initially and traded flat thereafter only to decline further as concerns related to the U.S-China trade war resumed in a dramatic turn of events.Last week, President Trump revealed that the U.S. administration reached a settlement on ZTE as part of the ongoing trade talks between the two warring countries. This included a fine of $1.3 billion against ZTE, restructuring of its management and hiring of American compliance officers at the company. In return, the Commerce Department lifted the seven-year ban on the Chinese firm related to the purchase of components from U.S. manufacturers that threatened its survival and crippled operations.Just when it appeared that things were working toward reducing the United States’ negative balance of trade against China, President Donald Trump flip-flopped on his trade policy and renewed threats to impose 25% tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods to retaliate against unfair trade practices. Some industry observers believe that the tactic is part of Trump’s broader plan to gain leverage in the trade talks as Commerce department secretary Wilbur Ross is scheduled to visit China later this week. However, the volte-face could derail the trade negotiations as China vouched to counter the move with similar restrictions.  Regarding company-specific news, improved product launches for superior connectivity and high-quality content to subscribers at lower cost of ownership, and technology collaborations ruled the roost over the last five trading days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    CenturyLink, Inc.

286,CTL,"Over the last five trading days, though telecom stocks initially witnessed a steep rise as U.S.-China trade concerns abated, concerns over the implications of Senate’s approval to retain net neutrality played spoilsport.Last week, President Trump made a sudden turnabout by acknowledging in a Twitter post that he was working with the Chinese President Xi Jinping to give ZTE “a way to get back into business, fast”, after its operations crippled following a seven-year ban on sale of various components for illegally shipping goods to Iran. Industry experts believed that the strategic move by one of the most vocal supporters of national security and job protectionism was probably aimed at gaining much in return as various U.S. firms depended on China for their survival. They opined that ZTE was perhaps used as a pawn to seek favorable trade concessions like annulment of proposed tariffs on American agricultural exports and free access to the Chinese markets.As concerns across the global borders subsided, domestic issues came to the forefront when the U.S. Senate voted in favor of reversing the FCC decision in December to repeal landmark 2015 net neutrality rules by a margin of 52 to 47. This offered a level playing field for all Internet providers to ensure free and open Internet to all users and provide equal access to Web content by barring broadband service providers from favoring any particular content. However, uncertainty remains over whether the U.S. House of Representatives will at all vote on the issue as the White House is reportedly opposed to repealing the December FCC order.Regarding company-specific news, earnings of some telecom companies along with push for increased coverage for 5G technology topped the charts. The industry’s earnings in general were on strong footing backed by healthy growth dynamics thanks to the existing secular trends in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and Big Data.  Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    CenturyLink, Inc.

The year-over-year improvement can primarily be attributable to impressive growth in revenues generated by its enterprise technology during the quarter.Ubiquiti reported revenues of $250.4 million, which lies within the company’s projected range of $245-$260 million.

Before fees and expenses, FGD seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones Global Select Dividend Index.This Index is an indicated annual dividend yield weighted index of 100 stocks selected from the developed-market portion of the Dow Jones World Index.Cost & Other ExpensesSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.58%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 4.03%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund.

(GES  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 15.31% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskFGD has lost about -0.59% so far this year, and as of 05/08/2018, was up about 7.83% in the last one year. In the past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $24.68 and $28.07.The fund has a beta of 0.88 and standard deviation of 15.00% for the trailing three-year period, which makes FGD a low choice in this particular space.

However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares MSCI ACWI ETF (ACWI  -  Free Report) tracks MSCI All Country World Index and the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT  -  Free Report) tracks FTSE Global All Cap Index.

Revenues were mainly driven by strong demand for cloud services from corporations and benefits from Equinix's global platform. The company witnessed revenue growth across all three geographic regions and verticals.Additionally, the company’s recurring revenue model and current expansion plans are encouraging. In April 2017, it announced a billion-dollar aggressive expansion plan, which includes unveiling data centers, acquisitions and expansion of existing facilities. Further, the company provided encouraging revenue guidance for the second quarter and full-year 2018.Nevertheless, we are concerned about the company’s growing debt burden, which would adversely affect the operating results as interest expenses would go up. Further, intensifying competition from established Internet data-center operators such as AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and CenturyLink Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report) might impact product pricing while consequently denting margins. A highly leveraged balance sheet and industry consolidation add to its woes.Equinix carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

297,CTL,"CenturyLink, Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report) recently gained approval from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for the divesture of certain fiber network assets of erstwhile Level 3 Communications in Albuquerque, NM and Boise, ID.CenturyLink had earlier inked an agreement with the DOJ for the sale of Level 3 Communications’ fiber network assets in Albuquerque, Boise and Tucson related to DOJ’s approval for the buyout of Level 3 Communications. We remind investors that on Nov 1, 2017, CenturyLink had completed the acquisition of Level 3 Communications.CenturyLink plans to vend the assets in the Albuquerque area to Unite Private Networks and those in the Boise area to Syringa Networks. Headquartered in Kansas City, MO, Unite Private Networks is a leading provider of high-capacity, fiber-based communication networks. Syringa Networks is a fiber-optic network provider in Boise.These divestitures will not affect pro-forma operating revenues and operating cash flow of the combined company. CenturyLink will continue serving all former Level 3 Communications’ customers unless they opt to be served by the buyer of the divested assets in each metro area.CenturyLink will retain all its existing networks and business operations in these three metro areas. The company will continue to provide a full suite of telecommunications and data services to residential and business customers.Per the previously outlined statutory decisions, the clause also stated that the combined company will divest 24 strands of dark fiber, which will connect 30 specified city-pairs across the country. Presently, the fibers are not used for any commercial purpose. Hence, this divestiture will not affect customers or services.  The sale is, however, subject to other governmental approvals, including the Federal Communications Commission and other customary regulatory closing conditions. The financial details of the deal have been kept under wraps.Given this backdrop, we expect investor focus to remain on the outcome of the divestment. Meanwhile, details related to the approval for the sale of the assets in the Tucson area has not yet been revealed.CenturyLink, Inc. Price  CenturyLink, Inc. Price | CenturyLink, Inc.

300,CTL,"Telephone and Data Systems (TDS  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 23, before the opening bell.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.29 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 0.9%. The consensus estimate for the bottom line is pegged at a loss of 2 cents per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 60%.The company has a mixed earnings surprise history. Earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last two quarters and surpassed the same in one of the previous four quarters. The company’s bottom line met the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the remaining quarter, delivering an average beat of 779.1%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Influence Q4 EarningsTelephone & Data Systems continues to compete with the likes of CenturyLink (CTL  -  Free Report) and Frontier Communications to name a few. Additionally, the company’s wireless division – United States Cellular (USM  -  Free Report) – continues to operate in an intensely competitive wireless market and remains significantly challenged by the offering of service plans from lower-cost mobile operators. We further believe that high costs associated with network integration and construction of new cell sites, aggressive equipment pricing, increasing capacity in existing cell sites, wireless technology upgrades and spectrum licensing will put considerable pressure on the company’s finances.However, Telephone and Data Systems’ efforts to reward its shareholders with a fourth-quarter 2017 dividend of 15.5 cents per Common Share and Series A Common Share are impressive. The dividend was paid on Dec 28, 2017, to shareholders of record as of Dec 15, 2017. The move indicates the company’s commitment to create value for shareholders and underlines its confidence in business growth.Telephone and Data Systems is looking for lucrative opportunities to bring more fiber in order to better address services. By leveraging on fiber, the telco is trying to respond to customers' growing TV and broadband service demand. The company continues to expand its business in the managed hosting and cloud service market. Launch of Shared Data plans at nominal prices is likely to help the company gain consumers. The company's IPTV is also doing considerably well. It continues to experience strong smartphone demand at its wireless wing, U.S. Cellular.Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Telephone and Data Systems is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Telephone and Data Systems has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 2 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with the Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Telephone and Data Systems has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. QuoteKey PickEdison International (EIX  -  Free Report) from the broader Utilities sector has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in fourth-quarter 2017, scheduled to be reported on Feb 22. It has an Earnings ESP of +1.44% and has a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters with an average beat of 9.08%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>
