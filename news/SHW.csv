4,SHW,"The stock market held higher Friday afternoon, although gains were modest as Wall Street kept a watchful eye on the G-7 meeting in Canada.The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.3%. Procter & Gamble (PG) extended gains. The consumer products giant has been rising since Thursday on word that a reorganization plan may be taking root. UnitedHealth Group (UNH), another Dow component, cleared the 250.89 buy point of a cup-type base. But volume was light.The S&P 500 added 0.3% and the Nasdaq composite 0.2%.

The gathering of major western leaders is expected to be frosty as President Trump presses allies to change trade policies. Trump added to tensions Friday, when he said Russia should return to the G-7. Russia was expelled four years ago in protest over its annexation of Crimea.Despite the market's gains, defensive sectors such as food, tobacco and alcoholic beverages were leading. But consumer stocks also led, with electronics stores, apparel and home furnishing groups among Friday's leaders.Homebuilders were one of the day's top performing industry groups, up 2%. The group has been a loser this year, but it's been bouncing modestly for a few weeks. IShares U.S. Home Construction (ITB) — an ETF that also includes suppliers such as Home Depot (HD) and Sherwin-Williams (SHW) — was up 2%. It was one of the best gains among unleveraged ETFs.The homebuilding group is still near the bottom of IBD's 197 industry rankings. A few builders such as Tri Pointe Group (TPH) and Pulte Group (PHM) are forming the right side of bases. But it's too early to get excited about the group because most stocks remain deep in corrections. LGI Homes (LGIH), D.R. Horton (DHI) and Toll Bros. (TOL) remain deep in corrections.The energy sector lagged as oil prices fluctuated. U.S. crude was down after JPMorgan reduced its oil price forecast and concerns about growing U.S. output and falling demand in China, CNBC reported.

6,SHW,"In a welcome move, Axalta Coating Systems (AXTA) saw its Relative Strength Rating improve from 68 to 71 on Thursday. X IBD's proprietary RS Rating measures technical performance by showing how a stock's price movement over the last 52 weeks compares to that of the other stocks in our database. History reveals that the market's biggest winners tend to have an RS Rating of above 80 in the early stages of their moves. See if Axalta Coating Systems can continue to rebound and clear that threshold. Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch? Start HereAxalta Coating Systems broke out earlier, but is now trading about 5% below the prior 34.20 entry from a consolidation. In the scenario where a stock breaks out then falls 7% or more below the entry price, it's considered a failed breakout. If that happens, it's best to wait for a new pattern to take shape. Also understand that the most recent consolidation is a later-stage base, which makes it riskier to establish a new position or add shares to an existing one. Earnings-per-share growth declined in the company's latest report from -9% to -21%, but revenue rose from 2% to 7%. The company earns the No. 2 rank among its peers in the Chemicals-Paints industry group. Sherwin-Williams (SHW) is the No. 1-ranked stock within the group.RELATED:Which Stocks Are Showing Rising Relative Strength?Why Should You Use IBD's Relative Strength Rating?How Relative Strength Line Can Help You Judge A Stock

7,SHW,"They're leaving!After weeks of U.K. public opinion swinging back and forth, on Thursday the United Kingdom shockingly voted to leave the European Union. The outcome forced the resignation of Prime Minister David Cameron.Early Friday, the British pound plunged as much as 11% and the euro sagged as much as 4%. U.S. markets were expected to be highly volatile Friday. The turmoil was expected to put the kabosh on any Federal Reserve interest-rate hike in the near term.Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, said, ""There is little point in investors taking precipitate portfolio action, as selling what you wish you had sold yesterday is rarely the right reaction in markets dominated by position-adjustment and recalibration of expectations. Better to wait for opportunities to be revealed by volatility than to be part of it.""Michael Metcalfe, head of global macro strategy, State Street Global Markets, said, ""In the three months before the referendum it was noticeable that international investors increased their holdings of U.K. equities ... in spite of the uncertainties created by the vote. The only place where investor behavour changed was in the currency market where investors hedged their currency risk. While this hedging has proven prescient given sterling's depreciation following the vote, the key question now is whether international investors will now seek to reduce their underlying holdings of U.K. assets. If the uncertainty following the leave vote persists and because investors bought rather than sold U.K. assets before the vote, there is a heightened risk of outflows from both U.K. equities . . .""So how should U.S. investors play the situation?Mutual fund managers and investment strategists with whom Investor's Business Daily spoke advised investors to stick with their long-term investment plans. Still, some say they had hedged their exposure to the pound and euro.Several said that within their overall strategy they are tilting toward U.S. stocks, especially those that draw little if any of their revenues from abroad. Some are tilting toward emerging markets.A key question facing U.S. investors is: Should you trim your weightings to stocks, mutual funds or ETFs with exposure to the U.K. or the rest of Europe? That would cut your losses if U.K. or other European stocks lose more ground.But what if you get out and the market rallies without you?""You can miss a lot of whatever rally takes place,"" said David Tannehill, head of the investment group of Regions Wealth Management.And the question does not become moot now that the voting has concluded. The vote for Brexit starts a two-year process in which the U.K. and EU would renegotiate a bevy of trade pacts. Prospects for U.K. and continental stocks almost certainly would rise and fall like a teeter-totter on every little stock market news report.""Markets will not stop functioning during those two years,"" said Alessio de Longis, who is a manager of four OppenheimerFunds with assets totaling $1.6 billion. ""It will be a period of extended volatility.""De Longis, who also leads macro strategy for the global multi-asset group at OppenheimerFunds,  thinks it will not be a seismic disturbance for which investors must reshape their investment plans.""We don't expect it to be a (systemically disruptive) event with catastrophic market action,"" he said. ""We may get one month of volatility and noise and erratic action. But at the end of the day, it won't be a Lehman Bros.-type event. It won't force the rest of the market to make fire sales, stop trading and disrupt capital flows.""Late last year, de Longis' team hedged all of its British pound sterling and almost all of its euros by shorting currency forwards. In addition, his team went long on the Japanese yen with currency forwards, betting that it will appreciate as investors seek non-European safe havens.Since Dec. 31, De Longis' team has also more than doubled his $1.5 billion Global Allocation Fund's (QVGIX) weight in emerging markets stocks.As of April 30, its emerging markets stocks included China's internet giant Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), India's real estate lender Housing Development Finance and its media company Zee Entertainment Enterprises, Korea's cigarette seller KT&G, chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Brazil's stock exchange operator BM&F Bovespa, according to Morningstar Inc.At this point, de Longis cautions investors, it is probably too late to hedge the pound or euro.""With the pound sterling, volatility is insanely high and bid-ask spreads -- for, say, one-week or one-month options -- are very expensive,"" he said. Over the long term, it would typically take just a 0.5% drop in value for a hedge to become profitable. By Tuesday, it took a 2.5% move.Bob Doll, a manager of nine Nuveen Asset Management funds with $1.1 billion in assets, intends to stick by his broader, overall investment plan.""There is more economic weakness and more uncertainty outside the U.S. than inside,"" he said. ""Therefore, I have chosen companies that get most of their revenues here. With or without Brexit, this is the best house in a bad neighborhood.""Doll, who who is also Nuveen's chief equity strategist, has lightened his exposure to multinationals. Also, he lightened exposure to financials in April.His flagship $250 million Large Cap Core Fund (NLACX) had 99% of its shareholders' money at work in North American stocks as of May 31. The balance of its holdings were in Asian emerging markets.Apple (AAPL), Home Depot (HD), Cisco (CSCO), Intel (INTC) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) were his top five holdings.Like Doll, Anna Rathbun, director of research for CBIZ Retirement Plan Services, tilts toward U.S. stocks as safer than U.K. and EU equities. She also favors small caps.Aside from the Brexit question, she has been waiting for emerging markets stocks to rally. She says they are undervalued and have become one of the few options for yield-hungry investors in a low-rate world.She's also keeping an eye on beaten-down European stocks.If Brexit had been defeated, her team intended to add that market to the mix of undervalued securities. Natural resources producer Glencore is one such name.""Europe has benefited from the recovery in commodity prices,"" Rathbun said. ""They suffered from a quick drop. But they are diversified and positioned to do well.""The dollar has trended down since February, which has buoyed commodity prices. The downside risk for Glencore is that commodity prices are tied to the price of the dollar. If the Federal Reserve raises rates, that would strengthen the dollar, putting downward pressure on commodity prices.Among U.S. stocks, she likes paint maker Sherwin-Williams (SHW).""We have seen delayed spending by consumers since the 2008 crash and recession,"" Rathbun said. ""But if they can spend on things that build equity like homes, they do. We've seen a lot of home improvement projects.""
"
8,SHW,"The U.K. Brexit vote was as stunning as a heavyweight boxer's surprise blow to an opponent's head -- unexpected and jarring.But investors were also quick to react. Recommendations ranged from sit-tight, do-nothing to very proactive buy advice.Voya Investment Management chief market strategist Douglas Cote told IBD that investors should not try to trade on the vote in the short term.""My advice to investors is to stick to your investment plan on this historic Brexit vote,"" he said. ""The only investors that could possibly make moves are those who are already out of the market, in cash, and this is a good buying opportunity.""Investors should expect volatility as the U.K. and EU central banks intervene.Other investors, strategists and researchers shared recommendations for what to buy, as well as more general advice.Anna Rathbun, director of research for CBIZ Retirement Plan Services, said the drops in value for the British pound and euro strengthen the dollar. That presents potential problems for large-cap U.S. stocks that rely on exports, so investors could seek safety in U.S. small caps and midcaps.""Companies that are focused on the U.S. and North America, like Panera Bread (PNRA), would fall under that category,"" Rathbun said. She also likes paint maker Sherwin-Williams (SHW).""We have seen delayed spending by consumers since the 2008 crash and recession,"" Rathbun said. ""But if they can spend on things that build equity like homes, they do. We've seen a lot of home-improvement projects.""Similarly, investors should consider U.S. small-cap and midcap dividend paying securities, as well as investment-grade bond products, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of fund research for S&P Global Market Intelligence. Those securities are more insulated from whatever economic problems are besetting the U.K. and European Union countries, according to Sam Stovall, U.S. equity strategist for S&P GMI.Rosenbluth cited several ETFs as fitting his bill, noting that their average dividend yields compare favorably with the 1.57% yield of the 10-year Treasury bond.For investors who prefer bond income from ETFs, Rosenbluth says these funds merit a look:Both have 3% 30-day SEC yields, he says, but they hold different bonds.Bryce Doty, senior manager of Sit Rising Rate ETF (RISE), said: ""We sold long-maturity Treasuries in the middle of the night, are buying back shares of the Sit Rising Rate ETF we sold yesterday, and are looking to buy high-grade corporate bonds at much wider spreads than we could yesterday.""Chuck Self, chief investment officer of iSectors, an ETF strategist, said: ""There are opportunities for investors who are long on Treasury bonds and utilities, as they will continue to do well in the wake of the leave vote.""He added: ""I recommend buying Treasury bond and utility stock mutual funds for their safe haven/diversification status and income component. I also recommend precious metals and precious metals stocks for their safe haven status.""Self recommends that investors should use ETFs rather than mutual funds for any such intraday tactical buys and because they can be sold on short notice intraday.Phil Blancato, president and CEO of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management, said: ""For U.S. investors, the theme is more of the same: focus on U.S. stocks with higher quality and try to earn income.""Bradford Pine, of Bradford Pine Wealth Group, says investors should focus on quality, dividend-paying U.S. stocks.Like several investors and strategists, he said the Federal Reserve is now very unlikely to raise rates this year.Art DeGaetano, CIO of Bramshill Investments and a manager of $40 million Bramshill Income Performance (BRMSX), said: ""You should be selling half of high-yield positions ... on any rebounds. I would buy longer-duration A-rated and AA-rated corporates as spreads are widening out. Those areas of the market in a high-quality credit will hold up well in this environment and still will be sought after by investors who need yield.""He added: ""If you had cash on the sidelines, (you should) put one-third of it to work here today. And then wait over the next month as I think you will get some lower prices and better points to enter. By the end of the summer, we would have two-thirds invested.""Like several investors, he said, ""The biggest concern going forward is the Italian referendum in October in our opinion.""

9,SHW,"Sales of new homes hit a four-year high last month, and luxury homebuilder Toll Bros. (TOL) said Tuesday the foundation for continued growth is in place, though questions remain about millennials' future buying habits.The Commerce Department said April new-home sales skyrocketed 16.6% to an annualized rate of 619,000, the highest since January 2008. Wall Street was looking for a small increase to 523,000 units.""We continue to believe the drivers are in place to sustain the current housing market's slow but steady growth,"" Toll Bros. Chairman Robert Toll said in a statement.""Interest rates remain low, the job picture continues to improve, home equity values are rising, supply remains constrained and the industry is still not building enough homes to meet the demand that current demographics imply are needed.""Toll Bros. shares closed up 8.7% in the stock market today, gapping above their 50-day average. Among other homebuilders, NVR (NVR) rose 3%. D.R. Horton (DHI) added 4.2%, Lennar (LEN) rose 3.9%, and PulteGroup (PHM) climbed 5.1%.Toll Bros., which sells to more affluent buyers, said adjusted fiscal second-quarter earnings climbed 39% to 51 cents a share, beating analyst estimates by 6 cents. Revenue grew 31% to $1.12 billion, well above analyst views for $1.04 billion.The homebuilder expects full-year revenue of $4.76 billion-$5.36 billion, with the midpoint of the range above views for $5.01 billion. Toll Bros. also expects to deliver 5,800-6,300 new homes for the year, with an average value of $820,000-$850,000.Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said the average home price climbed 6% to $379,800.Stifel Chief Economist Lindsey Piegza said the price increase may be too big for some consumers to swallow. ""If the price of new homes continues to go up, it will make it more difficult for the average potential homeowner to buy.""Piegza noted sales are still well below pre-recession highs. In April 2005, there were 1.26 million new homes sold, nearly double the figure this year, according to Commerce figures.Other analysts see strong results ahead.""Today's numbers were eye-popping growth,"" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. ""There is still plenty of momentum to go forward.""But new questions arose about whether millennials will buy homes at the same rate as earlier generations did. Piegza said they prefer to rent and may stay out of the home-buying market in the near term.And a new Pew Research Center study out Tuesday found that Americans 18 to 34 years old in 2014 were more likely to be live with their parents than in their own household with a spouse or partner. Pew said that is the first time that's happened in the modern era.But Robert Toll remained upbeat about the key demographic group, saying on a conference call that “as millennials mature, studies indicate their appetite for housing is consistent with past generations.”Meanwhile, paint and coatings company Valspar (VAL), which is being bought by Sherwin-Williams (SHW) for $11.3 billion, also said Tuesday that adjusted fiscal Q2 earnings rose 9.9% to $1.22 a share, 4 cents below forecasts. Revenue slid 2.1% to $1.056 billion, lighter than the expected $1.122 billion.

11,SHW,"Over the last three months, the top-performing mutual funds have continued to pick up shares in chip stocks like Applied Materials (AMAT) and Intel (INTC), as well as in building-related companies, including Thor Industries (THO), Pulte Group (PHM) and Stanley Black & Decker (SWK).XWith an eye toward the growth of industrial output, leading fund managers also invested in five chemical companies, including DowDuPont (DWDP), Sherwin-Williams (SHW) and plastics manufacturer Rogers (ROG).Fifty-one leading mutual funds also took a nearly $128 million gulp of energy drink leader Monster Beverage (MNST), which cleared a 57.35 buy point on, quite appropriately, Halloween.  The Coca-Cola (KO) partner is trading 1% above the entry, meaning it's still in the buy zone, which extends to 60.22.Monster sports a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and five quarters of rising fund ownership. The maker of Monster Rehab and other drink brands is set to report Q3 earnings on Nov. 8, with analysts expecting 21% EPS growth. Note that it's risky to buy any stock just before it reports.DowDuPont received the biggest investment of any stock on the list, as 73 funds purchased $16.7 billion worth of shares. But that number is skewed by the merger of Dow Chemical Co. and E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. that was just completed in September to create the new entity. The chemical giant's market cap stands at just over $88 billion, and the stock has eased back into the buy zone after become extended from a breakout in September.Forty-two funds invested just over $1.7 billion in leading chip stock Intel, which broke out on Oct. 2, then soared over 7% on Oct. 27 after reporting third-quarter earnings. Intel is now about 22% above the initial buy point.UnitedHealth (UNH) was the only other company to join the billion-dollar club, with 67 funds investing $1.2 billion.  The megacap managed-care stock has continued to climb since a breakout in March 2016, clearly boosted by seven quarters of rising fund ownership.Semiconductor stocks like IBD 50 members Applied Materials and Lam Research (LRCX) have been on a tear since the beginning of 2016, but it's a cyclical industry, so investors should be ready to lock in gains if the stocks begin to show topping action.In addition to Applied Materials, Lam Research, IBD Big Cap 20 stock Texas Instruments (TXN) and Intel, six more semiconductor-related companies made this month's list, a sign that institutional investors are continuing to put their chips on the table, so to speak. Time will tell if, in the short term, that turns out to be a good bet.Applied Materials is 19% above its recent 47.69 buy point in a later-stage cup with handle, putting just below a potential profit-taking zone. Lam Research is already in the 20% - 25% profit-taking area.Banking giant JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and automaker General Motors (GM) topped the list of new sells this month. JPMorgan showed 42 net sellers (89 selling minus 47 buying), while GM had 29 (43 selling, 14 buying).Megacap medical stock Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) came in third, with 24 net sellers (68 selling, 44 buying).Despite the selling, Johnson & Johnson is still within buy range after retaking a 137.18 entry on Oct. 17 after reporting a 13% rise in Q3 earnings.JPMorgan has continued to climb beyond a 95.32 buy point, but after reporting earnings on Oct. 24, General Motors has been giving back a chunk of the 25%-plus gains it made from a breakout in September.

31,SHW,"Rival home-improvement retailers Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) report third-quarter results on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively. Here's a look at what to expect.Estimates: Earnings per share up 16% to $1.58 on revenue up 6% to $23.044 billion. Wall Street expects same-store sales growth of around 4.4%, according to a Credit Suisse note last week.Stock: Shares fell 1.7% to 127.67 in the stock market today. Home Depot found resistance at its 200-day line intraday but is still above its 50-day line.Estimates: A 20% jump in EPS to 96 cents. Revenue is expected to rise 10% to $15.859 billion. Comps were seen rising around 3.1%, according to the Credit Suisse note.Stock: Lowe's shares rose 0.4% to 70.01 Monday, finding resistance at its 50-day line.The earnings for both companies come amid investors' worries about weaker home-improvement spending, Jefferies said in a research note this month, and the firm cited concerns about commentary from companies like Whirlpool (WHR) and Sherwin-Williams (SHW).During its third-quarter earnings call, Whirlpool said it saw ""temporary softness"" in U.S. demand in the first two months of that quarter with improvement in the third. The company attributed the lag to election-related consumer anxiety.There are also concerns about weaker big-ticket purchases, discounting and Fed rate hikes for Home Depot and Lowe's. Weather, as always, could play a huge role in the companies' future results.""Comparisons will get more challenging the next two quarters as a warm winter extended the outdoor selling season last year,"" Jefferies analyst Daniel Binder wrote in the research note. ""Forecasts suggest a more typical and colder winter this year, so we would expect a deceleration in comp trend over the next two quarters.""IBD'S TAKE: Even as home improvement stocks contend with potential rate hikes and colder winters, the broader construction industry could see a bigger uptrend if President-elect Trump carries out plans to overhaul the nation's infrastructure.However, the investment firm said, home improvement spending was still better than in other areas of retail, with higher home prices and healthy consumer finances helping the industry. The housing market, and some companies associated with it, have benefited from lower interest rates in recent years.Home Depot has generally outperformed Lowe's in recent years. Credit Suisse also said that more than 120 Home Depot stores ""may have been in the path"" of Hurricane Matthew. Those stores, analyst Seth Sigman wrote, could have seen an uptick in demand from customers looking to prepare for the storm or make repairs to damage afterward.Credit Suisse said Lowe's gross margins could be strained by its purchase this year of Rona, a Canada-based retailer that sells home-improvement products and building materials.The two companies are in IBD's retail and wholesale building products industry group, which is lagging at No. 108 but rising in the past three weeks.RELATED:Lowe's Q2 Earnings, Revenue Miss Views As Comps Lag Home Depot'sHome Depot Earnings Solid On Housing 'Tailwind'; Stock Flirts With Buy Point

34,SHW,"Stocks lost their grip on most of the day's gains Thursday as the indexes headed into the final hour of trade. The Nasdaq was up 0.3%, after being up 1.5% at midday. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average held pops of 0.7% and 0.9%, respectively. Volume in the stock market today was running much slower than the previous session.Among widely held issues, AT&T (T) thrust about 2% higher in volume 55% above average. While the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are down about 10% and 8% respectively so far this year, AT&T has held steady with a 1% gain.AT&T's dividend might be part of the reason. In an ugly market, dividend stocks start looking good to some investors. AT&T has increased its dividend for 32 consecutive years. The current annualized yield is 5.6%.The stock price, though, has been rangebound for more than two years. AT&T stock has found repeated resistance at the 36-37 area and support at the 31-32 level. The stock is trading just under 35.In the IBD 50, a list of stocks with the best ratings via fundamentals and technicals, Carter's (CRI) gained 1% in volume a third faster than normal. The marketer of clothes for babies and children is working on a stage-two base. However, the stock needs to do more work on the right side. Carter's is 17% off its high.A stage-two base means the stock is forming its second consolidation since starting an advance. Breakouts from the first two consolidations are more likely to work than those from a later stage.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, coal and oil stocks grabbed the biggest gains. Funeral Services and book stocks took the hardest hits.Follow Paul Whitfield on Twitter @IBD_PWhitfield.

The S&P SmallCap 600 fell 1%.Sherwin-Williams (SHW) gapped down more than 10% to 247.59 as volume ballooned to nearly 6 million shares, easily the heaviest turnover so far this year. The paint giant posted a 7% rise in earnings per share to $4.23 a share, the smallest increase in 11 quarters and missing the Thomson Reuters consensus view of $4.32.In March, Sherwin announced a $13 billion all-cash deal to buy rival Valspar (VAL).Sherwin shares have struggled since its July breakout past a 309.10 buy point failed to make much headway. On July 21, shares, gapped down hard on second-quarter results, falling more than 7% from the proper entry and triggering a sell signal. The stock also undercut the 50-day moving average, a sign of weakness.Air conditioning, wood product and building product companies also led the market's downside. Ship transport, apparel manufacturing, restaurant, medical research equipment and medical software stocks also sold off.On the upside, defense stocks rallied on the back of positive results from fighter jet and battle systems supplier Lockheed Martin (LMT). Shares bolted more than 7% to 249.26 and crossed back above the key 50-day moving average in turnover that expanded 33% above average.Lockheed reported a remarkable 30% rise in Q3 profit $3.61 a share, thumping Wall Street's consensus forecast of $2.88, as sales increased 15%, marking the third quarter in a row of double-digit top-line growth. In the third quarter of 2015, earnings were flat. After-tax margin improved to 9.4%, up 190 basis points vs. a year ago.Lockheed is now trading just 6% below a 266.93 all-time high, increasing the possibility for a new base to form.Industry peer Raytheon (RTN) rose more than 2% to 139.75, hopping back its 50-day line.

The Street sees earnings up 12% to $1.66 a share, following profit gains in two of the three prior quarters.Boeing (BA) rallied more than 1% to 139.02 in volume surging 65% above typical levels and reached its highest price level since July 27. That gain placed the Dow 30 component within arm's reach of a potential breakout from a 139.55 early buy point.Boeing has been forming a first-stage base since late February of 2015. As seen on its IBD chart, the relative strength line (painted in blue) has climbed sharply in recent weeks, meaning that it's outpacing the S&P 500. The aircraft giant is slated to post Q3 results on Wednesday; the Street sees earnings rising 6% to $2.62 a share despite an 8.5% dip in revenue to $23.64 billion.General Dynamics (GD) rose nearly 0.8% to 152.59 in fast turnover to climb back barely above its 50-day moving average. The stock is within buy range, less than 4% above a 147.26 shallow saucer entry point. The saucer could also be interpreted as the long handle of a gigantic saucer base. In either case, the buy point remains the same.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) gained 0.5% to 118.25 in the regular session but fell nearly 3% to around 114.75 in after-hours trade following mixed fiscal Q4 results. Earnings barely edged Wall Street views by 2 cents but still fell nearly 15% to $1.67 a share as revenue of $46.9 billion practically met the consensus forecast and slipped 9%.The results marked a third quarter in a row of slumping profits. However, CEO Tim Cook noted in a news release that Apple's service business revenue saw a 24% jump to an all-time record.Apple CFO Luca Maestri noted that the company returned $9.3 billion to shareholders through cash dividends and share buybacks during the quarter. Apple also declared a quarterly cash payout of 57 cents a share, payable Nov. 10 to holders of record on Nov. 7.

"
64,SHW,"The third quarter could finally be the bottom — after a year of the embattled, oversupplied energy sector pulling earnings of S&P 500 companies into negative terrain.Earnings for S&P 500 companies are forecast to dip 0.5% from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. Given that actual results usually top analyst forecasts by a couple of percentage points, this could end a four-quarter earnings decline as the hangover from the oil price crash subsides. Revenue is set to grow 2.6%, ending six quarters of declines.Energy earnings are seen plunging 67%, but that's an improvement from declines of 85% in Q2 and an outright loss in Q1. In Q4, energy earnings are expected to see 3.8% growth as crude prices have rebounded from 12-year lows early this year to above $50 a barrel on Thursday. Leaving out the energy sector, S&P 500 earnings are estimated to grow 2.9% in Q3.""The idea is that the worst is behind us,"" said Sheraz Mian, who manages Zacks' equity research department. ""We saw some early tentative signs of improvement in the last earnings season as well, even though growth was in the negative.  . . . But results were nevertheless an improvement over what was expected.""Financials will add a lift, with sector earnings forecast to tick up 1% vs. drops of 4% in Q2 and 12.6% in Q1. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) report on Friday, Oct. 14. Most banking stocks — with the notable exception of scandal-hit Wells Fargo — have been rallying in recent weeks on expectations for a Federal Reserve rate hike.Broadly, the estimates reflect easier comparisons, particularly in energy and materials, whose results have slumped with the price of commodities. And the strong dollar still weighed during the quarter. But it didn't weigh as much as it could have because expectations have dimmed over the year for the Fed to be more aggressive about raising interest rates.Expectations in the months to come — including 8.4% earnings growth for Q4 — are higher but obtainable, Thomson Reuters analyst David Aurelio said. But while loftier forecasts typically get revised downward as the reporting season advances, earnings are still likely to grow in Q4 and early 2017 despite lingering economic anxiety.""I think the overall sentiment doesn't seem to have this positive outlook,"" he said. ""But when you look into the numbers, they're telling you a very different story.""The tech sector's earnings are expected to grow 4.5% in Q3 and 10.1% excluding Apple (AAPL), Aurelio said, demonstrating the company's weight in the index. In fact, taking Apple out of the S&P 500 overall would result in a slim 0.1% profit gain.But Aurelio pointed to pockets of resilience in the tech sector outside of Apple, which has been bogged down on concerns about slowing iPhone demand.In particular, he likes the odds of the semiconductor equipment segment, whose earnings are expected to grow 61% amid greater demand for technology that provides efficient memory storage. Applied Materials (AMAT) is among the leaders in the group, with earnings seen jumping more than 125% on nearly 40% revenue growth.""It's historically always been a gauge for where things are going, because it's supplying the equipment to make the devices that go into other devices,"" he said. ""It's supplying the equipment to make the chips.""The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index of stocks has climbed 50% from a mid-February low to a 16-year closing high Thursday.Elsewhere, there are mixed signals. After posting double-digit-percentage earnings gains over the past year, the consumer discretionary sector is poised to slow to only 4.1% growth, according to Thomson Reuters.The expected slowdown comes largely from the auto industry, in particular Ford (F), with its anticipated 51% drop in earnings. The automaker in July indicated that sales could soon hit their peak, amid concerns about discounts and an auto-loan bubble. Take Ford out of the equation, and consumer discretionary's earnings would grow 7.9%, Aurelio said. General Motors' (GM) earnings should dip 4% after several quarters of more than double-digit gains.Amazon (AMZN), which is included in the consumer discretionary group, is seen doing some heavy lifting for the sector, with earnings growth expected to surge 371% in Q3.Elsewhere in the consumer-facing sector, restaurants across the board have warned of less customer spending, and retailers continue to suffer at the hands of Amazon.The materials sector, forecast to rebound to 7.1% earnings growth after a year of declines, is also seen getting a boost from a single heavy lifter.The section's drive into positive territory was due to the copper sub-industry, Aurelio said. The lone S&P 500 member of that mining subsector is Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), whose earnings are projected to soar 227%. Excluding Freeport, the materials sector's earnings would decline 0.6%.Labor costs in a variety of businesses — in retail, restaurants and even the airlines — could also mean lower profits. And while the health care sector is often immune to the cycles that hurt other businesses, earnings growth for the space is expected to slow to 5.5%. The sector overall is heading into tougher comparisons after getting a boost from the biotech industry in the past.So just as the shock from the oil bust is finally starting to fade, there's the sense that other big companies are losing momentum.""The growth cycle effectively has run its course for large-cap America as a whole,"" Mian said.Analysts expect industrial firms to report a 1.2% earnings decline, and that likely doesn't reflect Honeywell (HON) news. Honeywell late Thursday cut the top end of its 2016 earnings forecast, citing weak Q3 aerospace sales. Honeywell shares plunged 7.5% Friday, with aerospace customers and rivals also slumping.PPG Industries (PPG), maker of industrial coatings, paints and glass, crashed 8.3% Friday on a Q3 profit warning. Fellow S&P 500 paint component Sherwin-Williams (SHW) retreated 1.9%.

Existing-home prices rose 4.8% vs. a year earlier amid tight supply.But homebuilders' results were less positive. D.R. Horton, the nation's largest homebuilder by revenue, reported a 10% hike in second-quarter earnings per share minus one-time items to 66 cents, in line with forecasts. Revenue rose 13% to $3.23 billion, but that was lighter than the $3.26 billion Wall Street expected.The builder of single family and detached homes said its sales backlog was up 15% vs. Q2 2015, to 14,670 homes.D.R. Horton shares fell fractionally to 34.29 on the stock market today after briefly hitting a 10-year high. The stock is still slightly out of buy range from a 32.61 entry point cleared on July 6.IBD'S TAKE: D.R. Horton is ranked No. 2 in IBD's Builders-Residential/Commercial group. Which builder is No. 1? Find out at IBD Stock Checkup.PulteGroup reported Q2 net income of $118 million, or 37 cent EPS, up 32% vs. the same quarter a year ago. That beat estimates by 5 cents a share. Sales climbed 39% to $1.8 billion, topping views for $1.66 billion.Deliveries increased 27% to 4,772 homes, combined with an 11% increase in average selling price to $367,000. Value of backlog rose 21% to $3.7  billion, while the number of homes in backlog increased 8% to 9,679 homes.

89,SHW,"The $5.1 billion Columbia Select Large Cap Growth Fund (UMLGX) has hit a rough patch. Its year-to-date loss of about 8% going into Thursday lags the average 2.96% setback by its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the S&P 500's 2.45% gain.But you're highly unlikely to hear sounds of panic from the fund's quarters. That's because this is not the first lobster bake for the Boston-based fund managers. They've encountered market volatility before. And they have a way of rebounding.Right now, the fund's IBD 36-Month Performance Rating through May is A+, the highest available. That means the fund's performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.Around the start of that period, the fund was also battling rough seas. In the second quarter of 2013, the fund lost ground while both its peer group and the broad market romped ahead.Usually, the fund makes the opposite happen. In the more than 53 quarters since the start of lead manager Thomas Galvin's tenure on Feb. 28, 2003 -- he's the longest tenured of three current managers -- the fund has outperformed both its direct rivals and the big-cap bogey 28 times. It has lagged both two quarters in a row only once.That helps explain why this fund is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, shining in three categories: U.S. stock funds, growth funds and large-cap funds. It outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.So how has the fund positioned itself for the future? How will it maneuver through a market that is widely expected not to favor a lot of growth names and to be volatile amid a slow-growth U.S. economy? And don't forget the additional headwind from Brexit.Buys and sells are based on which individual securities appear most promising. But it's clear where the managers expect to find most opportunities. They had 41% of their shareholders' money at work in the technology sector as of May 31. Another 34% was in health care. And 12% was in consumer discretionary.Amazon (AMZN) -- to many investors, both a tech and a consumer discretionary name -- has helped fund performance by trending higher since early February. After declining for four quarters, earnings per share have climbed for four frames at a triple-digit pace. EPS growth has accelerated, rising 118%, 122% and 992% in the past three quarters.Amazon was the fund's third-largest holding as of May 31.Amazon is no longer just an online retailer. It also has become a major cloud computing player. And it recently announced a new video streaming service that will compete with Netflix and Hulu. Amazon's Prime video streaming service will be available for $8.99 per month.Amid severe selling pressure in the general market after the Brexit vote, Amazon has climbed from a 603.34 buy point and from an alternate entry of 638.11, as IBD's market coverage has noted. Shares are trading around 725. A stock will often begin to consolidate after rising 20% to 25% past a buy point.Monster Beverage (MNST) is the thirteenth-largest holding. EPS grew 25% in Q1, rebounding from a 6% decline in the fourth quarter.Trading around 160, shares are getting extended from a 154.06 cup-with-handle entry.The stock's six-month base began forming in December.Monster benefits from distribution by its strategic partner and global beverage powerhouse Coca-Cola (KO). Coke bottlers have also boosted the number of outlets where Monster energy drinks are available.And Monster recently debuted a soda called Mutant to compete with PepsiCo's (PEP) Mountain Dew.The value of Monster to Coke? Coke's sales have declined three straight calendar years. Pepsi's fell last year and were flat in 2014. Monster's sales rose 10% each of the past two years.Sherwin-Williams' (SHW) EPS grew 18%, 39% and 31% in the past three quarters. Trending sideways since late April, shares are forming a flat base with a 309.10 buy point.Annual return on equity has grown six years in a row, gaining 43.3%, 64.8% and 113.1% in the past three years. The company is acquiring rival Valspar.Anna Rathbun, director of research for CBIZ Retirement Plan Services, recently told IBD, ""We have seen delayed spending by consumers since the 2008 crash and recession. But if they can spend on things that build equity like homes, they do. We've seen a lot of home improvement projects.""

129,SHW,"Many investors are drawn to low-priced stocks like bears to honey. Truth is, it's an area of the market where institutional investors rarely fish. That means you shouldn't fish there, either.Prior to today, seven columns in this space have addressed the question: What makes a great base? Today's column is a reminder that when looking for good price setups, make sure stocks are priced at least $10 a share or higher.Retail shoppers love bargains. But in the stock market, what seems like a bargain usually isn't. Cheap stocks are usually cheap for a reason.Of course, it just sounds better buying 1,000 shares of a $1 stock as opposed to 10 shares of a $100 stock. The $1 stock goes up a dollar, yielding a tidy $1,000 profit. Meanwhile, the $100 stock goes up a dollar, yielding a $10 profit.Which sounds better? The logic may be flawed, but it's human nature to favor cheap stocks. Of course, there are stocks priced under 10 in IBD's database that have compelling fundamentals. Some have excellent Earnings Per Share, Relative Strength and Composite Ratings. ( Click on the IBD University tab at Investors.com to learn more about all of these ratings.)But it's not easy making money in low-priced stocks. It's a risky area of the market because most low-priced names lack a critical trait seen in past stock market winners: institutional sponsorship.Why do top mutual fund managers tend to shun low-priced stocks? Because they like liquidity, and cheap stocks rarely have it. Fund managers like to move into and out of a stock without being noticed. They can do that with liquid, highly priced names — not with illiquid ones.Fund managers like to focus on firms with an exceptional track record of earnings and sales growth. This is not easy to find in the low-priced space, where many firms talk the talk but can't walk the walk.It's not that money can't be made in low-priced stocks. It's just that the odds are much less in your favor.Truth is, some of the most profitable breakouts can come from higher-priced names. Not surprisingly, since they're more on the radar of institutional investors.""Expensive"" Often Is Not SoThe second half of 2012 yielded some powerful breakouts from institutional-quality names, as seen in the table above.MasterCard (MA) cleared a pre-split buy point of 448.10 in September 2012. For an individual investor, it may have been an easy stock to shun because of its price, but today it remains a true leader and shows strong institutional support.Mohawk Industries (MHK) broke out a few months later, clearing a buy point of 89.38. It has risen 109% since then.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) was trading around 150 a share in August 2010 with a lofty P-E of 30 times trailing earnings, but that didn't impede the stock. Over the next 10 months, the stock rallied 118% from a buy point of 154.53.It was no different in January 2013 as higher-priced institutional leaders like LinkedIn (LNKD), Sherwin-Williams (SHW) and Biogen Idec (BIIB) broke out of bases and went on lengthy uptrends.

131,SHW,"How To Invest In A Choppy Stock MarketBankers count money. Sleepy people count sheep. Successful investors count bases — even during choppy stock markets — to understand where a good stock is in its current upward move.A stock goes public, moves sideways for a while and before you know it, it breaks out from a first-stage IPO base. It rallies 20% or more and takes another breather. Soon enough, the stock breaks out from a second-stage base. Another strong 20% rally and a breakout from a third-stage base. And so on.Breakouts from later-stage bases can work, but after a big price run for a stock, they're definitely more risky.Note that when a stock clears a first-stage base, rallies less than 20% and forms a new base, the new base is still considered first-stage.In a volatile market, a stock can form a base-on-base pattern, or a base next to a base. A base-on-base forms above the prior buy point. A base next to a base can form below the prior buy point, but it needs to hold above the low of the prior base. Both bases count as one base.When a stock breaks out, sometimes it heads significantly lower in price. While doing so, the stock also undercuts the intraday low of the most recently completed base. This move resets the base count. The thinking behind a base reset is that selling is intense enough to wipe the slate clean of willing sellers, paving the way for another potential leg up.Sherwin-Williams (SHW) formed a base next to a base when major averages started to weaken in the fall of 2012. The first cup-shaped base corrected 12% and showed a bullish accumulation week in the week ended Nov. 16 (1). The second flat base corrected 8% (2). A breakout soon followed in early January. The breakout stuttered, but the stock never fell more than 4% below the 159.90 entry (3).At a time when the Nasdaq corrected about 12% off its high, Sherwin-Williams' strength was noteworthy. Keep in mind that it's common for a growth stock to correct as much 1.5 to 2.5 times as much as the broad market. Sherwin-Williams pulled back mostly in line with the market.It wasn't easy to hold the stock when it started to move sideways in June (4), but Sherwin-Williams held comfortably above the buy point.And it rewarded patience. In 2013-2014, the stock rose 71% vs. the S&P 500's 44% return.How To Invest In A Choppy Stock Market

139,SHW,"Managers of $389 million Nuveen Large Cap Growth Opportunities Fund (FIGWX) made defensive tweaks to their portfolio as the winter market storm kicked up, while also retaining their basic focus on growthier stocks.Keeping aim on certain growth stocks should benefit the mutual fund even if a slower growth environment prevails for some time or if negative stock market news about sluggish oil prices or China's economic slowdown weighs down the market.""The fund's largest overweight is in the area of companies with high growth potential that we believe can perform well somewhat independent of the economic cycle,"" the fund's managers wrote in their fourth-quarter commentary. ""We are always looking for exceptional growth companies that we believe have solid and/or improving fundamentals, a reasonable valuation and an approaching catalyst.""With that double-barreled approach, the fund's -1.28% return topped 77% of its large-cap growth peer mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the 12 months going into Tuesday. Its direct rivals averaged a 3.89% loss. The S&P 500 eked out an 0.51% gain.Over the past three years, the fund's average annual gain of 11.16% beat 62% of its peer group, which averaged a 10.31% yearly return. The big-cap bogey averaged an 11.23% advance.While the fund rotated from some smaller, fast-growing biotech and technology stocks in Q4 into better-established, more stable stocks, it has hardly abandoned growth. Holdings in the portfolio average an IBD Composite Rating of 72. The Composite Rating combines IBD's five stock-performance ratings, including EPS and RS Ratings, with 99 being the highest.Top holdings with very strong Comp Ratings of at least 80 as of Dec. 31 included Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), Home Depot (HD), Priceline (PCLN) and Nike (NKE).New buys with Comp Ratings of 90 or better included McDonald's (MCD), Adobe Systems (ADBE), Southwest (LUV) and MSCI (MSCI).Stocks poised to do well can be spotted deeper in the portfolio, too. Chemicals and paint company Sherwin-Williams (SHW), with a 97 Comp Rating, is up 9% so far this year.

140,SHW,"Cable TV leader Comcast (CMCSA), coffee king Starbucks (SBUX),  “innovative” drug companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and a few biotechs make Morgan Stanley’s list of companies with pricing power.Amid a low-inflation environment and worries over a global recession, stocks with pricing power should get a serious look, says the Morgan Stanley report.Its list also includes American Tower (AMT), Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG), Constellation Brands (STZ), Equinix (EQIX), L Brands (LB), Mindbody (MB), Phillip Morris (PM), Reynolds American (RAI), Sally Beauty Holdings (SBH), and Sherwin-Williams (SHW).Here’s Morgan Stanley’s take on why some of these companies have pricing power.1) American Tower. “Towers effectively offer local monopolies, and there is little alternative for wireless carriers wishing to add capacity to improve network quality.”2) Amgen. “While drug pricing has been a topic of debate since U.S. presidential candidates raised focus on the topic in the late summer of 2015, we continue to see pricing power among large cap biotech.”3) Biogen. “In 2015, management took around 11% to 12% gross price increases across its portfolio.”4) Celgene. “Management in 2015 took 7-10% gross price increases across its portfolio and we would expect a similar net price trend in 2016.”5) Comcast. “We are positive on CMCSA’s broadband growth story and see improved results in video given X1 (set-top box deployment).”6) Sherwin-Williams. “(Its) pricing power relates to its control of its own distribution, as well as its outsized leverage to professional painting contractors.7) Starbucks. “SBUX remains the category leader in the high-margin, premium coffee segment and benefits from selling an often-craved, habitual product.”

141,SHW,"If Morgan Stanley analysts' bets are right, 10 stocks are poised to rally over the next two to eight weeks, based on what they believe will be positive near-term catalysts.Their top picks range from Silicon Valley's social-media icon Facebook (FB) to ""old school"" New Jersey petroleum refiner and supplier PBF Energy (PBF).Others on Morgan Stanley's ""high conviction"" list going into the fourth-quarter earnings season include chip-gear supplier Lam Research (LRCX), enterprise data-storage firm Pure Storage (PSTG), and Canadian telco and media company BCE (BCE).The other five: cable operator AMC Networks (AMCX), paint company Sherwin-Williams (SHW), cloud networking specialist Arista Networks (ANET), dental-tech supplier Align Technology (ALGN) and Shopify (SHOP), which provides a cloud-based management platform to small and midsize retailers.Analysts who cover each of the stocks have views that ""diverge from the Street's,"" the report says.For Facebook, analyst Brian Nowak expects strong ad-revenue growth in the fourth quarter and positive earnings revisions coming in 2016. He also sees 2016 ""as the year of Instagram,"" with the platform adding more than $2 billion in incremental revenue. Another catalyst cited political ad spending.Facebook reports Q4 earnings on Jan. 27. Morgan Stanley views are 2% above consensus on earnings and 4% above on revenue. Its price target is 130.On Lam Research, Morgan expects the company to continue to outpace overall capital spending levels. Potential upside drivers cited are China's interest in chip manufacturing, Intel's (INTC) ramp-up of internal memory manufacturing, and potential competition for new chip-device structures.AMC Networks should deliver above-peer ad revenue growth on recent content success, including the ""near-term durability"" of ad revenue for its ""Walking Dead"" series and monetization of its new original programming, ""Into the Badlands,"" Morgan Stanley noted.It sees Pure Storage benefitting from fast adoption of all-flash arrays and Sherwin-Williams best positioned to gain share in the U.S. architectural paint cycle, which it believes has more room to grow than analysts expect.Follow Marilyn Alva on Twitter @IBD_MAlva.

142,SHW,"Many retailers, especially those largely dependent on brick-and-mortar stores for sales and profits, are suffering through a rough patch, but home improvement chains such as Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) should do just fine, analysts say.Home Depot will report third-quarter results Tuesday, followed by Lowe's on Wednesday. Both are expected to log double-digit profit growth on sales gains in the mid-single digits.The home improvement sector marches to its ""own drummer"" — the housing market — ""and should be less impacted by the recent retail malaise,"" said analyst Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets in a client note.Private fixed-residential investment, viewed as a proxy for U.S. housing-related spending, was up 10.7% in the third quarter from a year earlier, the fourth straight quarter of double-digit growth, he noted.Home Depot's earnings are seen rising 19% from a year ago to $1.32 per share on revenue of $2.18 billion, up 6%, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Lowe's is expected to earn 78 cents per share, up 32% from last year, on revenue of $1.43 billion, up 5%.While an unseasonably warm autumn can disrupt retail sales patterns, it might actually have benefited the two home improvement chains by extending the busy summer/fall selling season, he said.And he noted ""fairly positive"" commentary from vendors such as Sherwin-Williams (SHW), Fortune Brands (FBHS) and Whirlpool (WHR) during the third quarter.However, rural lifestyle chain Tractor Supply (TSCO) faced ""modest weather-related headwinds"" on heat-related products during the warmer-than-usual quarter. But overall, Tractor Supply benefited from the extended summer selling season, the analyst said.Shares of Home Depot, which tumbled 3% on Friday, closed up 0.7% on the stock market today. Lowe's finished 2.2% higher after losing 3.6% Friday.Home Depot and Lowe's both earn Composite Ratings from IBD of 82 out of a best-possible 99, based on metrics such as growth in earnings and stock, but that is down from the low 90s three months ago.Follow Marilyn Alva on Twitter @IBD_MAlva.

230,SHW,"Sherwin-Williams Co. (SHW) is the best way to play the recovery in construction markets, according to a recent analyst's initiation report on the highly-rated paint and coatings maker and distributor.In the report, RBC Capital Markets analyst Arun Viswanathanan notes that more than 70% of Sherwin-Williams' sales are tied to U.S. construction.""We expect its industry-leading growth, margins and cash flow generation to continue to expand as construction markets improve due to (the) high correlation between architectural coatings volumes and existing home sales,"" noted Viswanathanan, who rates Sherwin-Williams an outperform.He calls the company the ""pre-eminent"" coatings stock. He expects it will continue to deliver at least 7% sales growth and 15% to 25% earnings per share growth, or around 1.5 times higher than the industry's, in the coming years due to its dominance of the contractor and national accounts channels and its ""high degree of operating leverage.""The maker of several brands, such as its namesake and Dutch Boy, sells its Sherwin-Williams branded products exclusively through a chain of company-operated stores and facilities, while its other brands are sold through mass merchandisers, hardware stores and other distributors.""SHW's 'controlled distribution model' or vast network of dedicated paint stores supports the strongest sales and earnings growth amongst the coatings companies,"" Viswanathanan noted.He estimates 2014 third-quarter earnings will come in at $3.23 a share vs. consensus analyst expectations for $3.20. He anticipates earnings of $8.77 a share for all of 2014 vs. consensus estimate of $8.69. And he expects full-year 2015 earnings of $11 a share, compared with the consensus estimate of $10.62.In a separate initiation report, he rates Valspar (VAL) a sector perform. Valspar makes paints, varnishes and stains for the consumer market. He notes that Valspar is performing well in paints and coatings.However, he adds: ""Its premium brands require greater promotional spending at Lowe's Cos. (LOW) and other retailers.""We are also looking for a stronger recovery in global industrial production for meaningful upside earnings surprises.""Sherwin-Williams is part of IBD's Chemicals-Paints industry group. It has the group's highest Composite rating, 95 out of a possible 99. Valspar follows with a Composite rating of 90.In the Retail/Wholesale Building Products group, Lowe's has a CR of 89, second to rival Home Depot's (HD) 97.
"
231,SHW,"Jason Weiner is like Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.
"
232,SHW,"Season after season, he keeps performing at a high level.
"
233,SHW,"Since Feb. 2, 2007, when Weiner became the signal caller for the now $1.3 billion Fidelity Growth Discovery Fund and its adviser-sold twin $2.8 billion Advisor Equity Growth Fund , Growth Discovery has notched an 8.48% average annual gain vs. 7.03% for the S&P 500. Its performance ranks in the top 30% of its large-cap growth peers, tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
234,SHW,"Weiner has used the same approach for most if not all of his tenure, he says. He seeks undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, avoiding overly costly names.
"
235,SHW,"Weiner, 45 years old, talked with IBD from his office in Boston about how he invests.
"
236,SHW,"IBD: Jason, if you ever had a mentor, who was it?
"
237,SHW,"Weiner: I've had tons of mentors. On the rare occasions when (Fidelity) rolls me out to meet MBAs visiting Fidelity, I tell them they should find a mentor, either outside their workplace or inside, or preferably both.
"
238,SHW,"It's super important, going back to when I was 15 and had my first job. I got it from a family friend, Lou, who was a great influence. It was Lou Nargiso, and he owned a gas station-auto repair shop. He was a World War II vet, and he learned auto repair in the army.
"
239,SHW,"He was a very well-educated person and philosophical. He liked to debate things. Everyone who worked for Lou was very loyal to him, as was he to them. His shop was also kind of a clubhouse for his World War II vet buddies, and I hung out with them. Good times!
"
240,SHW,"IBD: And at Fidelity?
"
241,SHW,"Weiner: At Fidelity, Will Danoff (manager of Fidelity's $111.1 billion Contrafund , $28.9 billion Advisor New Insights , $6.4 billion Series Opportunistic Insights and $884.8 million Advisor Series Opportunistic Insights has been a great mentor.
"
242,SHW,"I don't remember exactly when it kicked off. It might have been around 1993. We were both on a train. Will was going to southern Connecticut, visiting his parents. We sat next to each other. I worked for him later. I gained a lot of wisdom. Will is super focused on studying each decade, understanding monster stocks in each decade, and being in the elephant-hunting business — hunting stocks that go on to make monster gains.
"
243,SHW,"If you owned Dell in 1990, for the next 10 years nothing else mattered. It's the beauty of incredible growth stories. Will was focused on that, and I have adopted that strategy.
"
244,SHW,"IBD: Overall, you look for undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, right?
"
245,SHW,"Weiner: You only get paid for two things with growth stocks. First, for P-E expansion. Second, for underlying earnings growth of the companies you invest in.
"
246,SHW,"Typically, I focus on the growth rate of companies. That's where fundamental research can bring value. And I try to leverage Fidelity's research engine a lot.
"
247,SHW,"It's a little harder to predict P-E.
"
248,SHW,"IBD: And you try to avoid valuations that are too high, correct?
"
249,SHW,"Weiner: If you can enter a name you like when there's controversy or doubt that casts its P-E lower, that's a great opportunity.
"
250,SHW,"IBD: Give me an example, please.
"
251,SHW,"Weiner: The best in recent years is Facebook (FB), after Facebook botched its IPO.
"
252,SHW,"The stock had gone public (at 38) and traded down immediately. It bottomed around 17 even though the company was doing great. But there were clouds of controversy that pummeled the stock.
"
253,SHW,"I bought after the IPO. I didn't buy it all on one day. My (average price per share) was in the 20s.
"
254,SHW,"While the stock was going down, the company was rolling out newsfeed ads. It seems like ancient history, but newsfeed ads are relatively new. About the time of the IPO, they stopped relying on ads for PC-based service and shifted to newsfeed ads that appeared on mobile devices. It was a fundamental transformation of their business model. That's Facebook's story today.
"
255,SHW,"IBD: Should people think of Growth Discovery as a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) strategy?
"
256,SHW,"Weiner: A lot of the fund would be recognizable as a GARP basket. That's OK. But in addition, I try to buy the best growth names in the market, the ones that are going to turn into big, sustainable, valuable franchises. That's a little different from GARP.
"
257,SHW,"My top 40 names are 65% of my assets. Not every name will become a brand-new, unbelievable franchise. Some already have great franchises. Some will become great. But if you look at every decade — and I know this from some of the publications that William O'Neil sends me — in the '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s and so on, and look at the monster stocks, there are never that many. I try to buy those sorts of names.
"
258,SHW,"IBD: You are allowed to invest in any market-cap size, but the fund has been large-cap oriented for a long time. Its heaviest weighting was in megacaps as of Sept. 30. Why those, why U.S. ones?
"
259,SHW,"Weiner: Let's take the U.S. piece first. The U.S. economy is doing better than the average developed nation's, so it's fortuitous to be U.S. investors in this day.
"
260,SHW,"And why so many megacaps? If you look at Internet models, the (successful) ones are global, scalable, enjoy incredible network effects and are viral. That's what we want.
"
261,SHW,"I point to Facebook. The biggest companies, like that, enjoy increased returns as they get bigger.
"
262,SHW,"If you were a manufacturer 50 years ago, you might have experienced decreasing returns for every single additional widget you made. They had to be sold at lower margins to incent the market to buy your product. In the Internet age, it's the opposite: increased returns.
"
263,SHW,"The other thing about the Internet is that it's a winner-takes-the-most dynamic. Google (GOOGL) is the leader in search. That is a winner-takes-all battle, and they won.
"
264,SHW,"It's to be determined in the OTA (online travel agency) space. You've got Facebook, Expedia (EXPE), TripAdvisor (TRIP) and a bunch of other ones. (This may also turn into a winner-takes-all space.) That's why we haven't invested in Priceline (PCLN). I have no skin in that game.
"
265,SHW,"IBD: Why did you boost your Apple (AAPL) weighting to 5.8% as of Oct. 31 from less than 1% as of March 31 and 2.3% as of June 30?
"
266,SHW,"Weiner: Full disclosure: I have not done a great job trading Apple in the last five years. I give myself low marks on that one. I can make a long list of Apple's positives and negatives. I've focused on the negatives in the last five years. I'm not going to do that any more.
"
267,SHW,"I live two blocks from an Apple store. When the iPhone 6 came out there was a line around the block. It was crazy. I can't ignore that.
"
268,SHW,"I could lecture about how smartphones are fully penetrated and the rate of innovation is slowing down. And how Android has outshipped Apple iOS five to one and usually the volume leader wins in tech. Actually, it always does! But the negatives haven't mattered (to Apple's stock performance).
"
269,SHW,"IBD: So you've decided — at least for the moment — that all is not lost for Apple?
"
270,SHW,"Weiner: One of the key buckets of stock I've avoided is large-cap tech legacy players: Oracle (ORCL), EMC (EMC), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Microsoft (MSFT) and on and on. I generally underweight them. I'm mindful that they have secular challenges. When that happens, you never know if they will catch up. IBM (IBM) for years faced them but somehow always punched out good earnings. But that may be changing. Last quarter was terrible for them.
"
271,SHW,"When secular challenges catch up to a company, it's all over. In the 1990s, I was a tech analyst covering Compaq, Tandem, Digital, Stratus, Data General. They faced secular challenges. When the wave hit, they fell over. They don't exist now (as independent companies).
"
272,SHW,"Apple is a huge, good legacy story relative to other legacy players. That's another justification for owning Apple.
"
273,SHW,"IBD: You held Illumina (ILMN) as of Oct. 31. You're a fan of the outlook for gene sequencing, right?
"
274,SHW,"Weiner: Yes. Illumina is an incredible company, helping to unlock the secrets of sequencing genomes for just $1,000. The way we practice medicine is changing because of companies like Illumina.
"
275,SHW,"If you look backwards, people were doing one human genome. Now they're sequencing thousands. In the future, you will have your genome when you go to the doctor. That's where Illumina comes in.
"
276,SHW,"IBD: Will Alexion (ALXN) remain a play on a single drug, Soliris?
"
277,SHW,"Weiner: My Alexion thesis (as of my latest disclosure) was this: they are a super orphan-drug company. They only go after indications with small patient populations, where they get a lot of money for life-saving drugs.
"
278,SHW,"They've increased the number of indications Soliris is sold for. And behind that there is another drug they're hoping for FDA approval for, for a new set of indications.
"
279,SHW,"It's hard for society to say it will not pay for a drug, and your child will live for only a couple of years. If society pays for the drug, your child will have a normal outcome. It's a big ethics debate. But bottom line: countries are paying for these drugs.
"
280,SHW,"IBD: How similar is Gilead's (GILD) story?
"
281,SHW,"Weiner: They have great risk-reward. They beat the competition. There will be others with cures for hepatitis C. They will get market share. But Gilead will get the majority market share. If you have hep C, you want this drug immediately.
"
282,SHW,"One knock against the drug is that some people don't like to invest in companies that cure a disease. Then the treatment is a one-shot deal. Some people say, 'Isn't it better to develop a treatment for HIV that requires patients to take a pill every day?' But there's still plenty of room for the hep C drug. There are millions of patients who don't have the drug yet.
"
283,SHW,"IBD: Chipotle's (CMG) earnings growth has accelerated for two quarters.
"
284,SHW,"Weiner: It's a great franchise with tons of room for growth. The secret is that people will pay more for food that they think is higher quality.
"
285,SHW,"IBD: What about Sherwin-Williams (SHW)?
"
286,SHW,"Weiner: This is one of the greatest companies that nobody recognizes.
"
287,SHW,"Their paint store franchise is so valuable. They're vertically integrated. Professional painters make their first daily stop at Sherwin-Williams, not Home Depot (HD) or Lowe's (LOW). They know how to treat pros. They have lots of pricing power. Material costs are not a big deal. Most (end users) are people restoring or remodeling homes. It does not depend on home sales.
"
288,SHW,"IBD: What drives Ulta Beauty (ULTA)?
"
289,SHW,"Weiner: What I like about Ulta is that beauty has high emotional content for women. Ulta gives them the ability to walk into a mall-based, completely dedicated beauty retailer and not have to walk halfway across a department store to get to a beauty counter. And Ulta has a growing number of prestige brands. Years ago, prestige brands wouldn't sell through them. Now they do.
"
290,SHW,"Beauty products have high margins. Profits, same-store sales, sales per square foot are all growing.
"
291,SHW,"Last year, profits had actually been muted. The CEO (Mary Dillon) is investing heavily in e-commerce. She told a credible story to the Street about what her investments can do, so people are on board.
"
292,SHW,"IBD: You were a fan of Alibaba (BABA) as of your latest disclosure, right?
"
293,SHW,"Weiner: Alibaba is like the legend with that name. In 100 years, people will talk about (CEO) Jack Ma in those terms. This is the e-commerce leader in China. Full stop. China is a big market that is growing.
"
294,SHW,"Jack Ma has done a very good job of building a huge business with massive gross merchandise value. He's attracted merchants with a low take rate. That means for a small or medium business, Alibaba is a great tool to grow your business.
"
295,SHW,"He also has G Mall, the place where global brands can sell in a safe place where there are no counterfeits there.
"

"
297,SHW,"Alibaba's gross merchandise value is larger than Amazon (AMZN) and eBay's (EBAY) combined.Jason Weiner is like Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.Season after season, he keeps performing at a high level.Since Feb. 2, 2007, when Weiner became the signal caller for the now $1.3 billion Fidelity Growth Discovery Fund and its adviser-sold twin $2.8 billion Advisor Equity Growth Fund , Growth Discovery has notched an 8.48% average annual gain vs. 7.03% for the S&P 500. Its performance ranks in the top 30% of its large-cap growth peers, tracked by Morningstar Inc.Weiner has used the same approach for most if not all of his tenure, he says. He seeks undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, avoiding overly costly names.Weiner, 45 years old, talked with IBD from his office in Boston about how he invests.IBD: Jason, if you ever had a mentor, who was it?Weiner: I've had tons of mentors. On the rare occasions when (Fidelity) rolls me out to meet MBAs visiting Fidelity, I tell them they should find a mentor, either outside their workplace or inside, or preferably both.It's super important, going back to when I was 15 and had my first job. I got it from a family friend, Lou, who was a great influence. It was Lou Nargiso, and he owned a gas station-auto repair shop. He was a World War II vet, and he learned auto repair in the army.He was a very well-educated person and philosophical. He liked to debate things. Everyone who worked for Lou was very loyal to him, as was he to them. His shop was also kind of a clubhouse for his World War II vet buddies, and I hung out with them. Good times!IBD: And at Fidelity?Weiner: At Fidelity, Will Danoff (manager of Fidelity's $111.1 billion Contrafund , $28.9 billion Advisor New Insights , $6.4 billion Series Opportunistic Insights and $884.8 million Advisor Series Opportunistic Insights has been a great mentor.I don't remember exactly when it kicked off. It might have been around 1993. We were both on a train. Will was going to southern Connecticut, visiting his parents. We sat next to each other. I worked for him later. I gained a lot of wisdom. Will is super focused on studying each decade, understanding monster stocks in each decade, and being in the elephant-hunting business — hunting stocks that go on to make monster gains.If you owned Dell in 1990, for the next 10 years nothing else mattered. It's the beauty of incredible growth stories. Will was focused on that, and I have adopted that strategy.IBD: Overall, you look for undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, right?Weiner: You only get paid for two things with growth stocks. First, for P-E expansion. Second, for underlying earnings growth of the companies you invest in.Typically, I focus on the growth rate of companies. That's where fundamental research can bring value. And I try to leverage Fidelity's research engine a lot.It's a little harder to predict P-E.IBD: And you try to avoid valuations that are too high, correct?Weiner: If you can enter a name you like when there's controversy or doubt that casts its P-E lower, that's a great opportunity.IBD: Give me an example, please.Weiner: The best in recent years is Facebook (FB), after Facebook botched its IPO.The stock had gone public (at 38) and traded down immediately. It bottomed around 17 even though the company was doing great. But there were clouds of controversy that pummeled the stock.I bought after the IPO. I didn't buy it all on one day. My (average price per share) was in the 20s.While the stock was going down, the company was rolling out newsfeed ads. It seems like ancient history, but newsfeed ads are relatively new. About the time of the IPO, they stopped relying on ads for PC-based service and shifted to newsfeed ads that appeared on mobile devices. It was a fundamental transformation of their business model. That's Facebook's story today.IBD: Should people think of Growth Discovery as a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) strategy?Weiner: A lot of the fund would be recognizable as a GARP basket. That's OK. But in addition, I try to buy the best growth names in the market, the ones that are going to turn into big, sustainable, valuable franchises. That's a little different from GARP.My top 40 names are 65% of my assets. Not every name will become a brand-new, unbelievable franchise. Some already have great franchises. Some will become great. But if you look at every decade — and I know this from some of the publications that William O'Neil sends me — in the '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s and so on, and look at the monster stocks, there are never that many. I try to buy those sorts of names.IBD: You are allowed to invest in any market-cap size, but the fund has been large-cap oriented for a long time. Its heaviest weighting was in megacaps as of Sept. 30. Why those, why U.S. ones?Weiner: Let's take the U.S. piece first. The U.S. economy is doing better than the average developed nation's, so it's fortuitous to be U.S. investors in this day.And why so many megacaps? If you look at Internet models, the (successful) ones are global, scalable, enjoy incredible network effects and are viral. That's what we want.I point to Facebook. The biggest companies, like that, enjoy increased returns as they get bigger.If you were a manufacturer 50 years ago, you might have experienced decreasing returns for every single additional widget you made. They had to be sold at lower margins to incent the market to buy your product. In the Internet age, it's the opposite: increased returns.The other thing about the Internet is that it's a winner-takes-the-most dynamic. Google (GOOGL) is the leader in search. That is a winner-takes-all battle, and they won.It's to be determined in the OTA (online travel agency) space. You've got Facebook, Expedia (EXPE), TripAdvisor (TRIP) and a bunch of other ones. (This may also turn into a winner-takes-all space.) That's why we haven't invested in Priceline (PCLN). I have no skin in that game.IBD: Why did you boost your Apple (AAPL) weighting to 5.8% as of Oct. 31 from less than 1% as of March 31 and 2.3% as of June 30?Weiner: Full disclosure: I have not done a great job trading Apple in the last five years. I give myself low marks on that one. I can make a long list of Apple's positives and negatives. I've focused on the negatives in the last five years. I'm not going to do that any more.I live two blocks from an Apple store. When the iPhone 6 came out there was a line around the block. It was crazy. I can't ignore that.I could lecture about how smartphones are fully penetrated and the rate of innovation is slowing down. And how Android has outshipped Apple iOS five to one and usually the volume leader wins in tech. Actually, it always does! But the negatives haven't mattered (to Apple's stock performance).IBD: So you've decided — at least for the moment — that all is not lost for Apple?Weiner: One of the key buckets of stock I've avoided is large-cap tech legacy players: Oracle (ORCL), EMC (EMC), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Microsoft (MSFT) and on and on. I generally underweight them. I'm mindful that they have secular challenges. When that happens, you never know if they will catch up. IBM (IBM) for years faced them but somehow always punched out good earnings. But that may be changing. Last quarter was terrible for them.When secular challenges catch up to a company, it's all over. In the 1990s, I was a tech analyst covering Compaq, Tandem, Digital, Stratus, Data General. They faced secular challenges. When the wave hit, they fell over. They don't exist now (as independent companies).Apple is a huge, good legacy story relative to other legacy players. That's another justification for owning Apple.IBD: You held Illumina (ILMN) as of Oct. 31. You're a fan of the outlook for gene sequencing, right?Weiner: Yes. Illumina is an incredible company, helping to unlock the secrets of sequencing genomes for just $1,000. The way we practice medicine is changing because of companies like Illumina.If you look backwards, people were doing one human genome. Now they're sequencing thousands. In the future, you will have your genome when you go to the doctor. That's where Illumina comes in.IBD: Will Alexion (ALXN) remain a play on a single drug, Soliris?Weiner: My Alexion thesis (as of my latest disclosure) was this: they are a super orphan-drug company. They only go after indications with small patient populations, where they get a lot of money for life-saving drugs.They've increased the number of indications Soliris is sold for. And behind that there is another drug they're hoping for FDA approval for, for a new set of indications.It's hard for society to say it will not pay for a drug, and your child will live for only a couple of years. If society pays for the drug, your child will have a normal outcome. It's a big ethics debate. But bottom line: countries are paying for these drugs.IBD: How similar is Gilead's (GILD) story?Weiner: They have great risk-reward. They beat the competition. There will be others with cures for hepatitis C. They will get market share. But Gilead will get the majority market share. If you have hep C, you want this drug immediately.One knock against the drug is that some people don't like to invest in companies that cure a disease. Then the treatment is a one-shot deal. Some people say, 'Isn't it better to develop a treatment for HIV that requires patients to take a pill every day?' But there's still plenty of room for the hep C drug. There are millions of patients who don't have the drug yet.IBD: Chipotle's (CMG) earnings growth has accelerated for two quarters.Weiner: It's a great franchise with tons of room for growth. The secret is that people will pay more for food that they think is higher quality.IBD: What about Sherwin-Williams (SHW)?Weiner: This is one of the greatest companies that nobody recognizes.Their paint store franchise is so valuable. They're vertically integrated. Professional painters make their first daily stop at Sherwin-Williams, not Home Depot (HD) or Lowe's (LOW). They know how to treat pros. They have lots of pricing power. Material costs are not a big deal. Most (end users) are people restoring or remodeling homes. It does not depend on home sales.IBD: What drives Ulta Beauty (ULTA)?Weiner: What I like about Ulta is that beauty has high emotional content for women. Ulta gives them the ability to walk into a mall-based, completely dedicated beauty retailer and not have to walk halfway across a department store to get to a beauty counter. And Ulta has a growing number of prestige brands. Years ago, prestige brands wouldn't sell through them. Now they do.Beauty products have high margins. Profits, same-store sales, sales per square foot are all growing.Last year, profits had actually been muted. The CEO (Mary Dillon) is investing heavily in e-commerce. She told a credible story to the Street about what her investments can do, so people are on board.IBD: You were a fan of Alibaba (BABA) as of your latest disclosure, right?Weiner: Alibaba is like the legend with that name. In 100 years, people will talk about (CEO) Jack Ma in those terms. This is the e-commerce leader in China. Full stop. China is a big market that is growing.Jack Ma has done a very good job of building a huge business with massive gross merchandise value. He's attracted merchants with a low take rate. That means for a small or medium business, Alibaba is a great tool to grow your business.He also has G Mall, the place where global brands can sell in a safe place where there are no counterfeits there.And he's got payments and financial services in his back pocket.Alibaba's gross merchandise value is larger than Amazon (AMZN) and eBay's (EBAY) combined.

327,SHW,"Valspar CEO Gary Hendrickson paints a bright picture of the company's business, which dates back to 1806. Recent buys, market share gains, expanded distribution and a strong showing in hot spots such as China put it on a path to grow.
"
328,SHW,"A maker of paints, varnishes and stains for the consumer market, Valspar (VAL) also sells industrial coatings for the automotive sector and equipment manufacturers. Some of its products go into floor finishes and others into packaging, such as food and beverage cans.
"
329,SHW,"The company has shown five straight quarters of double-digit-percentage earnings growth. In its third quarter of fiscal 2014, which ended July 25, earnings per share rose 13% from a year earlier to $1.21. Sales gained 10% to $1.2 billion.
"
330,SHW,"Prospects remain rosy: Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings will climb 16% to $4.12 a share for all of fiscal 2014, which ends in October. They forecast the same growth rate in earnings for fiscal 2015 and 12% for fiscal 2016.
"
331,SHW,"These expectations follow a nice pop in key overseas markets for Valspar and the 2013 acquisitions of Ace Hardware's paint-manufacturing assets and Inver Group, an industrial coatings maker in Europe.
"
332,SHW,"""In the short term, paints has been a fast growing segment because of the acquisition of Ace Hardware we did last year and a couple of other growth initiatives,"" Hendrickson told IBD. ""Our coatings business has done extraordinarily well with growth in the last quarter of 16%.""
"
333,SHW,"How Ace Hardware Helps
"
334,SHW,"Besides acquiring Ace Hardware's manufacturing assets, Valspar signed a long-term deal to supply Ace-branded paint products and make a comprehensive line of Valspar-branded paints available to more than 4,000 Ace retail stores in the U.S. It launched Valspar ""paint studio"" displays in more than 3,200 Ace Hardware stores in May.
"
335,SHW,"Overall, says Hendrickson, Valspar's paints segment is about $1.6 billion in sales and global in nature. Its market share is No. 2 in Australia and No. 3 in China.
"
336,SHW,"Valspar is the third in size by market cap of four companies in IBD's Chemicals-Paints industry group, after PPG Industries (PPG) and Sherwin-Williams Co. (SHW), and before RPM International (RPM). Valspar gets the highest IBD Composite Rating among them, 93 of a possible 99.
"
337,SHW,"Valspar's deal with Ace brought a lot to the table.
"
338,SHW,"""Our agreement with Ace extends the Valspar brand while further strengthening and diversifying Valspar's industry-leading consumer paints in the North American market,"" Hendrickson said in a statement announcing the arrangement, in January 2013. ""This new business also positions Valspar well for further growth as the U.S. housing market continues to recover.""
"
339,SHW,"Hendrickson says for Valspar to be a national brand, it needed to be widely distributed.
"
340,SHW,"""Prior to the deal our distribution was mainly with Lowe's,"" he added. ""The Ace deal gave us a national distribution partner and a new platform to advertise the brand.""
"
341,SHW,"Because it's still relatively early days yet, the Ace deal hasn't yet contributed to profitability, says Hendrickson. It was dilutive to profits in the first half of 2014, and will be slightly accretive in the second half and accretive in 2015, he says.
"
342,SHW,"Sales in the paints segment increased 4% from a year earlier in Valspar's third quarter to $474 million, led by performance in China and Australia. The May launch of Valspar Reserve Paint + Primer ""super premium paint"" in 1,715 Lowe's (LOW) stores in the U.S. also contributed to the gain.
"
343,SHW,"China And Australia Sales Lift
"
344,SHW,"Hendrickson says Valspar's paints business has seen strong growth in China, where the company serves domestic industries and its largest business is consumer paint sold into the housing market.
"
345,SHW,"In Australia third-quarter sales grew high single digits in local currency, Valspar's best sales growth in Australia since it acquired its business there in 2010.
"
346,SHW,"Year-to-date through the third quarter, the coatings segment has had the highest growth driven by the Inver acquisition, wood coatings and packaging coatings.
"
347,SHW,"About 55% of sales are from coatings and 40% from paints.
"
348,SHW,"Valspar acquired the family-owned Inver for an undisclosed amount. Inver specializes in liquid and powder coatings as well as resin products used in applications such as auto and off-road parts and railways. It posted around $200 million in sales in 2012.
"
349,SHW,"Designs On Europe
"
350,SHW,"Hendrickson says prior to the Inver buy Valspar was a ""small player in the $6 billion, extremely fragmented"" industrial coatings market in Europe. The buy gave Valspar scale.
"
351,SHW,"""With Inver, we went from being a smaller player to the No. 2 or No. 3 player ,"" Hendrickson said.
"
352,SHW,"Valspar saw synergies from the buy. It consolidated the two companies' supply chains, closed several redundant factories and ""got the cost structure to a place where it could be competitive,"" he added.
"
353,SHW,"The Inver buy gave Valspar an opportunity to restructure its European operation and to scale up, says KeyBanc analyst Ivan Marcuse.
"
354,SHW,"""Take the Inver acquisition, the Ace business, how successful Valspar is at Lowe's and the improvement in the China and Australia businesses, and it adds up to be pretty (meaningful),"" he said. ""The combination of all these things — plus its other core businesses doing better — allows sales and earnings to grow at a pretty decent rate, which helps to explain the recent share performance.""
"
355,SHW,"The Inver buy allowed Valspar to expand in Europe ""at a good time in the cycle when Europe should be recovering,"" adds CLSA analyst Nils-Bertil Wallin.
"
356,SHW,"Hendrickson, a 20 year-veteran of Valspar, took the paint and coatings maker's helm in 2011 in the wake of a three-year restructuring program he helped develop, which set the company on a growth path again after the recession caused a slowdown in its markets and business.
"
357,SHW,"The program focused on improving the company's cost structure via efforts such as exiting some commodity businesses in order to give it the resources to invest in the businesses it wanted to be in for the long term, says Hendrickson. Valspar has now delivered double-digit-percentage earnings growth in all but four of the past 15 quarters. 
"
358,SHW,"""We simply stuck to our knitting,"" he said. ""We are a paint company and a materials company to a smaller extent and we haven't branched out beyond that.""
"
359,SHW,"Valspar has done more than 20 acquisitions in the last decade. Historically, that's how the company has grown, a method ""part and parcel the nature of"" the fragmented coatings market, Wallin says. And Valspar has been good at buys. 
"
360,SHW,"""It's been able to take a company that may not have been run efficiently and add an element of expertise,"" Wallin said. He estimates about 60% of the company's growth until end of 2012 was through acquisitions.
"
361,SHW,"""That's changed as the market has changed. They went from mainly acquisition growth to organic growth,"" he said. ""From an investor's perspective the shift from acquisition to organic growth could be interpreted as a change in strategy. But it makes sense if the company wants to grow, given its lack of company-owned stores.""
"
362,SHW,"That organic growth includes efforts such as bringing Valspar paint into Ace Hardware stores.
"
363,SHW,"Acquisitions are still a key part of Hendrickson's growth strategy: ""We are talking with a lot of people (about buyouts) all the time,"" he said. ""But the timing of the deals is not normally under our control.""
"
364,SHW,"Meanwhile, Hendrickson sees a lot of potential for Valspar when existing-home sales pick up further, noting they are just ""OK"" now.
"
365,SHW,"""I feel like we'll be in a great spot with our paints business and some of our industrial business when the housing market gets more steam behind it,"" he said.Valspar CEO Gary Hendrickson paints a bright picture of the company's business, which dates back to 1806. Recent buys, market share gains, expanded distribution and a strong showing in hot spots such as China put it on a path to grow.A maker of paints, varnishes and stains for the consumer market, Valspar (VAL) also sells industrial coatings for the automotive sector and equipment manufacturers. Some of its products go into floor finishes and others into packaging, such as food and beverage cans.The company has shown five straight quarters of double-digit-percentage earnings growth. In its third quarter of fiscal 2014, which ended July 25, earnings per share rose 13% from a year earlier to $1.21. Sales gained 10% to $1.2 billion.Prospects remain rosy: Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings will climb 16% to $4.12 a share for all of fiscal 2014, which ends in October. They forecast the same growth rate in earnings for fiscal 2015 and 12% for fiscal 2016.These expectations follow a nice pop in key overseas markets for Valspar and the 2013 acquisitions of Ace Hardware's paint-manufacturing assets and Inver Group, an industrial coatings maker in Europe.""In the short term, paints has been a fast growing segment because of the acquisition of Ace Hardware we did last year and a couple of other growth initiatives,"" Hendrickson told IBD. ""Our coatings business has done extraordinarily well with growth in the last quarter of 16%.""How Ace Hardware HelpsBesides acquiring Ace Hardware's manufacturing assets, Valspar signed a long-term deal to supply Ace-branded paint products and make a comprehensive line of Valspar-branded paints available to more than 4,000 Ace retail stores in the U.S. It launched Valspar ""paint studio"" displays in more than 3,200 Ace Hardware stores in May.Overall, says Hendrickson, Valspar's paints segment is about $1.6 billion in sales and global in nature. Its market share is No. 2 in Australia and No. 3 in China.Valspar is the third in size by market cap of four companies in IBD's Chemicals-Paints industry group, after PPG Industries (PPG) and Sherwin-Williams Co. (SHW), and before RPM International (RPM). Valspar gets the highest IBD Composite Rating among them, 93 of a possible 99.Valspar's deal with Ace brought a lot to the table.""Our agreement with Ace extends the Valspar brand while further strengthening and diversifying Valspar's industry-leading consumer paints in the North American market,"" Hendrickson said in a statement announcing the arrangement, in January 2013. ""This new business also positions Valspar well for further growth as the U.S. housing market continues to recover.""Hendrickson says for Valspar to be a national brand, it needed to be widely distributed.""Prior to the deal our distribution was mainly with Lowe's,"" he added. ""The Ace deal gave us a national distribution partner and a new platform to advertise the brand.""Because it's still relatively early days yet, the Ace deal hasn't yet contributed to profitability, says Hendrickson. It was dilutive to profits in the first half of 2014, and will be slightly accretive in the second half and accretive in 2015, he says.Sales in the paints segment increased 4% from a year earlier in Valspar's third quarter to $474 million, led by performance in China and Australia. The May launch of Valspar Reserve Paint + Primer ""super premium paint"" in 1,715 Lowe's (LOW) stores in the U.S. also contributed to the gain.China And Australia Sales LiftHendrickson says Valspar's paints business has seen strong growth in China, where the company serves domestic industries and its largest business is consumer paint sold into the housing market.In Australia third-quarter sales grew high single digits in local currency, Valspar's best sales growth in Australia since it acquired its business there in 2010.Year-to-date through the third quarter, the coatings segment has had the highest growth driven by the Inver acquisition, wood coatings and packaging coatings.About 55% of sales are from coatings and 40% from paints.Valspar acquired the family-owned Inver for an undisclosed amount. Inver specializes in liquid and powder coatings as well as resin products used in applications such as auto and off-road parts and railways. It posted around $200 million in sales in 2012.Designs On EuropeHendrickson says prior to the Inver buy Valspar was a ""small player in the $6 billion, extremely fragmented"" industrial coatings market in Europe. The buy gave Valspar scale.""With Inver, we went from being a smaller player to the No. 2 or No. 3 player ,"" Hendrickson said.Valspar saw synergies from the buy. It consolidated the two companies' supply chains, closed several redundant factories and ""got the cost structure to a place where it could be competitive,"" he added.The Inver buy gave Valspar an opportunity to restructure its European operation and to scale up, says KeyBanc analyst Ivan Marcuse.""Take the Inver acquisition, the Ace business, how successful Valspar is at Lowe's and the improvement in the China and Australia businesses, and it adds up to be pretty (meaningful),"" he said. ""The combination of all these things — plus its other core businesses doing better — allows sales and earnings to grow at a pretty decent rate, which helps to explain the recent share performance.""The Inver buy allowed Valspar to expand in Europe ""at a good time in the cycle when Europe should be recovering,"" adds CLSA analyst Nils-Bertil Wallin.Hendrickson, a 20 year-veteran of Valspar, took the paint and coatings maker's helm in 2011 in the wake of a three-year restructuring program he helped develop, which set the company on a growth path again after the recession caused a slowdown in its markets and business.The program focused on improving the company's cost structure via efforts such as exiting some commodity businesses in order to give it the resources to invest in the businesses it wanted to be in for the long term, says Hendrickson. Valspar has now delivered double-digit-percentage earnings growth in all but four of the past 15 quarters. ""We simply stuck to our knitting,"" he said.

385,SHW,"The PowerShares DWA Industrials Momentum Portfolio (PRN  -  Free Report) made its debut on 10/12/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Industrials ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.But, there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies, and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market.These indexes attempt to select stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance, based on certain fundamental characteristics or a combination of such characteristics.This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor & IndexThe fund is managed by Invesco Powershares, and has been able to amass over $114.83 M, which makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Industrials ETFs. This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the DWA Industrials Technical Leaders Index before fees and expenses.The DWA Industrials Technical Leaders Index identifies companies that are showing relative strength and are composed of at least 30 common stocks from a universe of approximately 3,000 common stocks traded on US exchanges.Cost & Other ExpensesWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.60%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.PRN's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 0.60%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsMost ETFs are very transparent products, and disclose their holdings on a daily basis. ETFs also offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, though it's still important for investors to research a fund's holdings.Representing 72.10% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector; Information Technology and Materials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Jb Hunt Transport Services Inc (JBHT  -  Free Report) accounts for about 4.87% of total assets, followed by Ametek Inc (AME  -  Free Report) and Sherwin-Williams Co/the (SHW  -  Free Report).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 38.53% of PRN's total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF has lost about -0.85% so far this year and is up roughly 14.48% in the last one year (as of 05/30/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $53.19 and $64.80.The ETF has a beta of 1.23 and standard deviation of 15.27% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium choice in the space. With about 42 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers.AlternativesPowerShares DWA Industrials Momentum Portfolio is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Industrials ETFs segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.Vanguard Industrials ETF (VIS  -  Free Report) tracks MSCI US Investable Market Industrials 25/50 Index and the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI  -  Free Report) tracks Industrial Select Sector Index.

Its cost-control initiatives, working capital reductions, supply chain optimization and productivity improvement should also continue to yield margin benefits. Working capital management and efforts to cut operating costs are also helping the company generate healthy cash flows. Cost control actions also contributed to an expansion in operating margins in the company’s Americas Group unit in the first quarter.The Valspar acquisition also allowed Sherwin-Williams to strengthen its position as a leading paints and coatings provider globally, leveraging highly complementary offerings, strong brands and technologies. The buyout will extend Sherwin-Williams’ brand portfolio and customer relationships in North America and bolster its global finishes business. Sherwin-Williams expects to achieve $320 million in annual run-rate synergies by the end of 2018, which is expected to provide a benefit of $140-$160 million to its bottom line.Sherwin-Williams expects mid-to-high single digit percentage increase in net sales year over year for second-quarter 2018. It also sees incremental sales from Valspar acquisition to be around $600 million for April and May, in the quarter.

Sherwin-Williams expects charges related to the Valspar acquisition to be $3.40-$3.50 per share for 2018.The company, in April, also lowered its earnings per share guidance for 2018 to the range of $14.95 to $15.45 per share from its earlier view of $15.35 to $15.85 per share factoring in a 40 cents per share net reduction associated with an expanded customer agreement, mostly affecting the Valspar business.Moreover, Sherwin-Williams remains exposed to raw material cost pressure. The company has witnessed a spike in raw material costs in the first quarter, mostly affecting its Performance Coatings unit. It sees higher year over year input costs in first-half 2018 and projects average inflation to be in the 4% to 6% band.The Sherwin-Williams Company Price and Consensus The Sherwin-Williams Company Price and Consensus | The Sherwin-Williams Company QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderSherwin-Williams currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked companies in the basic materials space are FMC Corporation (FMC  -  Free Report), Huntsman Corporation (HUN  -  Free Report) and The Chemours Company (CC  -  Free Report).

387,SHW,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for The Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 1.9% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is SHW due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Sherwin-Williams' Q1 Earnings Top Estimates, Cuts Profit ViewSherwin-Williams logged net income (as reported) of $2.62 per share for the first quarter of 2018, up around 4% from $2.53 per share recorded a year ago.Adjusted earnings (barring acquisition-related costs) for the quarter came in at $3.57 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.14.Sherwin-Williams posted record first-quarter revenues of $3,965 million, up roughly 44% year over year. Sales were driven by the addition of Valspar sales, higher selling prices and increased paint sales volumes in the Americas Group unit. Revenues, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,984 million.Segment ReviewThe Americas Group unit registered net sales of $2.08 billion in the reported quarter, up around 7% on a year over year comparison basis. Revenues were driven by increased architectural paint sales volume across most end markets and higher selling prices.  Net sales of the Consumer Brands Group unit surged around 103% to $656.4 million, driven by the addition of Valspar sales and higher pricing, partly masked by reduced volume sales to some of the unit’s retail customers. Valspar sales increased the division’s net sales by around 108.3% in the quarter.Net sales from the Performance Coatings Group zoomed around 153% to $1.23 billion in the quarter owing to inclusion of Valspar sales and higher selling prices. Valspar sales contributed roughly 148% to the segment’s net sales in the quarter.Financials and Shareholder ReturnsSherwin-Williams purchased 600,000 shares of its common stock during the first quarter. At the end of the quarter, it had remaining authorization to purchase 11.05 million shares through open market purchases.OutlookMoving ahead, Sherwin-Williams projects mid-to-high single digit percentage increase in net sales year over year for second-quarter 2018. It also sees incremental sales from Valspar acquisition to be around $600 million for April and May in the quarter.For full-year 2018, Sherwin-Williams projects mid-to-high single digit percentage increase in net sales from 2017. It also sees incremental sales from the Valspar buyout to be roughly $1.7 billion for the first five months of the year.At this sales level, the company now expects earnings per share for the year to be in the range of $14.95 to $15.45 per share, down from its earlier view of $15.35 to $15.85 per share. The revised guidance includes a 40 cents per share net reduction associated with an expanded customer agreement, mostly affecting the Valspar business. The guidance also includes a $3.40-$3.50 per share charge related to the Valspar acquisition.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimate. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to seven lower.The Sherwin-Williams Company Price and Consensus  The Sherwin-Williams Company Price and Consensus | The Sherwin-Williams Company QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, SHW has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum is doing a bit better with a B. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is more suitable for momentum investors than those looking for value and growth.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

389,SHW,"Sales of U.S. new homes increased better-than-expected in March, according to data released by the Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development on Tuesday. Moreover, sales of existing homes too jumped for the second consecutive month in March, according to the National Association for Realtors (NAR). This is a clear indication that an increasing number of Americans prefer buying homes.Moreover, consumer confidence rebounded in April to a level close to the 18-year high it had hit in February. Understandably, the jump in sales of both new homes and existing homes hint at the underlying strength in the economy, increasing wages, higher number of jobs, greater spending power and high consumer confidence, despite signs of slow growth in the first quarter. Given this backdrop, it makes good sense to invest in stocks that are poised to gain from strong housing data.Sales of New Homes and Existing Homes RiseSales of U.S. new single-family homes jumped 4% to a seasonally adjusted rate of 694,000 units in March. The rise was mainly due to a 28.3% increase in sales in the West, the highest level in almost 12 years. Moreover, the South, which accounts for the maximum number of new home sales, rose 0.8%. The Department of Commerce also revised the February sales pace to 667,000 units from the previously reported 618,000 units. This also indicates higher first-quarter demand than previously expected by analysts and economists.Meanwhile, existing home sales too grew 1.1% on a month-over-month basis in March, suggesting that buyer sentiment is high despite the dwindling number of properties available in the market. Per NAR, existing homes sold in March on a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 5.60 million compared with 5.54 million in February. The robust growth can be attributed to impressive sales in the Midwest and Northeast, which was a reversal from the declines witnessed due to weather-related issues in February.Housing Starts Rise, Homebuilder Confidence Remains StrongHousing starts and building permits data too came in better-than-expected in March. Housing starts grew 1.9% to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.319 million, surpassing expectations of 1.267 million. The surge can be attributed to a 3.7% jump in multifamily starts.Also, building permits rose 2.5% to a rate of 1.354 million, surpassing expectations by 33,000. The strong data can be credited to robust growth in the West, with starts growing 34.2% through the first three months of 2018 on a year-over-year basis, while single-family starts grew 26.5%. The overall starts through the first three months of the year grew 8% compared with year-ago period.That said, National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) Housing Market Index’s (HMI) latest reading is 69, 1 down from March.  However, it is well above the 50 mark, which indicates a favorable outlook. It can thus be said that the sector is well on track to witness steady growth.Our ChoicesThe latest data, which reflects a rise in sale of existing homes and new homes, is a clear indication that an increasing number of people are showing interest in buying homes. Strong demand for housing is also keeping builders optimistic about the future market conditions. Also, housing starts and building permits too saw impressive growth in March, which makes the industry outlook bullish.Strong homebuilder confidence, increase in wages, higher number of jobs, greater spending power, unemployment level at a 17-year low and a bullish economic outlook are also signs that the housing market is on a steady growth path. Naturally, investing in stocks that are likely to gain from strong housing data looks like a good option at this point.

Earnings per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents.Higher adjusted net earnings were mainly due to 10% decrease in direct mining costs, driven by lower costs at Pueblo Viejo and Barrick Nevada, higher sales from low-cost operations at Barrick Nevada and lower relative sales from Turquoise Ridge and Acacia compared to the year-ago quarter. Higher gold and copper sales volumes along with higher copper prices also contributed to robust earnings which were partly offset by higher depreciation, increase in tax expense and increase in evaluation and exploration costs.Revenues rose roughly 7.3% year over year to $2,160 million in the reported quarter.

395,SHW,"The construction sector is in fine fettle buoyed by robust gains from home building investments, strong economic growth and recent tax reforms. That said, political and economic uncertainties continue to affect the sector. One such obstacle is the recent imposition of tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. An increase in import tariff will escalate raw material cost for builders, which are grappling with increased cost, thanks to the imposition of lumber tariff. This, along with high cost of land and labor and mortgage rate hikes, raises concern.Spending on construction projects in the United States inched up marginally in February, after a flat January. However, the figure logged an annual growth rate of 3%, as revealed by the Commerce Department. The solid labor market along with robust consumer confidence supported an increase in non-residential (lodging and office) construction.Positives such as an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment and positive consumer confidence work in favor of the sector. President Trump had vowed to double economic growth through an ambitious stimulus program featuring tax cuts, deregulation and higher infrastructure spending.Per a study by Dodge Data & Analytics, new construction starts in March increased 11% from the previous month, marking the highest level over the past six months. The considerable improvement followed modest declines in January (down 2%) and February (down 3%). Overall, in the first quarter of 2018, though total construction starts on an unadjusted basis were down 7% from the year-ago quarter, it rose 1% year over year.The implications of the metal tariffs and mortgage hike are yet to be felt in the sector that has occupied the second position out of 16 sectors based on our in-house classification.

400,SHW,"(0:30) - Warren Buffett Thoughts On Cyptocurrency(4:15) - Emerging Technology: Boom or Bust(8:30) - Buffett's 3 Ways The Market Could Keep Rising(11:45) - How To Play The Market Like Buffett(15:15) - Tracey's Top Picks: Old School Winners(22:00) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comWelcome to Episode #77 of the Value Investor PodcastEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio service, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.Recently, Warren Buffett gave an interview on CNBC where anchor Becky Quick asked him about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.He answered that he didn’t own any, wasn’t short any and would never have a position in them. Buffett then went on to say that they will come to a “bad ending” but he didn’t know when or how it would happen.As you can imagine, he immediately came under attack from those in the crypto community for being out-of-touch, too old, and ignorant.It’s nearly the identical response dot-commers had to his comments in the late 1990s.Picking Winners in Emerging TechnologiesWhen a new technology bursts on the scene, there are always dozens of competitors. After all, it’s seen as a gold rush and some people will get rich off of what is new.In the 1800s, there were hundreds of railroads in the United States. But now, there are less than 10 big commercial railroad companies.Similarly, there were thousands of automobile manufacturers and hundreds of domestic airlines when cars and airplanes came on the scene in the early 1900s.But, again, today, the “winners” have won the contest. There are only a handful of big names in those industries. They are the survivors.With cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, it’s so new, there’s no way of knowing who the winners may be. Buffett’s strategy, then, is to simply avoid those emerging technologies until winners can be determined.Investing in the Old-School WinnersWhy not invest in those that have become the winners in the older industries?These companies, some of whom have survived for nearly two hundred years, are clearly doing something right.1.      General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) is one of the original Dow Industrial components. Becky Quick asked Buffett about GE in their interview but he wouldn’t say, due to compliance issues, if he was buying now that shares have plunged. Is it even cheap enough? It still has a forward P/E of 18.3.2.     Masco (MAS  -  Free Report) makes plumbing parts like faucets, paints, cabinets and countertops. Founded in 1929, it now has a $14 billion market cap. Earnings are expected to rise 18% in 2018 after jumping about 29% in 2017.3.     Fortune Brands Home & Security (FBHS  -  Free Report) makes cabinets and plumbing, including the Moen brand, but it also makes doors and security devices such as padlocks by Master Lock. With a $10 billion market cap, it’s expected to see double digit earnings growth in both 2017 and 2018.4.     Sherwin Williams (SHW  -  Free Report) recently acquired Valspar and is now one of the largest paint manufacturers in the world. Founded in 1866 in Cleveland, it’s still producing double digit earnings growth all of these years later with analysts expecting earnings to pop 25.5% in 2018.5.     Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report) traces its roots all the way back to 1837 in Moline, Illinois. This agriculture and construction equipment giant has had a few tough years as farmers cut back on their equipment spending but is turning it around with fiscal 2018 earnings expected to jump 22%.Sometimes, for investors, the tried and true is just as attractive as the shiny and new.What else should you know about why Buffett is avoiding bitcoin and thinks the market isn’t over valued?Tune into this week’s podcast to find out.Exclusive Buffett Report for Podcast ListenersWhat 3 secrets drive the success of arguably the world's greatest value investor?

The segment’s profit reflects a better product mix, cost structure improvements and higher volumes.The Flat-Rolled Products (FRP) segment’s sales rose 13% year over year to $353.8 million on the back of improved pricing for both high-value and standard stainless products and higher volumes. Segment operating profit was $2.9 million against operating loss of $31.8 million in the year-ago quarter.

Further, the company expects the unit to continue to deliver a low-double-digit level of operating margin.The FRP unit is expected to continue to witness operational improvements in the third-quarter on the back of improved product mix.

Sales were driven by increased paint sales volumes in the Americas Group unit and the Valspar acquisition.The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, while missed twice, delivering an average positive surprise of around 0.8%.Shares of Sherwin-Williams have moved up 22.1% over a year, outperforming the industry’s 19% gain. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlaySherwin-Williams, in its fourth-quarter 2017 call, said that it sees mid-to-high single digit percentage increase in net sales year over year for first-quarter 2018.

At this level, the company expects earnings per share for the year to be in the range of $15.35 to $15.85 per share, compared with $18.67 earned in 2017. The guidance includes around $3.45 per share charge related to the Valspar acquisition.The Valspar acquisition has enabled Sherwin-Williams to strengthen its position as a leading paints and coatings provider globally, leveraging highly complementary offerings, strong brands and technologies. Sherwin-Williams should gain from significant synergies of the acquisition. The company expects to achieve $320 million in annual run-rate synergies by the end of 2018.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for consolidated net sales for Sherwin-Williams for the first quarter is $3,984 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of around 44.3%.Net sales from the Americas Group segment for the first quarter is projected to decrease roughly 4.1% from the fourth quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is currently pegged at $2,100 million.Net sales from the Consumer Brands Group segment for the first quarter is projected to increase roughly 14.2% sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is currently pegged at $653 million.Net sales from the Performance Coatings Group segment for the first quarter is projected to decrease roughly 2.3% from the fourth quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is currently pegged at $1,190 million.Sherwin-Williams’ cost control initiatives, working capital reductions, supply chain optimization and productivity improvement should yield margin benefits. Working capital management and efforts to cut operating costs are also helping the company to generate healthy cash flows. Moreover, addition of Valspar-related sales should continue to support the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.However, the company faces headwinds from higher raw materials costs.

The company expects higher year over year input costs in first-half 2018 and projects average inflation to be in the 4% to 6% band for this year.

404,SHW,"With the official start to the Q4 earnings season less than two weeks away, let’s take a look at how the construction sector is placed in this upbeat market.The construction sector has been stable through 2017 on sustainable growth despite multiple challenges. Spending on construction was up 4.2% year over year in the first 11 months of 2017, per the latest U.S. Census Bureau report.Optimism surrounding the sector grew manifold post President Trump’s victory as one of his key priorities has been driving infrastructure investments. Although spending on government projects declined 3.4% year to date, it grew 3% in October, the highest monthly gain in three years, with spending at the federal, state and local levels rising.The sector has seen a strong year mainly on the back of robust gains from home building investments. Homebuilding spending has increased 6.6% so far this year. Confidence level among the nation's homebuilders ended 2017 on a high note as the housing market index (HMI) was at 74 in December. This marks the highest reading since 1999.Although challenges in the housing industry persist in the form of low supply levels/limited listings, adverse impact of hurricanes as well as rising prices, factors like strong consumer confidence, favorable demographics, pent-up demand, job gains and income growth work in favor.Again, the rebound in the U.S. economy along with a decline in unemployment rate (4.1% in November) is encouraging. The November figure marked the lowest since December 2000. The United States has added jobs for 86 straight months, the longest streak so far. Moreover, Americans are highly optimistic about the economy with consumer confidence climbing to the highest level in 17 years.The improvement in the construction sector’s Zacks Rank is reflective of the ongoing positive trend. The Zacks Construction sector rank jumped from 11 to 7 (out of 16 sectors) last week, reflecting 42 positive revisions versus 35 negative. Notably, a sector with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) stocks will have a better average than the rest.It has advanced 28% in the past year, comparing favorably with 20.3% growth of the S&P 500.  Q4 ExpectationsOverall, the revisions trend for Q4 estimates has been very favorable, with earnings estimates holding up a lot better relative to other comparable periods.The construction sector is expected to register double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. Total fourth-quarter earnings for the sector are projected to increase 19.2% year over year compared with 11.6% growth registered in the prior quarter. Revenues are expected to increase 10% (12.3% last quarter) and margins are expected to grow 0.6% versus a 0.1% decline last quarter.For the broader market (S&P 500), total earnings are expected to be up +8.8% in Q4 from the same period last year on +6.9% higher revenues, according to the latest Earnings Trends report.Selecting the Winning StocksAs the sector is already benefitting from the positive industry dynamics, it’s prudent to invest in a few construction stocks that are expected to report a significant uptick this earnings season.We have taken the help of the Zacks Stock Screener to shortlist construction stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2.

In the third quarter, the company witnessed an 81.6% year-over-year surge in net sales for this segment, mainly driven by the addition of Valspar sales since June 2017, partly masked by reduced volume sales to most of the unit’s retail customers.Net sales from the Performance Coatings Group segment for the fourth quarter is projected to decrease roughly 8.7% from the third quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is currently pegged at $1,132 million. In the third quarter, the company witnessed a 150.8% year-over-year increase in net sales for this segment, owing to inclusion of Valspar sales, increased paint sales volume and higher selling prices.Sherwin-Williams’ aggressive cost-control initiatives, working capital reductions, supply chain optimization and productivity improvement should continue to yield margin benefits. Working capital management and efforts to cut operating costs are also helping the company to generate healthy cash flows.The Valspar acquisition also enables Sherwin-Williams to strengthen its position as a leading paints and coatings provider globally, leveraging highly complementary offerings, strong brands and technologies. The buyout will extend Sherwin-Williams’ brand portfolio and customer relationships in North America, and bolster its global finishes business.

412,SHW,"The Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results ahead of the bell on Oct 24.In the last quarter, the paints and coatings company reported a negative earnings surprise of 0.44% by posting adjusted earnings of $4.52 per share. The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.54.Sherwin-Williams recorded net sales of $3,735.8 million in the quarter, marking a 16% year-over-year rise. Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,571.9 million.Sherwin-Williams beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, while missing in the other two, delivering an average positive surprise of around 3.03%.Shares of Sherwin-Williams have moved up 10.5% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s 6.9% growth.  Can Sherwin-Williams surprise investors this earnings or is it heading for a possible pullback? Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayLast month, Sherwin-Williams provided its revised guidance for third-quarter 2017 after hurricanes affected its stores. The company lowered its profit outlook for the third quarter to reflect the impact of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria on its operations in Texas, Florida, the Caribbean and neighboring areas as well as disruptions from two earthquakes in Mexico.Sherwin-Williams noted that the hurricanes affected more than 600 stores while 40 locations in the Caribbean still remain closed. Sherwin-Williams operates 706 paint stores across Texas, Florida and the Caribbean and has 145 company-operated stores and 387 dedicated dealers in Mexico.As a result of the aforementioned disruptions, the company envisions third-quarter revenues in its Americas Group unit to be reduced by $50-70 million. It also sees its third quarter sales and profits to be hurt by lost sales days, costs associated with the clean-up and recovery initiatives and tightened supply of certain raw materials.Considering the impacts of hurricanes and earthquakes, Sherwin-Williams now expects its core net sales to rise by a low-single digit clip year over year in the third quarter compared with its earlier view of a low to mid-single digit percentage increase.At this expected sales level, the company now expects earnings for the third quarter to be in the band of $3.40-$3.70 per share, down from its earlier view of $3.70-$4.10. The revised outlook includes a $1.10 per share charge associated with the Valspar acquisition and a 40-60 cents per share increase from Valspar operations.Notably, the company is expecting the current sales momentum to continue in most geographies, especially in the company-operated stores in the unaffected regions of the United States and Canada. This will allow the company to recover some of the third-quarter earnings shortfall over the remainder of 2017.Sherwin-Williams, in June, closed its acquisition of Valspar, creating a premier global paints and coatings company. The buyout has positioned it as a leading paints and coatings provider globally. However, the company also faces earnings headwinds from sizable charges related to this buyout. It now expects charges related to the Valspar acquisition to be a $2.50 per share for 2017, roughly six times higher than its previous expectation of 40 cents per share.Sherwin-Williams Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Sherwin-Williams Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Sherwin-Williams Company (The) QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Sherwin-Williams is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

414,SHW,"PPG Industries (PPG  -  Free Report) has introduced a new line of corrosion-resistant, direct-to-metal (DTM) polyaspartic coatings, Kwikspar 600 and Kwikspar 600SG. These products, with advanced film-build and fast-cure characteristics, are geared to improve the throughput in field and shop applications.The new polyaspartic coatings can be overcoated on PPG Industries’ protective and marine coatings (PMC) products like Sigmafast 278 epoxy or Amercoat 370 primers, in highly corrosive environments. This provides an ultra-fast drying which is an alternative to conventional three-coat corrosion protection systems. In cases where the environment is low-to-moderately corrosive, one coat of Kwikspar 600SG or Kwikspar 600 can replace the usual two-coat urethane/ epoxy systems.The company’s PMC products help to protect assets in some of the most demanding environments and conditions including projects in infrastructure, energy and marine markets.According to PPG Industries, the technology behind Kwikspar polyaspartic coatings makes them very cost-effective solutions for structural and steel building components which usually require an excellent weathering, corrosion resistance, and color and gloss retention.When Kwikspar polyaspartic coatings are applied to steel, their fast curing abilities accelerate the production of finished parts and when used in the field for new construction or maintenance projects, their high film building characteristics enables applicators to attain a desired finish faster. This results in multiple benefits for the contractors and owners like saving time, labor and material cost and also helps them to ensure faster return-to-service.PPG Industries has announced that its Kwikspar coatings are formulated from 73% solids which cure up to eight times quicker than regular polyurethane coatings. They also exhibit outstanding properties like flexibility, durability and scratch resistance.PPG Industries has underperformed the Zacks categorized Chemicals-Diversified industry over the last one year. The company’s shares have moved up around 6.7% over this period, compared with roughly 7.1% gain recorded by the industry. PPG Industries is exposed to unfavorable currency exchange translation, especially in emerging markets.

419,SHW,"This is Rob Plaza filling in for the Zacks Elite Weekly Review. Sheraz is taking a much-needed break and will be back next week. 
"
420,SHW,"One theme that Sheraz has been trying to hammer home over the last month is that while economic growth is slowing, we are not headed to a double-dip recession. Second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) came in at 2.4%. While that is a disappointing number given how deep the recession was, it is still growth.  
"
421,SHW,"The deceleration in GDP growth, however, indicates that the economy has downshifted into the recovery phase from the expansion phase. We will continue to grow, but don't look for another sprint of 4% or 5% in this cycle.  
"
422,SHW,"Just because growth is decelerating doesn't mean that all companies are going to struggle. For proof, let's take a look at earnings. Earnings Season: So Far, So Good 
"
423,SHW,"Thus far, earnings season has been a resounding success. Nearly 340 companies in the S&P 500 have reported earnings. The aggregate earnings growth is north of 45% compared to the second quarter of last year.   
"
424,SHW,"More importantly, companies are beating expectations. Of the S&P 500 companies that have reported, 78% topped expectations, while just 16% missed estimates. The remaining companies have matched estimates.   
"
425,SHW,"If there's a fly in the ointment, it's that revenue growth hasn't been anywhere near as strong. Revenue growth for S&P 500 companies that reported is 10% (13% excluding financials). The biggest fear here is that corporations have exhausted cost-cutting efforts. Therefore, earnings growth going forward will have to come from revenue growth. For now, though, revenue growth is having little impact on stocks. Where Do We Go From Here?
"
426,SHW,"The strength of second-quarter earnings rules out a double-dip recession for the second half of the year. And if growth can exceed current expectations (which are now around 3% for GDP), the market should be able to deliver solid returns in the second half of the year.   
"
427,SHW,"In addition to earnings, here are three other reasons to be bullish on stocks: Valuation. Stock valuations are not expensive. The S&P 500 is trading around 12x to 14x forward earnings estimates. This is not out of line with historical norms. When compared to bond yields, however, the S&P 500's P/E multiple looks cheap. Monetary policy. Interest rates are still at historical lows, and the Fed is doing everything it can to prop up money supply.Cash. During the downturn and now the recovery, corporations have shored up their balance sheets. At the end of the first quarter, the S&P 500 cash balance (ex-financials) was roughly 10% of total assets. That is up from 8% in 2008 and 5% ten years ago. 
"
428,SHW,"Even so, I don't expect clear sailing in the months ahead. There are still too many headwinds that are likely to keep a lid on stock prices. 
"
429,SHW,"These headwinds include: Peak earnings growth. While we will avoid a double-dip, we won't avoid a slowdown in economic growth. That means earnings growth will have to begin to decelerate. At this stage in the cycle, it is to be expected. However, I expect the magnitude of earnings beats to decline as well.P/E multiples not likely to expand. There are too many macro factors that are weighing on equity valuations. For example, the growing fiscal deficits in the U.S. and internationally, austerity measures, higher taxes, and increased government regulation all raise concerns about future growth potential. With so many macro concerns, investors are unwilling to pay up to own equities.Central banks. There have been a few trial balloons floated by the Federal Reserve about possibly implanting another round of quantitative easing to prevent deflation from taking hold. Unfortunately, the Federal Reserve and central banks around the world have already taken steps to stimulate their economies. They have been successful in avoiding catastrophe, but the central banks have used up their bag of tricks to stimulate growth in the event of slowdown.  Portfolio Update 
"
430,SHW,"We made three changes to the Focus List, adding one stock and deleting two. We left the Growth & Income portfolio intact.   
"
431,SHW,"We added Amphenol Corporation (APH  -  Free Report) to the Focus List. Amphenol is a leader in the electric and fiber optic connector industry. We like the company's fat profit margins and consistent performance from quarter to quarter. APH has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in every quarter for more than four years.  
"
432,SHW,"We removed Plexus Corp. (PLXS  -  Free Report) from the Focus List. The company reported better-than-expected second-quarter EPS of $0.59, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. However, analysts were less than impressed with the company's prospects going forward and lowered their estimates for fiscal year 2010 and 2011. We've held Plexus since Nov 19, 2009 and our gain was about 11%.    
"
433,SHW,"We deleted Sherwin-Williams (SHW  -  Free Report) from the Focus List. While the company's strong second-quarter EPS beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents, management's EPS guidance for the back half of 2010 was well below consensus estimates. SHW expects to earn about $4.32 in 2010, compared to the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.59. We booked a small gain of 5% before the consensus estimates begin to turn lower. 
"
434,SHW,"We issued an updated research report on The Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW  -  Free Report) on Nov 28.Sherwin-Williams logged net income from continuing operations of $316.6 million or $3.33 per share for the third quarter of 2017, down roughly 18.4% from $386.7 million or $4.08 recorded a year ago.  The bottom line was adversely impacted by higher raw material costs, lost sales and recovery expenses resulting from natural disasters.Earnings, barring one-time items, came in at $4.75 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.70.  The company recorded net sales of $4,507 million in the quarter, marking a 37.4% year-over-year rise. Revenues also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,386.4 million.Sherwin-Williams, during third-quarter earnings call, said that the Valspar integration plans and synergy progress is in line with its expectations, as the company remains focused on strengthening performance of core businesses and newly acquired businesses. The company has also implemented appropriate pricing actions to offset the impact of increasing raw material costs.Sherwin-Williams projects mid-to-high single digit percentage increase in net sales, year over year for the fourth quarter of 2017. The company expects earnings per share in the fourth quarter in the range of $1.97-$2.27, compared with $2.15 earned a year ago.  Sherwin-Williams’ shares have moved up 17.6% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s 14% growth.  Sherwin-Williams’ aggressive cost-control initiatives, working capital reductions, supply chain optimization and productivity improvement should continue to yield margin benefits. Working capital management and efforts to cut operating costs are also helping the company to generate healthy cash flows.The Valspar acquisition also allows Sherwin-Williams to strengthen its position as a leading paints and coatings provider globally, leveraging highly complementary offerings, strong brands and technologies. The buyout will extend Sherwin-Williams’ brand portfolio and customer relationships in North America, and bolster its global finishes business. Sherwin-Williams should gain from significant synergies of the Valspar acquisition.However, the company also faces earnings headwinds from sizable charges related to Valspar acquisition. Sherwin-Williams now expects charges related to the Valspar acquisition to be $3.21 per share for 2017, higher than its previous expectation of $2.50. It also expects Valspar-related charge of 98 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2017.Moreover, Sherwin-Williams remains exposed to raw material cost pressure. It now expects raw material cost inflation for the paint and coatings industry to be at the top end of its mid-single digits range forecast in 2017, due to disruptions from hurricanes.Sherwin-Williams Company (The) Price and Consensus  Sherwin-Williams Company (The) Price and Consensus | Sherwin-Williams Company (The) Quote Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderSherwin-Williams currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are Koppers Holdings Inc.

435,SHW,"Huntsman Corporation (HUN  -  Free Report) and Venator Materials PLC have announced the completion of the earlier-announced private offering of $375 million principal amount of 5.75% Senior Notes due 2025. The offering has been completed through their fully-owned subsidiaries Venator Materials Corporation and Venator Finance S.a r.l.As communicated earlier, proceeds from the offering have been funded into escrow pending the IPO of Venator Materials PLC. The proceeds will be used to repay the intercompany debt owed to Huntsman, dividends and other related fees and expenses.According to Huntsman, the move is a significant milestone in the process of separating its Pigments & Additives business. The notes have been offered to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A, which is exempted from registration requirements under the United States Securities Act of 1933.Shares of Huntsman have moved up around 10.6% over the last three months, outperforming the Zacks categorized Chemicals-Diversified industry’s 6.9% gain. Huntsman witnessed positive business development in the first quarter of 2017. However, revenues of its Performance Products segment declined in the quarter due to lower sales volume as a result of the sale of the European surfactants business to Innospec Inc. (IOSP  -  Free Report), which more than offset higher average selling prices and increased volumes in other businesses.The company’s Advanced Materials segment also witnessed decline in sales owing to lower sales volume, as the company withdrew from certain low-margin businesses in the construction and coatings market. Huntsman also faced higher competitive pressure in the wind market that more than offset growth in some of its high value businesses.Huntsman Corporation Price and Consensus  Huntsman Corporation Price and Consensus | Huntsman Corporation QuoteHuntsman currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies in the basic materials space are The Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW  -  Free Report) and Ternium S.A.

437,SHW,"Homebuilding companies, under the broader construction sector, seem to be on solid ground. Positives such as an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels and positive consumer confidence raise optimism about the homebuilding industry’s performance in 2017.However, the U.S. housing data has been weak in July/August as inventory shortage has started taking its toll on sales pace and has pushed average home prices higher nationwide. Again, apart from inventory shortage woes and higher land/labor costs, hurricanes Harvey and Irma are expected to have a negative impact to some extent on the companies’ results. That said, the companies anticipate the impact to be temporary and remain confident about the substantial productivity gains in the later part of 2017 and through 2018.Per our latest Earnings Preview, earnings for the total S&P 500 companies are expected to grow 2.6% from the year-ago period, while revenues will increase 5%. The performance of the index is not restricted to a single sector. Of the 16 Zacks sectors, nine are expected to witness an earnings decline.Nonetheless, overall, earnings growth for the quarter is on track to mark growth and construction seems to be one of the stand-out sectors. The construction sector’s earnings are expected to increase 8.9% in Q3 compared with 15.5% in the prior quarter. Revenues are also expected to improve 10.6% (8.8% growth in Q2).Let us take a look at how the following construction companies are placed ahead of their quarterly release on Oct 24.Masco Corporation (MAS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, 2017 before the opening bell.The company managed to surpass/meet the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 1.15%.Masco’s growth in the last few quarters has mostly been driven by steadily growing repair and remodel activity. The trend is expected to contribute in the to-be-reported quarter as well. Notably, over 80% of Masco’s revenues are generated through repair/remodel activity. In the third quarter, the company expects KraftMaid, Masco’s leading repair and remodel brand, to capitalize on its already strong performance with new product launches.Masco’s Plumbing Products segment, comprising about 46% of the total revenues, is expected to contribute substantially to overall revenue growth in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Plumbing Products revenues of $953 million reflect a growth of 6% from the year-ago quarter.The Cabinets segment is expected to return to positive growth trajectory from this quarter, after experiencing year-over-year sales decline for quite some time now. The consensus estimate for segment revenues of $250 million reflects year-over-year growth of 4.6%.Decorative Architectural Products is expected to grow 5.8% on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter owing to strong pro-paint growth, while the Windows and Other Specialty Products is expected to decline 2.5% in the to-be-reported quarter.Thus, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $1.96 billion, implying 4.3% growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is 53 cents, reflecting a 29% year-over-year increase.Our proven model hints at an earnings beat for this company this quarter, as Masco has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).,This combination increases the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Currently, the company has an Earnings ESP of +0.19% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.(Read more: Repair/Remodel Activity to Drive Masco's Q3 Earnings)Masco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Masco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Masco Corporation QuotePulteGroup Inc.

Homebuilding, comprising about 97.5% of the total revenues, is expected to get a boost in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Homebuilding revenues of $2.3 billion reflect a growth of 17.6% sequentially and 22.5% from the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, consensus estimate for Financial Services revenues of $54 million indicates an increase of 14.2% from the prior quarter and 12.5% year over year.Overall, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $2.33 billion, implying 19.8% growth. The solid improvement in the top line is expected to give a meaningful boost to the company’s earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 59 cents, reflecting a 37.2% year-over-year increase.Meanwhile, PulteGroup does not have the right combination of two main ingredients for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.

QuoteThe Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results before the market opens.Recently, the company lowered its profit outlook for the third quarter to reflect the impact of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria on its operations in Texas, Florida, the Caribbean and neighboring areas as well as disruptions from two earthquakes in Mexico.Considering the impacts of hurricanes and earthquakes, Sherwin-Williams now expects its core net sales to rise by a low-single digit clip year over year in the third quarter compared with its earlier view of a low to mid-single digit percentage increase.The company now expects earnings for the third quarter to be in the range of $3.40-$3.70 per share, down from its earlier view of $3.70-$4.10. The revised outlook includes 10 cents per share charge associated with the Valspar acquisition and a 40-60 cents per share increase from Valspar operations.Thus, total revenues are expected to improve 33.8% from the prior-year quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $4.4 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $4.70 per share reflects a 11% improvement on a year-over-year basis.Sherwin-Williams is unlikely to beat earnings estimates as it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3.

442,SHW,"The Sherwin-Williams Company’s (SHW  -  Free Report) Protective & Marine Coatings unit launched a new high-solids coating, Zinc Clad 4100. With features like recoat times as short as 30 minutes, this new product enables accelerated shop throughput, enhanced project schedules, and fast field project turnarounds.Eliminating the need for sweat-in time, the organic zinc-rich epoxy coating has been designed for use over properly prepared blasted steel. The organic zinc-rich primer boasts outstanding application properties and excellent performance in the field. Additionally, its user-friendly packaging allows applicators to mix components directly in the Part A container for faster and precise mixing.With the launch of Zinc Clad 4100, the company will meet the customers’ need for a high-solids organic zinc-rich epoxy that allows productivity improvements across a number of shop and field applications. The coating is applicable for a wide range of shop or field applications, including bridge and highway structures, stadiums and sports complexes, steel fabrication shops, piping, barges and ships, drilling rigs and refineries.Sherwin-Williams has outperformed the industry over a year. The company’s shares have moved up around 41.8% over this period, compared with roughly 34.9% gain recorded by the industry. The buyout of Valspar has expanded the company's brand portfolio and positioned it as a leading paints and coatings provider globally. Sherwin-Williams should gain from significant synergies of the Valspar acquisition. The company is also benefiting from its actions to cut operating costs. It also remains focused on growth through expansion of operations.However, the company faces earnings headwinds from charges related to Valspar acquisition. Moreover, it remains exposed to raw material cost pressure. Sherwin-Williams has also lowered its earnings outlook for the third quarter factoring in the impacts of disruptions in its operations from recent hurricanes.Sherwin-Williams Company (The) Price and Consensus  Sherwin-Williams Company (The) Price and Consensus | Sherwin-Williams Company (The) Quote Sherwin-Williams currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the construction space are Owens Corning Inc (OC  -  Free Report), United Rentals, Inc.

"
443,SHW,"I am making a conscious effort not to get into the healthcare debate again after our coverage of the issue at length in today's Roundtable Review: Healthcare Bill: Stock Winners & Losers.    
"
444,SHW,"I intend to focus instead on earnings. With Alcoa kicking off the first-quarter earnings season in less than a month, it is high time that we took stock of how the earnings picture is shaping up. I will also give a brief update on the just-completed fourth quarter 2009 earnings season.  Strong Earnings Growth Expectations  
"
445,SHW,"Based on current Zacks Consensus Estimates, earnings for companies in the S&P 500 Index are expected to increase by 22.8% in the first quarter of 2010. For the full year 2010, earnings are expected to advance in excess of 31%. This would reverse the trend of the prior two years, when earnings dropped 10.1% and 23% in 2009 and 2008, respectively.   
"
446,SHW,"Just to give a context for the downturn, even after the solid earnings gains this year, overall S&P 500 earnings would still be below the 2007 level. As would be expected at this stage in the economic recovery, the earnings growth this year will be led by finance, basic materials and energy.  
"
447,SHW,"While it's still on the early side for next year, the current Zacks Consensus for 2011 is solid year-over-year growth of 20%. Following that type of growth next year, overall earnings for the S&P 500 companies would be modestly above the 2007 level, completely erasing the earnings impact of the Great Recession. Removing the downturn's impact on the labor market, however, will take much longer. Revenue Growth Returns 
"
448,SHW,"And bottom-line gains will not be driven by cost controls alone, as had hitherto been the case, but also by steady top-line improvements. Current expectations call for steady revenue gains both in 2010 and 2011. Revenue was down 7.3% in 2009, but is expected to rise 3.5% this year and 7.5% next. In the fourth quarter, total S&P revenue was up 10.1%, reversing the negative comparisons of the preceding quarters (in the third-quarter 2009, revenue dropped 10.8%).  
"
449,SHW,"Given the far more significant earnings growth compared to the revenue gains expectations, it is obvious that the bulk of the bottom-line growth will be driven by margin expansion. While that was the trend in the last few quarters as well, what will change going forward is that we will start seeing decent top-line growth as well. Expectations on Solid Ground Given Revisions Ratio  
"
450,SHW,"The current trend in the Revisions Ratio (calculated by dividing the number of estimates going up by the number of estimates going down) make me confident that earnings expectations will easily be met, if not exceeded. For 2010, the ratio stands at 1.69, which is clearly on the positive side. Typically, a Revision Ratio in the range of 0.8  1.2 would be in the neutral category, with readings outside of that range on either side directionally significant. For next year, the current reading is at a very strong 1.66.  
"
451,SHW,"The current strength in the Revisions Ratio is a direct result of the earnings surprises in the just-completed fourth quarter 2009. Earnings for the S&P 500 firms, excluding the financials, increased 14.2% from the year-earlier level, with 73% of earnings reports coming ahead of expectations. We witnessed positive surprises on the top-line as well, with almost two-thirds of the firms reporting better-than-expected revenues.Stocks May Not Be Impressed 
"
452,SHW,"The market appeared to be unmoved by the strong fourth-quarter earnings season. And we may see a replay of that performance next month as well. But that is not necessarily such a bad thing if you take a step back and look at it from our macro perspective. We don't expect a lot of fireworks from the market anyway. And as long as first quarter results come in-line with expectations, we would expect the market to remain unimpressed. This supports our range-bound market outlook. Portfolio Update
"
453,SHW,"We added two stocks and deleted one from the Focus List last week. The Growth & Income Portfolio remained unchanged. There were also changes to the Timely Buys list.    
"
454,SHW,"We added NBTY (NTY) and Sherwin-Williams (SHW  -  Free Report) to the Focus List last week. NBTY, the $3 billion market cap manufacturer, marketer, and retailer of nutritional supplements, enters the portfolio on the back of solid quarterly results and a strong estimate revisions profile. While the stock is at its 52-week high, we view the momentum to be sustainable, given its decent valuation in a backdrop of positive estimate revisions.   
"
455,SHW,"Given Sherwin-Williams' housing market exposure, some readers may be surprised at our addition of this name. But this major producer of paints and coatings does not need a full blown housing turnaround to generate solid results. It has sharply cut its costs and offers significant operating leverage in its business, enabling it to generate solid earnings and cash flows with an only modest improvement in the outlook. 
"
456,SHW,"We deleted Cantel Medical Corp. (CMN) due to the company's uncertain near-term earnings outlook. Given this lack of near-term visibility, we are inclined to lock in our 25% gain in this stock.  
"
457,SHW,"Sherwin-Williams Co. (SHW  -  Free Report) saw record results in its third quarter. Shares of SHW received a nice boost on the strong quarter, and the company has been trading well ahead Dow Jones ($DJI), S&P 500 Index (SPX) and NASDAQ Composite Index (COMP) since then.
"
458,SHW,"Company Description 
"
459,SHW,"Sherwin-Williams Co. manufactures, develops, distributes and sells coatings and related products to professional, industrial, commercial, and retail customers. The company manufactures products under well-known brands such as Sherwin-Williams®, Dutch Boy®, Krylon®, Minwax®, Thompsons® Water Seal®, and many more.

"
460,SHW,"Solid Income
"
461,SHW,"The company recently declared a regular quarterly dividend of 35 cents per share. SHW noted that the dividend is payable on December 5 to shareholders of record on November 14. The company is yielding 2.5%, which is in line with the industry. 
"
462,SHW,"Growth Reflected in Third-quarter Results
"
463,SHW,"The company also posted third-quarter earnings of $1.50 per share, exceeding the consensus estimate by 18%. Sales climbed 3.3% to a record $2.269 billion. 
"
464,SHW,"Commenting on the third quarter and first nine months results, Christopher M. Connor, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, We continue to manage our business through the challenging environment of the U.S. and global economies. We are experiencing an unprecedented downturn in the U.S. housing market that has severely depressed paint demand in the domestic new residential, residential repaint, DIY and commercial markets. During the third quarter, the strong paint demand we had enjoyed in many foreign markets began to subside and we anticipate increasing softness in the months ahead. Despite these conditions, we are pleased with the progress of our operating segments in producing record sales performance and strong cash generation. 
"
465,SHW,"More Signs of Growth
"
466,SHW,"SHWs earnings per share are expected to grow by 12% over the next 3  5 years, which is above the industry average of 9%. The companys return on equity (ROE) of 37% also tops the industry average of 20%.
"
467,SHW,"The Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW  -  Free Report) has lowered its profit outlook for the third quarter of 2017 to reflect the impact of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria on its operations in Texas, Florida, the Caribbean and neighboring areas as well as disruptions from two earthquakes in Mexico.The paint giant noted that the hurricanes affected more than 600 stores while 40 locations in the Caribbean still remain closed. Sherwin-Williams operates 706 paint stores across Texas, Florida and the Caribbean and has 145 company-operated stores and 387 dedicated dealers in Mexico.As a result of the disruptions, Sherwin-Williams envisions third-quarter revenues in its Americas Group unit to be reduced by a range of $50-70 million.The company also sees its third quarter sales and profit to be hurt by lost sales days, costs associated with the clean-up and recovery initiatives and tightened supply of certain raw materials.Factoring in the impacts of hurricanes and earthquakes, Sherwin-Williams now expects its core net sales will rise by a low single digit clip year over year in the third quarter compared with its earlier view of a low to mid-single digit percentage increase.At this expected sales level, the company now sees earnings for the third quarter to be in the band of $3.40 to $3.70 per share, down from its earlier view of $3.70 to $4.10 per share. The revised outlook includes a $1.10 per share charge associated with the Valspar acquisition and a 40-60 cents per share increase from Valspar operations.The company noted that it expects the sales momentum it is witnessing in most geographies, especially in the company-operated stores in the unaffected regions of the United States and Canada, to allow it to recover some of the third-quarter earnings shortfall over the remainder of 2017.The company plans to issue its full-year outlook when it reports third-quarter earnings on Oct 24.Shares of Sherwin-Williams have moved up 33.2% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 25% gain.Sherwin-Williams currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the basic materials space include Kraton Corporation (KRA  -  Free Report), Koppers Holdings Inc.

468,SHW,"Companies with favorable efficiency levels are expected to see upward movement in stock prices. This is because efficiency level is believed to have a direct relationship with the price performance of a stock. Efficiency, a company’s ability to transform its inputs into outputs, is a potential indicator of a company’s financial health.Key Ratios to Identify EfficiencySometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are:Inventory Turnover: The ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a 4-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company’s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which resulted in excess inventory. Receivables Turnover:  This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company’s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or “debtor’s turnover ratio” is desirable as it signals that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.Asset Utilization: This ratio indicates a company’s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last 4-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may also indicate that a company is efficient.Operating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company’s ability to control its operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.Screening ParametersIn addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average (Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)    The use of these few criteria narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to only 19.Here are four stocks from the 19 that made it through the screen:Kaiser Aluminum Corp. (KALU  -  Free Report) manufactures and sells semi-fabricated specialty aluminum mill products.

469,SHW,"On Sep 20, we issued an updated research report on paint giant, The Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW  -  Free Report).Sherwin-Williams logged profits of $319.1 million or $3.36 per share for the second quarter of 2017, down roughly 16% from $378.1 million or $3.99 per share a year ago.  The bottom line was hit by charges associated with the buyout of Valspar.Earnings, barring one-time items including acquisition-related costs, came in at $4.52 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.54.  Sherwin-Williams recorded net sales of $3,735.8 million in the quarter, marking a 16% year-over-year rise. Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,571.9 million.  Sherwin-Williams, during the second quarter earnings call, noted that it will continue to remain focused on boosting the performance of its core businesses while completing the Valspar integration.The company sees low to mid-single digit percentage increase in net sales, year over year for the third quarter of 2017. The company expects earnings per share in the third quarter to be in the range of $3.70-$4.10 per share, compared to $4.08 earned in the third quarter of 2016. Third-quarter earnings per share includes a $1.10 charge associated with the Valspar acquisition.Price PerformanceShares of Sherwin-Williamshave moved up 11.3% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s 6.8% growth.  Valspar Acquisition & Cost Actions to Drive ResultsSherwin-Williams, in June, closed the Valspar acquisition, creating a premier global paints and coatings company. The acquisition allows Sherwin-Williams to strengthen its position as a leading paints and coatings provider globally, leveraging highly complementary offerings, strong brands and technologies.In addition to expanding Sherwin-Williams’ global platform in Asia-Pacific and Europe, the Middle East and Africa regions, the buyout adds new capabilities in the packaging and coil segments. Sherwin-Williams expects to achieve $320 million in annual synergies within three years following the deal closure.Moreover, the company’s cost-control initiatives, working capital reductions, supply chain optimization and productivity improvement are expected to continue to yield margin benefits.

470,SHW,"In June, Existing Home Sales ran at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 4.77 million.  That pace is 0.8% lower than in May, and 8.8% below the year ago rate. The year ago numbers were somewhat inflated due to the end of the homebuyer tax credit.  The June sales rate was below consensus expectations of a 4.93 million annual rate. The history of used home sales is shown in the graph below (from Calculated Risk). 
"
471,SHW,"Sales of single family homes were unchanged on the month at a rate of 4.24 million, and are off 7.4% year over year. The median price of a single family home nationwide rose 0.6% from a year ago to $184,600. Condo and co-op sales fell 7.0% on the month, and are down 18.0% year over year. The median Condo price rose 1.8% from a year ago to $182,300.  For all existing homes, the median price was up 0.8% to $184,300.   
"
472,SHW,"Regionally sales were down on the month in two of the four Census regions. All four regions were down year over year. The Northeast fared the worst, with sales down 5.2% for the month and down 17.0% from a year ago. The West had a month to month decrease, with sales falling 1.7%, down 2.6% from a year ago. In the Midwest, sales rose 1.0% for the month but are down 14.0% year over year. The South, the largest of the four regions, saw a 0.5% rise on the month, but a 5.6% year over year decline.  
"
473,SHW,"Prices rose in the higher priced areas of the country, and fell in the cheaper areas. The Northeast is the most expensive region, with the median home going for $261,000, up 3.1% from a year ago. The West is also relatively expensive, with a median price of $240,400, up 9.5% from a year ago. The Midwest, already the cheapest area of the nation to live in with a median price of $147,700, saw a year over year decline of 5.3%. Prices in Dixie dropped 0.1% from a year ago to $159,100. The median price is not the best measure of housing prices, as it is affected by the mix of houses being sold. However, the data is consistent with what the better, but less timely, measures (such as the Case Schiller index) have been indicating. The median price is not seasonally adjusted. 
"
474,SHW,"The level of activity in used home sales really is not that important in isolation. It is just the transfer of an existing asset, and does not add a lot to economic growth. The one exception to that is Realtors' commissions. Indirectly, it can help as people will often remodel and redecorate a ""new for them"" house. That can stimulate some sales for paint companies like Sherwin Williams (SHW  -  Free Report) and perhaps it is good for furniture firms like La-Z-Boy (LZB  -  Free Report), but it pales compared to the economic activity generated by a new home sale.  
"
475,SHW,"New homes not only need new paint on the walls, but they need the walls. That means lots of business for wallboard firms like USG (USG  -  Free Report), timber firms like Weyerhaeuser (WY  -  Free Report) and roofing and insulation firms like the Johns Manville division of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report). It also means that those firms have to hire more workers, so the employment effect of new home sales goes well beyond the roofers and carpenters actually on the jobsite. Also, the newly employed Construction workers will have money in their pockets to spend, and as they do, that will stimulate other jobs. 
"
476,SHW,"Where used home sales are important is in relation to the inventory of houses for sale. That will influence the future direction of housing prices. Used home prices are extremely important. As used home prices fall, more and more people find themselves underwater on their mortgages. As long as a homeowner has positive equity in their house, the foreclosure rate should be zero.  
"
477,SHW,"After all, it is better to simply sell the house and get something for it, rather than let the bank take it and get nothing for it. The more people under water, and the deeper they are, the higher foreclosures and strategic defaults are going to be.  A strategic default is when someone has the cash flow available to continue to make his mortgage payment, but simply decides not to, since paying is a just plain stupid thing to do from a financial perspective. If you have a house that could only sell for $150,000 in the current environment, and you owe $200,000 on the mortgage, in effect you have the option of ""selling"" the house to the bank for $200,000 simply by not writing the checks. Of course that will be a hit to your credit rating, but $50,000 is probably worth a bit of a tarnish on your Fico score. If the difference is only $5000, then the hit to your credit score makes less sense, and there are lots of non economic factors (a house is after all a home, not just an investment) that come into play. 
"
478,SHW,"In June, inventories rose by 3.3% to 3.77 million.  Combined with the slight fall in sales, that puts the months of supply at 9.5 months, up from 9.1 months in May, but below the record 12.5 months set a year ago. It is still a very high level. A ""normal"" months of supply is about six months, and during the housing bubble just over four months was the norm.  Also, the inventory numbers are not seasonally adjusted, even thought here is a seasonal pattern when they tend to decline in the winter (especially around the holidays) and then increase in the spring.  
"
479,SHW,"The second graph (also Calculated Risk) traces the months of supply and the year over year change in inventory. The level still suggests downward pressure on existing home prices over the next few months.  The inventory numbers (and hence the months supply) are not seasonally adjusted, and there is a tendency for inventory levels to rise in the spring. The year over year drop in inventory is somewhat encouraging, but the level of inventories has to be viewed relative to the sales pace.  
"
480,SHW,"Fortunately, relative to incomes and rents, home prices are not as absurdly overvalued as they were then, so the magnitude of the coming price declines is likely to be a lot less over the next year than the 30% plunge in 2008 and early 2009. I suspect they will fall by about 3% from here, and will probably bottom out by the end of the year. Still, that could do a lot of damage, since the equity cushions are a lot smaller now than they were in 2007 or early 2008.  
"
481,SHW,"If housing prices fall more than 3%, then lots of people with razor thin current positive equity will also be underwater, and lots of homes that are only slightly underwater (where non financial considerations tend to dominate) will become deeply underwater. There are some very well respected housing economists, including Robert Schiller (creator of the Case Schiller index) who are far more pessimistic than I about the future of housing prices, thinking prices could drop 20% or more from current levels.  That is possible, especially if the austerity mania that is sweeping Washington results in a substantial slowing of the overall economy. That now seems very likely. If the debt ceiling is not raised, the economy will not slow, it will collapse.  In that case, Dr. Schiller is a giddy optimist on housing prices. However, barring such a scenario in Congress, we will probably muddle through for the rest of the year, as the waning of temporary drags like the effects of the Japanese Tsunami help offset the drag from fiscal austerity. 
"
482,SHW,"The next two graphs (also from Calculated Risk) track housing prices relative to the two most important drivers of housing prices: rents and incomes. My forecast of a further 3% decline would put prices roughly in the middle of the range where they were in the 1990's. Dr. Schiller's would put housing prices at the very low end of that range. I would say the risk is more that Dr. Schiller has it right, rather than we are both wrong (and him very wrong) and housing prices start to rebound in the near term. I would also note that apartment vacancies have been declining recently, which will likely lead to increases in rents; this would tilt the rent vs. buy decision in the favor of buying. 
"
483,SHW,"However, with falling home prices it is likely that the pace of foreclosures will pick up again. Even with the slowdown in foreclosures, the number of homes that are now owned by Fannie, Freddie and the FHA is mounting as can be seen in the next graph (again from Calculated Risk). Those institutions have no use for those homes and they will go on the market, often at very aggressive prices, putting downward pressure on the market.  Most of those that are being foreclosed on have indeed fallen far behind in their mortgage payments, and so in that sense the foreclosures are legitimate, even if the paperwork is a mess. The combination of underwater homes and reduced cash flow from one or both of the breadwinners in a family being out of work is a toxic mixture for the health of not just the housing market, but the economy as a whole. 
"
484,SHW,"This was a weak report. The monthly in inventory was worrisome. A 9.5 months of supply is very disturbing and points to continuing downward pressure on existing home prices. The huge glut of existing homes on the market, and the shadow inventory of homes that is likely to be foreclosed upon and thus come to market in the near future, means that we really have very little need to build new homes. Thus residential investment, the historical prime locomotive in pulling the economy out of recessions, will stay derailed.  
"
485,SHW,"While we got a bit of a bounce in housing starts and building permits last month, the strength was mostly in the very volatile multi family segment, and the overall level is still extremely depressed. The jobs not created by a rebound in housing construction will mean that household formation will stay depressed, thus further depressing the demand for housing. To put that in more concrete terms, young adults will not be able to get a job and form a family, instead, they will continue living in mom and dad's basement, rather than soak up the existing housing inventory.  A nasty chicken and the egg situation.   
"
486,SHW,"The most important part of this report is what it says about the future direction of home prices.  There the news is still bad, and at the margin, getting worse. In terms of economic activity and growth, the far more important report, New Home Sales, comes out on Thursday. New home sales have been slammed much harder than existing home sales.  
"
487,SHW,"In normal times, there is about a 6:1 ratio between existing and new home sales. In May, that ratio was 15.7 to 1. I don't expect much of a bounce in New Home Sales, and they well remain at near record lows. I suspect it will be a long time (perhaps until 2015 or so) before we return to that historic 6:1 ratio.  Still, that would imply an annual rate of new home sales of 795,000 based on the current level of used home sales, even over a four year recovery period, which still works out to a very strong compounded annual growth rate of 45.4%. That will be an important factor in overall economic growth going forward.  RELATED ARTICLESHousing Starts and Building Permits RiseWill the U.S. Default Before Greece?Factory Output Flat

488,SHW,"OVERVIEW
"
489,SHW,"Chemicals are essential to millions of consumer goods, enabling hi-tech  advances in industries as diverse as aerospace, computing and  telecommunications. The chemical industry comprises companies engaged in  the conversion of raw materials -- oil, natural gas, air, water, metals  -- that are then used to make a wide variety of consumer goods, as well  as inputs for agriculture, manufacturing, construction and service  industries.
"
490,SHW,"Globally, the chemical industry is mainly concentrated in three areas of  the world: Western Europe, North America and Japan. The European  community is the largest producer, followed by the U.S. and Japan. The  chemical industry, one of the largest in the U.S., is an enterprise  worth $674 billion. This industry is also one of the top exporters in  the country.
"
491,SHW,"The U.S. chemical industry operates through 170 major chemical companies  with international operations spanning more than 2,800 facilities  outside the U.S. and 1,700 foreign subsidiaries or affiliates. The  sector generates an annual chemical output worth $400 billion. The U.S.  industry records large trade surpluses and employs around a million  people. It is also the second largest consumer of energy in the  manufacturing sector.Outlook
"
492,SHW,"The recession had hit the chemical industry hard. Shying from a lack of  demand, chemical companies shelved their growth strategies. With plants  idled or running at historically low rates, the companies looked for  avenues to streamline operations and increase productivity. Accordingly,  they resorted to restructurings, plant closures, and layoffs.  Cost-cutting initiatives at industrial majors -- The Dow Chemical  Company  (DOW) and EI  DuPont de Nemours & Co.  (DD) -- amounted to  billions of dollars.
"
493,SHW,"The global chemical industry is, however, recovering from the  recession-hit lows. Domestically, chemical production volumes have  increased across all regions of the United States in 2010, reversing the  steep declines experienced in 2008 and 2009. The largest gains have  occurred in the Gulf Coast and Ohio Valley regions, boosted by export  demand for basic chemicals and plastics. Output is expected to grow  moderately in all regions in 2011 and continue to improve through 2012.
"
494,SHW,"Growth in export markets has been driven by several factors. These  include favorable energy costs, resulting from developments in  extracting natural gas from shale; and demand from emerging markets,  where recovery and expansion have been the strongest. As per the  American Chemistry Council (ACC), U.S. exports would grow by 9.7% in  2011, outpacing the expected 7.8% growth in imports.
"
495,SHW,"Further, the cost-containment measures implemented by chemical  companies, such as plant shutdowns, aggressive cost cutting and  production improvements, should continue to bolster industry-wide  margins. The resultant large cash flows could then be leveraged for  growth opportunities.
"
496,SHW,"Following a massive decline in fertilizer sales and consumption in 2009,  the speed and extent of the recovery in the first half of 2010 has been  stellar, leading to an annual increase of 13% and 7% over 2009,  respectively. The International Fertilizer Industry Association (IFA) is  projecting growth in global fertilizer consumption of 4.7% for  2010/2011 and 3.8% for 2011/12. By 2011/12, nutrient application rates  would fully recover to levels seen prior to the economic crisis of 2008.
"
497,SHW,"The fertilizer industry will be able to absorb the incremental demand  for food, feed, fiber and energy production on the strength of its  investments hitherto made. Between 2010 and 2015, some 55 urea units, 20  potash expansion projects and 40 processed phosphates facilities are  planned for completion worldwide.
"
498,SHW,"The industry has spent close to $40 billion on new capacity for all  three major nutrients since 2008. IFA estimates that another $80 billion  will be invested between 2011 and 2015, with the highest levels of  production, sales and consumption seen to date occurring in 2011. Global  urea capacity is projected to expand by 30% between 2009 and 2014 to  222 million tons (Mt). During the same period, world potash and  phosphates capacity is forecast to grow by 25% and 31%, respectively.End-Market Scenario
"
499,SHW,"The U.S. home building sector is a major consumer market for the  chemicals industry accounting for about 10% of chemical demand.  According to the ACC, every 100,000 group of housing starts generates  $1.5 billion in chemical sales. As per the National Association of Home  Builders (NAHB), new housing starts marginally rose 7% for 2010.  However, on the plus point, NAHB expects annual housing starts for  single-family homes to climb a much stronger 21% to 575,000 units in  2011.
"
500,SHW,"On the flipside, U.S. unemployment will remain high in 2011; credit  markets remain tight and mortgage rates will likely increase in 2011,  thus limiting any noteworthy rebound in the housing market. We expect  the housing sector to begin a slow recovery toward its pre-recession  peaks in 2011.
"
501,SHW,"The Auto sector accounts for 10% of the chemical industry’s demand. The  automotive industry has started showing signs of recovery. The ACC  estimates U.S automobile sales will reach 12.7 million units in 2011.  The remaining demand comes from the agriculture, architectural and  industrial coatings, paper and textile, electronics and other  industries.
"
502,SHW,"Growing emerging markets should propel production in the paper and  textile industry while the electrical industry is expected to pick up  with increased industrial investment. Other industries, including food  and agriculture, are also likely to gain momentum with the recovering  economy.Trends in Raw Material Markets
"
503,SHW,"The chemical industry is a large consumer of oil, naphtha and natural gas, which are widely used as energy and feedstock input.
"
504,SHW,"Oil prices trended upward throughout 2009, and in 2010 crude oil prices  averaged around $79 per barrel. With current economic conditions  improving worldwide, global demand for oil is rising, leading to higher  prices. Naphtha prices are also expected to rise in early 2011, fueled  by robust global crude prices, as bitterly cold winters in Europe and  U.S. spark demand for home heating.
"
505,SHW,"Natural gas working inventories ended 2010 were 3.1 trillion cubic feet  (Tcf), about 1% below the record-setting end-of-December 2009 level.  Inventories are expected to remain at or near record-high levels through  most of 2011. EIA expects total natural gas consumption to decline by  0.9% in 2011 and residential and commercial consumption to drop 2.7% in  2011 due to fewer heating days in the winter months this year compared  with last year.
"
506,SHW,"Over the past five years, the U.S. natural gas markets have seen a  dynamic shift due to the emergence of a new source of energy -- shale  gas -- which exists in large quantities with sources close to many big  energy-intensive cities. The shales ensure a cleaner power source than  coal or oil.
"
507,SHW,"OPPORTUNITIES
"
508,SHW,"Chemical companies spent much of the past two years on their core  business and tailoring their business processes and structure toward  becoming more efficient. Consequently, many of these companies have  ended up with excess cash on their balance sheets. Growth by further  reducing costs is not a viable option anymore as most companies have  already taken drastic measures to cut costs and improve operating  efficiencies.
"
509,SHW,"The chemical companies are seeing mergers and acquisitions as an option  to grow in the current economic environment. Thus, there has been a  pickup in the volume of deals announced during 2010, a substantial  increase from the previous year, indicating that that the global economy  is stabilizing.
"
510,SHW,"The companies are focused on exploring growth opportunities in emerging  markets with strong performance in fast-growing regions of Asia-Pacific  and Latin America, particularly China and Brazil. The United States  expects growth to continue, albeit at a slower rate than last year.  Business conditions are improving, with corporate profits and  investments rising and industrial production showing solid gains  compared with the year before.
"
511,SHW,"The world’s second-largest seed maker, DuPont recently entered into a  definitive agreement to acquire Denmark ’s Danisco for $5.8 billion in  cash and assumption of $500 million of Danisco’s net debt. This marks  the company’s largest acquisition since its $7.7 billion buy of Pioneer  Hi-Bred International in 1999. The deal will enable DuPont to expand the  company’s offerings in more specialized areas like biofuels and food  enzyme.
"
512,SHW,"DuPont is focused on capturing $1 billion in working capital  productivity gains during the 2011−2013 timeframe. The company is also  on track to achieve a cumulative $600 million in benefits from fixed  cost productivity and restructuring actions in 2011. It is executing  strategies for further development and growth of new products,  particularly for agriculture, photovoltaics, alternative energy and  materials.
"
513,SHW,"Dow is delivering cost synergies from the Rohm & Haas acquisition  and, in its 2010 third quarter, the company delivered more than $975  million in sales on a run-rate basis, already exceeding the year-end  target of $500 million. Dow is targeting an acquisition growth synergy  run-rate of $2 billion by the end of 2012.
"
514,SHW,"In April 2010, CF Industries Holdings Inc.  (CF  -  Free Report) acquired its  long-chased rival Terra Industries for $4.7 billion. With this  acquisition, CF has become the global leader in the nitrogen fertilizer  industry with a wide geographical footprint and a total capacity of 6.3  million nutrient tons of nitrogen and 2.1 million nutrient tons of  phosphate.
"
515,SHW,"Similarly, fertilizer manufacturer Agrium is growing through a  combination of acquisitions and organic expansion. Agrium’s recent  acquisition of AWB Ltd., a leading agricultural retailer in Australia,  will broaden its rural product sales business, including fertilizers and  herbicides, in Australia, the world’s fourth-largest wheat exporter and  third-largest shipper of canola.
"
516,SHW,"Another major deal in the chemical space is the pending Airgas Inc. (ARG) - Air Products & Chemicals Inc.  (APD  -  Free Report) merger valued at  around $5.9 billion, excluding debt. If it materializes, the Air  Products and Airgas association would form the world’s largest  industrial gas company. With the acquisition of Airgas, Air Products  plans a foray into the North American packaged gas business.
"
517,SHW,"Dow Chemical, DuPont, Agrium, Air Products and CF Industries have long-term Neutral recommendations.WEAKNESSES
"
518,SHW,"The chemical industry as a whole remains heavily exposed to economic  cycles and pretty much all of the industry’s underperformance of the  last two years can be attributed to the economic turmoil. The global  economic meltdown led to weak industrial demand for chemicals, resulting  in an under-utilization of production capacity, perpetrating a dramatic  fall in operating profits worldwide.
"
519,SHW,"While the global economic recovery appears to be firmly in place, the  recent turmoil in Europe and its impact on global growth remain sources  of near-term uncertainty. Chemical stalwarts like Dow and DuPont have  significant exposure to Europe with around 25% of their net sales coming  from the region.
"
520,SHW,"In Europe, disparate growth rates have been reported across the  continent. Economic conditions have shown improvement in northern Europe  and in the emerging countries of eastern Europe. Meanwhile, growth in  southern Europe continues to be restrained by sovereign debt concerns  and tightening in government spending.
"
521,SHW,"On the domestic front, we expect the U.S. economy's recovery to continue  to face headwinds from high unemployment, slow job growth, and  continued weakness in residential and commercial construction. Moreover,  expected monetary easing could lead to inflation in dollar-denominated  commodity prices and deflationary pressure on wages and asset values.
"
522,SHW,"Weak residential and commercial construction demand continues to affect  companies engaged in paint and coatings. Revenues and margins for Sherwin-Williams  (SHW  -  Free Report), the largest US  producer of paints and coatings, declined significantly in 2009.  Although demand in these end-markets is beginning to turn around of  late, it essentially remains weak, and industry-wide volume is down  significantly from peak levels achieved a few years ago.
"
523,SHW,"We do not expect a near-term recovery in the housing and construction  markets with declining home sales and consumer spending. We are highly  concerned about further declines in commercial construction, which  comprises around 30% of the company’s architectural paint sales.
"
524,SHW,"Sherwin’s peer, The Valspar Corporation  (VAL), however fared  better on the revenue front in its Paint segment in its recent quarter  driven by investment in new brands as well as higher volumes in the  global consumer and automotive refinish product lines. However,  operating income was affected by higher costs.
"
525,SHW,"Valspar will find it extremely difficult to achieve the level of price  increases necessary to fully offset these higher costs. Moreover, there  is a huge lag between high raw material costs and Valspar’s pricing  gains, which would continue to restrain margins.Calgon Carbon Corporation  (CCC), a leader in the  activated carbon sector, faces weak demand for carbon products. The  insipid global economy hurt volumes in 2009 and, though activated carbon  sales recovered to an extent in the last reported quarter, we are  skeptical about its sustainability. We expect sales volumes in the  segment to remain challenging as the end-markets are yet to recover  fully.
"
526,SHW,"There are other possible hurdles that chemical makers may have to face  such as pending rule changes within US regulatory agencies. Recently the  U.S. EPA has proposed a sweeping new rule that could impose stricter  hazardous air pollutant emissions limitation and other requirement on  operators of new and existing boilers and process heaters.
"
527,SHW,"According to EPA’s calculations, compliance with these rules would cost  boiler owners $12.2 billion to implement and annualized cost of $4.1  billion after accounting for savings and also result in mill closures.
"
528,SHW,"Sherwin-Williams, Valspar, and Calgon Carbon have long-term Neutral recommendations.                    
"
529,SHW,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for The Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 6.1% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Sherwin-Williams’ Q2 Earnings Trail, Profits Down Y/YSherwin-Williams logged profits of $319.1 million or $3.36 per share for the second quarter of 2017, down roughly 16% from $378.1 million or $3.99 per share a year ago.  The bottom line was hit by charges associated with the buyout of Valspar.Earnings, barring one-time items including acquisition-related costs, came in at $4.52 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.54. The company recorded charges of $0.72 per share for acquisition-related costs and charges of $0.44 per share related to the sale of Valspar's North American Industrial Wood Coatings business assets.Sherwin-Williams recorded net sales of $3,735.8 million in the quarter, marking a 16% year-over-year rise. Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,571.9 million. Sales from stores in the U.S. and Canada (open more than 12 calendar months) rose around 5% in the quarter.Segment ReviewThe Americas Group unit registered net sales of $2.44 billion in the reported quarter, up around 9% on a year over year comparison basis. Revenues were driven by increased architectural paint sales volume in most end markets, the impact of the change in revenue classification and higher selling prices.Net sales of the Consumer Brands Group unit went up 16% to $536.4 million, driven by the addition of Valspar sales for the month of June, partly masked by reduced volume sales to most of the unit’s retail and commercial customers. Valspar sales increased the division’s net sales by around 28% in the quarter.Net sales from the Performance Coatings Group jumped 48% to $761.1 million in the quarter on the back of one-month of Valspar sales, increased paint sales volume and higher selling prices. Valspar sales contributed roughly 49% to the segment’s net sales in the quarter.Financials and Shareholder ReturnsSherwin-Williams made no open market purchases of its common stock during the six months ended Jun 30, 2017. At the end of the second quarter, the company had cash on hand of $210 million that it plans to use to reduce debt.OutlookMoving ahead, Sherwin-Williams said that it will focus on boosting the performance of its core businesses while completing the Valspar integration.The company sees low to mid-single digit percentage increase in net sales, year over year for third-quarter 2017. The company expects earnings per share in the third quarter to be in the range of $3.70 to $4.10 per share, compared to $4.08 earned in the third quarter of 2016. Third-quarter earnings per share includes a $1.10 per share charge associated with the Valspar acquisition.For full-year 2017, Sherwin-Williams projects mid-single digit percentage increase in net sales from 2016. It also sees incremental sales from the Valspar buyout to be around $2.4 billion for the year. At this level, the company now expects earnings per share from continuing operations for the year to be in the range of $12.30 to $12.70 per share, compared with $11.99 earned in 2016. The guidance includes a $2.50 per share charge related to the Valspar acquisition.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been four revisions higher for the current quarterThe Sherwin-Williams Company Price and Consensus  The Sherwin-Williams Company Price and Consensus | The Sherwin-Williams Company QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, Sherwin-Williams's stock has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a C. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is more suitable for growth investors than those looking for value and momentum.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock. The magnitude of these revisions also looks promising. Notably, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect in-line returns from the stock in the next few months.
"
530,SHW,"OVERVIEW
"
531,SHW,"The chemical industry comprises of companies engaged in the processing and refinement of agricultural and industrial chemicals as well as gases. Chemicals are used to make a wide variety of consumer goods besides being necessary in the agriculture, manufacturing, construction and services industries. The European Union and the U.S. house the world's largest chemical companies.
"
532,SHW,"The entire US chemical industry is broadly divided into four segments -- basic chemicals, life sciences, specialty chemicals and consumer products. While most of the larger companies operate in one or more of these segments, specialized operators in niche segments are also numerous.
"
533,SHW,"Of these, basic chemicals or commodity chemicals form the largest segment and includes products like polymers, petrochemicals, plastics and inorganic chemicals, as well as fertilizers. Polymers form the largest product category, generating the biggest chunk of revenue. It includes products like polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene and polystyrene. Petrochemicals such as propylene, benzene, methanol, ethylene oxide are the major raw material for polymer products.
"
534,SHW,"Plastics are next in line, with application across several end-markets including packaging, home construction, containers, appliances, pipes and transportation. Synthetic rubber, dyes and pigments, resins, carbon black, explosives and rubber products are the other derivatives under the category. Inorganic chemicals include acids like phosphoric, nitric and sulfuric, as well as caustic soda, chlorine and soda ash. Phosphates, ammonia and potash chemicals form the fertilizers category.
"
535,SHW,"Pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, biological substance, animal health products and crop protection chemicals including herbicides, insecticides and fungicides form the Life sciences segment.
"
536,SHW,"Specialty chemicals cover industrial gases coatings, electronic chemicals, adhesives and sealants.
"
537,SHW,"Consumer products include products such as soaps, detergents and cosmetics that are chemically produced.
"
538,SHW,"Mixed Outlook
"
539,SHW,"We expect a slow recovery in global chemical production after a sharp decline in the last couple of years. The recovering global economy has resulted in improved demand for chemicals in several end markets. In North America, we expect chemical production to rise notably this year, however production levels are likely to remain below pre-recession levels. Chemical giant BASF is expecting about 10% growth in the US chemical industry on the back of rising demand for exports.
"
540,SHW,"Given that the rate of recovery in demand is slow, chemical companies have had to resort to plant shutdowns and right sizing, resulting in meaningful improvements in their bottom lines. Aggressive cost cutting and production improvements should continue to help margins in the industry. Large cash flows, which should benefit from cost-cutting efforts and healthier balance sheets should support growth opportunities for chemical producers in the offing.End-Markets Scenario
"
541,SHW,"About 10% of chemical demand comes from the housing sector and another 10% from the auto sector. Rest of the chemical demand comes from the agriculture, architectural and industrial coatings, paper and textile, electronics and other industries. The chemical industry was particularly affected by weak industrial demand in the second half of 2008 and in the first half of 2009. The drop in production in the chemical industry has been almost in sync with lower production in the key customer industries of housing, construction, automotive, electrical, furniture and paper.
"
542,SHW,"However, the automotive industry has started showing signs of recovery while the housing sector continues to be sluggish. We expect automotive production to be higher in North America, though weakness is expected to persist in Europe. Growing emerging markets should propel production in the paper and textile industry while the electrical industry is expected to pick up with increased industrial investment. Other industries, including food and agriculture, are also likely to gain momentum with the recovering economy. The construction industry, however, is expected to remain weak.Trends in Raw Material Markets
"
543,SHW,"The chemical industry is a large consumer of oil, naphtha and natural gas, which are widely used as energy and feedstock input. Crude oil prices have shown an uptrend since the second half of 2009. Oil prices have now reached near 2008 levels, when prices were historically high. Naphtha prices also soared through 2009 and are expected to rise further.
"
544,SHW,"U.S. natural gas prices declined in the first nine months of 2009, but moved slightly upward thereafter. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, average annual gas price in the US was around $4 per mbtu in 2009 and remained at the same level in the first half of 2010, considerably below 2008 prices. Natural gas prices are expected to remain weak in the near-to-medium term, positively impacting profits for North American chemical manufacturers.OPPORTUNITIES
"
545,SHW,"The overall chemical industry is in consolidation mode, driven by the need for creating scale economies in operations and supply-chain management. Major chemical makers are expanding through mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures. While we can cite multiple examples from recent history, the more noteworthy cases are those of Dow Chemicals (DOW), Agrium (AGU) and CF Industries (CF  -  Free Report).
"
546,SHW,"Dow Chemicals is delivering cost synergies from its recent Rohm and Haas acquisition. Similarly, fertilizer manufacturer Agrium is growing through a combination of acquisitions and organic expansion. Agrium’s acquisition of United Agri-Products is expected to drive growth through an expanded product line. The take-over of rival Terra Industries has made CF a global leader in the nitrogen fertilizer sector.
"
547,SHW,"After a tough 2009, chemical producers remain cautious about capital expenditures. Aggressive cost cuts and superior technology have been key techniques employed by most chemical manufacturers. DuPont (DD), for instance, plans to capture $1 billion each in the years between 2010 and 2012 by way of reducing fixed costs and working capital productivity gains.PPG Industries (PPG  -  Free Report), a major global supplier of protective and decorative coatings, responded to the economic turmoil with aggressive restructuring and cost reduction measures, while further increasing its focus on cash flows.
"
548,SHW,"Additionally, leading chemical companies are consolidating mature businesses and are moving to low-cost regions. Fertilizer companies such as Potash Corporation (POT) benefits from geographic diversification as nearly 60% of its total production is exported. Other chemical manufacturers, such as Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report) are benefiting through diversification into downstream businesses that have helped boost revenue and margins.
"
549,SHW,"Dow Chemical, DuPont, Agrium and CF have long-term Neutral recommendations while PPG Industries and Eastman have long-term Outperform recommendations. WEAKNESSES
"
550,SHW,"The chemical industry as a whole remains heavily exposed to economic cycles and pretty much all of the industry’s underperformance of the last two years can be put down to the economic turmoil. The global economic meltdown led to weak industrial demand for chemicals, which led to under-utilization of production capacity, resulting in a dramatic fall in operating profits worldwide.
"
551,SHW,"While the global economic recovery appears to be firmly in place, the recent turmoil in Europe and its impact on global growth remain sources of near-term uncertainty. Chemical giant’s like DOW and DuPont have significant exposure to Europe with around 25% of their net sales coming from the region.
"
552,SHW,"Weak residential and commercial construction demand especially affected companies engaged in paint and coatings. Revenues and margins for Sherwin-Williams (SHW  -  Free Report), the largest US producer of paints and coatings, declined significantly in 2009. We do not foresee any significant momentum in earnings growth for SHW unless there is some substantial growth in macro trends.
"
553,SHW,"Recently, we downgraded Valspar Corporation (VAL), the sixth largest paint and coatings manufacturer globally, to Neutral from our previous Outperform recommendation. The downgrade was driven by concerns over rising raw material costs and pricing pressures that are taking a toll on the company’s paint business.
"
554,SHW,"Recessionary trends, coupled with inventory de-stocking led to a sharp drop in volumes in the activated carbon sector last year, affecting Calgon Carbon Corporation (CCC), a leader in the activated carbon sector, and Celanese Corporation (CE  -  Free Report), the global hybrid chemical company. A continuation of weak economic trends, particularly in the housing market, could hamper the growth of chemical makers.
"
555,SHW,"Sherwin-Williams, Valspar, Celanese and Calgon Carbon have long-term Neutral recommendations.

"
560,SHW,"Other derivatives and basic industrials in this segment include synthetic rubber, surfactants, dyes and pigments, turpentine, resins, carbon black, explosives and rubber products. Inorganic chemicals make up the oldest of the basic chemical categories and include products such as salt, chlorine, caustic soda, soda ash, acids (including nitric, phosphoric and sulfuric acid), titanium dioxide and hydrogen peroxide.

562,SHW,"Specialty chemicals include electronic chemicals; industrial gases; adhesives and sealants; coatings, industrial and institutional cleaning chemicals; and catalysts. This is a relatively highly priced and rapidly growing segment with diverse end markets.
"
563,SHW,"Consumer products include the direct product sale of chemical-based products such as soaps, detergents and cosmetics. It also includes products such as sulfuric acid, nitrogen, ethylene, oxygen, lime, ammonia, propylene, polyethylene, chlorine, phosphoric acid and diammonium phosphates.Mixed Outlook
"
564,SHW,"After the sharp declines in the last two years, we expect worldwide chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) to recover, albeit at a slow rate. At a global level, we currently expect chemical production to require another couple of years to recover to levels seen before the crisis.
"
565,SHW,"In industrialized countries, severe declines in production as a result of the recession will have longer-lasting effects. The North American chemical production is expected to experience above-average growth in 2010, with domestic demand improving from the key customer industries on the back of a recovering global economy. Chemical giant BASF is expecting about 10% growth in the US chemical industry on the back of rising demand for exports.
"
566,SHW,"In response to the slow recovery in demand, chemicals companies have been disciplined in bringing capacity onboard, resulting in meaningful improvements in the bottom line. We believe aggressive efforts in working capital reductions, supply chain optimization and productivity improvement should yield margin benefits. There is also a chance of accelerating capacity growth in 2011–2012, assuming that older projects do not get cancelled. We expect a strong cash flows and underleveraged balance sheet to support growth opportunities for chemical producers going forward.End-Market Scenarios
"
567,SHW,"Demand for chemicals tracks global industrial production and global GDP very closely. The chemical industry was particularly affected by the weak industrial demand in the second half of 2008 and in the first half of 2009. The drop in production in the chemical industry has been almost in sync with lower production in the key customer industries of housing, construction, automotive, electrical, furniture and paper. Nearly 10% of the chemical demand in the country is directly tied to the housing sector, and an additional 10% is tied to the auto sector.
"
568,SHW,"The automotive industry has started showing signs of recovery while the housing sector continues to be sluggish. We expect automotive production to be higher in North America, though a weakness is expected to persist in Europe . Production in the paper and textile industry is expected to improve, primarily as a result of growth in emerging markets. The electrical industry is expected to pick up with increased industrial investment.
"
569,SHW,"Other industries including food and agriculture are also likely to gain pace with the recovering economy. The construction industry, however, is expected to remain weak. 
"
570,SHW,"Trends in Raw Material Markets
"
571,SHW,"The chemical industry is a large consumer of oil, natural gas and energy, which are widely used as an energy and feedstock input. During 2009, oil prices rose 87% from about $40 per barrel to more than $75 per barrel, re-attaining October 2007 levels. Prices for the chemical raw material naphtha soared in almost exactly the same way as the oil price; naphtha rose throughout 2009 from an average level of $340 per metric ton in January to well over $600 per metric ton in October.
"
572,SHW,"In both the US and Europe, natural gas prices fell during 2009 before increasing in the last quarter of the year. The average annual gas price in the US was around $4 per mbtu, less than half the cost in the previous year. In Europe, the average gas price was well over $8 per mbtu. Natural gas pries are expected to remain weak in the near-to-medium term, boosting profits for North American chemical manufacturers.OPPORTUNITIES
"
573,SHW,"The overall chemical industry is in a consolidation mode, driven by the need for creating scale economies in operations, supply-chain management and capital market needs. Major players are expanding activity through mergers, acquisitions, alliances and joint ventures. While we can cite multiple examples from recent history, the more noteworthy ones are those of Dow Chemicals (DOW), Agrium (AGU) and CF Industries (CF  -  Free Report).
"
574,SHW,"Dow Chemicals continues to progress in delivering cost synergies from its latest acquisition of Rohm and Haas. Similarly, fertilizer manufacturer Agrium is growing through a combination of acquisitions and organic expansion. Agrium’s acquisition of United Agri-Products is expected to drive growth through an expanded product line. The take-over of rival Terra Industries has made CF a global leader in the nitrogen fertilizer sector.
"
575,SHW,"After a tough 2009, chemical makers would be careful in planning capital expenditures. Focus on aggressive cost reduction and improving yield from better technology have been a key technique for chemical manufacturers. DuPont (DD), for instance, plans to capture $1 billion each in the years between 2010 and 2012 by way of reducing fixed costs and working capital productivity gains.PPG Industries (PPG  -  Free Report), a major global supplier of protective and decorative coatings, responded to the economic turmoil with aggressive restructuring and cost reduction measures, while further increasing its focus on cash flows.
"
576,SHW,"Additionally, leading chemical companies have been consolidating mature businesses and have started migrating to low-cost locations. Fertilizer companies such as Potash Corporation (POT) benefits from geographic diversification as nearly 63% of its production is exported. Other chemical manufacturers such as Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report) are benefiting through diversification into downstream businesses that have helped boost revenue and margin growth.
"
577,SHW,"Collectively, DuPont, PPG Industries and Eastman carry a short-term (1 to 3 months) Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) and a longer-term Outperform recommendation. On the other hand, Dow Chemical, Valspar, Agrium and CF are a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) and a long-term Neutral recommendation.
"
578,SHW,"WEAKNESSES
"
579,SHW,"The chemical industry as a whole remains heavily exposed to economic cycles and pretty much all of the industry’s underperformance of the last two years can be put down to the economic turmoil. The global economic meltdown led to a weak industrial demand for chemicals, which led to significant regional and global production overcapacities, resulting in a dramatic fall in operating profits across the world. While the global economic recovery appears to be firmly in place, the recent turmoil in Europe and its impact on global growth remain sources of near-term uncertainty. 
"
580,SHW,"Weak residential and commercial construction demand especially affected companies into paint and coatings. Revenues and margins for Sherwin-Williams (SHW  -  Free Report), the largest US producer of paints and coatings, declined significantly in 2009. We do not foresee any significant momentum in earnings growth unless there is some substantial growth in macro trends.
"
581,SHW,"Recently, we downgraded Valspar Corporation (VAL), the sixth largest paint and coatings manufacturer globally, to Neutral from our previous Outperform recommendation. The downgrade was driven by concerns over the high raw material costs and pricing pressures taking toll on the company’s paint business.
"
582,SHW,"Recessionary trends coupled with inventory de-stocking resulted in sharp volume declines in the activated carbon sector last year, affecting Calgon Carbon Corporation (CCC), a leader in the activated carbon sector, and Celanese Corporation (CE  -  Free Report), the global hybrid chemical company. A continuation of weak economic trends, particularly in the housing market, could hamper the growth of chemical makers. A further surge in raw material costs from persistently high oil prices could adversely impact margins.
"
583,SHW,"Calgon Carbon, Sherwin-Williams and Valspar are a short-term Zacks #3 Rank while Celanese is a Zacks #2 Rank.

"
589,SHW,"The chemical industry consists of companies engaged in the processing and refinement of agricultural and industrial chemicals as well as gases. Chemicals are used to make a wide variety of consumer goods, besides being necessary in the agriculture, manufacturing, construction and service industries. The European Union and the U.S. house the world's largest chemical companies.
"
590,SHW,"The entire US chemical industry is divided into four segments – basic chemicals, life sciences, specialty chemicals and consumer products. Many of the larger companies operate in all or most of these segments, while specialized operators are also numerous.
"
591,SHW,"Basic chemicals or commodity chemicals form the major chunk of the chemical industry. Products here include polymers, plastics, bulk petrochemicals and intermediates, other derivatives and basic industrials, inorganic chemicals and fertilizers. Of this, polymers generate the largest revenue. The major end-markets for plastics in this segment are packaging, followed by home construction, containers, appliances, pipes, transportation, toys and games.
"
592,SHW,"Other derivatives and basic industrials include synthetic rubber, surfactants, dyes and pigments, turpentine, resins, carbon black, explosives, and rubber products. Inorganic chemicals make up the oldest of the basic chemical categories and include products such as salt, chlorine, caustic soda, soda ash, acids (such as nitric, phosphoric and sulfuric), titanium dioxide and hydrogen peroxide. Fertilizers include phosphates, ammonia and potash chemicals.
"
593,SHW,"Life sciences include differentiated chemical and biological substances, pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, animal health products, vitamins and crop protection chemicals. Crop protection chemicals include herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides.
"
594,SHW,"Specialty chemicals include electronic chemicals; industrial gases; adhesives and sealants; coatings, industrial and institutional cleaning chemicals; and catalysts. These are relatively high valued and rapidly growing chemicals with diverse end product markets.

"
600,SHW,"Demand for fertilizers is driven by crop prices. The crop input sector is recovering and demand for potash has improved slightly. Crop nutrient margins are expected to improve significantly in 2010 due to strong demand and lower inventory costs than replacement costs.
"
601,SHW,"Agrium, for instance, expects a strong demand for crop nutrients and other crop inputs this spring, despite some recent weakening in crop prices. Both CF and Agrium are prepared for a reasonably good application season and spring demand due to attractive corn farming economics and restocking needed by downstream fertilizer channels.
"
602,SHW,"Other chemical manufacturers, such as Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report), are benefiting through diversification into downstream businesses that have help boost revenue and margin growth. Focus on aggressive cost reduction and improving yield from better technology have been a key techniques for chemical manufacturers.DuPont (DD), for instance, plans to capture $1 billion each in the years between 2010 and 2012 by way of reducing fixed costs and working capital productivity gains.
