In the other, it would license its self-driving-vehicle operating system and technology to carmakers.If Waymo forms a transportation network, it could have a fleet of 1.5 million autonomous vehicles by 2030, Mahaney said. This business could generate $1.9 billion in annual revenue with an operating loss of $1 billion by 2022. It could generate $65 billion in annual revenue with an operating profit of $20 billion by 2030. He sees break-even on an operating-income basis in 2025.If Waymo licenses its technology, it could generate $736 million in annual revenue by 2022. Operating profit could be $250 million.

1,MO,"Snoop Dogg, Sir Patrick Stewart and a large British tobacco company: all vaguely in the same news story, thanks to an investment deal announced late Wednesday that an analyst called Big Tobacco's ""most significant"" attempt yet to gain exposure to the marijuana industry.Imperial Brands Ventures, a subsidiary of U.K. tobacco giant Imperial Brands (IMBBY), and Snoop Dogg's venture capital firm, Casa Verde Capital, said they are investing in Oxford Cannabinoid Technologies, a British medical marijuana research firm backed by Stewart of ""Star Trek"" and ""X-Men"" fame.The decision by Imperial, whose cigarette brands include Winston and Kool, comes roughly a year after the company appointed the chairman of a medical cannabis company to its board. It also comes amid flagging demand for cigarettes, and on the heels of the FDA's approval this week of Epidiolex, a cannabis-based drug from GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH).""We are pleased to be partnering with OCT,"" Matthew Phillips, Imperial Brands' chief development officer, said in a statement on Wednesday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Cannabinoid products have significant potential and our investment enables Imperial to support OCT's important research while building a deeper understanding of the medical cannabis market,"" he continued.Earlier this year, an Imperial spokesman told IBD that the tobacco company was ""tracking developments in what is a fast-growing (cannabis) segment.""Oxford said in Wednesday's statement that it had secured investments from Imperial Brands Ventures and Casa Verde and others as part of a Series A funding round. Oxford will use the funds to set up a strategic research partnership and a laboratory in Europe.The company, founded in 2017, intends to fund research surrounding cannabinoids in academic institutions internationally.""With indications ranging from pain and inflammation to cancer and neurological disorders, OCT has commissioned research in many critical areas,"" the statement said.Cowen analyst Vivien Azer, in a research note on Thursday, said Imperial's investment was ""the most significant move among the global tobacco players in the cannabis industry to date. We continue to expect to see more activity in cannabis from both global tobacco and global alcohol.""Last year, Imperial appointed Simon Langelier, the chairman of PharmaCielo, a Canadian medical cannabis company, to its board. The spokesman for Imperial told IBD this year that the company appointed Langelier largely due to his three-decade stint at Philip Morris International. However, the spokesman added that Langelier's cannabis background was not ""irrelevant,"" either.Some analysts believe that the quickly growing — and destigmatizing — marijuana industry presents more of an opportunity for tobacco firms than alcohol.""Vaping is one of the fastest-growing segments in both nicotine and cannabis,"" Azer said in 2016. ""Upon federal legalization, Big Tobacco could leverage its expertise to explore the legal cannabis market through vapor.""Still, tobacco stocks like Altria Group (MO) and British American Tobacco (BTI) crashed two months ago after Philip Morris International (PMI) turned in weak first-quarter sales and weaker-than-expected demand for so-called ""reduced-risk"" devices.Turning Point Brands (TPB), which owns rolling-paper-maker Zig-Zag, has expressed excitement about pot legalization in Canada and the cannabis industry broadly. Philip Morris International planned to invest around $20 million in an Israeli company that makes a cannabis inhaler, according to reports in 2016.Imperial Brands rose 2.8% in over-the-counter U.S. trading. Altria was up 2.3% in the stock market today.British American Tobacco rallied 3.15%. Philip Morris gained 2.2%. Turning Point Brands ticked up 0.9%.Cronos Group (CRON) stock advanced 3.9%.

2,MO,"On the leading edge of the flourishing marijuana industry is MedMen's West Hollywood cannabis dispensary, which resembles an Apple (AAPL) store crossed with an upscale ski lodge. Touch-screen tablets on large, hazelnut tables display the buds' names and their prices. Clear, snowglobe-sized pods containing pot samples have a small latch at the top that customers can open to take in the fragrance. A staff member, one of many in a red MedMen T-shirt, relays customer orders via a small, clip-on microphone to a pickup counter.Big money is pouring into the legal cannabis market, potentially steering more U.S. consumer spending toward weed. And as the marijuana industry evolves into everyday consumerism, struggling beer and tobacco companies might find an avenue for new business in some of the increasingly popular products in Med Men's store: the cannabis drinks stacked in a refrigerator near the corner, or the sleek vaping devices and tins of prerolled joints, showcased in the tables' inset, fluorescent-lit displays.The trend has spurred Constellation Brands (STZ), the parent of Corona beer, to place a bigger bet on cannabis drinks. The creator of Blue Moon, the wheat beer owned by Molson Coors (TAP), wants to make THC beer. Former beverage execs have switched to the marijuana business. As for big tobacco companies, vaping devices alone could hand them a huge chunk of the pot market, a top Wall Street analyst says.Such moves face obvious obstacles. Pot is still federally prohibited, forcing shops to deal strictly in cash, even as California, the biggest marijuana market on the planet, and other states break away to legalize recreational use. Mixing alcohol with THC is also illegal. Less obvious obstacles include creating a cannabis drink that tastes like the alcoholic beverages we know and not, say, a weed fiber supplement.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStill, Andy Thomas, CEO of Craft Brew Alliance (BREW), whose beer brands include Red Hook and Kona, told IBD that pot is ""potentially one of the most disruptive factors"" to the beer industry, whether it's smoked, vaped or swallowed.""I think regardless of what kind of path you take, you can't help but say it's going to be another one of those forces that changes the way people socialize,"" he said.""You have to look at it as an opportunity,"" he added later. ""Otherwise I think we're kind of putting our head in the sand.""This month, Cowen & Co. estimated U.S. marijuana business could reach $75 billion by 2030 if fully legalized, indicating explosive growth. Its forecast two years ago put 2026 sales at $50 billion. That projection also compares with some estimates for current annual cigarette sales of $77 billion and beer sales of $110 billion, both of which are on the downtrend.Baby Boomers, seeking pain relief, are already buying more pot in general. So are more women, as cannabis products become easier and safer to buy in legal states. A report from the marijuana delivery platform Eaze, which operates in California, found that monthly marijuana spending last year among its thousands of users increased to $179-$189 from $125-$152 in 2016. An average-size pot dispensary draws more average yearly sales per square foot than a Whole Foods, and slightly less than a Costco (COST), research from Cowen and Marijuana Business Daily has shown.As the marijuana business shakes off threats from the Trump administration, MedMen, which has stores and other facilities in California, Nevada and New York, is trying to undo the stereotype of the pot dispensary as a windowless, cavernous weed deli.The company's stores have a bright, browsing-friendly atmosphere with staff who recommend cannabis products based on customers' preferences. In MedMen's store in downtown Los Angeles, shelves of creams, pet meds and Gummi candy line one wall. Near the checkout, wooden bins loaded with joints, packs of tea and other edibles, make up what spokesman Daniel Yi likened to an impulse-buy display.""Just the same way you shop at BevMo for your favorite Cab, the consumer wants to experience the store,"" he said during an interview in March.He said then that cannabis products that come in alternate forms — rather than the dry stuff people have been grinding, packing and rolling themselves for generations — could soon make up a majority of legal cannabis sales.Amid the influx of new marijuana users and shifting consumption habits, alcohol and tobacco companies have particular reason to take notice.As of 2016, the monthly rate of binge drinking was around 13% lower in states that had fully legalized pot than in states where it was illegal, Cowen's research this month shows.Meanwhile, Canada has been grooming itself to be a global leader for the cannabis industry. Toronto-based Cronos Group (CRON) has listed on the Nasdaq. Others, like Aurora Cannabis, plan to follow.""Ultimately, I see no reason why the global cannabis industry won't be as large as the brewing industry,"" said Cam Battley, chief corporate officer of Aurora.In May, Canopy Growth (CGC), which already trades in Canada, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange. MedMen followed that same month, with a listing on the Canadian Securities Exchange that came via a reverse takeover deal.However, tobacco companies like Altria Group (MO) and British American Tobacco (BTI), which includes Reynolds American, might have an easier time carving a way forward.""Vaping is one of the fastest-growing segments in both nicotine and cannabis,"" Cowen analyst Vivien Azer said in 2016. ""Upon federal legalization, big tobacco could leverage its expertise to explore the legal cannabis market through vapor.""She estimated then that big tobacco companies could nearly double their underlying growth via the cannabis market and grab around a fifth of the overall share of the marijuana industry by 2036 in a fully-legal U.S.Rather than try to snuff out the marijuana industry threat, beer giant Constellation agreed in October to take a minority stake in Canopy Growth. Bruce Linton, CEO of Canopy, said the investment followed nearly a year of conversations. Canopy, he said, was inspired to reach out after Constellation expressed interest in the cannabis market.""That was the very opposite of most of the other liquor, alcohol, wine guys, which was: 'How do we get rid of this problem?'"" Linton said. ""And so we thought that's the kind of guy we want to talk to.""The Canopy investment further chipped away at a longtime barrier between the beer and marijuana industries. But for other companies to make a similar move, they'd need to create an affiliate or subsidiary in Canada, and repatriating earnings from cannabis sales could still be difficult. Constellation Brands did not respond to requests for more detail about its investment in Canopy.The ongoing federal ban on pot is just one obstacle for the burgeoning marijuana industry, though the Trump administration last week signaled it wouldn't crack down on weed in states that have legalized it. Another is getting a precise, consistent dose that delivers a predictable high.Some bars already serve cocktails containing cannabidiol, or CBD, a nonpsychoactive but often-mellowing component of cannabis. CBD beer already exists. But the substance is unlikely to ease big alcohol companies' worries about people swapping booze with pot.""To really solve for the substitution issue, it's going to need to be THC,"" Azer said, referring to the psychoactive component tetrahydrocannabinol.But unlike tequila shots or bong rips, after which you generally know where you stand, edibles or THC coffee might take an hour or two.""People who consumed or who have kind of boomeranged to cannabis probably had a really bad story and experience with an edible, where they didn't know the dosing, or what's in it,"" said Sheena Shiravi, Eaze's director of communications. ""Education is really the key to that.""Eaze, she said, has tried to be upfront about products' THC and CBD levels, so that people can figure out how they react to a milligram or two. Lower-dose edibles, with two milligrams of THC, were popular last year, she said.Even so, achieving consistent taste in edibles and beverages — let alone one that doesn't resemble a rubberized, liquefied version of weed – has been another hurdle.""There have been a lot of folks in our space, the edibles space specifically, that have had trouble with uniformity throughout their products, making sure that one bite and one sip is the same as the next, or discoloration, cloudiness in the case of beverages and food, it can clump up and just taste funky,"" said Alex Howe, co-founder and president of Rebel Coast winery, which is making a THC-oil-infused, alcohol-removed sauvignon blanc.Chip Forsythe, Rebel Coast's winemaker and CEO, said he chose a sauvignon blanc because of the wine's citrusy, lemon-grass notes. And he said it tasted better than other wines when the alcohol is removed, while lending itself to some  characteristics of cannabis.But even as people look to avoid hangovers and alcohol's side effects, making that wine, he said, is far more difficult than letting the grapes sit around while yeast eats the sugar. And he said people still like the taste of the grape-based stuff that has existed for thousands of years.""We did a lot of trials in the beginning thinking that marijuana infused-wine should taste like wine and smell like marijuana,"" Forsythe said. ""We've ruled that out just from getting a tremendous amount of customer feedback on it. People really wanted something that tasted like wine, looked like wine and smelled like wine.""Thomas, of Craft Brew Alliance, said his company has held focus groups and conversations with people in the marijuana industry. He said he would consider making or selling cannabis-infused beverages and other products if federal prohibition were lifted. But he notes that pot regulations differ from state to state, and that competition can differ from product to product.""Trying to compete with weed at something that's predominantly in edible form is a very different animal than trying to compete with weed as something that's part of an ingredient form, is probably totally different than competing with weed, which is kind of an inhalable,"" Thomas said. ""And I think until we really know a lot of that it will be challenging for us to figure out what to do.""None of those products seems likely to wipe out demand for buds. Canopy's Linton likes the odds for marijuana beverages, which combine drinking rituals with the high that comes from smoking.""I've never had somebody say, 'Do you want to come over for Gummi bears?'"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Could Big Tobacco Become Big Cannabis As Marijuana Business Soars?These Marijuana Stocks With Second-Hand Exposure May Surprise YouHere's How Enormous Marijuana Business Could Get With LegalizationThe Apple Store For Weed Partners With Nasdaq's First Pot Stock

4,MO,"A day before April 20, when a dome of pot fumes will account for approximately 90% of the smog over Los Angeles and its hot marijuana business, Big Tobacco stocks giants Altria Group (MO), sister firm Philip Morris International (PM) and British American Tobacco (BTI) tanked on fresh signs of declining demand.The reason was that Philip Morris, which sells outside the U.S., fell short of Q1 sales expectations, amid an ongoing consumer flight from cigarettes in most of the world. Weaker-than-anticipated demand for reduced-risk devices that aren't cigarettes, particularly in Japan, also hurt.One place where none of this is a problem, at least right now, is the rapidly growing, quasi-legal marijuana business. More users, perhaps accepting that they don't enjoy coughing or pot smoke's armpit-spice smell, are turning to vaping devices. Some analysts say that trend could be an opportunity for firms like Altria and Turning Point Brands (TPB), which owns rolling-paper-maker Zig Zag and two vaping companies.""Vaping is one of the fastest-growing segments in both nicotine and cannabis,"" Cowen analyst Vivien Azer said in 2016. ""Upon federal legalization, Big Tobacco could leverage its expertise to explore the legal cannabis market through vapor.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseShe estimated then that Big Tobacco companies could nearly double their underlying growth via cannabis. Overall, assuming full legalization, Big Tobacco could scoop up around a fifth of the overall share of the marijuana business by 2036, she said in a report then.The marijuana delivery platform Eaze said last year that ready-to-use products, which include vaping devices, for the first time made up a greater portion of its sales than ""flower,"" the industry's term for buds. Vaporizers in November and December made up a greater percentage of sales than dry, loose buds, according to data from the company, which operates in California. ""Not a lot of people know how to roll a joint, or they don't have the paraphernalia to consume the flower,"" Sheena Shiravi, Eaze's director of communications. ""So (with) prerolls, they can just consume flower, or even better, a vaporizer.""Even so, people do, in fact, still roll joints. Turning Point Brands said in March that ""there will be a whole new audience of consumers"" of people rolling their own in Canada, where recreational pot legalization kicks in this year. Turning Point Brands at that time said it widened its offering of its Zig Zag Orange and King-Size Slim rolling papers in Canada, and that its partners were ""exploring additional opportunity products"" beyond this year.At a conference in January, Turning Point Brands CEO Larry Wexler said that it saw the marijuana business as an ""exciting opportunity"" that it was still trying to understand. He added: ""I suspect that there probably are some people who buy our products that were intended for tobacco — my lawyer's sitting here — intended for tobacco and they go off and they credibly use it for other products.""Even as it remains enthusiastic about the marijuana business, Turning Point Brands said in January that it had no plans for any prerolled products. Azer suggested that tobacco companies pushing lower-health-risk products might not want the extra glare from regulators that could come with trying to sell their own joints.""The tobacco industry is highly scrutinized and highly regulated,"" she said. ""And that's true in the U.S. and it's true globally as well. Right now, one of the key priorities for global tobacco companies are their reduced-risk product platforms.""The marijuana business, however, has its own big health problems. In California, new cannabis industry regulations on pesticides take hold in July. Those rules have raised fears that the vast majority of the pot sold via dispensaries would come up short, choking off supply and pushing prices higher. The changes would likely favor the state's small portion of licensed, deeper-pocketed pot growers.Despite the marijuana industry's rebranding efforts — the rustic-chic packaging and the chipper, minimalist startup logos — a lot of pot is still loaded with chemicals that are bad for you, a Rolling Stone article from March notes. That story also notes that because marijuana is illegal on a federal level, the EPA hasn't approved or rejected what pesticides to use for pot the way it does for other plants.Meanwhile, other tobacco companies have made quieter moves that may, or may not, signal interest in the marijuana business. Philip Morris International planned to invest roughly $20 million in Syqe Medical, an Israeli company that makes a cannabis inhaler, according to reports in 2016. Syqe ""will develop technologies for Phillip Morris that will help reduce health risks associated with smoking,"" Reuters said, citing the Israeli news outlet Calcalist. Philip Morris declined to provide any extra information beyond existing press accounts. The overseas Big Tobacco firm said it ""has no plans to develop or commercialize cannabis products."" Similarly, Altria, which owns Philip Morris USA and spun off Philip Morris International a decade ago, said ""Marijuana remains illegal under federal law and Altria's companies have no plans to sell marijuana-based products.""Imperial Brands (IMBBY), the U.K. company whose brands include cigarettes like Winston and Kool, last year appointed Simon Langelier to its board. Langelier is a 30-year Philip Morris International veteran who is also chairman of a medical cannabis company. Imperial, in a release, cited his experience in ""wider consumer adjacencies.""When asked about how Imperial was viewing the cannabis market, Simon Evans, a spokesman for the company, said it is ""tracking developments in what is a fast-growing segment."" Evans stressed that Langelier's experience at Philip Morris was the main reason for his appointment. But Evans indicated his cannabis industry experience wasn't just an afterthought. ""So, is it irrelevant? No. It's not,"" he said.  YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Will Marijuana Industry Overtake Beer As Legalization Spurs Innovation?These Marijuana Stocks With Second-Hand Exposure May Surprise YouThe Apple Store For Weed Partners With Nasdaq's First Pot StockBeer Giant To Take More Active Role In Cannabis, Boost Pot SpendingLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

5,MO,"Falling smoking rates may be good for global lifespans, but it's bad news for Philip Morris International (PM), whose bet on reduced-risk products has been slow to pay off.XThe seller of Marlboros outside the U.S. reported revenue excluding excise taxes of $6.9 billion, less than the $7.03 billion that analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had been projecting. Shares sank 16.6%.As global smoking rates decline, tobacco companies are trying to keep up performance by boosting prices and introducing new products. That didn't fully pan out last quarter as sales were hit by increased taxes in Saudi Arabia and slower demand. Cigarette shipments fell 5.3% in the first quarter, offsetting a rise in heated tobacco unit deliveries.Philip Morris has developed four ""platforms"" it says are less harmful than cigarettes. The first, called iQos, heats a tobacco plug without setting it on fire. Chief Executive Officer Andre Calantzopoulos has said he envisions a world where all 1 billion smokers have switched to reduced-risk nicotine delivery systems.Other tobacco companies' shares also fell in Thursday trading. Imperial Brands PLC was down as much as 5.2%, while British American Tobacco (BTI) dropped nearly 8%, triggering a halt in trading.IQos was available in 38 markets as of February. Platform 2 was introduced in a city test in the Dominican Republic in December. That product, called TEEPS, is a second heat-not-burn offering that resembles a regular cigarette with a tip that prevents it from setting on fire. The company plans to launch a consumer test for the third platform, a nicotine inhaler, this year, and it expects to release a next-generation version of Platform 4, an e-vapor offering.IQos could soon be available in a major market: the U.S. Philip Morris's sister company Altria Group (MO) would sell the product under a licensing agreement in the event that it receives Food and Drug Administration approval.The company raised its earnings guidance for 2018 by 5 cents to between $5.25 and $5.40, primarily due to a lower tax rate. That new forecast takes into account lower-than-expected growth in Japanese device sales.""We are now reaching more conservative adult smoker segments that may require, at least at first, slightly more time for adoption,"" Calantzopoulos said in a statement. ""Even if this temporary dynamic in Japan persists, we remain on track to double our worldwide in-market sales of heated tobacco units compared to 2017.""Wells Fargo & Co. analyst Bonnie Herzog said the lower-than-expected Japanese demand for non-cigarette products will pressure stock prices Thursday. However, she said she isn't concerned because it ""reflects iQos entering a more mature phase of growth"" and ""doesn't detract from its strong growth prospects globally.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Leaderboard: Daily Updates On Stocks With Potential For Big GainsBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

In a report titled, ""The Ongoing Case for an Apple iCar,"" Cihra said the market opportunity is simply too large for Apple to ignore.""We believe Apple needs big new TAMs (total addressable markets) to keep growing and we reiterate our expectation that it ultimately launches a self-driving car, irrespective of contrary news flow and even its own hesitations to date,"" Cihra said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

7,MO,"In their quest for cash, municipalities across the nation are trampling individual rights and human dignity by imposing arbitrary and abusive fines on residents. In some cities, if you walk on the left side of the sidewalk rather than the right, you could be fined. BBQ in the front lawn? Face a fine. Have mismatched window treatments? Face a fine.But this past month, a federal judge approved a major settlement that should create a model for reining in abusive practices at municipal courts.Pagedale, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis, used ticketing as a source of revenue. With just 3,000 residents in one square mile, Pagedale wrote more than 32,000 tickets in less than seven years. That flood of citations turned the municipal court into a cash register. It churned through a staggering 241 cases per session in 2013, as fines and fees accounted for nearly a quarter of Pagedale's budget in some years, becoming its second-largest source of revenue.After Missouri capped the amount of revenue that cities could collect from traffic fines, non-traffic code violations in Pagedale almost quintupled. Nearly 40% of adults received housing code violations like those listed above.Determined to vindicate their constitutional rights, three residents joined with the Institute for Justice and brought a class-action lawsuit against Pagedale in 2015.Their lawsuit has now borne fruit: Pagedale recently agreed to repeal its nuisance and housing code ordinances, and dismiss all charges of failure to appear in court. The municipal court will advise those facing incarceration of the right to counsel at no cost if they cannot afford one, provide information on paying fines and fees in installments, and hold hearings on ability to pay before punishing someone for failing to make payment.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhat happened in Pagedale was certainly alarming but unfortunately not unique. Research by the Conference on State Court Administrators found that more than $50 billion in criminal justice debt is owed by roughly 10 million Americans.To end the practice of municipal courts gouging those who come before them we must address three aspects of the current system.First, states need to eliminate the profit incentives created when citation fines are deposited into city treasuries, and fees retained by the courts that levy them.A new lawsuit brought by the Institute for Justice details how Doraville, Ga., relies on prosecuting and convicting people for code and minor traffic violations as a rich source of revenue. So rich, in fact, that in recent years Doraville has mined between 19% and 30% of its budget in fines, fees and forfeitures.With that much at stake, municipal officials are under pressure to funnel the maximum number of people through the system and force them to pay as much as possible as soon as possible. By one account, Doraville spends almost half of its budget on policing, with officers writing an average of 40 tickets per day.Instead, state law should require fines and fees to be sent to neutral recipients, like county or state education, or health care providers. The urge of municipal officials to maximize collection disappears without the lure of that revenue for their city-employer and their own salaries.Second, county or state courts should adjudicate traffic and ordinance violations, as Kentucky among other jurisdictions do. Municipal courts have too powerful a motive to convict or obtain the guilty pleas that turn citations into revenue. All too often, court personnel are beholden to their city-employer. In the process, revenue expectations replace the dispensing of blind justice.County and state judges are less susceptible to a city's financial aspirations and better able to properly apply the law neutrally — free of financial self-interest.Finally, states should prevent municipal judges from using or threatening harsh punishments to coerce full and immediate payment of steep fines and fees. This means enforcing the constitutional ban on incarcerating people who cannot pay, barring their detention for failure to abide by a court order to pay, and offering less-onerous payment plans.Further, municipal courts must fully inform every one of their rights and the charges against them.As the Pagedale and Doraville cases show, municipalities prey on those least able to defend themselves in an unfair system. States need to update their laws to restrain egregious municipal practices and ensure that ordinary people aren't at the mercy of courts bent on filling their city's coffers.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

10,MO,"Figuring out how to help midcareer executives is fairly easy compared with figuring out what millennials want from financial services.Midcareer executives hire an advisor to handle the complexities of their financial life. They've got sizable assets to manage, steep tuition bills for their kids and retirement and estate planning needs.Millennials, by contrast, may have a limited understanding of what advisors do. They're just starting out in their career, so they have less cash on hand.Moreover, some young professionals harbor suspicions about the financial industry. Growing up amid the Great Recession left them skeptical of Wall Street institutions and investment products.Yet advisors cannot ignore this huge segment of the marketplace. In the coming decades, millennials will inherit substantial assets from their baby boomer parents while entering their prime earning years.For advisors to win over the next generation, citing their credentials and knowledge isn't enough. They also need to explain their fee structure.""A lot of millennials have a negative perception of financial advisors,"" according to a Deloitte study. ""To overcome this negative attitude, wealth management firms initially need to focus on the pricing transparency.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAdvisors who court a younger clientele are getting the message. Many of them include an overview of their fees on their firm's website.""Millennials seem cost-sensitive, particularly with so many low-cost platforms available,"" said Peter Lazaroff, a certified financial planner in St. Louis. ""They are more likely to bring up cost-related questions like, 'How are you paid?' or 'What's the cost of this fund?'""When millennials weigh whether to hire an advisor, they want assurance that they're hiring an educator acting in their best interest. They don't want a salesperson pitching products.They may already understand the role of a fiduciary, but many advisors still define the term. Stating at the outset that the only compensation they receive comes from the client — not from products they sell — can address concerns about hidden fees and commissions.""When we go through the client agreement, our fees are very clearly laid out,"" Lazaroff said. ""We show fees in both annual and monthly terms. Millennials are used to a monthly subscription model, so we bill monthly.""Because many young adults have wide-ranging financial needs, they tend to seek advisors who adopt flexible pricing options. Advisors who offer pricing to fit an individual's situation can attract more early-career clients.Deb Meyer, a certified financial planner in Saint Charles, Mo., charges new clients a one-time fee, currently $1,000. That reflects more frequent meetings during the first year. From there, financial planning clients pay a monthly amount based on the level of service that she provides. The amount ranges from $175 to $375.""I give them the exact number after I meet with them, based on their net worth and income,"" she said. ""My practice is heavily focused on young professionals in their 30s and 40s"" who welcome different pricing tiers.She knows of other advisors who charge new clients on an hourly basis or per project. But she rejects that approach. After 10 years as an advisor, Meyer has learned that summarizing her fees on her firm's website filters out some wavering prospects.""Providing more pricing transparency on my website has improved the quality of leads I get,"" she said. ""There's this question of whether potential clients will be deterred by seeing my fees upfront. But it's fine if that happens because my time is valuable and I'd prefer to serve more engaged clients who are committed to the process.""Young professionals may not necessarily understand how advisors get paid. That can lead to faulty assumptions about the nature of the relationship.When millennials who already have an advisor decide to shop around and switch wealth management firms, they may balk at the notion of paying a monthly retainer. Even though many advisors are embracing this model, it's still sometimes perceived as a less traditional way to charge for financial planning.When Autumn Campbell, an advisor in Tulsa, Okla., presents her fees to newcomers, a few of them reply, ""But my current advisor doesn't charge me.""In addition to educating them about the various ways in which advisors earn compensation, Campbell might propose that they bring in their current statement so that she can compare costs. She finds that many clients aren't accustomed to paying a monthly fee.""We use a fee calculator, entering (a prospect's) net worth and income on a screen to show what they'd pay,"" Campbell said. ""If there's sticker shock, which we've had just a few times, we thank them and emphasize that we want them to make informed decisions.""Ending the meeting on a positive note pays off. Campbell recalls a woman in her mid-30s who didn't want to pay the fee, but changed her mind three months later and signed on.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Advisors Extract More Value From Their Time By Working EfficientlyWhat's Going On In The Stock Market Today?

11,MO,"For financial advisors seeking to build a sustainable business, attracting clients is a strategic imperative. Learning how to market financial services to millennials can pave the way for years of steady growth.Yet trying to discern the preferences and proclivities of millennials — those born in the 1980s and early 1990s — poses a series of challenges for financial advisors in a hiring mode. While they may have grown up on social media and rely on tech tools to manage their everyday lives, their attitudes and aspirations are hard to pin down.Depending on whom you ask, millennials are a different breed of consumer — or they're similar to older generations. They enter into professional relationships with different expectations — or the same ones that older clients bring.Stereotypes of cynical, lazy narcissists miss the mark. Assuming that they are coddled, entitled or impatient can stymie marketers, hiring mangers and professional service providers.When advisors strategize about the future, they often conclude that they must redouble their outreach to millennials. Winning over young adults paves the way for long-term relationships as they accumulate assets and need comprehensive financial planning.""My target is clients age 25 to 35 because that's an underserved market,"" said Mike Zeiter, an advisor in Carthage, Mo. ""This age group lacks the assets to work with traditional advisors, but they may have student loans and face decisions about their 401(k), buying a home and setting other financial goals.""Young professionals with limited income can still benefit from an advisor's guidance. The financial decisions they make at an early stage of their career can have lasting, powerful effects.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseZeiter says that many of his clients are young couples with a combined annual income over $100,000. These clients may lack a deep grounding in financial matters.""They often don't choose the right 401(k) option,"" he said. ""They may choose the default (option) or what the guy in the next office suggests.""Persuading millennials, even high earners or hard-charging entrepreneurs, to pay for an advisor's services can take patience and perseverance. They may view financial planning as a low priority or harbor misconceptions about an advisor's role.""It can be a hard sell because it's a service many of them aren't used to,"" said Zeiter, a fee-only planner who charges a monthly retainer. One of the top questions he addresses on his firm's website is, ""What do you offer that I can't do myself?""Younger advisors wield an advantage because they can connect with millennials better than their elders. In their own lives, they may have grappled with buying their first home, managing debt and optimizing employee benefits.They can also assure clients they will provide financial planning services over the long haul. Zeiter, 28, often tells millennials: ""I'm young enough where we can work together for your whole career.""Because he expects to stay in the business for decades, Zeiter has established a client mix of about 75% younger professionals who pay a monthly fee and 25% who are older and pay a percentage of assets under management.""That can change over the years to a 50/50 split as I get older and my clients get older,"" he said.In structuring their practice, advisors who defer to their clients' preferred communication style tend to attract more millennials. Along with providing a secure online platform for clients to access and track their accounts, advisors learn to develop strong working relationships from afar.""Many millennials don't want to talk on the phone or meet in person,"" Zeiter said. ""They may be more comfortable doing everything virtually.""Communicating largely by videoconference, text messages and email may initially seem like a less effective way to cultivate trust with remote clients. But over time, an advisor's accessibility and sound advice can prove a differentiator.To grow your business, you'll need existing clients to refer their friends and colleagues to you. Traditionally, advisors ask for such referrals. But that approach can backfire with millennials.""It's not easy to get referrals from millennials,"" said Greg Karis, a Los Angeles, Calif.-based advisor. Through their online networks, they may know hundreds of people but lack strong connections with them.Karis, 31, invests time getting to know his millennial clients better — and tracks their lives via social media. Rather than press them for referrals, he waits for the professional relationship to blossom.""If you ask for referrals too early, they will clam up and pull away,"" Karis warned.As an alternate strategy, Karis recently asked a friend — a real estate entrepreneur — for help identifying prospects. After his friend told Karis to scan his LinkedIn contacts, Karis came up with 15 promising leads.""He told me more about each of them and introduced me to them,"" Karis said. He reached five of them by phone and he's hoping his outreach bears fruit.As much as older advisors try to identify with a young client, the age gap can prove tough to bridge. That's why they often seek to recruit new associates who can better relate with their millennial peers.""If you're an advisor in your 50s or 60s and you want to attract the next generation of clients, look inward and ask who on your team is going to attract the next generation,"" said Aaron Schaben, executive vice president at the Carson Group in Omaha, Neb. ""You need to incubate the next generation of leadership in your firm.""Schaben, 32, works with advisors to grow their business. He extracts insights from his firm's ""millennial advisory council,"" a sampling of young clients who offer input.""We've found that millennials want an advisor who's the same age as them along with the power of a team who's behind that advisor,"" he said. ""And they want an experience that combines maximum technology with the human touch.""Millennials seeking more connections in the community suggested that the firm host networking events. Pouncing on the idea, the firm launched one-hour ""Wine Wednesdays"" in which clients and prospects mingled with a guest speaker such as a real estate agent or home health care expert.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:What's The Stock Market Doing Now?Advisors Extract More Value From Their Time By Working Efficiently

12,MO,"That's what's being confirmed this week as traders and analysts trek across Kansas for the Wheat Quality Council's annual crop tour. Plants are shorter than normal with shallow roots after drought this winter, coupled with an unusual spring cold, stunted development. Some fields were in such bad shape that farmers talked about ripping up their crops and replanting with sorghum.July futures for hard red winter wheat jumped 11% in April on speculation that drought would damage Great Plains crops. This week's tour was the first opportunity of the year to systematically inspect multiple fields and assess the damage from the dry, freezing weather. Kansas is the biggest U.S. grower of the grain variety that's mostly used in making bread.""The market's really been paying close attention to it,"" said Brian Hoops, president of Midwest Market Solutions in Springfield, Mo. ""The tour overall may come in somewhere less than last year, but maybe not as bad as some people had feared.""Yields measured Tuesday by participants on the tour averaged 38.2 bushels an acre in northwest and north-central Kansas, the lowest for the day since 2015. On Wednesday, results in western Kansas were 25% below last year. Reports from Nebraska, Colorado and Oklahoma also indicated waning production.About 90 traders, millers, farmers and government employees are weaving along routes from Colby to Wichita. The group will issue a final yield estimate for Kansas on Thursday. While there has been some rain during the tour, more than half of the state was facing moderate to severe drought as of May 1, the latest U.S. Drought Monitor figures show.At midday Wednesday, plants in western Kansas were less than half their normal height, increasing this risk of additional yield cuts unless there's significant precipitation in the next two weeks, Dennis Haugen, a director of the North Dakota Grain Growers Association, said in an interview near Ness City.""My main concern is the stage of crop development is so far behind,"" he said.

13,MO,"Former Vice President Joe Biden recently told MSNBC's Rev. Al Sharpton that the GOP wants voter identification laws for one reason. Racist Republicans so despise blacks and are so determined to oppress them, that they seek to prevent all blacks from voting.Biden said: ""It's what these guys are all about, man. These Republicans don't want working-class people voting. They don't want black folks voting."" What Republicans ""are all about,"" according to Biden, is the push in some states for voter ID laws, which Democrats call ""voter suppression."" Then-Attorney General Eric Holder characterized the call for voter ID laws as an example of ""pernicious"" racism.If it is ""pernicious"" racism, apparently a lot of people failed to get the memo. Blacks want voter ID laws, too. A 2016 Gallup Poll found: ""Though many of the arguments for early voting and against voter ID laws frequently cite minorities' voting access, nonwhites' views of the two policies don't differ markedly from those of whites. Seventy-seven percent of nonwhites favor both policies, while whites favor each at 81%."" This has not stopped the Democrats from turning the legitimate concern about the integrity of voting into a full-on attack against blacks.Biden, of course, is a skilled veteran at playing the race card. Recall how then-Vice President Biden, in 2012, somehow turned then-GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney's opposition to the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform bill into a racial issue. ""(Romney) is going to let the big banks once again write their own rules, unchain Wall Street,"" Biden said at a campaign event in Danville, Virginia. ""He is going to put y'all back in chains.""Without the 90-plus percent black vote, the Democratic Party, at the national level, is in deep trouble. This explains why they race-bait. Constantly.Take then-senate candidate Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who, after Hurricane Katrina, said, ""(President) George (W.)

14,MO,"Get premium stock lists, pass or fail stock ratings and more. Start HereHillary Clinton, during the 2016 campaign, complained about what she called the ""school-to-prison pipeline.""Clinton said: ""We've seen a significant increase in police involvement in school discipline, especially in schools with majority-black students. We're seeing an overreliance on suspensions and expulsions. I'm sure many of us remember that horrifying video of the girl in South Carolina being thrown out of her desk and dragged across her classroom by a school police officer. A classroom should be a safe place for our children. We shouldn't even have to say that, I don't think. So today I'm announcing my plan to end the school-to-prison pipeline.""So the cops lie in wait to arrest innocent young blacks? Not one word about personal responsibility?Actor Denzel Washington, whose last movie was about a criminal defense lawyer, commented on a criminal justice system that many call institutionally racist, resulting in an unfair mass incarceration of blacks.But Washington wasn't buying it. He said: ""It starts in the home. You know, if the father is not in the home, the boy will find a father in the streets. I saw it in my generation and in every generation before me, and in every one since. ... If the streets raise you, then the judge becomes your mother, and, you know, prison becomes your home.""As a result, Washington said, ""So, you know, I can't blame the system."" In other words, the breakdown or, more precisely, the nonformation of the nuclear black family is a far, far bigger problem than the allegedly racist criminal justice system.But as long as the Democratic Party continues to market itself as the party of social justice in an ever-racist America, the party thinks it can capture the black vote. Who cares whether it's counterproductive for Dems to tell young blacks that hard work doesn't pay off? It's the votes that matter.Former Washington Post investigative journalist Ron Kessler wrote in his book, ""Inside The White House,"" that President Lyndon Johnson, in touting the Civil Rights Act of 1964, said, ""I'll have those (N-words) voting Democratic for the next 200 years.""President Trump, through his secretary of education, urges parental choice in schools. Polls show that inner-city parents want the option to remove their kid from underperforming public schools, where many of those who graduate cannot read or do math at grade level. Many graduate without the skills employers want. Many of those pursuing higher education must take remedial courses to compete at the college level.Yet to Biden and the Democrats, Trump, who wants to do something about the quality of education in inner cities, is ""racist.""And ""racist"" Trump wants to eliminate the competition for jobs held by illegal aliens. Research by Harvard economist George Borjas shows that illegals, especially unskilled illegals, compete for inner-city jobs and place downward pressure on wages. The Americans losing out are the very black and brown workers the Democratic Party claims they care so deeply about.But that doesn't stop the Democrats from employing their tried-and-true technique. The race card. Don't leave home without it.Other columns by Larry Elder

15,MO,"The Black Lives Matter movement has led to a transformation in the way law enforcement documents crime.XThe call for more oversight of officers has been a catalyst to the mass adoption of body cameras. They provide evidence that will help the public in cases of officer misconduct as well as protect lawmen from false accusations.The movement gained traction following the 2014 police shooting of Michael Brown in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Mo. Then-President Barack Obama helped the adoption process along by pushing through a $263 million funding package.The swelling in support for the devices has been a boon for Axon (AAXN), formerly Taser International. It has taken advantage of the business opportunity with its line of body cameras and accompanying evidence storage software. It's now the market leader.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Going back to the Ferguson, Missouri case, under the Obama administration the Department Of Justice provided federal grants to increase body cameras,"" Dougherty & Co. senior analyst Jeremy Hamblin told Investor's Business Daily. ""That proved to be an accelerant on growing this business.""Axon specializes in body-worn cameras and its famed Taser electroshock weapons. The Scottsdale, Ariz.-based company also boasts Evidence.com, a cloud-based digital evidence platform. And it's captured share in the in-car police camera market with its new Axon Fleet product.The company boomed to new highs on the back of strong earnings, as well as a sunny outlook for its law enforcement technology and weapon products.In February, Axon reported earnings per share of 13 cents, defying fourth-quarter views for an 8-cent loss. Revenue climbed 16% to $95 million, also topping views. It sees 2018 revenue climbing 16%-18%.""We don't intend to slow down in 2018. At our investor and analyst day in November 2017, we laid out a financial strategy to shift to recurring cash flows, to invest in products and features that expand our total addressable market and to drive profitability through disciplined execution,"" Steve Tuttle, company spokesman, told IBD.The firm currently concentrates on increasing its body camera and Evidence.com market share. It also seeks to increase average revenue per user.Further, management wants to expand Taser adoption and increase its in-car video market share with Axon Fleet. Plus, it's looking to move into new areas with its police agency records management systems and computer-aided dispatch software.The future for Axon's body camera business looks strong. Baltimore recently extended its existing contract to equip 2,500 officers. The contract, which includes Axon's software and data storage, is now worth $18.5 million and continues until 2023. Plus, the Chicago and Virginia Beach, Va., police departments also signed deals in the last month.In its most recent earnings report, Axon said law enforcement agencies in 69 U.S. major cities had purchased its body cameras or signed up for its Evidence.com platformThe body cameras are a vehicle to push its enterprise software business. Analysts see Evidence.com revenue growing to $100 million in fiscal 2018. And this is where Hamblin believes the true payoff for the stock lies, and presents what he described as a ""huge long-term opportunity.""Hamblin also is impressed the new Axon Fleet in-car camera solution has gained traction faster than expected. It has annualized contract revenue already exceeding $5 million in just two quarters and holds a 1% market share. He believes it could be disruptive to the market, as it offers as much as a 50% discount to industry standard-bearers, WatchGuard, COBAN and Panasonic.""When Evidence.com revenue gets to $100 million — and last year it was about $60 million — there is going to be critical mass where people start to see this no longer as a hardware company that sells Tasers, but it is going to be seen as a software company and it is going to be valued in a different light,"" Hamblin said.The more mature Taser business, however, also is performing well and still provides the bulk of the company's profits. It reported a 10% revenue increase to $64.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $58.3 million for the same quarter the year before. In addition, weapons segment gross margin was up 70.9% in 2017's fourth quarter compared with 69.3% in the year-ago quarter.The stock has put in an impressive performance so far this year. On Feb. 28, the stock skyrocketed 28% after it beat views on earnings, blasting back above a 28.06 cup-with-handle buy point. It continued to rally until March 12, then consolidated tightly. The stock has been sitting between 40 and 45, near a record high.Shares were up more than 1.5% in afternoon trading Thursday, near 43.45.Its relative strength line, which tracks the stock vs. the S&P 500 index, is also near its 13-year high. And while its IBD Composite Rating of 72 is not stellar, it has a strong Relative Strength Rating of 97 and it sits fifth in the Security/Safety Industry Group.The firm only came in below Wall Street earnings estimates in one of the past six quarters, while it has beaten on revenue in five of those.Axon makes the bulk of its revenue in the U.S., but the firm says on its website that more than 17,000 law enforcement agencies in more than 100 countries are now part of its network.And there is good potential for further growth overseas, according to Hamblin. He said there is demand for Taser weapons in foreign markets such as the U.K. and in Europe. They are seen as providing nonfirearm-carrying law enforcement officers with a potentially effective weapon when responding to terror attacks.Other analysts are also backing Axon, with Ladenburg Thalman analyst Glenn Mattson recently upgrading the stock to buy and giving a price target of $35.""International strength has picked up (if mainly from weapons for now). Costs are being rationalized and new product introductions are expanding the addressable market,"" Mattson said in a recent note to clients.Last November, Axon moved to rein in costs, including a hiring freeze and rationalization of nonessential roles.Axon Chief Executive Rick Smith has also been praised by analysts for taking a performance-based payment package. In February, he relinquished his salary, with his new plan tied entirely to achieving market cap and financial performance targets. For the full award to vest, the company's market cap must increase to $13.5 billion — more than 10 times its level when the plan was agreed.""We often said management has focused so much on investment, it had become detrimental to investor returns,"" Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz said in a note to clients. ""CEO Rick Smith's new compensation package changes this. He only gets paid in stock and only when significant financial milestones are met (both revenue and EBITDA). This is investor-friendly and a welcome change.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Worth Surveilling: This Police Bodycam Maker's Stock Is SoaringWhy The High, Tight Flag Is A Rare Chart Pattern And Produces Big GainsStill Bullish On Bitcoin?

16,MO,"As Facebook (FB) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg faced down a Congressional gauntlet during a second day of hearings Wednesday, lawmakers said regulations may be the only way to prevent the data privacy abuses exposed by the company's data scandal involving political consultant Cambridge Analytica.XThe question among lawmakers, though, was whether Congress would do too much or too little.""There are two things Congress is good at,"" said Rep. Billy Long, R-Mo. ""They are doing nothing, and overreacting. We're getting ready to overreact.""Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., in his opening comments at the hearing on Wednesday before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said more regulations are needed.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""My fear is that all we'll do is have hearings then nothing happens, not accomplishing anything,"" said Pallone. ""It's time for legislation to prevent incidents like this from happening.""By mid-afternoon Wednesday, Zuckerberg was on his 10th hour of testimony, which started with a joint Senate committee hearing on Tuesday. Wall Street appeared to applaud Zuckerberg's  performance, with Facebook shares rising 4.5% Tuesday and another 1.5% Wednesday.Facebook has rebounded over the past five days from the 19% plunge in its stock, starting on March 16. That followed revelations that political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica had wrongfully accessed personal data from 87 million Facebook users — data that was used in the 2016 presidential election.Zuckerberg was grilled on the data privacy issues in addition to how his network can prevent hate speech, propaganda and other forms of undesired content. He also faced questions on who makes those decisions.But the hearings are raising the likelihood that Facebook — along with Alphabet (GOOGL), Twitter (TWTR), Amazon (AMZN) and a number of other social media and e-commerce sites — will face regulations that could hinder ad revenue and disrupt business models.On Wednesday, Zuckerberg again apologized to lawmakers for failing to protect user privacy that led to the Cambridge Analytica debacle. But he didn't waver in offering a defense of the company's broader business model. He consistently defended its platform, strategy and monetization plans.""We believe Zuckerberg exceeded investor expectations,"" Wells Fargo analyst Ken Sena wrote in a note to clients about the Tuesday testimony before a joint Senate committee hearing. ""He appeared focused, conciliatory, and genuinely engaged in a productive discussion with legislators on how best to rectify the company's loss in public trust and its road map to safeguard against future abuses.""Sena said the testimony seems to make clear that some regulatory oversight may be inevitable. But he expressed confidence that Facebook, with artificial intelligence software tools, will be more effective in detecting and eliminating abuses on its platform.Sena maintained an outperform rating on Facebook and price target of 230.GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives in a research note also retained a positive view of Zuckerberg's performance. He maintained a rating of highly attractive, with a price target of 225.Ives said the hearings are more than about Zuckerberg and his company. They have ramifications for Alphabet and Twitter along with online advertisers worried about a new regulatory landscape on the horizon.""In our opinion, this is the most pivotal 48 hours of Zuckerberg's career and so far he is performing well above expectations, passing with flying colors on Day 1 of the hearings and the Street is showing a sigh of relief accordingly,"" Ives wrote. ""Zuckerberg looks confident and is a stark contrast to the fears this was going to be another 'Rocky' movie with a Congressional beating and Facebook/Zuckerberg waving the white towel.""As to the impact the data scandal will have on Facebook usage, a survey over the past few weeks by GBH suggests there will be some deceleration in activity.""We found that roughly 15% of Facebook users polled will decrease in some capacity their use of the platform in light of the Cambridge issue and we estimate a negligible number of users have deleted their Facebook accounts despite the backlash,"" Ives wrote.He estimated that in a worst-case scenario, between $1 billion to $2 billion of annual advertising — about 3% of total revenue — is at risk in 2018. That's based on slower user growth, reduced engagement, and softer advertising revenue with regulation the major variable.In one portion of Tuesday's testimony, Zuckerberg was asked by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who he thought was the main competitor to Facebook.

He added: ""Is there an alternative in the private sector?""Zuckerberg replied there are a number of rivals who offer some of the same services as Facebook such as Twitter and Alphabet.One recently formed company wanting to take on Facebook is Vero.co, a subscription-based, ad free social network.In its promotional material, Vero says it's an alternative to Facebook and its Instagram platform, with more than 3 million members.

17,MO,"Philip Morris International (PM) shares fell on a series of FDA advisory committee votes on its smoke-free device.X The Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee ruled the company's smoke-free tobacco delivery device IQOS should not be marketed as being less harmful than continuing to smoke cigarettes. A positive recommendation would have been a key step toward its IQOS system winning FDA approval for general sale in the U.S.  The IQOS is a cigar-shaped product that creates an aerosol supposedly less toxic than cigarette smoke.The FDA's Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee voted 8-0 with one abstention against Philip Morris' claim IQOS cuts the risk of tobacco-related diseases, and in a 5-4 vote rejected its claim that it is less risky than continuing to smoke cigarettes.The panel did vote 8-1 in favor of the Philip Morris' claim that the product reduces the body's exposure to harmful or potentially harmful chemicals, but then ruled 5-2 against the claim that these reductions are reasonably likely to translate to a measurable and substantial reduction in morbidity and or mortality.""Early votes were largely in line with our expectations, as we'd asserted the group would generally argue that more research would be required,"" Cowen tobacco analyst Vivien Azer said. ""The initial stock reactions seemed excessive, as the voting outcome has no impact on PM or MO's commercialization plans.""Other rulings included there being a low to medium likelihood U.S. smokers who used IQOS would switch to exclusive use, however the votes were split three high, five medium and one low on the likelihood they would become duel users of IQOS and cigarettes. There was a mixed response to the question of how likely it is Americans who never smoke, particularly young people, will become established users of the product, with four voting low, two high, on medium and two abstaining.Philip Morris, up slightly before the late morning announcement, tumbled as low as 103.02 on the news before closing down 2.8% at 107.49 on the stock market today. U.S. partner Altria (MO) was down 2.3% to 69.91. Philip Morris International was split off from Altria nearly 10 years ago.British American Tobacco (BTI) lost 3.4% and Vector Group (VGR) fell 1.5%.The FDA usually follows its advisory panels' recommendations, but not always. The agency is expected to decide in the next few months whether Philip Morris can sell IQOS, but will decide separately whether to authorize the modified-risk claims ruled on by the committee Thursday.""We don't view today's events as a total disaster given... much of the panel's concerns were around how PM worded its proposed reduced risk claims and how PM 'messages' those claims to the consumer."" Wells Fargo Senior Analyst Bonnie Herzog said in a research note. ""She was also sunny  on the prospects of the product coming to market, adding, ""We expect premarket approval of IQOS and continue to believe this could be in the next few months.""The IQOS devices works by heating up a stick of tobacco, but not to the point that it burns and generates smoke. The company has produced three products, each with Marlboro branding, with two having menthol flavoring.Philip Morris released the following statement following the FDA advisory panel's meeting:""Philip Morris International appreciates the open, positive dialogue and the serious consideration the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee (TPSAC) has shown during the last two days in discussing the complex science presented in our Modified-Risk Tobacco Product (MRTP) application. We are encouraged by the recognition of the risk reduction potential of IQOS that clearly emerged from the statements of the Committee members.""Philip Morris is aiming to bring the product to market this year, and has said it hopes to convert every adult smoker into an IQOS user.The system is already used by nearly 4 million people in 30 markets outside the U.S.In its application the company argued the product will ""significantly reduce harm and the risk of tobacco-related disease,"" however it does not say that the product is risk-free.IQOS is said to come somewhere between trendy vaping products and traditional cigarettes on the scale of harm.Last November the FDA said it was considering measures to speed development of products that help people quit smoking.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:How To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple RoutineThese Are The Top 20 Stocks Millennial Investors Are Holding, Says Robinhood

18,MO,"An unlikely superstar is emerging in the battle for ETF supremacy: the professor.Over the last six months, the $3.6 trillion U.S. exchange-traded fund industry has plucked several prominent academics out of the classroom and put them on the corporate payroll. OppenheimerFunds has appointed a brain trust to help generate and validate ideas for new products. Research Affiliates, a strategy and index creator, hired a Duke University scholar as a partner and senior advisor. And one college professor on the outskirts of Boston even started his own fund.It's easy to see why. With the three largest ETF issuers controlling 83% of the assets, others must go above and beyond to stand out. That means pioneering higher IQ products, like smart-beta, which shun traditional indexes in favor of weighting by other factors. It also means innovating wherever possible, setting an attractive price, coming up with a memorable ticker — and now, getting backing from an array of big thinkers.""Academics always bring credibility to the table,"" said Rusty Vanneman, chief investment officer at CLS Investments, which manages $9 billion from Omaha, Neb. ""They have always been important but probably even more so in recent years.""Factors — as the finance industry calls the dizzying array of theories about why the price of stocks or bonds moves — are used to direct more than $700 billion, or 20%, of the U.S. ETF market, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Encompassing themes like value, growth, momentum and quality, many of these strategies were hothoused within universities, yielding research and publicity.That academic rigor has proved popular with investors and issuers alike. While investors have been won over by the promise of better returns than plain-vanilla ETFs that are linked to a simple index, issuers can justify charging more for these products due to their additional complexity. The average management fee is 0.4%, vs. as little as 0.03% for funds weighted by market capitalization.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut with so many funds to choose from, the divergent methodologies supporting them have come into question. One value fund may look at a stock's price-to-earnings ratio, for example, but those earnings could be calculated on a forward, trailing or operating basis. Or, a fund could ignore earnings entirely and look at the ratio of price-to-sales, dividends or book value, says CLS's Vanneman.It's not that one method is better or worse. But based on the precise formulas, the outcomes should differ.""You have to decide that you know an aspect of financial markets in order to be able to pick between the various solutions because they are so nuanced,"" said Sam Fraundorf, the Atlanta-based chief investment officer at Diversified Trust, which oversees $6.5 billion. ""I'm not sure that all this proliferation is in any way, shape or form designed to enhance a true investment experience.""Enter the experts. Combining academic research with the front-line experience of issuers can help produce better ETFs, according to Mo Haghbin, head of product at OppenheimerFunds's beta solutions business.That's why it's recruited two academics from Harvard Business School and one from the London School of Economics to a new advisory board. The trio also weighs in during weekly strategy calls on topics such as how to construct multi-factor funds that focus on emerging markets, or the investment rationale behind thematic products, like artificial intelligence, Haghbin said.Similarly, Campbell Harvey, who teaches at Duke, joined Research Affiliates in October as a partner and senior advisor. Going one further, Joel Shulman, who teaches entrepreneurship at Babson College outside Boston, has started his own ETF under the EntrepreneurShares brand.""With what's happening in smart beta and all of these different strategies coming to market that may or may not have merit, it's really important that sponsors take the time to do this research,"" Oppenheimer's Haghbin said. ""The next big innovation in smart beta could be something that was researched 10 to 20 years ago that hasn't made it into the mainstream yet, so we want to continually have this dialogue and feedback loop.""Of course, academia has long informed asset management, and vice versa. Nobel laureate and Yale professor Robert Shiller teamed up with Barclays to start an exchange-traded note back in 2012; Wharton's Jeremy Siegel was instrumental in getting WisdomTree Investments off the ground a decade ago; while Burton Malkiel — who wrote ''A Random Walk Down Wall Street"" — is on several fund indexing committees and serves as chief investment officer for Wealthfront, an ETF-focused online financial advisor.Some of the largest players also employ their own academics to gain an edge. BlackRock, the world's largest ETF issuer, hired Andrew Ang from Columbia Business School back in 2015 to lead its factor-based strategies team, and partnered with MSCI to re-imagine how advisors think about factors. MSCI, meanwhile, relies on its own Ph.D.s to develop the measures that will work for both ETF issuers and investors.All that big-name firepower matters. Having Ang on board has helped BlackRock ""enormously,"" said Rob Nestor, head of iShares smart beta, noting that Ang's relationship with some of the world's largest pension funds has encouraged greater collaboration with them. For MSCI, research is also a core selling point that differentiates the firm from its rivals, according to Raman Aylur Subramanian, who heads equity applied research for the Americas at the indexer.But all that knowledge and expertise has to amount to more than window-dressing, cautions Duke's Cam Harvey. He's found more than 200 phony factors documented in academic literature.""Just because you have an academic affiliated with you, that's just not enough,"" he said. ""You want the academic to be doing something that will ultimately benefit the investor and the firm. If you add value for the investor, you will benefit the firm.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:AI, Robotics, Blockchain Among Hot New ETF Industry TrendsCapture More Upside And Less Downside With Low Volatility ETFsBlockchain Expands Beyond Bitcoin To Amazon, Nvidia, Alibaba

21,MO,"General Electric (GE) may be removed from the Dow Jones industrial average, to which it has belonged for more than 110 years, according to a Wall Street analyst.X GE is one of the original members of the Dow, a price-weighted measure of 30 U.S. blue-chip companies invented by Charles Dow in 1896. The index covers all industries except transportation and utilities.""We believe the chances that GE could be removed from the Dow are increasing as GE continues to face substantial challenges including earnings and cash pressure, tough global power generation markets, aggressive downsizing, shrinking its portfolio, management shake-up and SEC investigations,"" Deutsche Bank analyst John Inch wrote Wednesday.GE's falling share price makes it an ""outlier"" and ""likely candidate for removal"" from an index that aims to reflect the ""best"" large U.S. companies, Inch said.He sees headline risk if GE were to be dropped from the Dow, noting that roughly 40% of GE's common stock is held by retail investors.Shares of GE closed up 1.4% at 16.17 on the stock market today, after ending the previous session below 16 for the first time since Dec. 1, 2011.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.GE doesn't have to be replaced by another industrial giant, and recent changes show new components don't always come from the same sectors of dropped components.In the latest tweak, DowDuPont (DWDP) replaced DuPont in Sept. 1, 2017, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, after it merged with Dow Chemical.Before that, Apple (AAPL) replaced AT&T (T) on March 19, 2015. And on Sept. 23, 2013, Goldman Sachs (GS) replaced Bank of America (BAC), Visa (V) replaced Hewlett-Packard, which split up, and Nike (NKE) replaced Alcoa, which also split up.A committee made up of three representatives from S&P Dow Jones Indices and two from the Wall Street Journal meets twice a year to consider if any changes are needed to the Dow index.Committee members prefer the ratio between the highest share price and lowest share price among components to be no more than 10:1. But the current ratio between Boeing (BA) (the highest) and GE (the lowest) exceeds 20:1, Deutsche Bank said.A spokeswoman for S&P Dow Jones Indices declined to comment. ""As a matter of firm policy, we do not provide comment on additions or drops to our indices as we consider this information to be market moving and material,"" she said.One way for GE to stay in the Dow could be a reverse stock split.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:How To Choose The Best Online Stock Brokers: Start HereBest Stocks To Buy And WatchHow To Invest In The Stock Market Using A Simple Routine

22,MO,"Neuropsychologist Richard Chaifetz was thinking big when he graduated with his doctorate in 1981.He saw an opportunity to provide broad-based mental health services to the general public and opened a dozen psychological treatment centers in the Midwest, with the goal of a national franchise system. To fund this, he committed to advertising in the Yellow Pages for $10,000 a month charged to a credit card, since he only had a few thousand dollars to his name.""If I hadn't succeeded, I'd have gone bankrupt,"" Chaifetz, the CEO and chairman of ComPsych Corp., told IBD from his Chicago office. ""I knew professionals in the mental health field often didn't have good business acumen, and I saw an attractive opportunity for them if I could provide infrastructure, marketing and oversight. But then the insurance model began to change from direct reimbursement for patients to coverage by HMOs. I expanded services in 1984, pioneering employee assistance programs or EAPs and eventually selling off the mental health centers.""He succeeded, in spades. Today, ComPsych is the world's largest provider of customized programs for improving the lives of workers, ranging from overall wellness and work-life balance to meeting their needs for expert legal and financial help. It serves 100 million people in 160 countries, helping its 45,000 clients, including Comcast (CMCSA) and Hilton Hotels (HLT), to retain their best employees and increase productivity.Crain's Chicago Business last April estimated annual revenues for the privately held company at $475 million for 2016. According to Chaifetz, ""We've always had double-digit growth, so I expect them to estimate an increase of more than 10% for last year.""Chaifetz, 64, was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., and attended Eastern Military Academy in Huntington on Long Island, after his parents divorced. Upon graduation, he was one of only two cadets to receive appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, but turned it down because the Army wasn't where he wanted to spend his life. At the advice of Eastern's headmaster, he instead attended Saint Louis University in St. Louis, Mo.But in the second semester of his freshman year working towards a degree in psychology, his father, with whom he had little contact after his parents' divorce, stopped paying his tuition and his mother couldn't provide enough on her teacher's salary for him to continue. Chaifetz refused to give up and pleaded with the university president to let him stay, committing not only to pay off his student debt, but to do something big for the university once he became successful.Permission granted, he worked at all kinds of jobs part-time during the school year and full-time in summer, including at mental health facilities, graduating magna cum laude in 1975. He went on to earn his Psy.D at Illinois School of Professional Psychology.""Psychology can be fluffy and I was attracted to the fact that neuropsychology, which is the study of the relationship between brain function and behavior, emotion and cognition, was more scientific and exact in coming to a diagnosis,"" Chaifetz said.He never forgot his promise to Saint Louis University, and in 2007, Chaifetz and his wife Jill donated $12 million as the lead gift to build Chaifetz Arena, an $80 million, 10,600-seat sports facility. They also funded the Chaifetz Trading Center at her alma mater, the Farmer School of Business at Miami University-Oxford in Oxford, Ohio, with $3 million.""We pioneered fully integrated EAPs to cover everything from crisis intervention to disability management, under our GuidanceResources brand, for organizations from small, private concerns to the Fortune 100,"" Chaifetz said. ""To be able to grow globally and serve so many industries, we empower our own employees to solve problems with a custom-fit for client needs. We encourage them not only to innovate, we expect them to challenge the status quo, helping us to avoid falling into the standardization trap that big companies often do.""ComPsych recruits for high-energy, intellectually curious, creative individuals who are willing to test the limits within the boundaries of good business sense. The selection process not only uses extensive interviewing and background checks, but also tests and uses role-playing to make sure candidates fit the culture. The new hires are tasked to create superstars in other organizations and are incentivized by rewards for performance. As boomers retire and more millennials are hired, Chaifetz is confident about the company's future.""Studies have shown that younger people want meaningful work, and we believe our entrepreneurial culture is an excellent fit,"" Chaifetz said.ComPsych has gradually expanded its offerings. One of the most critical is absence management, which helps companies meet the requirements of the two-decade-old U.S. Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) at a lower cost with less liability exposure. Health care organizations have the largest percentage of employees on leave in a given year at 39%, while hotel and hospitality employees have the lengthiest absences overall, averaging more than 30 days. ComPsych's integrated EAPs have helped health care worker absenteeism drop by 43%, while their life satisfaction has risen 59%.Another area where the company excels is in managing the opioid abuse crisis, which cost $20 billion in lost productivity in 2016, yet three-quarters of employers have not offered training on how to detect misuse. The fatality rate is six times higher than the world average, according to the United Nations. ComPsych's multi-pronged approach can include cognitive behavioral therapy, managing inpatient and outpatient treatment by leading providers, coordinating with pharmacies, family support and 24/7 access to online workshops with master-level clinicians.ComPsych's growth has been entirely organic and it counsels clients to be careful about how they go about mergers and acquisitions, since studies show 70% to 90% fail to pay for themselves. Clients are advised to have clearly defined core competencies they can leverage to expand and to avoid trying to merge cultures that are not compatible.""Most M&A problems are not due to miscalculating the financials, but because of the intangible aspects,"" Chaifetz said. ""You're buying the services of people and if their aspirations are not a good fit with the new company culture, financial goals are unlikely to come to fruition. That's where we can play an important role in helping clients make sure that they understand the needs and expectations of new employees.""Enlightened corporate leaders have come to see the cost-effectiveness of employee wellness services, but ComPsych is especially appreciated during crises. During Hurricane Harvey last summer, the company conducted more than 450 critical incident stress management sessions.In 2017, Chaifetz was given the Humanitarian Award by the Illinois Holocaust Museum. ""He always wanted to help people as a psychologist,"" Jill told the audience. ""He's been called the Michael Jordan of his industry, and he's pretty much a savant.""Dale Grenolds, executive vice president at ComPsych, says Chaifetz is the type of leader that lets you take risks and be autonomous.""At the same time, he's very direct in his feedback and clear about his expectations,"" Grenolds said. ""His drive and level of confidence push his people to achieve more and operate from a place of strength. And at times of crisis, he has a unique ability to create clarity and find solutions.""CEO of ComPsych Corp., world's leading provider of employee well-being programs.Overcame: The need for a completely new business model in the early years.Lesson: Attract clients by offering easy solutions for the areas where they have the biggest challenges.""Over-reliance on market research can stifle creativity and create a 'me too' organization which can marginalize opportunities.""
"
23,MO,"What do you get when you bring together two professional poker players, a CNBC pundit and an ex-boxer who tried to turn a social gaming company into a cybersecurity company? The answer is Riot Blockchain (RIOT), which was one of the hottest stocks for a few months late last year.X While it isn't the only company to abruptly declare a crypto-strategy — Long Blockchain (LBCC) and Eastman Kodak (KODK) have made similar moves — Riot Blockchain stands out.Since its sudden pivot last October from biotech, it has become a poster child of investors' blind rush into blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, as well as the subsequent hangover when cold, hard daylight reveals what is actually going on — or not going on.For example, Riot Blockchain has scooped up some companies with little to no track record of actually doing anything. (One of those acquisitions is a company owned by a frequent guest on CNBC, which aired an investigation into Riot last week.) Riot also has lost two auditing firms in just one year, has failed to muster enough voting shareholders for an annual meeting, and is crisscrossed with investors, including relatives, who have worked on similar deals together in the past, raising questions about its governance.This pattern of behavior should give investors pause, said Marquette University accounting assistant professor Joseph Wall, who consults in areas including blockchain technologies and financial forensic investigation.""I'm not going to say this company in particular is doing anything illegal,"" he said. ""I just know that companies that have those patterns of behavior, each one of those patterns is not advantageous to small individual investors.""However, Riot Blockchain CEO John O'Rourke says the skeptics who are unconvinced about his firm's approach will lose out in the end.Speaking before publication of the CNBC report, which sank Riot's stock by 33% Friday, he added that ""our legacy shareholders"" are happy that the stock was trading at a multiple of what it was prior to the blockchain pivot.""Ultimately with what we have in place now we're well capitalized: we have over $40 million cash in the bank; our stake in Coinsquare is worth over $50 million,"" he told IBD. ""Those two things alone are tangible assets you can't question.""IBD'S TAKE: Bitcoin's meteoric rise has done more than make some daredevil investors rich overnight. It's also put blockchain — the software technology enabling Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies — on a trajectory of its own.But investors who pay attention to fundamentals and stock charts would recognize multiple red flags instantly about Riot Blockchain, even without knowing anything about the company's operations and leadership.The stock surged in October after the company changed its name from Bioptix and announced a new crypto focus, just as Bitcoin mania was beginning to spread far and wide. After a one-month pause, Riot embarked on a climax run, along with the rest of the Bitcoin investing world. That's when a stock suddenly skyrockets over several weeks in a frantic run-up after a strong prior gain — followed by a massive reversal.After a climax run, stocks, commodities and currencies usually lose well more than half their value quickly and make take months or years to recover, if ever.Here's how Riot's climax looked. It nearly tripled over the five sessions to Nov. 24 in huge volume. The stock paused for a couple of weeks, and then nearly doubled again. It had its largest point gain on Dec. 18, a day before its final intraday peak. From its Dec. 19 peak of 46.20 — when Riot Blockchain announced a $37 million private placement — the stock crashed 77.5%. Riot rallied back somewhat with Bitcoin over the next several sessions but crashed last Friday. Riot has continued to sell off this week, tumbling 13% to a three-month low.Loup Ventures managing partner Douglas Clinton, a former analyst for Piper Jaffray, has questioned whether Riot Blockchain has the necessary knowledge base in blockchain.""The CEO, from as far as I can tell, doesn't necessarily have a background in technology,"" he said. ""So obviously they see an opportunity, and we agree that blockchain is an opportunity, but we had a hard time understanding what their unique insight is and what they want to accomplish by investing in blockchain.""O'Rourke says he has been ""engrossed"" by blockchain technology since 2012. In 2013, he invested in three blockchain companies and has personally accumulated Bitcoin. Since then, he says he's done ""a tremendous amount of research,"" while speaking with thought leaders and attending conferences. He also pointed out that two ""key opinion leaders"" are on Riot's advisory board.He was referring to a pair of professional poker players: Jason Les, a cryptocurrency miner who describes himself as a ""student of Bitcoin,"" and Jason Mo, who is described by Riot as one of the most respected independent investors in the cryptocurrency space.Other notable pieces in Riot's team are ones that are no longer there. Riot Blockchain dismissed EisnerAmper as its certifying accountant last month, a year after the firm's previous auditor, GHP Horwath, resigned. MNP is the new auditor.""Having several auditors suggests you either have very bad abilities to pick an auditor (incompetence or unlucky), or are unable to find an auditor to fudge your numbers the way you want them fudged (unethical),"" said Pai-Ling Yin, a USC business professor and director of the school's Technology Commercialization Initiative.O'Rourke declined to comment.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersThen there's Barry Honig, a boxer turned activist investor who forced out the old management at Riot, paving the way for the pivot to blockchain. In his days as a stock broker, he was fined $25,000 and suspended for 10 days in 2000 by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for alleged stock manipulation. Honig has denied he is a stock manipulator.Prior to Riot, he and O'Rourke were investors in MGT Capital Investments, which they tried to turn into a cybersecurity company from a social gaming one. But Intel (INTC), which bought the McAfee cybersecurity company in 2010, blocked MGT from changing its name to John McAfee Global Technologies.Meanwhile, Honig successfully flipped mobile gaming firm Majesco to what is now PolarityTE (COOL), a biotech currently cited by Nasdaq for non-compliance on audit committee composition and board independence rules. And he has been accused of trying to illegally strip the pharmaceutical company BioZone away from its founder. That case was settled in 2016.Many of the people involved in those endeavors are also Riot Blockchain investors. For example, directors and investors in PolarityTE and MGT were early investors in Riot, while another is a fund controlled by Honig's brother. Other big early investors have ties to O'Rourke due to his role as a board member of MUNDOmedia, whose chief legal and corporate development officer is a Riot director.In fact, a review of SEC filings reveals that investors with connections to Honig and O'Rourke controlled a majority of Riot's 5.4 million outstanding shares before its blockchain pivot.Despite their past dealings, Honig insists he is a passive Riot investor and is letting O'Rourke call the shots. ""John happens to be a terrific, smart young man,"" he said. ""He's got a tremendous amount of integrity.""Marquette University's Wall, who runs his own securities investment firm, said the relationships among the people involved in Riot should be another red flag to investors, as the insiders could potentially have access to information on the company that a normal investor does not.One trade that has drawn particular attention is O'Rourke's sale of most of the Riot shares he held at the time on Dec. 29, just days before the company announced its third accountant in a year. He said it was for tax reasons.""In general when you combine a changing of auditors, insider selling, a lack of disclosure, postponing shareholder meetings, then you bring in a close network of people where you don't have arms-length transactions, that usually doesn't result in good things for a small investor in the long run,"" Wall said.Another Honig connection also pops up in Riot's most recent acquisition. On Feb. 7, Riot announced the buyout of Logical Brokerage, with a view to establishing a U.S. digital currency exchange.Logical President Mark Fisher and Honig serve on the board of the Florida Vipers basketball team, which is also an educational non-profit meant to help inner city youth. Honig told IBD that while he is an acquaintance with CNBC pundit Fisher, the two have ""never really spoken to each other"" about Riot.Logical's website states it is a ""futures introducing broker."" But its National Futures Association listing says it has no on-exchange futures or options customer accounts, is not soliciting customers, is not managing futures or options customer accounts, operates no commodity pools and is not engaged in retail off-exchange foreign currency futures or options.O'Rourke said he liked that Logical is a CFTC-licensed registrant and has the ""framework"" for dealing with regulators. But neither the CFTC nor the NFA regulate spot-market digital currency exchanges or activity.In November, Riot agreed to buy Nevada cryptocurrency mining company Kairos Global Technology, which at the time had been incorporated for just over two weeks.Riot in October acquired a majority stake in TessPay, which is developing a blockchain payments ecosystem for the telecom sector with hopes to launch in September or October. TessPay also plans to go public via a reverse-takeover agreement that will give it a majority of a subsidiary, created by Cresval Capital, to be called ""TessPay Inc."" Cresval is a company focused on mineral exploration.Riot Blockchain, in regulatory filings, said TessPay had net tangible assets of roughly $10,000 as of October. The company, which was founded in July and has around 15 employees, would not comment on whether that figure had changed or what those assets were.When asked how far the companies are from bringing products to market, O'Rourke said, ""They are actively in development. No timeline is in place publicly quite yet.""However, Riot Blockchain does have a crown jewel; its holding in Canadian cryptocurrency exchange Coinsquare. Riot invested $3 million into its parent GoNumerical last September, and claims the stake is now worth 15 times its original value. Riot recently announced it had invested another $2.5 million while exercising previously acquired warrants.This has been their most prudent move so far, according to USC's Yin.""In light of what I've said about Riot acquiring anything related to crypto, Coinsquare appears to raise the least red flags,"" she said. ""This is still a new frontier, a lot of exchanges will enter, but not all will survive, and it is hard to predict who will be left.""Bill Peters contributed to this article.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Before You Buy Bitcoin, Read ThisSEC Halts Trading In 3 Companies Over Crypto, Blockchain Claims The Coming Cryptocurrency Lobbying WarBitcoin And Cryptocurrency News And Trends

24,MO,"When Harry Truman had the American presidency thrust on him on April 12, 1945, he called it the day ""the whole weight of the moon and the stars fell on me.""President Franklin D. Roosevelt had died 82 days into his unprecedented fourth term. Truman had been made vice president because he was the least offensive option among the Democratic Party factions. He had no executive experience, and his career didn't inspire confidence:""The first four months of his administration were the most challenging four-month period of any president,"" A.J. Baime, author of ""The Accidental President,"" told IBD. ""He oversaw the collapse of Nazi Germany, the victory at Okinawa, the dropping of the atomic bombs, the founding of the United Nations, the Potsdam Conference where he negotiated the new map of the world with (British Prime Minister Winston) Churchill and (Soviet Communist Party General Secretary Joseph) Stalin, and the dawn of the Cold War. At the end of all this, Americans had achieved a sense of unity that is unimaginable today.""Truman (1884-1972) was born in Lamar, Mo., to a farming family. They moved to Independence, 10 miles from Kansas City, when he was 6. Sick with diphtheria that virtually paralyzed him for a year, he became a voracious reader of biographies about heroes, including Hannibal, the Duke of Wellington, and Ulysses Grant. ""I found that the first victory they won was over themselves … self-discipline with all of them,"" he recalled.His father went bankrupt in 1906, and the family moved to the 600-acre farm in Grandview where his mother had grown up. In 1917, he was made a first lieutenant in the Army to command an artillery battery. While training at Fort Sill, Okla., he befriended the nephew of Tom Pendergast, head of the Kansas City Democratic Party machine. Promoted to captain, he and his unit arrived in July 1918 on the front line in France, where Truman showed his courage and leadership skills.Returning in 1919, he married Bess Wallace and opened a haberdashery (a store that sells sewing supplies) in Kansas City, which went out of business during the recession of 1921. The next year, Pendergast helped him get elected as a judge, then in 1934, backed him for the U.S. Senate. Although Truman accomplished little before his reelection in 1940, he began making headlines as chairman of the committee on military affairs, which found $15 billion in waste. When Roosevelt decided his vice president, Henry Wallace, was too far to the left for his fourth campaign, Truman was offered the position at the nominating convention in Chicago in July 1944.""Truman didn't want the job and was terrified because the rumors about FDR's health were rampant, and he realized he might become president,"" Baime said. ""But he believed he had to take orders from the commander in chief, so he accepted.""Truman had only been in two one-on-one meetings with Roosevelt before his death. After taking the oath as president, Truman was told for the first time that there was a secret weapon that was being developed as the Manhattan Project. Two weeks later, he was given the details on the atomic bomb, but there were rumors that the Germans might make a workable one first.The same day, the conference to found the United Nations began in San Francisco, and American and Soviet forces met at the Elbe River in Germany, joining the western and eastern fronts. The German military surrendered on May 8, Truman's 61st birthday.U.S. military leaders thought it could take another 18 months to bring the war against Imperial Japan to an end with an invasion of the home islands. The Battle of Okinawa, the bloodiest of the Pacific campaign, had started April 1 and would end on June 22, with 14,572 American and Allied soldiers dead, as well as 77,166 Japanese military and 149,193 Okinawan civilians.By August, even the fire bombing of much of Tokyo had not forced an unconditional surrender. Japanese military leaders insisted that any peace agreement would have to allow Emperor Hirohito to stay on the throne, and they believed they could inflict enough casualties on an invasion force to bring the Allies to the negotiating table, perhaps resulting in retaining some of their wartime gains. They had not only 2 million soldiers on the home islands, but had also trained women and children in a wide variety of suicide attacks. A conservative estimate of casualties by American planners was 800,000, according to Stephen Ambrose in ""To America: Personal Reflections of an Historian.""Hiroshima, a major military manufacturer, was the target for the first atomic bomb on August 6 local time. When no surrender was forthcoming, three days later Nagasaki was hit, ending the war. The atomic bombings resulted in immediate deaths, plus long-term consequences of radiation, of as many as a quarter million people. According to The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia, Japan's war had resulted in the deaths of 1.7 million of its military and 393,000 civilians, while 111,606 American military died, as well as 4 million Chinese soldiers and a staggering 18 million civilians.The transition to a peacetime economy was rocky, with the rapid decrease of government spending on military needs and demobilization resulting in high unemployment, labor strikes, and a shortage of housing and consumer goods leading to inflation. In foreign affairs, Truman was more successful, directing the airlift to deliver supplies to West Berlin (which had been isolated by the blockade imposed by the Soviet Union and its allies), implementing the Marshall Plan to rebuild Western Europe, and recognizing the new state of Israel.Truman was far ahead of the public when it came to civil rights for African Americans. In 1947, he proposed anti-lynching legislation, the abolition of poll taxes that discouraged minority voting and an end to job discrimination. He would later push to desegregate interstate transportation and the armed forces. This contributed to his approval rating sinking to 32% by the time he ran for reelection in 1948, with Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina and former Vice President Wallace leading third parties from the right and left. Against all odds, Truman won with 49.5% of the popular vote over the Republican candidate Thomas Dewey's 45.2%.But the second term was even more challenging than the first, with the escalation of the Cold War, including the loss of China to Communists in 1949. That same year, the Soviets detonated their first atomic bomb. Then there was the hot war, the invasion by North Korea of South Korea in 1950.""Truman, although the least formally educated of modern presidents, was perhaps the most historically minded and the most devoted to the Constitution,"" said H.W. Brands, author of ""The General vs. the President."" ""In 1951, at the height of the Korean War, he relieved commanding general Douglas MacArthur, who publicly disputed Truman's policies in the war. He knew he was signing his political death warrant by firing the popular MacArthur, but he judged the constitutional principle of civilian control of the military more important than his career.""Truman's popularity sunk to 22%, so he decided not to run for another full term in 1952. He died at age 88, and he and Bess are buried at his presidential library in Independence, Mo.Conservative scholar Alvin Felzenberg, in ""The Leaders We Deserved,"" ranks Truman at No. 7 among the best presidents, especially strong on character, national security, vision, competence and extension of personal liberty.The 33rd U.S. president led the Allies to victory in the final months of World War II.Overcame: Objections to dropping the atomic bombs on Japan.Lesson: The top leader has to take responsibility for what the entire organization does.""America was built on courage, on imagination and an unbeatable determination to do the job at hand.""

25,MO,"Stock indexes surged Tuesday, providing a solid boost just when the market seemed ready to pause. The Nasdaq composite led with a gain of 2.9%, its largest single-day advance of this year and the biggest since Aug. 26. The S&P 500 roared 2.4% higher.

26,MO,"Stocks quickly turned slender gains to losses Thursday, navigating mixed influences from overseas markets, early economic data and a raft of quarterly results.The Nasdaq slipped 0.3%. The S&P 500 and the Dow struggled with fractional losses. Volume was unusually soft on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE, suggesting large-scale investors were standing back from early trade.Today's stock market set out with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 recovering to narrow gains so far this week. The market's young uptrend is seeing some affirmative data points and has thus far managed to avoid distribution days -- days in which selling by institutional investors sends the market lower in rising volume. But a positive finish to the week would help bolster investor confidence.Europe's markets hung on to their early advances in afternoon trade, with the CAC-40 in Paris and London's FTSE 100 up more than 2% apiece.But a European rally and a positive surprise in January durable goods orders weren't enough to buck up investor confidence, as weekly jobless claims rose slightly more than expected, and the bulk of early earnings reports offered at least some disappointing news.The December Housing Price Index from the Federal Housing Finance Agency fit that same pattern, rising 0.4% -- good but below November's 0.5% increase and just missing consensus views for another 0.5% gain.Still, the Dow opened with two-thirds of its stocks positive. Nike (NKE) rose 1.5% to lead the index. Chevron (CVX) posted the widest loss, down 1.5%.Salesforce.com (CRM) topped the S&P 500 with a 10% advance. The cloud-based software leader posted Q4 results late Wednesday, with strong guidance drawing similarly strong support from investors. The advance stopped at the stock's 50-day moving average, which could present some resistance as shares attempt to climb the right side of a 37%-deep consolidation.Quanta Services (PWR) muscled 6% higher on above-forecast fourth-quarter results. HP Inc. (HPQ) dropped 7% following disappointing Q4 results.Among IBD 50 stocks, theater real estate investment trust EPR Properties (EPR) pared gains and was up more than 2% after an initial 5% surge. After Wednesday's close, the Kansas City, Mo.-based firm reported better-than-expected funds from operations, but a 7% revenue gain was just shy of estimates, and management lowered its guidance on full-year funds from operations. The move left shares in frustrated stasis, just below a 62.66 buy point.

27,MO,"In what appeared to be another of his jaw-droppers, Donald Trump, who has vowed to kill ObamaCare and replace it with ""something terrific,"" seemingly embraced the law's most-detested part: the individual mandate to get coverage or pay a fine.""Well I like the mandate. OK. So here's where I'm a little bit different: I don't want people dying on the streets,"" he told a CNN town hall on Feb. 18.As outraged conservative editorials flooded the Internet the following day, Trump clarified in a tweet that he was referring to the law's requirement that insurers offer people with pre-existing conditions coverage on the same terms offered to people in robust health.Yet, even though his clarification was logical enough based on the wording of the question he was asked, it's safe to say that most of the Republican Party's influential policymakers were hardly assuaged. In their view -- much like the view of the Obama administration -- the individual mandate and coverage guarantee are a package deal: You can't have the latter without the former, or else people will wait until they are sick to get covered. That would leave the insurance market prone to adverse selection, yielding excessive premiums and the risk of a death spiral.Trump has eschewed wonkery and position papers, making a pitch that aims for the gut, backed by the candidate's bravado and little depth of thought. Yet in this case, there's little doubt that Trump is right, that you can have the coverage guarantee without the mandate, and that the solution could be pretty terrific relative to the ObamaCare status quo.It's clear that the individual insurance market is not functioning well even with an individual mandate. UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET), facing financial losses, have both questioned whether the exchanges are sustainable under current rules.The problem with ObamaCare isn’t that insurers participating on the exchanges are making money hand over fist: many are losing large sums. While more competition is a good thing, Trump’s idea of selling insurance across state lines has little or no potential to change ObamaCare’s dynamics because doing so won’t have a major effect on provider costs or on the population that signs up.The problem is simple: ObamaCare offers such an unattractive deal to so many millions of people that the exchanges are attracting a pool of customers which is too small, too old and too costly. The logical way to fix the individual insurance market is to start by offering people a deal that makes a lot more sense for their finances.To understand how this could work, first consider the example of a couple, age 30, in St. Louis, Mo., with pre-tax income of $40,000 (200% of the poverty level) and a child covered by Medicaid. For this couple, the cheapest silver plan under ObamaCare from Cigna (CI) this year costs about $2,200, which may not be financially feasible, even before their $1,000 deductible and maximum cost-sharing of $4,500.The couple could instead buy the cheapest bronze plan for $1,260, but it carries a $13,700 deductible, which means that a trip to the hospital could be financially devastating. Since that's just the situation that ObamaCare was supposed to fix, it seems beyond the pale to force a couple in this situation to buy coverage or pay a fine of $1,390 -- 3.5% of their income. In other words, it's likely that all the options for this couple are bad, unless they happen to be desperate for health coverage, perhaps because they're trying to have a second child.Once you factor in the threat of a tax penalty for those who go uncovered, the reality is that ObamaCare, which was supposed to be an antidote for inequality, turns out in far too many cases to make inequality worse.The chasm between silver and bronze deductibles — $1,000 vs. $13,700 — is by design, though clearly a poor one. The architects of ObamaCare decided to attach extra cost-sharing support to silver plans, effectively turning the plans to platinum for low-income beneficiaries. The cost-sharing subsidies work exactly like premium subsidies, paid directly from the government to insurers on a monthly basis, whether or not the policy holder gets medical care.Simply getting rid of the individual mandate could lead millions of people to drop coverage, sending rates through the roof. But what if, for starters, the government offered that cost-sharing support directly to individuals, instead of paying it out to insurers? If this were done while easing ObamaCare's age-rating restriction (for bronze plans only) that artificially inflates the cost of coverage for young adults — a bronze plan costs $1,000 more for a 30-year-old than for a 60-year-old if each earn $25,000 — the deal offered to this 30-year-old couple would be transformed. They could still get the same level of coverage offered by silver, but if they opted for bronze-level coverage, their policy would cost nothing (vs. $1,260 under ObamaCare today), and they'd have $800 in a Health Savings Account to put toward medical bills (assuming a 4:1 age-rating for bronze). Clearly, no mandate would be needed to get modest-income households to sign up for this kind of coverage.This approach resembles the Republican idea of giving people a subsidy and, if they choose catastrophic coverage that costs less, letting them keep what is left over. The problem with GOP plans offered to date is that they make comprehensive coverage a whole lot less affordable for people who really need it — dramatically so for older people with modest incomes.The potential fallout from taking away coverage that millions are depending on explains why a who's who of GOP policy wonks has come up with the idea of killing ObamaCare softly -- letting people opt into a Republican vision of health reform and leaving the exchanges to gradually fade away. The only problem is that their idea of a gradual phase-out has zero chance of working.What's needed is an approach that offers a good deal to the millions who don't get one under ObamaCare, while continuing to meet the needs of the millions who are happy with their deal. There's no reason it can't work and there's no reason it can't be done without a heavy-handed mandate.The keys are giving people much more flexibility over how they use their subsidies; easing age-rating for high-deductible and catastrophic coverage; broadening eligibility to include millions of low-wage, full-time  workers that ObamaCare threw under the bus; and creating a level playing field between the middle class who get no help to buy individual market coverage and their peers who get government tax subsidies to buy employer coverage. Lastly, instead of penalizing for not buying coverage, the government could very gradually reduce the level of future health insurance tax subsidies for those who go uninsured, making it a no-win proposition for young invincibles to gamble that they won't get sick.

28,MO,"Altria (MO) reported slightly higher fourth-quarter profit as its flagship Marlboro brand grew retail sales for the fourth year in a row. The company also said it plans layoffs to lower costs.The No. 2 tobacco company by revenue behind Philip Morris (PM) said earnings per share rose a penny in Q4 to 67 cents, one cent less than the analyst consensus of 68 cents. It was the first time in six quarters that Altria failed to meet or beat profit estimates.Revenue rose 2.5% to $4.729 billion, lighter than the expected $4.745 billion.On its earnings call Thursday, Altria said it plans to eliminate jobs to cut up to $300 million in costs annually, according to the Wall Street Journal. Chairman and Chief Executive Marty Barrington declined to say on the call how many jobs would be cut.The results were in line with Stifel's forecast. Prior to the earnings report, Stifel analyst Christopher Growe said in a Jan. 14 report that he had a buy rating on Altria with a positive bias.Growe said he expected 2016 industry growth to be lower than 2015's, but he generally sees robust conditions, saying the recent period for tobacco makers is a ""Golden Age"" amid global expansion and the rollout of new products such as electronic cigarettes.During Q4, Altria continued to build its Nu Mark portfolio of e-vapor products to additional retail outlets.Altria forecast full-year 2016 EPS of $3 to $3.05, below the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $3.05.The tobacco company is a major shareholder of SABMiller and is hoping the proposed merger between Miller and brewing giant AB InBev (BUD) will go through.If it does, ""we expect to capture a significant premium on our very large investment in SABMiller and continue our participation in the global beer profit pool on attractive terms,"" Barrington said in the earnings statement.Altria shares closed up 1.1% in the stock market today. Altria continues to trade near its all-time-high close of 61.53 on Oct. 29, and it sports a 93 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed more than 93% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth.Philip Morris added 1.1%. Among other large tobacco companies, Reynolds American (RAI) rose 19%, and British American Tobacco (BTI) climbed 2%.

29,MO,"Tobacco stocks have risen into the upper echelon of IBD's industry rankings as investors seek a safe haven from the market's gyrations.The eight-stock industry group has jumped 25 places over the past six weeks to No. 15 out of 197 as of Tuesday amid remarkably stable earnings growth, slow-but-steady stock price appreciation and healthy dividend increases.Reynolds American (RAI) leads the industry with a best-possible Composite Rating of 99, putting it in the top 1% of all stocks based on five fundamental criteria such as sales and profit growth and relative price strength.The IBD Leaderboard stock has pulled back to just below a 49.66 buy point of a flat base after breaking out Thursday in volume 15% above average. Still, its relative strength line is soaring and its Accumulation/Distribution Rating indicates net positive demand for the shares.Reynolds, which makes cigarettes under brands such as Camel and Pall Mall, boasts a dividend growth rate of 8%. Also, its annualized dividend of $2.26 a share yields 2.9%, which is above the S&P 500 average.Tobacco companies have offset declining cigarette sales by raising prices, cutting costs and developing new products such as electronic cigarettes.Profit at Reynolds rose 17% in the latest quarter, picking up from the prior quarter's 13% gain. Revenue jumped 41%, accelerating for the third straight quarter following the company's acquisition last year of Lorillard, whose popular Newport cigarettes helped boost Reynolds' earnings last quarter.Altria Group (MO), the maker of cigarette brands such as Marlboro,  reported Thursday that Q4 profit edged up 2% to 67 cents a share on a 1% gain in revenue to $6.32 billion. Both figures trailed Wall Street forecasts. The company reportedly said after its earnings release that it would eliminate 490 jobs in the U.S. in order to save $300 million a year by the end of 2017.Yet Altria has risen 12% in the past year even as the S&P 500 has declined. The stock sits just 1% off a record high as it works on a flat base with a 61.84 buy point. Its relative strength line is soaring, which is a bullish sign.Philip Morris International (PM), also boasts a five-year earnings stability factor of 1 on a scale of zero (most stable) to 99 (least stable).Philip Morris is just 1% below an all-time as it hovers under a 90.37 buy point of a flat base. Its long-term dividend growth rate of 11% and annualized dividend yield of just over 4% are highest among the three stocks discussed here.Philip Morris, which was spun off from Altria in 2008, will report Q4 results Feb. 4.Profit for the period is seen falling 21% to 81 cents a share on a 10% decline in revenue to $6.49 billion due in part to the strong dollar. Altria spun off Philip Morris in 2008 to reduce regulatory risk, though the two companies are working together to develop and jointly market e-cigarettes.Image provided by Shutterstock.

30,MO,"Casino owner Donald Trump defied the Las Vegas odds Tuesday night to win the Nevada Republican caucuses going away.With final tallies still coming early Wednesday, Trump had exploded through what many had declared was his GOP support ceiling of 35% or 36% to easily win the night with more than 42%.Second place again went to Marco Rubio with about 25%, while Ted Cruz trailed again with about 21%. John Kasich and Ben Carson finished at the bottom once more with the delusional retired surgeon detecting mounting enthusiasm for his candidacy.It was Trump’s third consecutive win in a third different region with the same 1-2-3 finish as South Carolina, albeit minus Jeb Bush. Only five percent of GOP delegates have been awarded after the first four states. But television pundits were declaring the entire contest all but over for the GOP nomination in Cleveland come mid-July.Now the political show heads into the 11 March 1 Super Tuesday primaries when about half of the 1,237 delegates necessary for nomination will be awarded.Trump certainly appears to have the Big Mo with competitors making it easier still dividing Trump’s opposition. As he did in South Carolina, Trump captured most of the party’s demographics but one. He won among the wealthy, the less affluent, the higher-educated, the lesser-educated. He won nearly half the Hispanic vote which, honestly, only comprised 10% of GOP caucus-goers.Nevada's 2016 caucus showing was expected to far exceed 2012’s GOP turnout of 33,000. As usual with caucus states, however, that’s a small fraction of total voters. If each of the 47,000 Republicans who pre-registered to caucus Tuesday showed up, that’s still barely 11% of the Silver State’s registered Republicans.To put on another perspective, all of Nevada’s GOP caucus participants together  totaled less than Ben Carson’s last place vote total four days ago.Among caucus-goers, the thrice-married billionaire with the profane mouth again cut deeply into Cruz’ expected support with evangelicals, as he did in South Carolina. Cruz, whose campaign has been playing defense against charges of dirty tricks and lying in recent days, was unable to win even a single county in the Palmetto State. According to Trump's uncanny plan, Cruz should now attack Rubio, not the front-runner.The only party demographic that Trump failed to capture was young voters, where Rubio ruled. Trump dominates with angry voters and those dissatisfied and frustrated with the federal government. Once more, Cruz won among voters who want someone sharing their values. Following a pattern, third-place Cruz’ “concession” remarks sounded more like a victory stump speech.As the Nevada ballots were counted, Rubio was already campaigning in Michigan, which votes March 8. Again the youngest GOP candidate blew away the others among those seeking the most electable candidate come November, among late-deciders and this time also among those seeking a nominee with experience.Trump’s media manipulation skills allow him to get away with mostly vague policies. He’s also proficient at playing offense, mostly against Cruz in recent days, deflecting attention to the alleged faults of others.The 69-year-old has set himself a brutal campaign schedule of 25 cities in the next 21 days. “It’s going to be an amazing two months,” he said late Tuesday, trying to ignite inevitability talk. “And we might not even need those two months.”Trump does use speaking notes on a little card to remind of rich friends to recognize in the audience, and a list of points to make quickly, often inconsistent with previous stands.Trump’s talking points do not follow anything resembling standard conservative ideology. For instance, he proposes leaving Russia to fight ISIS. But in these days of revolting voters angry about unfulfilled promises of congressional Republicans, ideological impurity has proven a plus.No matter what Trump says, no matter how general nor disjointed, even tasteless, his supporters lap up his inarticulate rants.Trump told his victory audience of a rich friend who offered $10 million to the billionaire’s self-funded campaign. “It’s hard for me to turn down money,” Trump proclaimed, “because that’s not what I’ve done my whole life. I grab. And grab. And grab. I get greedy. I want money, more money.“I tell you what, we’re going to do it right. We’re going to get greedy. We’re going to get greedy for the United States. We’re going to grab and grab and grab. We’re going to get so much money and so much everything. We’re going to make America great again, folks. I’m telling ya. Make America great again. We’re going to do it. And it’s going to happen fast.”Speaking of fast, just six days until March 1 primaries in Alabama, Georgia, Massachusetts, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee and caucuses in Minnesota and Alaska.RELATED:

34,MO,"Cerner, the nation's large pure-play developer of health care information technology software, late Tuesday did a belly-flop with its Q1 EPS guidance, sending shares sharply lower after hours, though it blew its Q4 earnings out the water.Cerner (CERN) forecast first-quarter earnings per share minus items of 52 to 54 cents on sales of $1.15 billion to $1.2 billion, both metrics up 18% from the year-ago quarter at their midpoints. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting 54 cents on $1.178 billion.  In either case, the performance would represent slowing growth. In the year-ago Q1, Cerner grew adjusted EPS 22% and sales 27%.The North Kansas City, Mo.-based company said it expects Q1 new-business bookings of $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion, the midpoint flat with Q1 2015,  which had risen 32% from Q1 2014.Cerner is facing single-digit hospital IT spending growth of about 8%, up from 6% to 7% in 2015,  as clinicians struggle to keep up with software innovation. Federal rule makers are requiring more health care technology updates while changing the game, complicating buying decisions.For its Q4 ended Jan. 2, Cerner said EPS rose 30% to 61 cents per share minus items, while revenue rose 27% to $1.175 billion. Revenue met analyst views, while EPS beat by 4 cents.Cerner stock was down more than 13% in after-hours trading, after the company released its Q4 results. Cerner stock rose 1% to 55.46 in the stock market today, 26% off its all-time high of 75.72 set April 13. Smaller rival Athenahealth (ATHN)  rose 7.7% Tuesday but was down more than 1% after hours. Rivals Allscsripts (MDRX) and Quality Systems (QSII) were flat in after-hours trading.Cerner said its Q4 bookings rose 16% to $1.35 billion.“Our fourth-quarter results reflect a solid finish to a record year,” Cerner President Zane Burke said in the earnings release. “In 2015, we added more than double the number of new EHR (electronic health records) clients than any year in our history, including both large health systems and small hospitals. We also continued to advance our cloud-based HealtheIntent platform and had a very strong year of selling our population health solutions both inside and outside our EHR installed base.”For this year, Cerner forecasts EPS ex items of $2.30 to $2.40, on revenue of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. Wall Street had modeled, $2.36 EPS minus items on $5.02 billion in revenue.

35,MO,"Altria's (MO) profit growth is projected to cool to the low single-digit range when it reports fourth-quarter results early Thursday, though the tobacco industry is considered to be in a ""Golden Age.""Analyst consensus is for earnings per share to rise 3% to 68 cents, which would be its weakest quarterly growth in more than four years. Revenue is projected to rise 2.7% to $4.74 billion, which would be its smallest growth rate in four quarters.""Over the past 18 months, we have regarded the conditions of the U.S. Tobacco industry as very strong leading us to regard this recent era as 'the Golden Age,' "" said Stifel analyst Christoper Growe in a Jan. 14 report that it has a buy rating on Altria and maintains a positive bias on it.While he expects 2016 industry growth to be less robust than 2015, the general industry conditions are still robust enough to support his bullish stance.He cited light litigation and regulatory activity, modest tax hikes, commanding market share, strong pricing, and an improving consumer market.Sales volumes slowed in 2014 but rebounded in 2015, led by stronger overall economic conditions like lower gas prices and employment gains, though those tailwinds should be lapped in early 2016.Altria shares crossed above its 50-day average last Friday and pushed higher Monday. It's been above the 200-day line since early October. Its stock  was up about 1% at 58.82 in Monday afternoon trading on the stock market today. It has a strong 92 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed 92% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth.Philip Morris International (PMI), was up 0.8%.

48,MO,"By all accounts, President Obama’s last year in office could be a record-setting year for federal regulations.His two terms in office have already seen over 2,600 federal rules finalized with an associated annual economic cost of nearly $710 billion, according to the American Action Forum. Yet as of Jan. 1, nearly 4,000 proposed regulations are already being drafted by the federal bureaucracy —and the White House is all but guaranteed to propose hundreds, if not thousands, more.This regulatory deluge is weighing down the American economy and harming the American people through slow job growth, stagnant wages, the proliferation of part-time work, and many other negative consequences.Fortunately, Congress is now building a foundation for comprehensive regulatory reform that could break down barriers to opportunity and unleash economic growth in 2017 and beyond. Earlier this month, the House of Representatives passed two bills that pare back the bureaucratic state and prevent future administrations from unleashing similar regulatory floods.The most important is the “Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act.” Introduced by U.S. Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., the SCRUB Act creates a temporary commission charged with identifying ineffective, unnecessary and outdated federal regulations.It devotes special attention to major regulations — those with over $100 million in annual costs — and requires some agencies to eliminate rules before creating new ones. The commission is designed to cut at least 15% of the total national regulatory burden.Crucially, the act allows Congress to vote on the commission’s recommendations. If lawmakers approve, the affected agencies must repeal the targeted regulations within 60 days.The second praiseworthy bill is the “Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act,” introduced by Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga. It requires federal agencies to generate monthly reports listing each regulation they intend to finalize or propose over the next year. This simple proposal would enable lawmakers — and the public — to keep better tabs on a regulatory state run amok.It also limits the “sue-and-settle” strategy that federal agencies often use to bypass the regulatory proposal process established in law. Sue-and-settle cases begin when an outside interest group sues a federal agency alleging it did not fulfill its regulatory duty. The agency and the interest group then agree to collaborate.Disturbingly, agencies often end up using the regulatory structure developed by the interest group. Once an agreement is reached, a federal court makes the resulting regulations legally binding. Neither the general public nor affected parties has the chance to weigh in — even when the new regulation will harm them.The Environment Protection Agency frequently uses this underhanded tactic. It participated in at least 60 sue-and-settle cases between 2009 and 2012. More than 100 regulations followed, including the Clean Power Plan in 2015. According to NERA Economic Consulting, it is one of the EPA’s most expensive regulations ever, estimated to cost up to $73 billion annually.Rep. Collins’ bill would help end this unethical practice. It requires agencies to promptly inform Congress of such lawsuits and hand over all relevant documents. It also prevents agencies from settling the same day complaints are filed — something the EPA did in 2010. And it prohibits the creation of new regulations until a proposed rule has been published, thereby allowing comments from the general public and affected parties.The House should be applauded for passing these two bills. They now deserve the Senate’s full consideration. So for that matter, does a bill that passed the House last July: The Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act.Introduced by Rep. Todd Young, R-Ind.), the REINS Act is perhaps the most critical of all the regulatory bills under consideration by Congress. It requires both the House and Senate to hold an up-or-down vote on all regulations costing more than $100 million annually.The George W. Bush administration finalized 496 such regulations; the Obama administration passed the 500-mark in June of 2015, by which point the cost was already a staggering $625 billion. Elected lawmakers — not unelected bureaucrats — deserve the final say over whether Americans must bear such a burden.President Obama is likely to veto these three bills if and when Congress passes them. But that shouldn’t distract from the fact that lawmakers are working to undo the record damage caused by the White House’s agenda of regulation-not-legislation. Passing these measures will send a powerful message that lawmakers are fighting for Americans’ interests, not Washington’s.

49,MO,"Health care information technology is growing fitfully -- hurt and helped by government policies. Still, HCIT software makers Cerner (CERN), Allscripts (MDRX), Athenahealth (ATHN) and Quality Systems (QSII) are expected to see their combined revenue rise more than 12% this year to $8.14 billion, and 11%, to $9 billion, next year, Wall Street analysts estimate.That's an achievement, since the biggest spenders -- hospitals -- are expected to increase their IT budgets by only 8% in 2016, up from 6%-7% in 2015, says analyst Matthew Gillmor with investment banker Robert W. Baird.That 8% increase will be shared with other companies that compete in HCIT, including IBM's (IBM) Watson Health, an analytics provider launched last year that is expected to ramp up to 2,000 employees. Another rival is Verona, Wis.-based, privately held Epic Systems, which employs some 8,500 workers and reportedly generated $1.7 billion in sales in 2014.The workforce for Kansas City, Mo.-based Cerner, the largest of the HCIT software pure plays, reached 22,000 employees last year after the company acquired Siemens Health Services for $1.3 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Cerner's revenue to rise 13% in 2016, to $5.01 billion.HCIT growth faces a unique struggle, heavily influenced by policymakers in Washington, D.C., determined to expand and improve care while keeping a lid on patient costs. While federal rules have stimulated HCIT growth, they're also challenging hospitals' ability to keep up, compromising doctors and nurses' ability and time to provide care, some observers say.The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which includes the Health Information Technology (HITECH) Act, established the Electronic Health Records Incentive Programs that reward and punish hospitals and doctors’ practices for the pace of their EHR transition. Then the Affordable Care Act of 2010, better known as ObamaCare, and most recently the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA), which became law in April, also hasten higher HCIT standards.In between the lawmaking, rule writers continue to draft implementation language that the federal director of HCIT standards in October called an ""IT bonanza.""This is good for the software vendors as they race to refine and sell Population Health software. PopHealth records expenses, tracks patient care and outcomes, incorporates patients’ evaluations of their care, parses data from similar patient populations, encourages communication between caregivers, and collects performance metrics throughout a hospital -- all intended to improve patient care while giving regulators tools to measure compliance.Cerner calls its PopHealth platform HealtheIntent and says it's used ""to address the growing demand, payer pressures and policy mandates organizations face today.""Those policy mandates are driving some doctors, nurses and hospital IT executives up the wall -- and some are pushing back.At this month's JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, where Cerner was among presenters, Andy Slavitt, acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees HCIT, tweeted: ""In 2016, MU as it has existed – with MACRA – will now be effectively over and replaced with something better.""In other words, the rules are changing again, maybe.MU is meaningful use, a protocol that has guided health care IT spending and systems development, and which the director of HCIT standards, Steven Posnack, has been implementing with a certification process under the auspices of MACRA. (At 39,010 words, MACRA is 10% the length of ObamaCare, which most consider complex.)In November, Dr. John Halamka went public with the case for changing or eliminating MU.""I’m likely going to violate many rules with this post,"" he prefaced in a blog post. He's chief information officer of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, the 631-bed teaching hospital for Harvard Medical School. Halamka wrote in a post titled ""The Path Forward for Meaningful Use"" that MU had outlived its usefulness and is doing damage.""Stage 1 created a foundation of functionality for everyone,"" Halamka wrote. ""That was good.""Stage 2 tried to change too much too fast and required an ecosystem of applications and infrastructure that did not exist. ... Stage 3 makes many of the same mistakes as Stage 2, trying to do too much too soon. ...""Clinicians cannot get through a 12-minute visit, enter the necessary Stage 3 data elements, reconcile problems/allergies/medications from multiple institutions, meet the demands of the Stage 3 clinical quality measures, make eye contact with patients and deliver safe medical care. There needs to be a new approach.”As a veteran medical-surgical registered nurse at a big California hospital told IBD: ""We’re set up to fail.""This uncertainty helps explain why HCIT spending is growing slowly as hospital administrators hesitate to invest in systems requiring, as Halamka put it, ""infrastructure that did not exist"" under a ""meaningful use"" protocol of questionable viability for a MACRA law just 9 months old, with pending regulations yet to come.Two days after Slavitt's declaration to do away with MU under MACRA, his office issued its regular newsletter, ""What's Happening in Health IT,"" highlighting news of the ""Adopted 2015 Edition Criteria for Testing and Certification Under the Health IT Certification Program"" and ""In Preparation for Testing, ONC Publishes Certification Companion Guides,"" among other HCIT must-reads.""HCIT spending is still in the process of resetting post the MU bonanza, but the overall environment remains healthy,"" said Baird analyst Gillmor in a research note issued Jan. 8.He says the electronic health records replacement ""opportunity remains elusive,"" even though many hospitals need to get moving on their EHR efforts.Chicago-based HIMSS Analytics says only 4% of U.S. hospitals had achieved the most advanced Stage 7 of EMR proficiency as of Q3 2015, with 25% in Stage 6 and the remainder at the lower levels.""Replacement activity has been slow, and we expect this will continue in 2016,"" said Gillmor. ""CERN and Epic will continue to win the lion's share of replacements.""

85,MO,"Is O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) getting ready to shift into overdrive and rally again? Shares of the auto parts retailer, up more than 33% this year, are working on a new flat base with a potential 278.06 buy point.O'Reilly is outpacing most of its rivals. AutoZone (AZO) is up about 20%. Advance Auto Parts (AAP) is down nearly 5% since Jan. 1.And it's not just the stock that's outperforming. The Springfield, Mo.-based company sports the top Composite and Earnings Per Share ratings in its nine-stock group. Where O'Reilly and its rivals used to mostly rely on the do-it-yourself shopper, the growing DIFM business is providing an additional revenue stream.O'Reilly started the year off with a Feb. 5 breakout, an 8% gap up past a 196.90 flat-base buy point. It immediately went on to form a new flat base, which it cleared in mid-March. Since then, it's shaped and broken out of two more bases.At its Feb. 5 breakout, the stock boasted a 97 Composite Rating; 95 EPS; 92 Relative Strength; Sales+Profit Margin+ROE of A; and B- for Accumulation/Distribution.When it began to climb past a new flat-base entry on June 19, O'Reilly's ratings remained solid: 95 Composite, 96 EPS, 91 RS,SMR of A and Acc/Dis of B-.And when the stock cleared its latest buy point on Oct. 12, its Composite Rating had risen to 99. The 95 RS and B Acc/Dis ratings also showed improvement.Because O'Reilly already has cleared a series of bases over the past two years, its current pattern is late-stage, which tends to be riskier than earlier stage bases. Also, an up-down volume ratio below the neutral 1.0 level implies weak share demand. (See the ratio at IBD Stock Checkup, found under the ""Research"" tab on Investors.com).All the bases it's formed this year have been third stage, since the stock hasn't gained 20% from the breakouts.Aside from the October 2014 (1) and February breakouts (2), weekly volume has been rather tepid. Yet the chart shows numerous weeks of gains in heavy trade. Plus, O'Reilly has been finding support near its 10-week moving average as it trends higher. Despite the late-stage nature of its bases, the stock has offered investors chances to buy or add shares at breakouts and pullbacks to the 10-week line.The number of funds owning shares rose to 1,341 in Q3 from 1,118 in last year's Q4. Plenty of top-rated funds bought a stake or added to their position in Q3.

86,MO,"War On Cops: In case after case, jurors are siding with police over civil rights activists who have accused them of racially targeting young black men for murder. The Black Lives Matter movement is proving a fraud.The latest exoneration came Monday in Cleveland, where a grand jury refused to indict a white cop for shooting a black youth after he pulled a gun out of his waistband and threatened him with it.It was supposed to be a slam dunk case of a racially motivated police shooting. But newly enhanced surveillance video made it ""indisputably clear"" that the boy approached the cop, lifted his shirt and reached for the pellet gun, which was ""indistinguishable"" from a real gun.Before shooting, the officer yelled repeatedly, ""Show me your hands"" as loud as he could. But the boy refused to comply, brandishing the gun instead.The grand jury also learned that Tamir Rice appeared much older than 12. At 175 pounds and wearing size 12 shoes, he looked like a young man when the officer and his partner responded to a call of a ""guy with a pistol"" scaring people.Of course, that's not how Black Lives Matter protestors have portrayed the facts. They convinced the gullible media that the two racist patrolmen pulled up on an innocent little boy as he played with a toy in the park and gunned him down in cold blood. They demanded city officials charge the cops with murder.Jurors heard the actual facts in the case and concluded there was no reason for the cops to know that Rice was threatening them with a pellet gun and therefore had reason to fear for their lives. And they found no racial animus in the tragic shooting.The dismissal of the case follows a mistrial earlier this month in the first of several cases against police in Baltimore involving the death of another young black man, Freddie Gray.A majority black jury could not agree that Baltimore Police Officer William Porter was guilty of negligence in Gray's death while in custody. Porter's conviction was supposed to be a cinch. But the decision now throws the trials of five other cops into flux.In August, a jury in Charlotte, N.C., also made up of minorities, could not agree that Charlotte Police Officer Randall Kerrick was guilty of manslaughter in the shooting death of an unarmed black man, Jonathan Ferrell.Eight jurors, including minorities, argued for acquittal, believing Kerrick shot Ferrell in self- defense as Ferrell, a college football player under the influence, repeatedly charged at the rookie cop while responding to a report of a home invasion involving Ferrell.A grand jury initially declined to indict Kerrick, but after angry protests from the NAACP and Black Lives Matter, the case was presented to a different grand jury and eventually went to trial. Prosecutors decided not to retry Kerrick. For its rush to judgment, the city must pay the railroaded cop almost $200,000 in back pay, retirement and legal fees.Last year, moreover, jurors exonerated equally framed police involved in the deaths of two other black men — Michael Brown of Ferguson, Mo., and Eric Garner of Staten Island, N.Y. — and before that, a jury found a neighborhood crime watch captain acted in self-defense in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, aka Obama's ""son,"" in Sanford, Fla.Six swings, six misses by the race-baiters and -mongers.None of these cases should ever have gone to trial, but riots and political pressure forced prosecutors' hands. Luckily, there are multiple layers to our judicial system, and mob justice can only go so far.These citizen jurors are in effect indicting Black Lives Matter as a fraudulent movement based on a false narrative of ""systemic racism"" and bogus charges of police abuse and brutality.They're also rendering judgment on Obama, who recently called BLM a ""legitimate"" cause and has launched an anti-discrimination witch hunt against more than two dozen police departments.

90,MO,"Earnings season can cause volatility in a stock, while a steady profit track record can mean fewer big surprises. Here are five Dividend Leaders with the most stable earnings — and market-beating yields.AT&T (T) offers an annualized payout of 5.6% vs. the S&P 500's 2.04% average. Its five-year Earnings Stability Factor (ESF) is 2 on a scale from 0 (most stable) to 99 (most volatile). AT&T's five-year earnings growth rate is 3%. The stock's been consolidating since June.The telecom services giant said Tuesday that it had received a five-year blanket purchase agreement to offer fleet management services to federal agencies. Also, AT&T is raising its monthly fee for grandfathered unlimited data plans by $5 to $35 in February.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) reported a 5.9-million-share stake in AT&T in Q3. It previously owned shares of DirecTV, which AT&T bought in July.Altria Group (MO), which offers a 3.9% yield on a full-year basis, gets an ESF of 1. The Marlboro maker has a five-year earnings growth rate of 8%. Analysts expect a 9% gain this year and 9% the next. The stock is back in buy range from a 55.76 entry that it cleared Oct. 6.Paychex (PAYX) (ESF 1) pays a 3.1% annualized dividend. The payroll and employee benefits services provider's five-year earnings growth rate is 7%, with consensus views for a 10% increase this year and 8% in 2016. Its shares are near the top of a buy range from a 51.82 entry.Camel cigarette maker Reynolds American (RAI) (ESF 2) offers a 3.1% annualized yield. Its five-year earnings growth rate is 8%; analysts see a 16% jump this year and 17% the next. The stock has eased into buy range from a 44.24 entry first cleared Sept. 29.Kimberly-Clark (KMB) (ESF 2) offers a 3% payout. The consumer products maker's five-year earnings growth rate is 4%. The Street expects profit to grow 5% this year and 7% the next. Shares are in a buy zone from a 117.05 buy point initially cleared Oct. 21.

91,MO,"Senate leaders announced a bipartisan two-year budget agreement Wednesday that would provide nearly $300 billion in additional funding, a step likely to avert a Friday government shutdown and end a months-long impasse on spending priorities.X The plan would also suspend the federal debt ceiling until March 2019, according to Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, a member of the GOP leadership team. It also would provide hurricane and wildfire disaster aid. Blunt said he expects a Senate vote on Thursday.The dollar rose on the deal, as did yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury.Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky called the plan a ""significant agreement"" that gives both parties what they want. It includes a long-sought defense spending boost that was the top goal of Republicans who lead both chambers in Congress and gives more funding for domestic programs sought by Democrats.Defense spending would increase by $80 billion over current law in this fiscal year and $85 billion in the one that begins Oct. 1, according to a congressional official familiar with the plan. Non-defense spending would rise by $63 billion this year and $68 billion next year.Secretary of Defense James Mattis told reporters at the White House that he's optimistic that Congress will give the Pentagon the funding it needs.Lawmakers intend to combine the two-year spending deal with a short-term measure to keep the government operating when current funding runs out at the end of the day Thursday. Like the House-passed short-term bill, the Senate measure would fund the government through March 23 while lawmakers fill in the details on longer-term spending.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, speaking on the floor after McConnell, said the agreement was completed ""without a great deal of help from the White House.""""I believe we have reached a budget deal that neither side loves but both sides can be proud of,"" Schumer said.One complication is House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California, who was part of the negotiations on the agreement. She said earlier Wednesday that House Democrats won't back the plan without a commitment from Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin to allow an open debate on immigration legislation, similar to a promise made by McConnell.Some conservative Republicans, including members of the House Freedom Caucus, are threatening to vote against the deal because of the higher spending for non-defense programs. That means as many as 100 Democratic votes may be needed to get it through the House.GOP Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama said he'll vote ""hell no"" on the measure.""The Republican Party seems to be the party of big government in this day and age,"" said Brooks, though he added he doesn't think there's enough opposition to sink it.Pro-immigration Democrats pushed Pelosi to demand an open debate on immigration legislation rather than being forced to vote on a Republican-only proposal.Representative Luis Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat, said a budget deal is unacceptable without protection for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, who have been covered under the soon-to-end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.""That would be a complete betrayal,"" he told reporters, adding that ""a lot"" of Democrats would feel the same.McConnell reiterated his promise to allow an open debate on immigration legislation ""that will be fair to all sides."" He said it will start with essentially a blank slate and both Democrats and Republicans will be able to offer amendments for a vote.The higher spending would add to an expanding federal budget deficit that Steve Bell, a former Senate Budget Committee staff director, forecast would reach as much as $1 trillion next year.Second-ranking Senate Republican John Cornyn of Texas said the disaster relief package will be between $80 billion and $90 billion.The deal would repeal an Obamacare board charged with controlling health-care costs, which has long been criticized by Republicans.Schumer said the deal would extend the Children's Health Insurance Program for 10 years, four more than the extension Congress just enacted.The plan includes $20 billion for infrastructure over two years, including roads and drinking water, he said. There's also $6 billion to combat opioid abuse and improve mental health, $2 billion for research at the National Institutes of Health, and $4 billion for college affordability.The deal would be at least partly paid for by cuts to mandatory spending programs elsewhere in the budget, according to the Republican summary.

The report sent bond prices, boosting the 10-year Treasury yield to 2.58% before settling at 2.55%.PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) lost 0.3%, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) slid 0.2% and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) gave up 0.1%. Emerging markets lagged with iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) down 0.7%.Among bond funds, iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (TLT) fell 1% intraday, sliding further below its 200-day moving average. It tumbled 1.3% Tuesday to breach the support line. IShares 3-7 Year Treasury Bond (IEI) also extended its losses from the prior session. But TLT recovered most of its Wednesday loss and IEI reversed slightly higher.Homebuilders, semiconductors and real estate led the downside among sector funds in the stock market today. But banks, metals miners and retail advanced. Gold ETFs rose along with gold futures, which rose 0.4% to $1,318.90 an ounce.Bitcoin climbed 0.3% to $14,5478.68, according to CoinDesk, down slightly from an earlier high of $14,650.38. Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) slumped 9% to about 1,972, for a third straight decline. It skyrocketed last year but has had a far tamer start this year with a 2% gain.Meantime, the cryptocurrency it aims to track continues to make daily headlines. So far this year, South Korea has announced a probe into banks to curb speculation, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he regrets comments last year in which he called Bitcoin a fraud, and billionaire investor Warren Buffett told CNBC Wednesday he has no interest in cryptocurrencies. The Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) CEO said: ""What's going on definitely will come to a bad ending.""Talk about a fresh start for the new year. A cannabis-focused exchange traded fund is soaring as more states legalize marijuana sales.But it's not a newly minted ETF. ETFMG Alternative Harvest (MJX) has run up 16.4% so far this year through Jan. 9, according to Morningstar Direct, far ahead of the S&P 500's 2.8% gain. The fund hit a new intraday high Tuesday. It perked up with a 3% jump Dec. 26, when MJX began trading with a new objective and ticker, and has soared 30% since then.Before that date, MJX traded under the ticker LARE and was the Tierra XP Latin America Real Estate ETF. In late October, ETFMG notified investors it would change the Latin America index to Prime Alternative Harvest Index and track marijuana stocks instead.MJX now boasts $317.6 million in assets and owns Canadian pot stocks such as Cronos Group, Canopy Growth and Aurora Cannabis. It also has positions in medical companies such as GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH), a U.K.-based developer of marijuana-derived drugs to treat cancer and other diseases, and Insys Therapeutics (INSY), whose products target cancer pain.A handful of tobacco makers including British American Tobacco, Japan Tobacco and Altria Group (MO) round out the 30 holdings in the portfolio.Since the fund began trading under the new objective and ticker two weeks ago, there isn't really a track record. It's currently extended from any buy point. MJX carries a 0.75% expense ratio.IBD'S TAKE: Even as investors in the cannabis industry try to get in on the ground floor, investing in the space in the U.S. can be tricky.AdvisorShares Vice ETF (ACT) isn't a pure-play marijuana fund. As the name implies, it's a broader theme. As of Dec. 13, cannabis stocks accounted for 20% of its portfolio, while alcohol and tobacco made up the remaining 49% and 32%, respectively.ACT has attracted $15.1 million since its Dec. 12 launch. Its top holdings include alcoholic beverage producer Constellation Brands (STZ), drugmaker AbbVie (ABBV) and agricultural chemical firm Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG).Constellation Brands rose more than 2% Tuesday on news related to its work with Canopy Growth Corp., a Canadian medical marijuana company, to develop nonalcoholic cannabis drinks. The beer and wine giant in October announced it would take a 9.9% stake in Canopy.ACT is flat this year and bears a 0.75% expense ratio.Tuesday's picks, iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) and SPDR S&P Semiconductor (XSD), remain just below their respective buy points.RELATED:Pot Stock Plays Fall, But Here's Why Jeff Sessions May Not Matter MuchStock Market Closes At Record High; Is Bitcoin No Longer A Fraud?Stocks Move As Nvidia, Tesla Drive Techs; Bitcoin, Ripple Dive

93,MO,"Is there a difference between President Barack Obama's ""stimulus"" and President Donald Trump's ""infrastructure investment""? Despite costing $800 billion, most economists do not believe Obama's ""stimulus"" program did much stimulating.XDuring the Great Depression, President Franklin Roosevelt's secretary of Treasury wrote in his diary that the New Deal spending, designed to rescue the economy, was not working. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau wrote: ""We have tried spending money. We are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work. ... I want to see this country prosperous. I want to see people get a job. I want to see people get enough to eat. We have never made good on our promises. ... I say after eight years of this Administration we have just as much unemployment as when we started and an enormous debt to boot!""Trump, in announcing his upcoming plans for 2018, said: ""Infrastructure is, by far, the easiest. People want it, Republicans and Democrats. We're going to have tremendous Democrat support on infrastructure, as you know. I could've started with infrastructure. I actually wanted to save the easy one for the one down the road. We'll be having that done pretty quickly.""What if, instead of spending more on infrastructure, the government began paying nearly 20% less for projects? And how about pushing privatization, where possible, over the inevitably more costly government spending?The Davis-Bacon Act, a Depression-era measure, was designed to thwart black workers from competing against white workers. It requires federal contractors to pay ""prevailing union wages."" This act sought to shut out black workers from competing for construction jobs after white workers protested that Southern blacks were hired to build a Veterans Bureau hospital in Long Island, New York — the district of Rep. Robert Bacon, one of the bill's sponsors. It is remarkable the Davis-Bacon still lives despite its racist intent and its discriminatory effect — to this day — on black workers. Passed in 1931, two Republicans teamed up to sponsor it.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveIn a labor market dominated by exclusionary unions that demanded above-market wages, blacks, at the time, competed by working for less money than the unionists. Davis-Bacon stopped this by requiring federal contractors to pay prevailing local union wages, causing massive black unemployment. Lawmakers made no secret of the law's goal.In the House of Representatives, Congressman William Upshaw, D-Ga., said: ""You will not think that a Southern man is more than human if he smiles over the fact of your reaction to that real problem you are confronted with in any community with a superabundance or large aggregation of Negro labor."" Rep. Miles Clayton Allgood, D-Ala., supported the bill and complained of ""cheap colored labor"" that ""is in competition with white labor throughout the country."" Rep. John J. Cochran, D-Mo., stated that he had ""received numerous complaints in recent months about Southern contractors employing low-paid colored mechanics getting work and bringing the employees from the South.""Davis-Bacon adds as much as 20% more to the cost of any federal project. And most states have enacted local Davis-Bacon laws that similarly jack up the price of those government construction projects.This brings us to privatization. Why not encourage more projects to be built and run by the private market?In California, for example, the Democratic governor pushes a ""bullet train"" that promises to benefit Los Angeles-to-San Francisco travelers. Yet the governor expects taxpayers to pay for at least part of this supposedly wonderful project. If it is predicted to be so profitable, why should taxpayers finance it?Finally, it is not true that our gas tax has not kept pace with federal highway route expenses. From 1982 through 2014, federal gas tax revenues increased nearly 6% a year, according to the Cato Institute's Chris Edwards. He also points out that, beyond transportation and water, ""most of America's infrastructure is provided by the private sector, not governments.""""In fact,"" says Edwards, ""private infrastructure spending — on factories, freight rail, cell towers, pipelines, refineries, and other items — is four times larger than federal, state, and local government infrastructure spending combined.""Businessman Trump is uniquely positioned to make the case not for more government spending but for less — but more efficient — spending. Obama's failed ""stimulus"" should serve as Exhibit A for what we ought not do. Trump should make the case to abolish Davis-Bacon, and for the privatization of as much infrastructure as possible.So what's the difference between Obama's ""stimulus"" and Trump's ""infrastructure investment""? Obama spent $830 billion in four years, while Trump says he wants to spend as much as $1 trillion in 10 years. Unless we kill Davis-Bacon and move toward more privatization, the answer may be no difference at all.RELATED:2017 Was A Great Year; Here's How 2018 Could Be BetterHow Obama's High-Speed Rail Fantasy Led To Deadly Derailment In WashingtonGeorge Will: Demolishing A Racist 1931 Law Would Make Building Much CheaperClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

94,MO,"In 2013, when Pam Nicholson took the steering wheel of Enterprise Holdings Inc., the world's largest car rental firm, she was ready.Starting as a manager trainee right out of college in 1981, Nicholson did everything from washing cars to marketing as she moved up the ranks of the company until she was named COO in 2003. Four years later, she oversaw the company's game-changing acquisition of the National Car Rental and Alamo Rent A Car brands. Andy Taylor, who at the time was CEO and is the son of Jack Taylor, who founded the firm in 1957, was so impressed he recommended her as his successor, the first outside the family to helm the private company.""Just like 99% of our senior management team, I learned the business from the ground up, so I had hands-on experience in nearly every facet of our business,"" Nicholson told IBD from her office in St. Louis, Mo. ""I truly understand the challenges people are facing because I've been there before. We're a meritocracy, promoting from within and paying for performance, so my job as a leader is to empower others to harness their strengths and reach their full potential, which helps the entire organization deliver outstanding results.""Nicholson's own results are fully recognized, with Fortune magazine ranking her No. 17 on its recent list of most powerful women in U.S. business.Nicholson, 58, grew up in St. Louis and graduated from the University of Missouri-Columbia. Within nine months, she was made assistant manager in a local office and a few months later was sent to the Southern California market. It only had a fleet of 1,000 cars, but the company could see the enormous potential.Her competitive instincts were honed as she entered horse-jumping contests in her 20s and 30s. Within 12 years, she was made regional vice president of the Southern California group, whose fleet had reached 27,000.""I learned about how to hire the right people and then continually train and mentor them to provide the consistent customer service we're known for,"" said Nicholson. ""No matter where they work in the world, they get promoted based on the same measurements of performance that reveal both ability and talent. If you don't meet your goals, you don't get promoted, and everyone embraces that.""With such attention to developing good leaders at every level and retaining the best employees, it's no wonder that Enterprise has continued to win awards from magazines Workforce, Chief Learning Officer, and Training. Nicholson is the highest-ranking woman to receive the 2017 Glassdoor Employees' Choice Award, with a 95% approval rating.Today, some 10,000 new employees, as well as 2,000 interns, are hired each year through the renowned Enterprise Rent-A-Car Management Training Program. CollegeGrad.com ranks it No. 1 for entry level jobs, and the company prioritizes military veterans and reservists for recruitment.Enterprise Holdings and its network of regional subsidiaries — including nearly 10,000 neighborhood and airport locations — currently employ more than 100,000 people. And every year, they rent and lease about 1.9 million vehicles, made up of 450 makes and models.In 1994, Nicholson was brought back to headquarters as a corporate vice president. Three years later, she moved back into the rental business as general manager of the New York regional subsidiary, whose profitability she doubled in two years. She returned to St. Louis in 1999 as senior VP of North American operations. In 2003, Nicholson was appointed chief operating officer and became responsible for all day-to-day operations. Chrissy Taylor, the daughter of now Executive Chairman Andy Taylor, is the current COO and Nicholson is responsible for mentoring her, just as mentors helped her master the skills she needed as she advanced.""The late Jack Taylor used to ask me, 'Are you having fun?' "" said Nicholson. ""There's no reason we can't both work hard and have a good time doing it, which helps us deliver better customer service, since it's far easier to make other people happy when you're happy.""Enterprise had long specialized in offering free pickup of customers from their neighborhood offices, including providing cars for customers of insurance companies, whose own autos were being repaired. As a result, it had only 8% of the airport market. Then in 2007, Nicholson supervised the integration of two new brands: National Car Rental, which primarily served business travelers, and Alamo Rent A Car, which catered to value-oriented domestic travelers and foreign visitors to North America. After the acquisition, the three brands together had 28% of the airport market and that has now grown to 38%.""On the day the acquisition was completed, we delivered a small book titled 'GR8 DAY' to every Enterprise, National and Alamo employee,"" said Nicholson. ""It stated that we had all become part of a company dedicated to three things: 1) Listening to and satisfying our customers; 2) Creating opportunities for our employees; and 3) Achieving long-term sustainable growth. Just as importantly, the book stressed that we were going to take our time to carefully review all organizational, customer, and cultural issues. Above all else, we wanted to make sure that we got the integration process right, because, just like a first impression, you only get one chance to do a merger well. Ten years later, I think our deliberative approach has paid off enormously.""But she says that while the airport presence was the primary driver for the deal, there were other important benefits.""We also learned a lot about ourselves and changed our company in ways that have equipped us for faster growth on a global scale,"" said Nicholson, who added the title of president in 2008. ""Our biggest lesson from the integration is that our company can execute a major acquisition without risk to our fundamental values and culture.""Enterprise set up its first European franchise at the end of 2012. As CEO starting the next year, Nicholson continued the company's focus on franchising overseas. It now has offices covering 95% of the car rental market in more than 90 countries and territories.""Our robust growth is a tribute to the strong international reputation of our brands,"" she said. ""We have a very clear vision of how Enterprise, National and Alamo customers should be treated. As a result, we have developed a strong international network of exceptional franchise partners who share our passion for excellence across the board. Good customer service translates well in any language or culture. Yet that core competency is always balanced with an intuitive understanding of local cultures and characteristics, which means we are learning as much from our partners as they are from us. It's definitely a two-way street.""Nicholson says that the expansion needs to rest on a foundation of entrepreneurialism, where decisions are made as locally as possible. She also oversees the Enterprise Fleet Management affiliate, which has 50 offices and manages a fleet of 470,000 vehicles in the U.S. and Canada, with full-service management for companies, government agencies and organizations having midsize fleets of 20 or more. That business recently invested $100 million in its information-technology infrastructure.""I think many people have been surprised by how quickly technology is changing the automotive industry,"" said Nicholson. ""We believe we should let innovation and responsiveness to consumer needs determine which business models and technologies thrive in the market, allowing a pragmatic and market-driven solution to evolve, supported by infrastructure and appropriate public policies. We think the car rental industry may be one of the early adopters of autonomous vehicles, since many drivers first experience new automotive technologies in rental vehicles. While potential liability issues need to be evaluated, our industry can efficiently introduce new autonomous vehicles to millions of consumers.""During Nicholson's tenure as COO, revenue for the company and its Fleet Management affiliate more than doubled. Since becoming CEO, revenue has increased from $16.4 billion in fiscal 2013 to more than $22.3 billion in fiscal 2017 ending July 31, exceeding the combined size of its chief competitors, Hertz Global Holdings (HTZ), with $9.4 billion, and Avis Budget Group (CAR), with $8.5 billion.In 2017, National and Enterprise took the top two spots respectively in Travel & Leisure's World's Best Awards for car rental agencies, and it also earned the same rankings by Business Travel News. Money magazine gave its top award to Alamo and second place to Enterprise.Executive Chairman Taylor believes that the ongoing success reflects ""Pam's leadership, passion and dedication to grow the business, with the help of every employee, and she continues to have an impact as a leader across all industries.""CEO of Enterprise Holdings Inc., the world's largest car rental company.Overcame: Challenges of integrating National Car Rental and Alamo Rent A Car.Lesson: Make sure all the core values of the company are clearly understood and implemented consistently everywhere. ""Don't sell yourself short. Set your goals high.""

Goal-driven visionaries also need to transform their grandest dreams of success into practical building blocks on which they can ascend.To set effective goals that spur entrepreneurial triumphs:Stay close to customers. It's fine to dream, but stay grounded. As you formulate your business model, keep checking in with your target market to ensure you're on the right track.""Entrepreneurs tend to convince themselves that they're right and then set lofty goals,"" said Toby Rush, chief executive of Zoloz, a Kansas City, Mo.-based identity verification and biometrics platform. ""It's better to force yourself to do market validation early on and establish goals that flow from customer input.""Proceed in steps. Brimming with confidence and passion, entrepreneurs may set wildly ambitious goals and assume they'll attain them. But it may make more sense to do a reality check.""Entrepreneurs like to think their assumptions are correct, that they can go from zero to 100,"" said Rush, a serial entrepreneur who sold a previous firm to Alibaba Group (BABA) in 2016. ""But you have to set up incremental milestones along the way. You set your feet to the fire with the milestones.""Knowing what results you need to see each month or quarter helps you advance in steps toward your larger goal. If you miss a milestone, you can make course corrections and test different strategies while mitigating your overall risk.Heed wise counsel. Beware of setting goals in a vacuum. Instead, ask a trusted ally to help you distinguish between a realistic target and pie-in-the-sky aspirations.Rush, 43, remembers launching his first company in 2005. He kept modifying his business plan as various ideas ricocheted in his head.Finally, a board member said, ""Toby, how will we ever know if you're successful if you keep changing the idea?""""I was jumping around too much,"" Rush recalled. ""The lesson is, it's fine to change direction as long as you stick with your defined milestones and you're consistent in how you get from A to B.""Hire winners. You cannot turn dreams into reality on your own. You'll need to assemble a team of skilled, motivated stars to help you.To recruit winners, don't just focus on candidates' technical qualifications. Also consider their psychological makeup.""It's important to hire patriots, not mercenaries,"" said Jack Teboda, founder and chief executive of Teboda & Associates, a financial advisory firm in Elgin, Ill. ""Patriots have that inner drive. They'll help you reach your goals,"" while mercenaries lack the buy-in to go beyond the call of duty.Focus on how, not what. While important, goals themselves have limited value. The real driver of success is how you climb the ladder to attain your objective.For Courtney Reum, the process of setting goals is only part of the picture. He's co-author of ""Shortcut Your Startup.""""Goal-setting is not about digging in your heels for the sake of reaching a goal,"" he said. ""It's more about the tactics and action steps you take to get there.""Reum urges entrepreneurs to ask themselves, ""What are we doing to reach the goal? How will we get there?"" rather than ""What is the goal?""""It's not about the what,"" he said. ""It's about the how.""Balance micro and macro. Turning your dreams into dollars requires a mix of detailed analysis and big-picture visioning. Beware of neglecting one at the expense of the other.""A good entrepreneur needs a microscope in one eye and a telescope in the other,"" Reum said.

96,MO,"Turnout would be the key to which of the wildly conflicting polls would best presage the result of Alabama's special Senate election, wrote Republican consultant Patrick Ruffini earlier this week.XThat proved correct. Statewide, turnout was down 37% from November 2016. It was down less, 31%, in the five metropolitan counties around Birmingham, Huntsville, Montgomery and Mobile, with their black communities and most of the state's highly educated whites.Turnout was down by even less, 28%, in the 10 rural counties where the majority of voters are black. But it plunged 42% in the remaining 52 small counties. As the returns came in, you could see Republican Roy Moore reaching his target percentages — but not the raw votes he needed. Donald Trump carried those counties by 568,000 votes. Moore did so by only 149,000.So Democrat Doug Jones, with big majorities in the metropolitan (61%) and black-majority (76%) counties, beat Moore by a 50-48% margin in a state that has voted 60 to 62% Republican in the past four presidential elections.Moore was a problematic candidate from the outset. He was twice ousted as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court for disobeying federal court orders, in violation of the supremacy clause in Article 6 of the Constitution. He also argued that Muslims cannot take the oath of office, in violation of Article 6's ban on religious tests for office. In 2012, he was elected chief justice with 52% of the vote, far behind Mitt Romney's 61%.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveMoore might still have won but for The Washington Post's scrupulously vetted Nov. 9 story reporting that in his 30s, he dated teenage girls and sexually molested a 14-year-old. Moore's denials were ham-handed and unpersuasive.The majority of Alabama voters are evangelical Christians. Many white evangelicals were clearly sickened by the charges and stayed home, voted for Jones or, like the state's senior senator, Richard Shelby, wrote in someone else. Black evangelicals streamed into the polls in large numbers.Liberal commentators like to chide white evangelicals by noting that many heavily white evangelical areas have high rates of divorce and unmarried births. The same could be said of black evangelicals. Nonetheless, many such voters lament breaches of traditional morality and seek candidates who uphold their higher, though often violated, standards.There are multiple losers from the Alabama result. One is Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota, who promised to resign in ""coming weeks"" while denying misconduct far short of that alleged against Moore. Minnesota's governor has announced his replacement, and Franken will surely be gone soon.Gone also are Democrats' hopes of capitalizing on what would have been an inevitable Senate Ethics Committee investigation of Moore and a probable vote to expel him from the Senate. Mainstream media, which carefully avoided coverage of the bribery trial of Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, would have joined gleefully in portraying Moore as the face of the Republican Party.Republicans are losers, as well. Their Senate majority is reduced to only 51-49, so Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can afford to lose only one colleague on partisan roll calls. Democrats' chances of winning a Senate majority next year increase, though perhaps not to the 50-50 level some claim. They need wins in marginal Nevada and Arizona, and their chances of saving their 10 incumbents in states carried by Trump — five by wide margins — look better.But the biggest loser is surely Breitbart News leader and former Trump aide Steve Bannon. He has been operating under the delusion that as a private citizen, he can spark a national rebellion aimed at somehow removing McConnell as majority leader. Now it's clear that the only possible replacement is Democrat Chuck Schumer.Bannon campaigned actively for Moore, who would probably have won the nomination even without his help, while Trump endorsed appointed incumbent Luther Strange. Given Jones' small margin, it's obvious that Strange or Rep. Mo Brooks, who finished third in the primary, would have won Tuesday.Jones deserves credit for a flawless campaign, but his example of taking ultraliberal positions on abortion and immigration may lead Democrats to nominate similar candidates in races against less problematic Republicans. And would Jones have beaten Moore if the Senate had been 50-50 and his win would have led to Democratic control?Jones' victory depended on multiple Republican mistakes, enumerated in an amusing tweetstorm by The New York Times' Alexander Burns, much as a lock picker depends on getting every tumbler to fall into place. The result is consequential but won't be easy to replicate.RELATED:Moore And GOP Lost In Alabama, But Did The Democrats Win?More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

98,MO,"During America's founding era, a significant debate took place about the nature of representation in a democratically elected government. Were representatives supposed to act as simple proxies for their constituents? Or were they supposed to exercise independent judgment?Edmund Burke was a forceful advocate for the latter position: A representative, he said, was supposed to exercise his ""mature judgment, his enlightened conscience. And ""he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living."" John Stuart Mill, too, believed that representatives ought to act independently; he said: ""A person whose desires and impulses are his own...is said to have a character. One whose desires and impulses are not his own, has no character, no more than a steam-engine has a character.""Then there were those who argued that to exercise independent judgment would be to betray voters, that they sent you there with a mission, and your job is to fulfill that mission. This so-called delegate view of representation is supremely transactional -- we only bother electing representatives in this view in order to do the work we're not willing to do. They aren't elected to spend time learning about the issues or broaden their perspective beyond the regional. They're there to do what you want them to do.This debate has finally come to a head recently, not because sectional representatives have forgone their voters but because characterless people are running for office more and more.Those who believe in the Burkean model oppose such people -- we say that to put those without character in charge of policy is to leave our future in the hands of the untrustworthy.Those who believe in the delegate model can embrace such people -- they say that so long as the representative votes the right way on the issues, they can murder dogs in the backyard or allegedly molest young girls.Nina Burleigh's perspective on then-President Bill Clinton falls into this second camp. ""I would be happy to give him a blow job just to thank him for keeping abortion legal,"" she said. So does Rep. Mo Brooks' perspective on Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore. He said: ""Roy Moore will vote right ... That's why I'm voting for Roy Moore.""XThere's a certain freedom to this perspective. It allows us to forgo discussion about the nature of the people we support -- so long as they're not lying about how they vote, we can trust them in office. The founders, however, would have rejected this perspective. The Federalist Papers are replete with explanations of just why a good government would require good men. The founders greatly feared the constraints of a parchment barrier against characterless men; they didn't trust human nature enough to believe that child molesters or puppy torturers would be bound by simple conformity with the public will.And the founders were right. History has shown that bad men in positions of power rarely get better; they often get worse. They tend to abuse power. They tend to exercise their judgment -- or lack thereof -- even when they pledge to do otherwise. That means that we must measure our candidates for character as well as position.""May none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof,"" President John Adams prayed regarding the White House. He didn't pray that they agree with him on tariffs.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market? Start with IBD University.

100,MO,"Insys Therapeutics (INSY) faced the same woes as at least one other troubled opioid maker in the wake of the arrest of the company's founder, largest shareholder and board member John Kapoor, as the stock was halted Friday.XKapoor was charged Thursday with leading a nationwide conspiracy to profit by using bribes and fraud to illegally distribute a Fentanyl spray known as Subsys, an opioid, intended for cancer patients experiencing breakthrough pain.The Department of Justice alleged six former Insys employees, in addition to Kapoor, engaged in a kickback scheme to get pain doctors to write a large number of Subsys prescriptions including for patients not diagnosed with cancer. Shares were halted at 5.74 apiece.The employees allegedly misled and defrauded insurers who were reluctant to approve payment for Subsys when it was prescribed to noncancer patients by setting up a unit dedicated to getting prior authorization from insurers and pharmacy benefit managers.Janney analyst Ken Trbovich expects Insys stock to be volatile when it does return to trading. Shares were halted Thursday after crashing 22.7% to a five-year low in seven times their normal volume.Trbovich says the ""dark day does not doom Insys but it is painful.""He likens Insys' situation to that of Purdue Pharmaceuticals in 2007 when the drug giant paid millions to settle a case over its marketing for opioid painkiller OxyContin.""The DOJ settlement with Purdue included guilty pleas pertaining to criminal charges, financial payments for criminal and civil penalties and implementation of monitoring pertaining to a corporate integrity agreement,"" Trbovich wrote in a note to clients.In total, the penalties Purdue paid represented 21% of OxyContin sales between 1995-2001, Trbovich said. The firm remained in business, OxyContin and its other approved drugs remained on the market and its pipeline advanced, yielding new approvals.""In other words, Purdue paid the fines, changed its marketing practices and continued to do business,"" he said. ""We expect the same will occur with Insys.""IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks struggled Thursday after a disappointing third-quarter report from Celgene and guidance cut. Head to IBD Industry Themes for more on Celgene's view for 2020 and what its report could mean for the sector.Last month, new Insys Chief Executive Saeed Motahari outlined efforts to put ethics front and center at the company in a letter to Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who, earlier this year, launched an investigation into opioid drug manufacturers.Since Motahari joined Insys in April, the firm has hired more than 50 new employees including key executive and management positions. Notably, more than 90% of the 250 field-based sales staff employed before 2014 are no longer with the firm, he said.""Over the past several years, Insys has actively taken the appropriate steps to place ethical standards of conduct and patient interests at the heart of our business decisions,"" he wrote in the letter to McCaskill.The compliance program has been under significant scrutiny by government authorities and as a result of internal reviews conducted with external experts and counsel. Insys also invested resources to create an effective compliance program to ensure compliant and ethical behavior.Insys also recently completed a successful gap assessment into compliance protocols and processes by an independent, global consulting firm, Motahari wrote in the September letter. The assessment was voluntary.Motahari noted Insys' drugs address unmet need for patients requiring supportive or palliative care in their battles with cancer or AIDS. According to a 2016 report from the Drug Enforcement Administration, pharmaceutical fentanyl is diverted for abuse in the U.S. at small levels, he wrote.""Recent overdose deaths from fentanyl are 'largely due to clandestinely-produced fentanyl, not diverted pharmaceutical fentanyl,'"" according to the DEA report cited by Motahari.Insys didn't immediately return a request for comment from Investor's Business Daily.RELATED:How Electricity Could Replace Opioids In Treating Chronic PainFDA Chief Gottlieb Address Opioids, Cancer, New TherapiesIs Big Pharma Addicted To Opioid Painkillers?

101,MO,"Wise advisors don't try to time the market. They know better than to guess how stocks will move in the days and weeks ahead.XBut that doesn't stop them from predicting the future.Farsighted advisors look beyond their workaday lives to envision how their business might change over time. They keep one eye on their daily responsibilities — preparing for client meetings, managing their team — while pondering how new products, consumer trends and evolving technologies will affect their practice for decades to come.""To think that you can continue with your same business model for the next generation, that's a fallacy,"" said Richard Brownstein, a certified financial planner in Fairfield, N.J. He urges advisors to embrace technology and anticipate the needs of tomorrow's investors.IBD'S TAKE: Do your clients expect you to know more about the stock market than just what the Dow did today? If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.Brownstein hears pundits discuss the transfer of wealth from baby boomers to their adult children. But he rejects the idea that advisors can survive solely as asset managers for the rising generation.""If your value proposition is you can manage assets better than the other guys, you'll be out of business in five years,"" he declared. ""The next generation of investors is so computer-savvy, and the bots will get so good, that the asset management world will become commoditized.""To prepare for this new world, Brownstein took an online course in 2016 offered by MIT on emerging trends in financial technology (also known as ""fintech""). It proved an eye-opener.The 12-week ""Future Commerce"" class heightened Brownstein's awareness of what he calls ""the soft issues"" that advisors need to address to deepen their client relationships. Examples include long-term-care planning, insurance expertise and estate planning.Brownstein foresees advances in fintech reshaping retirement planning. While annuities are popular today, he thinks a different product — called tontines — will soon gain traction.Tontines consist of a group of participants who pay into an investment pool run by an issuer that provides a designated amount every year to all the members as long as they live. When one of the participants dies, the surviving members receive higher payouts.For Brownstein, the true benefit of tontines flows from the convergence of artificial intelligence and fintech. He predicts that tontines will thrive as issuers adopt blockchains — verifiable, ever-growing digital records of transactions — along with peer-to-peer ""smart contracts"" that bypass traditional providers of financial services.""Tontines will be an important part of creating income streams without intermediaries like legacy insurance companies with their brick-and-mortar structure,"" he said. ""Tontines will help people better than annuities do today. With tontines, the risk is borne by the pool of investors, not an insurance company. Because of the blockchain, that pool is very transparent. And you have the potential for lower costs because the management of all required information and the distribution of funds can be implemented through self-executing smart contracts.""Seeing the future requires diligent research. Advisors must resist getting mired in their day-to-day business so that they step back and ponder their industry from a lofty perch.""You have to set aside dedicated time to work on the business, not in the business,"" said Chris Kerckhoff, a certified financial planner and president of Plancorp in St. Louis, Mo.To crane his neck into the future, Kerckhoff tracks authors and speakers with compelling messages about how businesses need to change. For example, he watched Salim Ismail's presentation on how ""exponential organizations"" harness technologies to spur growth.For over 20 years, Kerckhoff's firm has participated in Zero Alpha Group, a professional support network of wealth management providers. The eight firms in the national network share business ideas and help each other strategize for the future.In addition, Kerckhoff huddles with five Plancorp colleagues on a quarterly basis for a full-day discussion of their firm's direction. Every three or four years, Kerckhoff says they hire a facilitator ""to help us visualize the future on a long-term basis.""""We're looking at what we can do in the next one to two years to set us up for the long term,"" he said. ""The focus is on our clients. Who are they today and who will they be? And how can we support them now and in the future?""Like Brownstein, Kerckhoff envisions the advisor's role as evolving to serve younger clients with a wider set of needs than simply asset management. They will pepper their advisor with questions ranging from paying off debt to spending on vacations.""Tomorrow's clients, especially younger clients, will want feedback on their entire financial life,"" Kerckhoff said. ""They'll want a game plan. That means we need to be more responsive and offer an engaging digital platform with more real-time interactive"" features.RELATED:Clients' High-End Hobbies Can Stymie AdvisorsIs The Stock Market Up Or Down?

102,MO,"Taxes: Is the GOP getting serious about tax reform at last? Republicans in Congress say they'll unveil the outlines of a consensus plan in two weeks, as President Trump hits the hustings to stump for tax reform. We hope this isn't another false start.""Reform"" is one of those words that sounds easy, but really isn't. Every political interest group has a dog in the fight, and no one wants to give up a cherished deduction. And few politicians want to be seen as cutting taxes on Americans in the top income brackets or corporations, a sure way to be accused of ""tax cuts for the rich,"" as the progressives' anti-tax-cut mantra goes.Still, it seems as if both Congress and the president are aware that time is running out, and that next year — a midterm election year for Congress — doing anything bold or smart might not be politically possible. The political window is still open, but it might shut soon.A poll released Thursday by the pro-tax reform Club for Growth, conducted by Fabrizio, Lee and Associates, put it bluntly: ""If Republicans fail to pass tax reform, the situation will be bleak. Nearly 1 in 5 will oppose members if they do not pass tax cuts. Another 25% of Republican voters will not support either party — meaning they will likely not vote at all.""For a party desperate to maintain control of both houses of Congress, this is not good news. Our own IBD/TIPP polling shows that Americans overwhelmingly blame Congress, not President Trump, for Washington's current gridlock by nearly 3-to-1. Since Republicans are in control, that should be a warning both to the party's leaders and its followers.That's why we're heartened to know that the GOP is taking seriously the need for tax reform, which holds the key to future economic growth, jobs and higher wages.Trump on Wednesday said he'd like to see the corporate tax rate cut sharply from the current level of around 39% to 15%, in a bid to boost U.S. tax competitiveness. As we've mentioned numerous times, among major economies, U.S. corporations face the highest marginal tax rate in the world. It's time to end that bit of foolishness.""The rich will not be gaining at all with this plan,"" Trump said, in what sure looked like a sop to the Democrats. ""We're looking for the middle class, and we're looking for jobs. Jobs, meaning companies.""We're fine with much of what Trump vows, but we hope that he doesn't mean to exclude the upper incomes from tax cuts. If their taxes aren't cut, it will mean the tax code will be more progressive, not less. For tax reform to mean anything, it should lead to lower, flatter, fairer taxes for everyone, with fewer deductions and a broader base.Still, Trump is right about one thing: Tax reform is really about growth, not about redistribution. It's absurd to suggest we can only cut taxes on the middle class and the poor, since the top 10% of all incomes pay over 70% of all the taxes.""If we achieve sustained 3% growth,"" Trump said two weeks ago in Springfield, Mo., ""that means 12 million new jobs and $10 trillion of new economic activity over the next decade.""This should be the bottom line. When Democrats talk about ""neutrality,"" they're always seeking offsets for tax cuts by hiking taxes elsewhere. But that shouldn't be anyone's focus. If you really want to ""offset"" tax cuts, do it by reducing spending. Getting rid of the $1 trillion-plus albatross that is ObamaCare would be a great start.What will the GOP come up with? There are plenty of pretty specific proposals out there for reducing tax burdens on Americans. Corporate tax cuts. Individual tax cuts for all. Eliminating the death tax and the grossly unfair alternative minimum tax. Reducing taxes on capital and dividends. Tax reductions for small businesses and immediate expensing of investments. They could also slash taxes on repatriated capital that's now held in overseas accounts by American firms that don't want to be punished by high U.S. taxes. If only half the $2.5 trillion or so of the money now sitting in overseas accounts returned, it would fuel hundreds of billions of dollars in new investments and tax revenue.The point is, there is no shortage of ideas. It's time to get busy. Sure, we could nitpick, but no tax reform will ever be perfect. And the American people expect reform, GOP. You'd better give it to them.RELATED:Like A Zombie, Tax Reform Refuses To Die  IBD: How To Invest In Stocks

103,MO,"Tax Reform: It's been clear from our economy's near-decade of underperformance that the U.S. is badly in need of a fiscal shot in the arm in the form of tax reform and tax cuts. After his speech to factory workers in Springfield, Mo., on Wednesday, President Trump has made it clear he expects Congress to do something big.XCalling on Congress not to miss a ""once-in-a-generation opportunity,"" Trump pushed for a massive tax overhaul that, he promised, would cut loopholes and simplify the tax code from its current labyrinthine complexity into one that is ""simple, fair and easy to understand.""""It's time to give American workers the pay raise that they've been looking for, for many, many years,"" he said.He stressed that corporate tax cuts are absolutely necessary to make the U.S. more competitive when it comes to being a place where things are made. The U.S. corporate tax rate of 35% is way higher than the OECD average of about 24%. Not only does that impede investment here in the U.S., but it encourages companies to take profits and hold the cash overseas to reduce their tax bills. As a result, U.S. firms by government estimates now hold roughly $2.6 trillion in funds overseas. Even getting a part of that massive cash pile to return to the U.S. in the form of investment could have a significant impact on jobs and wages, estimates show.""Ideally, and I say this to our Secretary of the Treasury, we would like to bring our business tax rate down to 15%,"" Trump said.As we've noted here before, National Economic Council chief Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have been meeting feverishly with leaders in Congress to hammer out a plan. That may be the reason why Trump, in his speech, didn't provide a great deal of detail. But it's important that the American people and Congress now know that Trump is engaged and that this is a priority for him.But the promise of a flatter, fairer tax code that delivers relief to both middle-class Americans and to corporations has already seemed to buck up the lackluster economy that Trump inherited. Under President Obama, as has been noted, the economy's growth averaged just 2% or so. That's not enough to create jobs for the millions of people who have been sidelined since the Great Recession of 2007-2008.While the economy's not out of the woods yet, in recent months it has perked up, largely in anticipation of tax reform and repeal of ObamaCare. Getting rid of the ObamaCare albatross might not be politically doable this year; but tax reform definitely is.Consumers, financial markets and companies know this. That may be why GDP for the second quarter was revised up on Wednesday to an annual rate of 3%, the best performance in over two years, while payroll giant ADP estimated that 237,000 new private jobs were created during August. To top it off, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow figure, which estimates current GDP growth weekly, well before government figures emerge, sees 3.4% GDP growth in the third quarter.The economy is primed and ready to grow. All it needs is a spark, and tax reform would provide just that.Yet, even before Trump spoke, the usual suspects were at it again, savaging the notion that U.S. corporations needed any tax cuts at all. Both the New York Times and the Washington Post, arguably still our newspapers of record, questioned whether tax cuts create jobs.Well, the record is so clear on that. Every major tax reform that included tax cuts has been followed by a period of strong growth for jobs and the economy. There's no reason to believe this time will be any different. A 2015 Tax Foundation study estimated that cutting the corporate tax rate to 15% would boost GDP by 3.7% over 10 years.More importantly, it would have a major impact on jobs, the study said. ""The increase in investment from a corporate tax rate cut would lead to higher wages, more jobs, and a larger economy,"" wrote economist Andrew Lundeen.As for the idea that tax cuts ""cost the government,"" the government doesn't pay taxes. You do. But guess what? A boost in economic growth from 2% to 3% would raise tax revenues by as much as $3 trillion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office, while also reducing debt as a percentage of GDP.So, contrary to what the economic gloomniks say, tax reform is both fiscally responsible and a job creator.But there will almost certainly be a big battle over this, with Democrats once again arguing that anything that simplifies and lowers taxes is really a ""giveaway to the rich.""Well, tax reform can be popular, if it's truthfully sold to the American people. When our IBD/TIPP Poll asked voters about tax reforms last May, some 55% said they supported cutting the business rate to 15%, while 66% supported tax cuts for families. Another 75% supported slashing taxes on repatriated profits from overseas, to get companies to reinvest that money in the U.S.""Put the partisan posturing behind us and come together as Americans, to create the 21st century tax code that our people deserve,"" Trump said. ""What could possibly be more bipartisan than helping people keep more of what they earn?""Average Americans know this is a big chance to get the economy moving again. Trump is now showing he's on board and making this a priority. If Congress is smart, as Trump suggested, it won't let this chance go by.RELATED:Never Mind The Gimmicks, We Need Real Tax Reform The Big Three Tax Cut Lies That Democrats Keep Telling When It Comes To Tax Reform, Keep It Simple, Stupid For Market Lists To Help You Invest Your Savings

104,MO,"Income Taxes: With President Trump turning his attention to tax reform, Democrats are busy dusting off their shopworn claims about federal income taxes. Almost nothing they say about taxes is true.Trump plans to make a pitch for tax reform on Wednesday at an event in Springfield, Mo. He will likely explain that tax cuts are the key to a bigger economy, more jobs and increased incomes. Pundits are busy explaining that getting tax reform done this year won't be easy. True enough. But it will be made more difficult because of misinformation spread by Democrats and their allies in the press about the U.S. tax code.Here are the three big lies:Bush tax cuts didn't work. ""The American people,"" says Winnie Stachelberg of the Center for American Progress, ""know from experience under the Bush era that tax cuts for millionaires and corporations will not benefit the U.S. economy, jobs, or the middle class."" They also supposedly boosted the deficit.Democrats have been peddling this lie for so long that no amount of hard data will likely stop them. But here goes, anyway.Federal deficits steadily declined after Bush signed the 2003 tax law, which retroactively cut income tax rates — the deficits dropped from $470 billion in 2004 to $167 billion by 2007.The economy perked up, with GDP jumping 6.9% in Q3 2003 and 4.8% in Q4. In the six quarters after Bush signed those tax cuts, average quarterly GPD growth topped 4%, compared with 2.1% in the previous six quarters. Anyone want to guess how Obama's tax hikes affected GDP growth?By the end of 2007, the unemployment rate had dropped to 4.7% — down from 6.1% when Bush signed the 2003 tax cuts into law. Median household income climbed 3%. Income inequality, meanwhile, didn't change at all.It was the financial crisis — which, as we have repeatedly shown in this space, was caused by misguided federal policies first enacted under President Clinton — that erased these gains.The rich don't pay their fair share. ""The last thing we need is for the tax code to be even more rigged in favor of millionaires, billionaires, and corporate insiders,"" claims the organizers of Not One Penny, a liberal coalition that includes the George Soros-backed MoveOn.org.If by ""rigged"" liberals mean a tax code under which the top 1% pay 39% of federal income taxes — which is up from 33% in 2001 — and that U.S. the most progressive in the industrialized world, then we'd agree. But the idea that the ""rich don't pay their fair share"" is utterly false.In fact, one reason tax cuts always seem to benefit the rich more than the middle class is precisely because the tax code is so heavily skewed toward the wealthy. According to the IRS, the bottom 50% of taxpayers account for less than 3% of federal income taxes paid.As for corporate taxes, the U.S. imposes the highest corporate income tax rate of any industrialized nation — up to 40% when federal and state taxes are combined. Yet it has one of the lowest collection rates as a share of GDP. Why? Because the code is riddled with loopholes that benefit ""corporate insiders.""The GOP plan is to cut the tax rate, close loopholes and simplify the code. The only losers will be companies that on political connections and gimmicks to lower their tax burden.Tax reform must be 'revenue neutral'. ""At a bare minimum, tax reform should not lose revenues,"" declares the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.What they and other Democrats mean by this is that any tax cuts must be offset by tax hikes somewhere else, and that no account can be made of the growth effect of tax cuts.But the idea the tax reform must be revenue neutral is based on a myth that taxes are at an acceptable level today. The fact is, they are historically high. As it stands, taxes as share of GDP will be 18% this year, which is well above the 17.2% average since World War II.The reason the federal government is running deficits is because spending will equal 21% of GDP this year, which is also well above the post-War average.Clearly, then, the country doesn't have a tax problem, it has a spending problem, which means that both taxes and spending should be cut. And, since tax cuts will boost economic growth, at least some of the revenue ""lost"" to tax cuts will be regained from an expanded economy.One final point worth keeping in mind. The mainstream media won't correct any of these lies, despite their supposed role as guardians against ""fake news.""RELATED:Sorry, Hillary, You And Bill — Not Tax Cuts — Caused The Financial CrisisHuffington Post Accidentally Destroys The Left's Entire 'Tax Fairness' ArgumentBest-Run States Are Low-Tax Republican, Worst-Run Are High-Tax Democratic, Study Finds

106,MO,"Tobacco companies such as Altria Group (MO) and British American Tobacco (BTI) plunged Friday after the Food and Drug Adminstration outlined a comprehensive regulatory plan that includes lowering nicotine in cigarettes to non-addictive levels.XThat could pose a fundamental challenge to the cigarette industry, which has survived massive settlements and steadily declining volume sales.Shares of Altria, maker of Marlboro, Virginia Slims and Parliament brands, crashed 9.5% to 66.94 after falling as low as 60.01, a 15-month low. British American Tobacco, which recently bought out the rest of Reynolds American, dived 7% to 64.93, falling intraday to 60.15, its lowest level since January.However, one cigarette maker fared reasonably well. Peer Philip Morris International (PM), which sells Marlboro and other brands outside the U.S., rose 0.3% to 118.51 on the stock market today, rebounding from session lows for 109.31. Philip Morris presumably would not be directly affected by FDA rulings on cigarette sales in the U.S.Vector Group (VGR) lost 4.7% and Universal Corp. (UVV) dipped 0.85%.""The overwhelming amount of death and disease attributable to tobacco is caused by addiction to cigarettes -- the only legal consumer product that, when used as intended, will kill half of all long-term users,"" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement from the agency.""The FDA plans to begin a public dialogue about lowering nicotine levels in combustible cigarettes to non-addictive levels through achievable product standards,"" the agency said.The FDA gained regulatory powers over the tobacco industry in 2009.Altria, Philip Morris and British American Tobacco are big dividend payers, so their stocks have been favorites for income investors for decades. Phillip Morris International has a 3.5% dividend yield, with Altria at 3.3%. British American has a 3.2% dividend yield.Cigarette makers are already dealing with steadily declining volumes in the U.S., offsetting that with higher prices. But non-addictive cigarettes would be a huge blow to the industry.RELATED:Phillip Morris Misses On Earnings, Slashes GuidanceThe Income Investor

Northrop Grumman (NOC), General Dynamics (GD) and Raytheon (RTN) also raised their full-year earnings outlooks after reporting Q2 earnings results above estimates. Northrop said its aerospace-system sales climbed on higher manned-aircraft demand, including work on its E-2D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft. Raytheon saw higher air-defense missile and smart bomb sales and General Dynamics' revenue got support from strong Gulfstream and defense-product demand.Boeing shares soared 14% for the week.

Cigarettes, But One Tobacco Giant Is Holding UpThe Federal Reserve kept to Wall Street's preferred script on Wednesday, leaving its key interest rate unchanged and putting off an announcement that it will begin unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet.The Fed's patience comes as the economy is performing pretty well, with real GDP growing at a 2.6% pace in the second quarter, but inflation and wage gains have been more muted than expected. The combination has been good for the stock market, partly because the prospect of low interest rates has weighed on the dollar, which could be a boon to the earnings of U.S. multinationals in the second half of this year.The decision by the Fed to wait until September to announce a shift in its reinvestment policy — a gradual pullback from its current stance of reinvesting all principal from its maturing mortgage and Treasury bond portfolio — also sent a signal that policymakers aren't overly concerned that financial markets are too exuberant.The next interest-rate hike is expected in December. The real uncertainty, hinging on the inflation outlook, is what Fed policy will look like in 2018.A flurry of chip-industry players posted beat-and-raise June-quarter results including chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Cypress Semiconductor (CY), Intel (INTC) and Texas Instruments (TXN), as well as chip-gear suppliers Lam Research (LRCX) and Teradyne (TER).AMD earned an adjusted 2 cents a share on sales of $1.22 billion in Q2, when analysts expected it to break even on sales $1.16 billion. In the current quarter, AMD forecasts sales to rise 15%, vs. Wall Street's target of 6%.Cypress earned 21 cents a share ex items on sales of $594 million in Q2, vs. estimates of 16 cents and $547 million.

For Q3, Intel forecast adjusted earnings of 80 cents a share on sales of $15.7 billion, when analysts were looking for 74 cents and $15.32 billion.TI earned $1.03 a share ex items on sales of $3.69 billion in the June quarter, vs. analyst expectations for 96 cents and $3.57 billion. For the current quarter, TI expects to earn $1.11 a share on sales of $3.9 billion, vs. Wall Street's targets of $1.05 and $3.8 billion.Lam earned an adjusted $3.11 a share on sales of $2.34 billion in the June quarter.

U.S. crude inventories tumbled by 7.2 million barrels and domestic production dipped. Some energy companies trimmed capital-spending plans after months of sub-$50 oil. Halliburton (HAL) warned that it sees U.S. exploration and production companies ""tapping the brakes"" and U.S. rig counts plateauing. Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) earnings missed.General Motors (GM) reported that adjusted profits grew 1.6% to $1.89, beating views for $1.72, while revenue dropped 12.7% to $37 billion, below views for $40.2 billion. GM reaffirmed full-year EPS guidance but will cut second-half production amid swelling inventories and falling U.S. industry sales. Ford Motor (F) topped views and raised guidance, but largely on lower tax rates. GM fell further below a buy point while Ford fell back toward multiyear lows. But Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) held above a buy point after adjusted EPS swelled 49% though sales fell short.

Merck rose 3% on Thursday. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), which has had several setbacks for its I-O drug Opdivo, slid 3% on concerns that the Mystic failure bodes ill for a similar Opdivo-combo study.Wall Street soured on casino players like MGM Resorts International (MGM), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO) as the sector overall put up mixed results and guidance. Concerns about mass-market gaming in Macau weighed on Wynn, whose Q2 results nonetheless beat estimates. MGM offered a weak revenue-per-available-room outlook. It also cited ""higher-than-anticipated disruption"" at the Monte Carlo, which is being revamped into Park MGM, and a ""challenging comparison"" on the Las Vegas Strip in Q3. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) topped; results from Melco and U.S.-focused Boyd Gaming (BYD) and Penn National Gaming (PENN) were mixed.Shares in AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) soared after the telecoms reported better-than-expected wireless results amid stiff competition.

Domino's Pizza (DPZ) crashed in part on disappointing Q2 international comps, lower margins, an EPS helped by the tax rate and an already-high stock valuation. Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled after fiscal-Q3 same-store sales and revenue missed; EPS matched views. The coffee chain said it would close all 379 Teavana retail stores.Several industrial Dow giants rolled past Q2 estimates Tuesday thanks in part to improved global growth.

United Technologies (UTX) saw earnings climb 1.6% to $1.85 per share on a 2.7% revenue rise to $15.28 billion. Shares tumbled to their lowest level since May despite raised full-year EPS and revenue guidance. DuPont (DD) also beat on the top and bottom lines. Their Dow peer 3M (MMM) was an outlier with an overall miss, and shares tanked.Proofpoint (PFPT) reported Q2 profit and revenue that topped expectations and forecast current quarter sales and earnings just above consensus estimates. Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Proofpoint specializes in email and data-loss protection for corporate networks and cloud-computing infrastructure. Proofpoint rose modestly Friday morning. Fortinet (FTNT) posted mixed Q2 results that beat on EPS and revenue, but billings growth disappointed. The outlook for providers of computer-security software has yet to improve despite recent  ransomware attacks. Fortinet shares tumbled.TAL Education (TAL) topped earnings and sales estimates, as per-share profit of 43 cents and revenue of $321.9 million came out ahead of forecasts for 28 cents and $307.8 million.

Meanwhile, peer New Oriental Education (EDU) also pulled ahead of forecasts with 41 cents EPS and $486.4 million, in addition to a 36.9% bump in total student enrollments; the midpoint of Q1 revenue guidance pulled just ahead of current views. TAL and New Oriental shares rose 4.8% and 0.9%, respectively,  but the latter's breakout failed Thursday.Mastercard (MA) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and revenue.

109,MO,"Southern Gothic is a literary genre and, occasionally, a political style that, like the genre, blends strangeness and irony. Consider the current primary campaign to pick the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions. It illuminates, however, not a regional peculiarity but a national perversity, that of the Republican Party.In 1985, Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III — the name belongs in a steamy bodice-ripper, beach-read novel about Confederate cavalry — was nominated for a federal judgeship. Democrats blocked him because they considered him racially ""insensitive."" In 1996, he got even by getting elected to the Senate. Twenty years later, he was the first senator to endorse Donald Trump, who carried Alabama by 27.7 points. Sessions, the most beloved Alabaman who is not a football coach, became attorney general for Trump, who soon began denouncing Sessions as ""beleaguered,"" which Sessions was because Trump was ridiculing him as ""weak"" because he followed Justice Department policy in recusing himself from the investigation of Russian involvement in Trump's election.On Aug. 15, Alabama's bewildered and conflicted Republicans will begin picking a Senate nominee. (If no one achieves 50%, there will be a Sept. 26 runoff between the top two.) Of the nine candidates, only three matter — Luther Strange, Roy Moore and Rep. Mo Brooks.Strange was Alabama's attorney general until he was appointed by then-Gov. Robert Bentley to Sessions' seat. Bentley subsequently resigned in the wake of several scandals that Strange's office was investigating — or so Strange's successor as attorney general suggests — when Bentley appointed him. The state Ethics Commission, which had scheduled an Aug. 2 hearing into charges of campaign finance violations by Strange, recently postponed the hearing until Aug. 16, the day after the first round of voting.Twice Roy Moore has been removed as chief justice of the state Supreme Court. In 2003, removal was for defiance of the U.S. Supreme Court regarding religious displays in government buildings. Re-elected, he was suspended last year for defiance of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision regarding same-sex marriages.Yet Brooks is the focus of ferocious attacks on behalf of Strange, who ignores Moore. The attacks are financed by a Washington-based PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. This Washington Republican establishment strenuously tried but fortunately failed to defeat now-Sens. Marco Rubio and Ben Sasse, of Florida and Nebraska respectively, in their 2010 and 2014 primaries. (The Rubio opponent the PAC favored is now a Democratic congressman.) The attacks stress some anti-Trump statements Brooks made while chairman of Ted Cruz's 2016 Alabama campaign. For example, Brooks criticized Trump's ""serial adultery,"" about which Trump has boasted. The PAC identifies Brooks, a conservative stalwart of the House Freedom Caucus, as an ally of Nancy Pelosi and Elizabeth Warren. Another ad uses Brooks' support for Congress replacing the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force with an updated one, and his opposition to interventions in Libya and Syria, to suggest that Brooks supports the Islamic State.Brooks contributed financially to Trump's general-election effort, and has named his campaign bus the ""Drain the Swamp Express."" He says he supports Trump's ""agenda,"" including potentially its most consequential item — ending Senate filibuster rules that enable 41 senators to stymie 59. Strange sides with McConnell against Trump in supporting current rules. Yet the PAC's theme is that Brooks' support of Trump is insufficiently ardent. Such ardor is becoming the party's sovereign litmus test.In one recent poll, the three candidates are polling in the 20s. Moore is leading; the PAC's attacks are driving some Brooks voters to Moore. Among voters who say they are familiar with all three, Strange is third. A runoff seems certain, and if Moore (sometimes called ""the Ayatollah of Alabama"") is in it and wins, a Democrat could win the Dec. 12 general election.""Anything that comes out of the South,"" said writer Flannery O'Connor, a sometime exemplar of Southern Gothic, ""is going to be called grotesque by the Northern reader, unless it is grotesque, in which case it is going to be called realistic."" But, realistically, Alabama's primary says more about Republicans than about this region. A Michigan poll shows rocker-cum-rapper Kid Rock a strong potential Republican Senate candidate against incumbent Debbie Stabenow. Rock says Democrats are ""shattin' in their pantaloons"" because if he runs it will be ""game on mthrfkrs.""Is this Northern Gothic? No, it is Republican Gothic, the grotesque becoming normal in a national party whose dishonest and, one hopes, futile assault on Brooks is shredding the remnants of its dignity.

Two ETFs with big weightings in PayPal (PYPL) and Apple (AAPL) are poised near buy points.First Trust US Equity Opportunities (FPX) is pulling back near its 50-day moving average, after marking a record high last week. It gained about 3% from an early July bounce off the support line to the peak.The fund tracks the IPOX-100 U.S. Index, which is a market-cap-weighted index of the 100 biggest and most liquid U.S. initial public offerings. The index sets a 10% cap on weightings in all constituents and is reconstituted quarterly.FPX, which turned 11 in April, has gathered $858.2 million in assets. Its biggest sector weightings as of Aug. 1 were technology, at about 21%, health care at 19% and consumer defensive at 15%.

The top five holdings accounted for nearly 33% of assets.The fund outperformed the S&P 500 with a 12.8% vs. 11.9% gain through Aug. 1, according to Morningstar Inc. It lagged the benchmark index over the past three years but has outpaced the S&P 500 on a five- and 10-year basis. FPX has a 0.60% expense ratio.IShares Edge MSCI U.S. Quality Factor (QUAL), which gained 2% from a June 1 breakout past a 74.39 buy point to a June 19 peak, is testing support at its 50-day line for the second time since the breakout.A solid rebound off the line could set up a buy opportunity. The $3.5 billion fund, which marked its fourth anniversary last month, trails the S&P 500 this year with a 10.2% gain. Its three-year average annual return of 11.4% is just ahead of the benchmark index's 11.1% advance.QUAL, featured in this column June 1, counted among its top holdings as of Monday: Altria Group (MO), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). Apple leapt 5% Tuesday on the heels of its quarterly earnings report.

112,MO,"The stock market remained rattled from the prior day's technology-sector tumble, but damage was minimal, as earnings reports influenced much of Friday's action.The Dow Jones industrial average was trying to stay afloat, trading flat in afternoon dealings. The Dow's two oil companies served as bookends, with Chevron (CVX) leading the average and Exxon Mobil (XOM) down the most, sinking to a February 2016 low.XBoth companies reported earnings this morning. Exxon's Q2 earnings jumped 90% to 78 cents a share, but missed estimates of 83 cents, according to Zacks Investment Research. Sales rose 9% to $62.88 billion, topping views for $61.16 billion.

118,MO,"Consumers interested in smartwatches like the Apple Watch are overwhelmingly male and much more likely to talk about topics important to the gay community.Those are a couple of findings in a new report from analytics firm Infegy. The Kansas City, Mo.-based company studied social media conversations from April through September to better understand users of smartphones and fitness bands.More than 18 million consumers talked online about smartwatches and fitness bands from Q1 through Q3, Infegy said.Apple's (AAPL) Apple Watch was far and away the most talked-about smartwatch during that period, commanding 86% of mentions in social media, Infegy said.Fitbit (FIT) was the most discussed maker of activity trackers on social media during the first three quarters of the year. The Fitbit brand accounted for 86% of discussions about fitness bands on social media from Q1 through Q3, Infegy said.Smartwatch discussions in social media are dominated by men (89%), while fitness band discussions are ruled by women (54%).Infegy also tracked consumer interests by device type. It found that consumers who talk about smartwatches on social media are 6.6 times more likely than the general population to also talk about topics related to the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community.Consumers who talk about smartwatches on social media also are 4.3 times more likely than the general population to discuss comedy and 3.5 times more likely to talk about owning a dog.Not surprising, fitness band owners are way more likely to discuss exercise, running, bodybuilding and weight loss than the general population, the study showed. They also are 5.5 times more likely to discuss personal finance and stocks in social media.RELATED:Fitbit's not-so-secret weapon: WomenApple Watch has a female problem.

119,MO,"Ford said Monday its recently ratified collective-bargaining agreement with the United Auto Workers will increase labor costs less than the rate of inflation, putting it on a more even footing with Big Three rivals General Motors and Fiat Chrysler Automobile.The No. 2 U.S. automaker said labor costs will rise by less than 1.5% a year over the four-year period under the accord ratified by the workers on Nov. 20.The company said that's less than its projection for inflation over that period, though it didn't specify its estimate.While Ford (F) will take a $600 million charge related to the contract this quarter, mainly to pay for a $500-per-employee ratification bonus, other provisions may ease cost pressures.Terms of the new four-year union agreement, which covers 53,000 union workers, include an end to a cap on entry-level employees, letting Ford hire more employees at a lower salary and cut costs. Improved ability to use temporary workers and use of alternative work schedules may also cut overtime costs.Ford shares dropped 1.4%.CEO Mark Fields said in a conference call that ""the agreement effectively closes our labor-cost gap to GM (GM) and substantially narrows the gap to FCA (Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU).""Ford said it can now steer toward investing $9 billion in its U.S. plants, which are expected to ""create or secure"" 8,500 jobs nationally as it ramps up production of the Ford Super Duty and F-150 pickups and the revamped Lincoln Continental, among other models.Ford was the last of the Big Three to ink new labor contracts, which also call for eliminating in eight years the two-tier wage system. That arrangement holds new hires to lower pay scales and had boosted U.S. automakers' competitiveness against foreign rivals.Ahead of the contract ratifications, U.S. companies ramped up plans for production abroad, which drew sharp criticism from the UAW.In April, Ford announced it was investing $2.5 billion in new engine and transmission plants in the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato, respectively, creating about 3,800 direct jobs there.General Motors earlier this year also laid out plans to spend $5 billion on new plants and upgrades in Mexico. And the Wall Street Journal reported in November that GM plans to begin selling China-made Buicks, a popular car there, in the U.S. early next year.Toyota (TM), Volkswagen (VLKAY) and others have also turned to Mexico mainly to build small cars, which are more popular in South America, Europe and Asia than in the U.S., for export to those regions.

120,MO,"Top-rated Dycom Industries (DY) got a big price-target hike Friday from investment bank FBR, which sees ""accelerating opportunities"" for the installer of underground fiber and provider of other specialty contracting services to telecom, cable and other broadband providers in the U.S. and Canada.FBR analysts Alex Rygiel and Min Cho hiked their price target on Dycom stock to 100 from 88 after the company late Tuesday posted better-than-expected earnings and sales for its its fiscal Q1 ended Oct. 24 and gave what the analysts called a ""strong outlook.""""Dycom remains a leading beneficiary of increased 1 gbps (1 gigabit per second fiber broadband) spending by major telcos, cable operators and new entrants to enhance their wireline networks for higher bandwidth speeds,"" the analysts wrote in a research report.Dycom stock was up a fraction in early trading in the stock market today, the historically slow Black Friday trading day.Dycom stock was trading near 87 early Friday after touching a record high Tuesday of 90.82. Shares are up nearly 150% this year, and it has been No. 1 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks since late September. Dycom stock remains just a bit extended from an 80.95 buy point, touched on Nov. 3.In their report, the FBR analysts note ""accelerating opportunities with new entrants such as Google,"" but they do not call Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google a Dycom customer.In its quarterly filing, Dycom names its top eight customers except for the customer that accounted for the fifth highest percentage of revenue in Q1, 8.5%. Its top four customers, in order, were AT&T (T), CenturyLink (CTL), Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon Communications (VZ).Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.-based Dycom didn't immediately respond to a question asking about its unnamed major customer. Since 2012, Google Fiber has been deploying high-speed broadband to a number of markets, including Provo, Utah; Kansas City, Kan.; and Kansas City, Mo. Six other markets are in the works, including Atlanta and Salt Lake City, and nine other markets have been identified as possible future targets.Among other catalysts, FBR points to pending opportunities in CAF II spending. The Federal Communications Commission-administered Connect America Fund calls for $1.68 billion in spending per year for six years to deliver broadband Internet to rural markets.Dycom's ""valuation is high relative to other contractors, yet reasonable, given company-specific growth potential,"" the FBR analysts wrote.Follow Mike Krey on Twitter @IBD_MKrey and on Facebook .

After falling asleep repeatedly at night school, he never returned.By the 1930s, the family had moved to California. Dad drove trucks for a firm that went bankrupt. The Slyes went north to pick peaches and lived in a labor camp.Soon young Len was in Los Angeles, playing at parties.He was so entertaining, his sister Mary suggested that he audition for a radio contest. He didn't win, but a few days later the leader of a band, the Rocky Mountaineers, invited him to join.Over the next couple of years, he changed groups until he co-founded Sons of the Pioneers. By 1934, they were a national item via syndicated radio segments.They made their first record that year; one of their first songs was ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds,"" an enduring hit.""Tom Spencer and Bob Nolan were genius songwriters, but Roy was the driving force, and it was his sense of purpose and discipline that moved their career forward,"" Michael Sheehy, a producer of CDs for the Rogers family, told IBD.Throughout his career, Roy used the Sons in films, TV and radio, as well as on promotional tours.His first solo hit was ""A Little White Cross on the Hill,"" which reached No. 7 on the Billboard Country Music chart in 1946.The next year, he reached his career high at No. 4 with ""My Chickashay Gal.""Len began shifting to a career in movies. ""Slightly Static"" was his first picture in 1935; 104 would follow.He rode Trigger for the first time in ""Under Western Stars"" and eventually bought the palomino for $2,500 (worth $34,000 now).He was soon a competitor with Gene Autry for the title of America's favorite singing cowboy. Unlike most stars, each usually played a character using his own name.Rogers' first marriage was to Lucile Ascolese in 1933.He married Arlene Wilkins in 1936, and they adopted Cheryl.Arlene gave birth to Linda in 1943 and three years later to Roy Jr., nicknamed Dusty. But Arlene died of a brain embolism shortly thereafter.The Roy-Dale TeamIn 1947, Rogers wed his co-star Evans, who had a son, Tom, from a prior marriage.In 1950 she gave birth to a daughter, Robin, with Down syndrome, who died before her second birthday. Evans wrote about the experience and their Christian faith in the book ""Angel Unaware."" They adopted several more children and became advocates for adoption.In the Motion Picture Herald's ""Top 10 Money-Making Western Stars,"" Rogers held first place from 1943 to 1954, thanks to smash hits such as ""Sunset in El Dorado,"" ""Eyes of Texas"" and ""Spoilers of the Plains.""In 1952 he appeared with Bob Hope and Jane Russell in ""Son of Paleface,"" the comedy Western sequel to ""The Paleface."" It was not only a hit in America but also the No. 1 movie in Britain that year. And Rogers' prior flicks continued to do well at the box office as he focused on TV.""The Roy Rogers Show"" broadcast 100 episodes on NBC from 1951 to 1957 and has been in reruns on other networks ever since.Like most Western films of the time, the show featured traditional cowboy culture in modern settings. Trigger became a star in his own right, with the camera following him on solo adventures.The program was nominated for an Emmy in 1955. Its theme song, ""Happy Trails,"" written by Evans and sung by Evans and Rogers over the end credits, lives on as their signature tune.The pair traveled the country to promote their films and TV programs with live shows, using trains to transport their horses. When they had time, they visited burn wards of children's hospitals.Upbeat Aim""Roy was always an incredibly hard worker, and he had to learn everything from yodeling to sharpshooting from scratch and stuck with each skill until he had mastered it,"" said Sheehy. ""But he did everything with a little twinkle in his eye because he was always a kid at heart and knew how to entertain other kids.""In his contracts, Rogers retained merchandising rights, and his name was everywhere. ""Forty-seven manufacturers turned out more than 360 items, from binoculars to boots,"" wrote Kazanjian and Enss. ""In 1953, consumers bought 408,000 pairs of felt slippers and 900,000 lunch kits. Roy Rogers was second only to Walt Disney in sales and licensing.""Rogers also made money raising thoroughbreds, one of which won 13 races, and lent his name to the Roy Rogers Restaurants operated by Marriott (MAR). Today the eateries number 51 and are owned by Plamondon Hospitality.In 1959, Rogers was in ""Alias Jesse James,"" his last film until the 1970s. ""Today they're making pictures that I wouldn't want Trigger to see,"" he explained. ""Hollywood changed. I think we've lost something, and we don't know how to get it back.""The Rogers family moved to Apple Valley in the desert north of Los Angeles in 1964 and three years later opened the Roy Rogers & Dale Evans Museum. It was moved in 2003 to the country music mecca of Branson, Mo., where Dusty's group, the High Riders, played. The museum closed in 2009.By the 1970s, Rogers had returned to country music, resulting in three top 40 albums and six hit singles. He was the first individual elected twice to the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, Tenn., with the Sons of the Pioneers in 1980 and as a soloist in 1988.A decade later, Rogers died at age 86 and was buried in Apple Valley. Evans followed him in 2001 at 88.

194,MO,"Saucer bases take a long time to unfold, but they're capable of producing strong gains similar to shorter patterns such as the cup-with-handle and flat bases.Saucers form over a period of seven weeks to a year or more. They're harder to recognize than cup-type bases because their length makes them look shallower even though they can correct up to 30%, or as much as a solid cup pattern.This next point is critical: In some cases, saucer bases can be so long that they're only visible on a weekly or monthly chart. So make sure you are not limiting your research by looking only at daily charts.Find The Big-Cap WinnersSaucers are often shaped by big-cap stocks, which tend to be slower moving and less volatile than their smaller, high-growth counterparts. Some stocks form saucers during periods when the general market moves sideways.Both cups and saucers can also form handles, which yield lower buy points.Altria Group (MO), the tobacco giant, began shaping a 13-week saucer-with-handle base in late December 2013. The buy point was 37.43, or 10 cents above the high of the handle that began forming in early March 2014. The stock cleared the buy point in weak volume on March 27, when the market was in a correction.Few stocks can defy a market slump, but Altria rose for seven straight weeks and volume picked up, a good sign. Patient investors would have also noticed that its fundamental and technical characteristics also continued to improve.Altria's Composite Rating was just 52 at the breakout, its Earnings Per Share Rating was a tepid 67 and its Relative Price Strength Rating was a lowly 41. Such weak ratings, not to mention the longer base, tend to scare off growth investors. But they're fairly typical of slower-moving big-cap stocks that form such a long base.Slow And SteadyAlso, Altria typifies the stocks featured in IBD's Income Investor column by possessing extremely steady earnings and solid dividend growth.Today, Altria sports a 3-year Earnings Stability Factor of 1 on a scale of zero (most stable) to 99 (least stable). Long-term dividend growth is healthy at 8% annually.In particular, stocks that form saucer bases tend to have weak RS Ratings because the metric tracks 12 months of price progress. Such a calculation penalizes stocks that shape long bases.By the end of April, Altria's Composite Rating had climbed 27 points to 79, while its RS Rating had jumped to 67 even though the market remained in a correction. The stock rose for seven straight weeks following its breakout.Importantly, Altria's base showed nice symmetry. The number of weeks on the left side of the pattern equaled the number of weeks on the right side.Altria revealed a hefty shakeout near the bottom of the pattern. Weak shareholders were exiting the stock. The handle drifted lower in light volume, a bullish sign.Over the next year, Altria rose 51% to a high of 56.69 in the week ended March 6 of this year.

Harrison wrote in a research note that while it's true that Gilead has the cash to make a substantial acquisition, he doesn't think there's a really big one in the immediate future.""Management offered a few comments around M&A at our recent conference which suggests to us that management is focused on multiple deals for clinical stage assets awaiting derisking data, similar to the Bristol-Myers (BMY) string of pearls strategy,"" Harrison wrote. ""While we believe this is the smart strategy for Gilead and should generate above average long-term returns, we also do not see this strategy offering a single deal that could re-rate Gilead as some investors have suggested.""At the same time, Harrison wrote that the long-term outlook on the hepatitis C market will be unclear until next year, when the EU rollout is more advanced and after Merck (MRK) has unveiled more data on its own pipeline.Gilead stock was down 1.5% near 97 in midday trading on the stock market today.Picking The Big-Cap WinnersMeanwhile, Harrison liked the position of Vertex as it moves into what's expected to be its first profitable quarter in two years, thanks to the recent launch of cystic-fibrosis drug Orkambi.""We see a strong Orkambi launch based on physician feedback, suggesting 2015 revenue as much as $100 million above consensus,"" Harrison wrote. ""Biotechs transitioning to profitability have historically outperformed peers by 15 times in the 12 months following transition.""Harrison upgraded Vertex stock to overweight from equal-weight and set a price target of 148.Vertex stock was up 5%, near 113, midday Friday, after touching a nearly one-year low of 97.45 on Tuesday.Harrison also upgraded Alexion stock to overweight from equal-weight, with a price target of 211, writing that the recent sell-off in drug stocks has created an attractive entry point for the orphan-drug stock.""While Alexion has only declined 7% vs. 10% for its other large-cap biotech peers, Alexion has been an underperformer year-to-date, down 15%, the most of all large cap biotechs,"" Harrison noted. ""Thus, given the robust set of new product launches, potential pipeline upside and consensus now more aware of the competitive landscape for Soliris, we see the potential for Alexion to outperform out of the weakness generated by concerns around government pricing.""Alexion stock was up 4% in midday trading Friday, near 164. That still leaves shares down more than 20% from an all-time high near 209 touched in July, before the stock market's tumble proved especially tough on biotechs.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

214,MO,"Kit Carson was a legend in his own time, with 70 novels recounting his imagined exploits in the Wild West. But his real adventures needed no embellishment.Carson became a beaver trapper in 1825 and was at the last gathering of the mountain men in 1840, when few beavers were left.He became famous as an Indian fighter but earned the Indians' respect for his bravery and integrity.He was the guide for John Fremont's three expeditions to map the Oregon Trail from 1842 to 1845.He helped spark California's revolt against Mexico in 1846. When riding for help, he saved American soldiers at San Pasqual, now part of San Diego.He led Union volunteers during the largest battle of the Civil War in the West at Valverde, N.M., in 1862, which involved 6,000 men and inflicted equal casualties.After the Confederacy stirred up Indians across the Great Plains against the U.S. in 1864, over 1,400 surrounded Carson's 400 men, but he led them to safety.""Carson ... mastered the rules of living on America's borders, those fluid, highly unstable regions where people of different races, cultures and languages met, mixed ... and often fought, sometimes against each other, sometimes together,"" wrote David Remley in ""Kit Carson: The Life of an American Border Man."" ""Carson was skilled, thorough, scrupulous, pragmatic. .. . He helped other people, whoever they may be, if they were harmless and in need. ... He was characteristically self-effacing . .. (and) seldom if ever took credit for decent things he did. ... He killed if he considered it necessary ... although such instances were usually in 'killed or be killed' situations.""Kentucky And Missouri RiseChristopher Carson (1809-68) was born in Richmond, Ky., on Christmas Eve, the sixth of 10 children, and a year later they moved to Boone's Lick, Mo.His father was a veteran of the American Revolution and War of 1812, but he died when Kit was 8 after a tree fell on him while he was clearing a field. His mother remarried four years later.Carson was illiterate all his life, though he grew fluent in Spanish and French, and learned to speak a dozen Indian languages. He was sent to a saddle maker in Franklin, Mo., as an apprentice, but he found the work dull and was stirred by tales of trappers and traders.He left at 16 to tend the cattle of pioneers on the Santa Fe Trail.Over the next three years, based in Taos, N.M., he worked as a wagon driver, cook, translator and miner.In 1829, at 19, he began traveling with other trappers and hunters into the unexplored wilderness.While moving along the Salt River in what is now Arizona, Carson's camp was attacked by Indians, and he repelled them.After a trek through the desert, Carson and his men reached California's San Gabriel Mission, an area he called ""a paradise on earth"" in memoirs that he later dictated.""Over the next decade, he developed a reputation throughout the West among whites and natives for the ability to overcome great odds in fights and for courage in protecting members of his group, even when it nearly cost him his life,"" R.L. Wilson, author of ""The History and Art of the American Gun,"" told IBD.Carson biographer John Abbott wrote: ""He never lost any time in deliberation; but whatever the emergency, he seemed instinctively to know at the moment exactly the best thing to be done. ... With energy and fearlessness unsurpassed, he was certainly one of the most gentle, upright and lovable of men.""In 1836, Carson married an Arapahoe, Singing Grass, who died giving birth to their second child. The baby was killed in an accident two years later. Carson sent the first child to his sister in St. Louis to receive the education he never had.Meanwhile, his skill with language and reputation for fairness drew him to mediate disputes between enemy tribes. By 1840, the beavers across North America were almost gone, and 600 mountain men gathered to do their last trading of fur and skin for cash and goods at the annual fair on the Green River in Wyoming.Carson married a Cheyenne woman in 1841, but they didn't get along and soon broke up. The next year, he wed Josefa Jaramillo, the daughter of a wealthy Mexican family in Taos, and they had eight children.In 1842, on a steamboat on the Missouri River, Carson met Fremont, an officer with the Army Corps of Topographical Engineers, and agreed to guide the outfit to Wyoming. Fremont wrote a report afterward that made a national figure of Carson, who led a second expedition the next year to Oregon and a third in 1845, spurring thousands to migrate.PraiseFremont lauded Carson for saving the lives of his men from Indians and bad weather many times.Mexico had ordered all Americans to leave California. At the end of their trip in 1846, Fremont and Carson decided to help a revolt to create an independent republic.Fremont sent Carson with the news of victory to Washington, D.C., and after riding 800 miles in a month, he stopped in Socorro, N.M., to meet Gen. Stephen Kearny and his 300 cavalry.The soldiers had been sent to enforce U.S. claims on California. Believing that the revolt was over, Kearny sent 200 troops back to Washington with Fremont's victory letter for President Polk and headed to California, with Carson guiding the 100.At San Pasqual in December 1846, the American soldiers learned that the rebellion was in the process of being put down, and Kearny's men were surrounded on a hilltop by a Mexican army.Coming ThroughIn the middle of the night, Carson and two others left their shoes behind to avoid making noise as they sneaked through enemy lines and walked barefoot through the desert to get reinforcements from an Army camp 25 miles away. Just in time, 200 cavalry rescued Kearny's men.Carson then went on marathon gallops, carrying messages to Polk three times in 1847-48. Included in his packet was news of the first California gold strike.Novels about Carson's supposed adventures began to appear and were translated even into Japanese, Arabic and Hindi. In 1849, he found one of them in an Apache camp and had it read to him.He served as an Indian agent, working with Native tribes for the U.S. government. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Carson became an officer in the Union Army leading volunteers in New Mexico. Later in 1861, he rose to colonel.In 1862, 2,600 Confederate cavalry attacked 3,800 mostly militia infantry at Valverde. Carson helped push the rebels back.He felt that his men were on the verge of victory when his general panicked and retreated into a secure fort. It was a technical victory for the rebels, but most of their horses had been killed, and they had to walk to their next fight.In November 1864, 1,400 Comanche, Kiowa and Apache surrounded Carson's 400 men at Adobe Wells, Texas. He managed their escape with only three lost, while killing 100. President Lincoln made Carson a brigadier general of volunteers in March 1865.Carson returned home in 1868, but soon thereafter, Josefa died. A grieving Carson, 58, passed away a month later. They were buried at what is now the Kit Carson Home and Museum in Taos.""He was like Zelig or Forrest Gump, always in the right place at the right time for important events,"" said Stephen Aron, a professor of the history of the American West at UCLA. ""Carson was not your stereotypical cowboy, but represented the possibility of people and cultures mixing and adapting peaceably to each other amid rapid change. He's an inspiration for today as we encounter other cultures, often in a shrinking world.""

251,MO,"Reynolds American's acquisition of Lorillard this summer has breathed new life into its product portfolio and solidified its position as the No. 2 U.S. tobacco company. A key to the $25 billion deal, completed in June, was that it brought aboard the popular Newport cigarette brand.It also helped boost Reynolds American's (RAI) Q2 revenue and earnings above consensus views, prompting the company to raise its full-year earnings estimate. Reynolds now expects 2015 EPS in the range of $1.90 to $2, up from prior guidance of $1.83 to $1.90.""They are in a much stronger competitive position, given that they now control not only the leading menthol brand, which is Newport, but they already control the fastest-growing menthol brand, which is Camel,"" Cowen & Co. analyst Vivien Azer told IBD. ""They also have exposure to the super-premium segment via Natural American Spirit, which has been growing at torrid rates.""Shifting FocusThe tobacco giant's merger comes as it explores new ways to address changing consumer preferences. It boasts an expanded portfolio that includes traditional cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, moist smokeless tobacco and other sources of nicotine in various formats.Reynolds and rivals such as Altria Group (MO), maker of Marlboro, are vying for market share in an industry that has seen cigarette volumes decline 3% to 4% per year in the U.S. in recent years. Tobacco companies also face possible new federal regulation around menthol and e-cigarettes, among other hurdles.Azer expects Lorillard's Newport brand to benefit from Reynolds' marketing and packaging expertise and from its innovative approach to the market. She sees an opportunity for Reynolds to post double-digit earnings growth in 2015, 2016 and 2017.The Newport brand provides new momentum for profitable growth in the near term, says Reynolds American spokeswoman Jane Seccombe.More importantly, she said, it provides new momentum ""in our long-term initiatives to reward shareholders and advance the product development and innovation that's essential for sustainable growth in a rapidly changing industry.""On a July 29 conference call with analysts, Reynolds American CEO Susan Cameron said that the Lorillard acquisition also will improve operational efficiencies and increase scale. As part of the merger, Reynolds divested about $7.1 billion in brands, some of which had seen consistent volume declines.Chief Financial Officer Andrew Gilchrist said on the call that Reynolds expects about $800 million in cost synergies as a result of the acquisition, with about $300 million coming within 18 months.Although cigarette sales volumes continue to decline industrywide, Reynolds actually posted an 11% year-over-year revenue gain during its second quarter. The Lorillard buyout helped. So did lower gas prices, which increased foot traffic to convenience stores, where a lot of cigarettes are sold.Reynolds also increased its quarterly cash dividend by 7.5% during the quarter, marking the 12th dividend increase since Reynolds American was formed in 2004.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Reynolds' Q3 revenue to increase 38% to $3.097 billion and EPS to rise 13% to 54 cents.The Reynolds-Lorillard merger combined two of Big Tobacco's oldest companies. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco has roots dating back to 1875, while Lorillard was founded in 1760.Reynolds American is the holding company for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, Santa Fe Natural Tobacco, American Snuff, Niconovum and R.J. Reynolds Vapor.The company's key rival is Altria, which has about 50% of the market share. The two companies combine for about 75% of the market, according to Stifel Nicolaus analyst Christopher Growe.Seccombe said that Reynolds' vision is to achieve market leadership by ""transforming the tobacco industry over the long term, which aligns well with society's expectations of how we should operate responsibly.""Shifts in adult tobacco consumer behavior and industry dynamics ""are creating opportunity in many areas,"" she added. ""We're confident that our companies have the brands, strategies and resources to win.""One of those strategies is to take advantage of the growing e-cigarette market. Reynolds' Vuse e-cigarettes deliver nicotine by way of inhaled vapor. Its line of Revo heat-not-burn cigarettes use temperature to release nicotine without any combustion.Meanwhile, the Niconovum unit's Zonnic nicotine gum is being marketed in more than 25,000 retail outlets.Morningstar analyst Adam Fleck expects the ""transformative merger"" to help Reynolds stem declines in market share.""We expect the pricing power of Camel, Newport and Pall Mall to help offset industry volume declines and keep Reynolds' cigarette revenue largely stable,"" Fleck said. ""Additionally, the firm should be able to expand its super-premium, additive-free Natural American cigarette and American Snuff smokeless tobacco segments.""Those segments represented 7% and 9%, respectively, of sales in 2014.As always with the tobacco industry, there are plenty of challenges. One is a potential menthol ban by the Food and Drug Administration. Reynolds also faces headwinds with international expansion after selling the international rights to its brands in 1999 to Japan Tobacco.Meanwhile, last week the FDA ordered Reynolds to stop sales of four cigarette brands because they don't meet the regulator's guidelines. Camel Crush Bold, Pall Mall Deep Set Recessed Filter, Pall Mall Deep Set Recessed Filter Menthol and Vantage Tech 13 can no longer be distributed in the U.S., the FDA said in a statement on Sept. 15.Pursuing InnovationCameron should be adept at helping Reynolds navigate the industry's many challengers, Azer says, because the CEO is an industry veteran who ""really understands the landscape and is a terrific brand manager and innovator.""Reynolds also has demonstrated an innovative culture. It rolled out its own line of e-cigarettes even as Altria opted to license an e-cigarette technology from a Chinese manufacturer, Azer said. Reynolds also acquired a smokeless tobacco company ahead of Altria.Wall Street has taken note. Reynolds' stock price has been on a steady rise this year and is up about 30% since the beginning of 2015.Azer expects Reynolds' momentum to continue well into the future as the company adapts to a shifting landscape.""Underlying industry fundamentals are the best we've seen in a number of years,"" Azer said. ""The view today, I think, is that the consumer is one where next-generation tobacco is not going to be a one-size-fits-all type of solution. Different consumers are going to be looking for alternative sources of nicotine in various forms.""

252,MO,"War On Cops: As President Obama's ex-chief of staff blames ""fetal""-position police for growing violent crime, another cop murder explains why officers may be backing off high-crime areas. They're afraid for their lives.On Tuesday, authorities say convicted drug dealer Tyrone Howard walked up to New York Police Department officer Randolph Holder and shot him in the front of the head.It's not clear if Holder had his weapon drawn. But it wouldn't surprise us if he didn't. New York, like most major cities across the country, is training officers to avoid physical altercations with minority suspects, lest they be accused of racism by Black Lives Matter.As part of that training, New York police are even sending new recruits to Broadway to watch a play about Emmett Till, who was killed by racists in Mississippi in 1955, to overcome their ""unconscious bias"" and increase their sensitivity toward minorities.Holder's murder was the fourth New York City police officer murdered in the past 11 months, one of the highest rates of police deaths in the nation.In May, Demetrius Blackwell was arrested for shooting New York officer Brian Moore in the head while the 25-year-old cop was on patrol. Days before Christmas, New York officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were allegedly gunned down execution-style in their patrol car by Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who said he was retaliating for the death of Michael Brown. Brown, wanted for a robbery, was killed in self-defense by a Ferguson, Mo., cop.On Wednesday, the day after his officer was murdered, New York Police Commissioner William Bratton was supposed to meet with President Obama and civil-rights activists to discuss police ""de-biasing"" training and ""de-incarceration"" of repeat drug offenders like Howard.In fact, de-incarceration is why Howard, who had been arrested 28 times previously, was on the streets. A liberal judge diverted him from prison to a drug treatment center, which he never attended. He instead went right back to his previous lifestyle.""If ever there were a candidate not to be diverted, it was this guy,"" Bratton said. ""He's a poster boy for not being diverted.""Bratton was in Washington earlier this month meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch to address with other police chiefs the soaring murder rates in major cities across the country. New York, Boston, Baltimore, Minneapolis, Chicago, Milwaukee, Houston, Dallas, Cleveland, Los Angeles and Seattle have all seen dramatic spikes in violence, especially homicides.Bratton and other brass blamed ""the Ferguson effect."" Cops are reducing pro-active policing in bad neighborhoods for fear of being falsely accused by civil-rights activists of police brutality and racial bias.They're also worried about being targeted by thugs. Black Lives Matter has called on activists to kill ""pigs.""""Marchers in my city were chanting, 'What do we want? Dead cops! When do we want them? Now!' "" Bratton said. ""Well, they got them.""Mayors were also at the meeting. Rahm Emanuel of Chicago complained that de-policing in his city has led to one of the worst homicide rates on record. But Emanuel should blame his former boss. He and his attorney general declared war on cops. What did they expect?Holder was the 33rd cop fatally shot in the nation so far this year.Last month, Jarvis Hall allegedly fatally shot Forest Acres, S.C., police officer Greg Alia, who just had a baby boy with his wife. Hall allegedly ambushed Alia as he was patrolling a shopping mall.Also in September, Joseph Johnson-Shanks allegedly shot and killed Kentucky state trooper Joseph Ponder. Johnson-Shanks allegedly fired several shots through the windshield of the trooper's cruiser.If politicians want to stop soaring crime rates, they should stop vilifying cops. And they should start speaking out against the Black Lives Matter race-mongers and their patrons in the White House.

Do the Democrats, we asked, ""want to stay behind a candidate who will be under investigation throughout the campaign?"" Do they ""want to support a candidate who would start her term as president under investigation,"" as well as one ""for whom a Republican House would be drawing up articles of impeachment at the very moment she's taking the oath of office?""Apparently they do, because there's been no effort to talk her down. She's still running as if she has no baggage to bring to the White House with her.Meanwhile, Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama is reportedly saying that impeachment will be awaiting Clinton if she's elected.""In my judgement, with respect to Hillary Clinton, she will be a unique president if she is elected by the public next November, because the day she's sworn in is the day that she's subject to impeachment because she has committed high crimes and misdemeanors,"" Brooks said last week on radio talk-show host Matt Murphy's program.Brooks' comment is not crazy talk. Clinton is in deep trouble. Last week we reported that she could end up in a federal prison for violating the Espionage Act. Her email scandal is truly the Watergate of our time.And it just might end up being worse. If the FBI email probe determines that there was ""gross negligence"" in the way she treated ""information relating to national defense,"" Richard Nixon's 1974 resignation will look like a garden party compared to what would happen to Clinton, and the divisions of that time will seem like unity relative to the political war that will erupt.This is one reason, but not the only one, that we've said a bad day for Hillary Clinton is a good day for the country.Follow Kerry Jackson on Twitter @IBD_KJackson.

""Children will be more tuned in to money and begin to learn skills related to consumption. This is a great opportunity to teach them about opportunity cost."" Pass on values. Identify family stories and life lessons, using them as the cornerstone for all planning, says Mark LaSpisa, president of Vermillion Financial Advisors in the Chicago area. Try 'em. Future heirs learn and sharpen skills by running part of the business.""Depending on the age and skill set of the family member, they could be given a portion of the family budget to manage,"" LaSpisa said.

How has the stock fared on a weekly closing basis? And do you see a potential new base forming?You want more tools. These can help. Check the RS Rating. This tool should apply to an income stock just as it does a high-adrenaline growth play.If your dividend stock has a Relative Price Strength Rating of 80 or higher, it means your stock is in the top fifth of the U.S. market in terms of 12-month relative performance. Knowing that may help you keep the conviction necessary to hold on.In IBD's Dividend Leaders screen, a quarter of the 59 names show an RS Rating of 80 or higher. They include Hasbro (HAS) (93 RS), ConAgra Foods (CAG) (91 RS), Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE) (90), Home Depot (HD) (87), Altria (MO) (84) and CME (CME) (80).It's also worthwhile comparing a stock's RS Rating with those of its industry peers. IBD Stock Checkup does that instantly for you. Home Depot ranks fourth among 18 stocks in the Retail/Wholesale-Building Products industry group. That's a strong showing. Analyze the moving averages. If your stock's 10-week and 40-week moving averages are rising, that's positive. It means the mid- and long-term price trends are up.Last week, many stocks punctured one or both support lines. Hasbro fell below the 40-week line briefly. But Coca-Cola Enterprises bounced off its 10-week average, revealing exceptional strength. As weeks pass, see if Hasbro can reclaim its 10-week line. A prolonged stay below this line signals weakness. Uptrend or downtrend? This is best checked on a weekly chart. Do you see a pattern of higher highs and higher lows over at least several months? CME has done so since April 2014 despite last week's brief plunge.

Less-aggressive policing has emboldened the bad guys, leading to a nationwide spike in murder.New data show murder rates have shot up across major cities as police morale plummets. Surveys show police feel ""under siege"" by race-baiting politicians and activists, as well as increasingly hostile suspects, and are second-guessing themselves as they respond to crimes. As IBD's Andrew Malcolm notes elsewhere, other surveys show Americans see the police under seige as well.Officers fear violating softer new use-of-force and arrest policies pushed on cities by the Obama Justice Department will open them up to civil-rights prosecution. Many have backed off patrols and stops in dangerous urban areas as a result.Fearing ambush, moreover, police in some cities are doubling up patrols, reducing the breadth of officer presence on the street. Inner-city residents complain criminals aren't being taken off the streets like before.The result: Year-over-year homicide rates are up 76% in Milwaukee; 60% in St. Louis; 56% in Baltimore; 44% in Washington, D.C.; 22% in New Orleans; 20% in Chicago; 20% in Kansas City; and 17% in Dallas. And single-digit rises have been seen in New York and other cities.Residents in Baltimore and Ferguson, Mo., now complain cops aren't showing up fast enough to crime calls. Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn acknowledged his officers are making fewer traffic stops and conducting fewer field interviews, thanks to ""free-floating anxiety"" among law enforcement officers across the nation.The crime wave may only get worse as departments fail to recruit enough rank-and-file officers to put on the street. The National Sheriff's Association says recruitment nationally is ""way down,"" thanks to the anti-cop climate. The number of police applicants in Seattle is down more than 90% since Justice accused the department of racial bias and forced it to adopt reforms.Police recruits are down in Chicago and Philadelphia, as well.

338,MO,"Bob Chapman is CEO of a crucial capital equipment maker you've never heard of: Barry-Wehmiller Cos., based in St. Louis. Walk into any supermarket and pick up any product, and odds are one of Chapman's machines made the packaging or filled it.When Chapman talks about his people-centric leadership philosophy, you see why Barry-Wehmiller has delivered. Since 1987, the packaging automation giant has had a 15.6% compound annual return for investors in this privately held company, which compares with 5.4% average private company growth in 2013, according to Forbes.Its 2014 sales stood at $2 billion.Last year, Inc. magazine put it on its list of the 25 Most Audacious Companies for its culture.""We like to say that our economic engine is that we build great people who do extraordinary things,"" Chapman, co-author with Raj Sisodia of the forthcoming book ""Everybody Matters,"" told IBD. ""If you look at surveys, 88% of workers don't feel their companies care about them, and the result is poor morale, stress and low engagement. It took me a long time to realize that if you stop managing people like objects and instead treat them like family, they will be motivated to create much greater value.""The Show Me KidChapman, 68, grew up in Ferguson, Mo. He attended Indiana University, where he was an average student until his girlfriend, Liz, became pregnant his sophomore year. They married and moved into a trailer.The responsibility of becoming a father motivated him, and he graduated with honors in accounting in 1967. He landed an MBA at the University of Michigan the next year.After he audited companies for Price Waterhouse for two years, his father invited him to his company, Barry-Wehmiller.Founded in 1885 by the Barry and Wehmiller families to provide equipment to produce malt from grain for beer, it turned to making machines that washed bottles for beverage manufacturers.With the firm struggling, Chapman worked on improving units.Then in 1975, his father died of a heart attack and Bob, 30, took over as chairman and chief executive.The prior year, sales were $18 million and it lost $477,000. The company also had $3 million in debt, and the bank called its loan. ""I vowed not to go down and brought an intensity to bear I hadn't had before,"" he recalled. ""We were three months into the fiscal year when I started, and nine months later we had our best year, $22 million in sales and a profit of $2.2 million.""The market improved, and banks supported investing in technology to let beverage makers do quality control inspections of bottles electronically and to pasteurize beverages with solar heat.New government legislation encouraged returnable bottles, which had to be cleaned, driving demand for the firm's washing equipment. Within five years, sales rocketed to $71 million, but Chapman says success made him overconfident. In 1983, rising warranty costs, inventory write-downs and reduced orders for new equipment due to brewer mergers hit all at once.The year simply looked bleak, with a looming loss of $5 million. Suddenly B-W's line of credit was frozen and loans were called.Taking ChancesChapman rolled the dice, betting his company on an asset-based loan. If he missed a payment, the bank would own everything.He decided that the only way to win was to acquire struggling firms he believed had products with a better future if managed right.He had no financial resources or experience making acquisitions, so he became creative in proposals.In one case, he took an underperforming electronics unit that had $3 million in sales and merged it with a similarly sized firm — and within three years the combo was bringing in $37 million.Another gamble came in 1987, when he spun off all the acquisitions as an IPO on the London Stock Exchange.Chapman hoped this would let him pay off the bottle business' debt and put $2 million in the bank.The jackpot was even more lucrative. Demand was so great, Barry-Wehmiller banked $28 million.""I told everyone that our history was not our future and we needed to think about how we could apply the lessons we had learned to now build an ideal packaging company, with a balanced set of customers, markets and technologies,"" said Chapman. ""We realized there were plenty of opportunities in capital equipment because of cyclicality and global competition. We were going to think outside the steel box of the industries we had operated in.""Stick With ThemSince then, Barry-Wehmiller has made 75 acquisitions and sold none of them. This in an environment where half of all corporate takeovers fail to pay for themselves.Chapman's company has looked at 500 other prospects and is in discussions with 40.""The dialogue sometimes has taken 20 years because we're not in a rush; we're very disciplined,"" he said. ""We look for opportunities where we're confident we can help. I'm not going to do surgery on someone whose life I can't save.""Barry-Wehmiller has become the manufacturer of equipment that consumer product companies depend on. Its 120 locations and over 8,000 employees are in 28 countries but concentrated in America and Europe. They are grouped into 10 interactive but independent subsidiaries, with the goal of optimal use of capital equipment in processing and packaging products.Its firms provide engineering consulting, design services and machines to a wide range of industries: Robotic technology for manufacturing lines and conveyor systems. Corrugated boxes and bags, plus equipment to turn rolls of paper into tissue and packages. Machinery to fill bottles and seal cans. Equipment that can put together pallets of products to ship and take them apart on arrival.""About 90% of the corrugated boxes in the U.S. are touched by one of our machines,"" said Matt Whiat of the Barry-Wehmiller Leadership Institute, which teaches what it calls Truly Human Leadership to other companies. ""In a typical supermarket, a majority of the products have interacted with our equipment or technology in one way or another in the manufacturing and packaging process, whether it's Purina pet food or Kraft cheese.""In 1976, Chapman divorced, and his three children joined with the three kids of his new wife, Cynthia; they would also have one child together. ""Learning parenting skills in a blended family caused me to rethink what I'd been taught at business school,"" he said.In the late 1990s, he had several other related epiphanies:An inspiring sermon by his pastor made him think, ""He only influences us for an hour a week, but think of the impact a business could have in 40 hours."" During a wedding, he said to himself, ""The parents of the bride are asking the groom to take care of their child and help her become what she is meant to be. I have that same responsibility with everyone in my care as a leader."" While visiting a new acquisition in South Carolina, he saw how everyone was energized before work, but as soon as they started, that excitement disappeared. He set up fun contests that would incentivize everyone to be team players in sales, with spectacular results.""The game of business is played at the highest level when you can do both organic and acquisition growth together,"" said Chapman. ""A key to our leadership practices is to ask our team to articulate where you want to go, why you want to go there and when you get there, will you have taken your people to a better place? This creates buy-in and direction.""After surpassing $1 billion in sales for the first time in 2008, the recession hit Barry-Wehmiller with a 40% drop in new equipment orders the next year.Chapman wondered, ""What would a caring family do in such a crisis?"" The answer was shared sacrifice. No one was fired, everyone took pay cuts and some took a voluntary unpaid furlough.The company bounced back with record results in fiscal 2010 and has found that its culture translates to other countries.Fred Kiel, chairman of leadership consultancy KRW International and author of ""Return on Character: The Real Reason Leaders and Their Companies Win,"" said, ""Barry-Wehmiller has been pushing its 'people first' concepts down to every level, but it does take constant learning and innovation. We found that companies with strong character leadership teams bring home nearly five times the amount to the bottom line compared with teams that just focus on getting the job done.""

373,MO,"War On Uber: A California judge has recommended the ride-sharing company be fined $7.3 million and have its state license suspended 30 days. The crusade against this wealth- and job-creating company accelerates.The recommendation, made by a California Public Utilities Commission administrative law judge, is yet another front that Uber must fight on. Its enemies are everywhere, from Hillary Clinton to Paris cab drivers to local police in America.Entrepreneurs who see these campaigns against Uber have to wonder if it's worth the trouble to innovate and create startup companies. Should they become discouraged, our economy will feel the effects.The administrative law judge, Robert Mason, made the recommendation based on Uber's failure to comply with the CPUC's demand that it provide the commission with information about where it picks up riders, vehicle accessibility and driving incident reports.The CPUC justified its demands of this private company because it wants to know if its ""services are being provided in a nondiscriminatory manner enabling equal access to all,"" and whether ""services are being provided in a manner that promotes public safety.""Mason wants his recommendation to appear legitimate, but Reason's Brian Doherty points out that the charges are not due to ""any specific accusation of having committed some sort of civil rights law violation against the disabled."" The ""enormous fine"" and ""threatened destruction,"" he writes, were recommended merely due to Uber's ""failure to send reports to the state in a manner it finds sufficient.""No doubt the state was just looking for a way to punish a new business. How do we know this? Because ride-sharing companies Uber, Lyft and Sidecar make regulators uncomfortable due to their adaptable, innovative nature, and they infuriate their rivals — the taxi cartels — and government officials who benefit when those rivals are protected from competition.Government figures, from elected officials to bureaucrats to commission members to administrative judges, enjoy the authority they can wield over companies such as Uber. It gives them power and a sense of purpose.They don't want commerce taking place outside their reach of taxation and regulation.They're driven by an insatiable desire to force their way between private parties — a driver and his rider, in the case of ride-sharing companies — who have entered into a purely voluntary and peaceful agreement.This isn't happening just in California. We've also seen it in Virginia; New Mexico; Miami-Dade County; Kansas City, Mo.; and Austin, Texas.The war on Uber is not always for political power gain. Sometimes it's been waged on behalf of the local taxi cartel. Cab companies in New York can pay as much as $1 million per vehicle for the medallion that grants them the privilege to operate in the city and enjoy insulation from competition. Local officials are glad to side with the cab companies because they are a rich source of government revenue.Then there are the taxi drivers themselves. Cabbies in Paris rioted and shut down roads. Competition from ride-sharing is toxic to the government-protected business model that provides them with their cushy jobs.Of course, the French government surrendered to them and began hounding Uber.Ride-sharing has even become a presidential campaign issue — at least according to Clinton. She's promised to crack down on the companies because they enter into arrangements with independent contractors rather than hire drivers as employees. Naturally, she's looking out for the interests of unions that would love to organize the drivers and take a cut of their pay.Uber and other ride-sharing companies aren't criminal organizations that warrant government harassment. They're entrepreneurial risk takers creating wealth and jobs.That doesn't mean government needs to promote them. It only means it should get out of the way and let the natural order of the free market as determined by consumers do the regulating.

The score shows how stable a firm's dividend history is over a five-year period. A lower number means a more stable history.First Trust Value Line Dividend (FVD), with $1.2 billion in assets, holds furniture maker Leggett & Platt (LEG). The stock has a DSF of 0.PowerShares Dividend Achievers (PFM) has $343.5 million in assets and big stakes in J&J and IBM, as well as Altria Group (MO). The tobacco firm has a DSF of 1.SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY), with $13.62 billion in assets, holds Johnson & Johnson, Leggett & Platt and Kimberly-Clark (KMB) among its top 25 holdings. The Huggies maker has a DSF of 1.The 12-month yield of these four ETFs ranges from 1.95% for PFM to 2.25% for SDY. But when comparing dividend funds, investors who look at yield in isolation may be running a risk.Yield can be volatile over time. WisdomTree Equity Income (DHS) yielded roughly 10.3% in February 2008. It yields 2.9% today.""Some ETPs (exchange traded products) are clearly taking on more risk than others when they go about building an income-oriented portfolio,"" Johnson said.For less volatile yields, he said, ""It's important to look for funds that track benchmarks which incorporate some sort of (dividend) sustainability screen.""He added: ""Investors should place a premium on income stability, particularly in bear markets .""Dividend Yield Vs. GrowthDividend growth provides a historical context for yields. Investors in ETFs with growing dividends have a better shot at a cash stream that beats the rate of inflation over time.VIG screens for stocks that have increased their dividend for at least 10 consecutive years. It has an 0.1% expense ratio, the lowest among dividend-focused ETFs.SDY looks for stocks that have raised their dividends for the past 20 consecutive years. It has a 0.35% expense ratio, or $35 in fees for every $10,000 invested.VIG was up 1.4% year to date as of Wednesday. It produced an annual average 14.3% gain in the past five years, as opposed to 0.8% and 15% for SDY over those same periods.

427,MO,"The war on Uber, Lyft and other rideshare companies is a war on consumers. There's clear evidence of this in Long Beach, Calif., where the city council has eliminated the price floor for cab rides. The Los Angeles Times reports that it is ""a move aimed at keeping cabs competitive with the flexible pricing models of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft."" After the 9-0 vote, cabs in Long Beach ""will now be able to offer discounted rates and free rides.""Economist and IBD contributor Mark Perry says what will happen after the Long Beach vote is ""another example of Perry's Law — 'competition breeds competence.'"" Competition, says Perry, ""forces producers to offer consumers better service, higher quality and/or lower prices.""""Direct, ruthless, even cutthroat competition is often the most effective form of regulation, and provides the intense discipline that forces firms to maximize their responsiveness to consumers,"" he says.Long Beach is alone among major U.S. cities, says the Times, in dropping the price floor. The reaction to Uber and Lyft elsewhere has been more hostile, though. We noted this war on Uber and others last year:""The Virginia DMV has ordered both companies to cease and desist operations. Officers in Miami-Dade County, Fla., are posing as riders so they can seize cars and fine rideshare drivers up to $2,000.""Kansas City, Mo., police have ticketed drivers while New Mexico's Public Regulation Commission has voted to order Lyft to shut down operations in the state.

"
428,MO,"War On Cops: As two Mississippi police officers are laid to rest, the FBI says the number of cops feloniously killed in the line of duty soared 89% last year. How much can a cop-vilifying president be blamed for the trend?Deadly shootings and assaults on cops jumped to 51 in 2014 from 27 in 2013, according to preliminary FBI data.The total includes the brutal ambush of two New York City policemen as they sat in their squad car in New York on Dec. 20. Their black killer, Ismaaiyl Abdullah Brinsley, indicated that he sneaked up to their parked patrol car and shot them both in the head as payback for the deaths of Eric Garner in New York and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.This year is shaping up to be as bad, if not worse, for cop killings. Five NYPD cops already are believed to have been shot by black criminals in just the past five months. Last week, 25-year-old officer Brian Moore was fatally shot in the head while in his car, allegedly by career criminal Demetrius Blackwell.And this week, four blacks were charged with the shooting deaths of Hattiesburg, Miss., police officers Benjamin Deen and Liquori Tate. The cops were ambushed while making a traffic stop. Two of the suspects allegedly then stole their police cruiser as a getaway car.Law enforcement officials say President Obama and his ""war on police"" are to blame for the tragedies. Even some African-American brass are livid over his demagoguing, as acts of racism, recent unintended deaths of black criminals who resisted arrest or attacked police.""Obama started this war on police intentionally,"" said Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke. ""Right in line with his community agitating.""Media are also to blame. From Ferguson to Baltimore, they've parroted the false narrative put out by a race-mongering White House and Justice Department. When a white officer kills a black man, the media are quick to point out the race, never the other way around.Obama's press popinjays have made great hay of the racial element in the Ferguson, Staten Island, N.Y., and Baltimore cases involving black suspects who died while resisting arrest.But they completely overlook the race factor in recent shootings of police. They have written off the shooting deaths of cops by black assailants as ""isolated incidents,"" arguing that the real threat is from white cops ""targeting"" black men.Here's a fact they won't tell you: 42% of officers murdered in the line of duty over the past decade were shot by black suspects — and therein lies the real story, and real crisis. Evidence shows police face a lethal and growing threat from violent black criminals, not vice versa.But Obama is agitating to give them, in the words of Baltimore's mayor, ""the space"" to break the law, which only means they'll have more opportunities to kill cops.

430,MO,"Law And Order: Just two months ago, President Obama held up the Baltimore police force as a model of unbiased community policing. Now he's investigating it for civil-rights violations. What's changed?In a March White House report on police reforms, Obama and his Task Force on 21st Century Policing praised Baltimore's force and its black chief for ""implementing national best practices for policies and training,"" including ""use of force"" reforms. His task force even quoted Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts, who said he changed ""outdated procedures"" that ""put officers at odds with the community.""Yet now the Obama Justice Department is investigating the Baltimore police for a ""pattern or practice of discriminating"" against the black community in ""arrests, traffic stops and other operations."" The federal probe is separate from an ongoing federal inquiry into the death of Freddie Gray, which focuses on the alleged misconduct of six Baltimore cops involved in his arrest, half of whom are black.It's absurd to think that black police officers under the direction of a black police chief are inherently biased against young black men. So why does Obama keep charging police bias where mixed-race juries weighing all the evidence conclude there is none?He was just as wrong in Sanford, Fla., where he and his attorney general scolded local police for not charging George Zimmerman with murder, as he was in Ferguson, Mo., and Queens, N.Y.Why does he keep launching investigations into police discrimination and portraying cops as rabid racists? Because these probes provide a political justification for federalizing local police forces.Last week, Obama said he's dispatching federal civil-rights officials to retrain cops in ""every city and jurisdiction around the country"" to be more culturally sensitive to urban blacks. This so-called de-biasing retraining, according to the same White House report, centers on ""respecting"" black perpetrators and teaching ""de-escalation and tactical retreat skills"" when confronting them in high-crime areas.In other words, giving people space to break the law, which also means giving them space to ambush and kill cops. Five NYPD cops already are believed to have been shot by African-American criminals in just the past five months. Last week, 25-year-old officer Brian Moore was fatally shot in the head, allegedly by career criminal Demetrius Blackwell, while sitting in his car.FBI crime data over the past decade show that African-Americans commit a disproportionately high 40% of all cop-killings — more than three times their representation in the population — yet this administration is forcing local police to lower their guard when dealing with blacks in crime-infested urban areas.The policing reforms he's already forcing on more than 20 police departments across the country — including Seattle, Cleveland, Las Vegas, Newark, N.J., New Orleans, Philadelphia and Ferguson — are based on the studies of social psychologist Lorie Fridell, who argues legal definitions of unlawful discrimination are ""outdated"" and should be broadened to include even unquantifiable prejudice against people of color that occurs ""outside our conscious awareness.""While she admits the link between blacks and violent crime is statistically strong — African-Americans commit 53% of all murders and are 10 times more likely to commit violent crimes than whites — she trains cops to resist that ""stereotype"" through what the White House calls ""counter-stereotyping.""According to her PowerPoint presentations, Fridell recommends routinely testing cops for ""implicit"" or ""unconscious"" bias and ""unlearning"" their experience associating blacks with crime.By retraining cops' minds to perceive blacks as less of a threat, Fridell and Obama hope they'll be less likely to use lethal force against black suspects. Fridell recommends banning all criminal profiling that takes a suspect's race into account.By criminalizing crime-fighting, Obama is not only endangering more cops' lives but those of citizens they're sworn to protect.

457,MO,"In that environment the past several year, there was a high correlation between stocks. Investors did not differentiate between stocks. Lower-quality, highly leveraged companies would not do well without access to cheap capital.
"
458,MO,"Though the Federal Reserve has not acted yet, now it feels like (the start of interest rate hikes) is not far away, although it's not clear exactly when that will begin.
"
459,MO,"So the prospect of higher rates is turning into a headwind for lower-quality, highly leveraged companies. It's a tailwind for the type of higher-quality companies we like.
"
460,MO,"IBD: So the outlook for normalization of interest rates has helped the fund, right?
"
461,MO,"Hollond: So long as things normalize, that should benefit this fund. It's already benefiting.
"
462,MO,"IBD: For people who may not know your basic approach, take a moment to describe it, please.
"
463,MO,"Hollond: We are growth managers. What we look for is early recognition of acceleration in a company's growth rate. We try to find companies at the inflection of their fundamental improvement. We try to find companies growing faster today than in the recent past, and which will continue to grow faster. The key is, we look for catalyst-driven acceleration. We look for a driver that explains why the growth rate has picked up, a driver we can analyze and be confident that is sustainable for the foreseeable future.
"
464,MO,"IBD: You invest bottom up, not based on sectors. Yet sector weights reflect where you've been expecting to find buys. Why were consumer discretionary, technology and industrials your three biggest sectors as of March 31?
"
465,MO,"Yogasundram: We look for bottom-up ideas. But consumer discretionary and tech have dispersion. You can find companies doing well vs. companies doing badly. It's unlike energy, where it's much harder to find dispersion.
"
466,MO,"IBD: Is your stake in Harman International Industries (HAR) a play on U.S. economic expansion fueling more car purchases?
"
467,MO,"Hollond: Harman does infotainment in car systems. Years ago, you found that only in high-end cars. It's been moving down market. So Harman has been improving its content per car.
"
468,MO,"Yes, they're benefiting from a cyclical trend. But Harman is also a secular story, independent of the economic cycle. There's this secular trend toward infotainment and people wanting all of their (digital) devices to connect with their car's entertainment system and GPS. People are willing to spend more money on that. Harman has gained share and dollar content per car, getting paid more per car.
"
469,MO,"IBD: What did you see in LinkedIn (LNKD) that made you boost the fund's stake to 326,000 shares as of Dec. 31 from 281,000 as of Oct. 31?
"
470,MO,"Yogasundram: LinkedIn is the professional network that has the most and very accurate data on professionals like us. They're layering in more services (that they can sell) to take advantage of that data. They started by helping recruiters find better candidates for jobs. Now they're laying in services to help corporate marketing divisions sell to other businesses.
"
471,MO,"And they're selling services to China. They're leveraging data well. And they're expanding services from human resources and recruiting to sales and marketing, and they're going international. It's a solid secular growth company.
"
472,MO,"IBD: Thoughts on last Friday's price plunge on a disappointing outlook?
"
473,MO,"Yogasundram: LinkedIn is a solid company with a good long-term outlook. However, a combination of an acquisition-related write-off and some sales reorganization drove a temporary headwind.
"
474,MO,"IBD: Chipmaker Avago Technologies' (AVGO) growth has picked up. Earnings per share went from an 8% decline eight quarters ago to quarterly gains of 3%, 16%, 29%, 39%, 70%, 124% and 149%. Is it sustainable for now?
"
475,MO,"Yogasundram: There are two reasons their EPS growth accelerated and will continue to improve. First, they have a top-notch management team that bought good companies in the past. Most recently, they bought LSI, which was a badly run, high-cost company with a bloated infrastructure. They made it more efficient. Those gains dropped straight to their bottom line, which you've been seeing in their EPS.
"
476,MO,"Avago is the leading provider of communications devices to the iPhone and Samsung smartphones. As phones get more complex, Avago is a share gainer. And they've increased their dollar content on phones. That will continue with the iPhone 6 and 6+ and new Samsung phones as well.
"
477,MO,"IBD: AmerisourceBergen (ABC) is another holding with accelerating EPS growth. Is this a beneficiary of ObamaCare?
"
478,MO,"Hollond: The Affordable Care Act means more people are covered by insurance, so more people get health care and drugs. The ACA is a driver, but not the full story.
"
479,MO,"AmerisourceBergen is a pure play on drug distribution. If that's what you want to invest in, you can get that solely through AmerisourceBergen.
"
480,MO,"They've got some favorable fundamentals driving long-term attractiveness. With generics, after this year there will be robust acceleration in the generics launch calendar. That will provide a lift.
"
481,MO,"IBD: What about specialty pharmaceuticals?
"
482,MO,"Yogasundram: That's another area for them. They have key expertise. And there's robust growth in the specialty area. And it's higher margin. So it's an increasingly larger part of their business.
"
483,MO,"Let me mention one last thing. They acquired MWI Veterinary Supply, which presents an increasing market they can go after.
"
484,MO,"IBD: Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is a play on heightened concerns about network security, right?
"
485,MO,"Yogasundram: You're right. What you have today is an installed base of security that is woefully behind the threats.
"
486,MO,"Palo Alto is a next-generation security company, enabling customers to better defend themselves. Palo Alto is a secular share gainer. And it provides many more services than its layered defenses.
"
487,MO,"Their initial sale to a customer is an appliance. The second, third and fourth sales are higher margin. Their services can tell a customer exactly what happened (when a security breach occurs) and how to prevent that breach.
"
488,MO,"IBD: Lighting sounds dull. What's attractive about Acuity Brands (AYI)?
"
489,MO,"Yogasundram: Acuity is the largest lighting equipment company in the U.S. Adoption of LED lights is accelerating, especially as costs go down, so customers are layering in more products with LEDs.
"
490,MO,"When you have both cyclical and secular drivers, we really like that. That's what we have here.
"
491,MO,"IBD: What's your outlook for Electronic Arts (EA), which plans to release its next ""Star Wars Battlefront"" game about a month before December's scheduled debut of the next ""Star Wars"" movie?
"
492,MO,"Yogasundram: We started investing a couple of years ago when a new management team came in. They found a heavily bloated infrastructure. In the past couple of years they've reduced costs, reduced the number of (game) titles. Margins expand from 9% and 10% to 25% in the four or five quarters.
"
493,MO,"IBD: Is your stake in Hain Celestial (HAIN) a play on the growing appeal of organic and healthful foods?
"
494,MO,"Yogasundram: Correct. They've been in organic foods for some time. But we're really seeing two things happen. One is that organics is not just a Whole Foods (WFM) story (which the fund also owned as of its latest disclosure). It is also a Kroger (KR) story. It is a Target (TGT) story. Organic food is going from early adopters to more mainstream consumption.
"
495,MO,"That's a trend we're playing in a few different directions, including Whitewave Foods (WWAV) and Constellation Brands (STZ).
"
496,MO,"With Hain, they're selling more to Whole Foods and to Target and Kroger, so they're expanding distribution. And they're layering in more products. So it's a solid organic secular growth story.
"
497,MO,"IBD: Constellation isn't an organic play, so what is your thesis?
"
498,MO,"Yogasundram: There is a consumption change. Millennials and people in general are drinking beer less and wine and spirits more.
"
499,MO,"Constellation was part owner of Corona, the largest U.S. beer brand, and they brought the brand in-house and a few others like Pacifico. Since then, they've boosted advertising and brand awareness, and really started to grow that business. Beer is a 1% to 2% grower, but they've been growing it 10% to 11% to 12% the past couple of years.
"
500,MO,"They've seen better margins and better capital allocations and buybacks, but the crux is that they're a share gainer.
"
501,MO,"Corona grows faster than the U.S. market. There's a growing U.S. population of Latin Americans, and their favorite (beer) is Corona. But the mainstream U.S. is also drinking more Corona.
"
502,MO,"Constellation is also bringing Pacifico and Modelo as alternate brands to the U.S.
"
503,MO,"IBD: Is Middleby (MIDD) a play on growing U.S. GDP growth?
"
504,MO,"Yogasundram: It is a play on the U.S. economy in general. But you're also getting refreshes (in commercial kitchen equipment). For example, Chipotle (CMG) wants not only Mexican food, but also to move into pizza. McDonald's (MCD) wants to change their mix of items to more health friendly. So changing consumer tastes drives changes in equipment.

505,MO,"And Middleby sees growth in emerging markets. If Yum (YUM) wants to grow in China, it needs more restaurants, more ovens.Best Mutual Funds 2015: April Performance ReportThe $5.9 billion American Century Heritage Fund has been in a groove.Its return this year through April 30 was 6.42%.

"
521,MO,"Cabinet: If there's a government agency that ought to stay above the political fray, it's the Justice Department. But outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder used his department to pursue a racially polarizing political agenda.In his farewell speech Friday at Justice, Holder asserted that he restored Justice ""to what it always was — free of politicization and focused on the mission without any kind of interference from political outsiders.""This from the man who just last year proudly described himself as ""an activist attorney general.""In that same 2014 interview with Juan Williams, Holder admitted that he turned the civil rights division into a political weapon, adding ""(I am) proud of it.""""The responsibility of the attorney general is to change things,"" he asserted.Gee, and here we thought it was to apply the law equally.When he took office in 2009, Holder immediately signaled he would do the opposite.Career prosecutors brought to him an open-and-shut case of voter intimidation against club-wielding thugs of the New Black Panthers, who in 2008 tried to bully white voters at a Philadelphia polling place into voting for Obama. But Holder dismissed the case.He made it clear that he was only there to prosecute white people who intimidate black people, not the other way around. He had no intention of protecting the voting rights of every American, just the voting rights of select groups.And in an overtly political speech, he attacked America for being ""a nation of cowards"" for not seeing the same racist bogeymen he and his boss see lurking behind virtually every corner.Yet it was Holder who six years later still can't bring himself to talk about black-on-black murder — the real problem plaguing the inner city. The real cowardice was his refusal to address the young black fratricide in Chicago and other major cities.No, Holder didn't have the stomach to talk about that; because if he did, he'd have to address the welfare-induced, anti-family pathologies leading so many young black men to commit suicide by gang or suicide by cop.Holder only fed these pathologies by ginning up racism in Sanford, Fla., and Ferguson, Mo. He knew better. He was agitating, whipping up the mob to get out the black vote ahead of the 2012 and 2014 elections.""Mr. Holder was not beyond using scare tactics against minorities to win re-election,"" ex-Justice Department lawyer J. Christian Adams said. In fact, his ""job was to scare and mobilize minorities.""Adams also cites Holder's launch of a 2012 campaign against voter ID in South Carolina and other states with large black voter bases, in which he compared voter ID laws to the ""poll tax.""""Without a racially polarized and activated base,"" Adams said, ""Mr. Obama could not have won in 2012.""Holder also stacked his department with fellow activists, pushing out career lawyers ""to fill the rank-and-file with leftist lawyers,"" Adams said.The supposedly apolitical attorney general rejected his own inspector general's recommendation against hiring lawyers from left-wing civil rights groups, such as the Students of Color Coalition, the Black Organization of Soul Sisters, the Poverty and Race Research Action Council, the Workers' Center of Racial Justice and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.Yet Holder has the gall to claim in a ""legacy"" video posted on Justice's website, ""Attorney General Eric Holder: People's Attorney,"" that he ""depoliticized Justice Department hiring practices.""Holder was the first African American to be named the nation's top cop, a welcome and poignant milestone in our troubled history.But to the nation's detriment, he proved a polarizing, race-baiting radical who conducted himself in the most dishonest manner, enforcing the law for some groups and not for others.Holder injected politics into the law at every turn, leaving a legacy of racial scare tactics and division.
"
522,MO,"Leadership: When a big city mayor gives thumbs up to unbridled violence and chaos in her own town, she shouldn't be surprised when she gets it. Neither should those who voted for her and now will suffer the results.Here's what we know: Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old African-American man, was taken into custody by the police for possessing a switchblade knife. He ran from the police and resisted arrest. And sometime during his arrest, he was injured seriously — so seriously that he died a week later of spinal injuries in the hospital. The six police officers involved in the pursuit and arrest have been put on leave, and an investigation is underway. Those are the main facts so far.Yet, in our era of heightened racial sensitivity, and before all the facts are in, Gray's death has led to demonstrations and outright rioting in Baltimore.In the wake of last August's fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and the subsequent rioting and destruction of property there, one thing should be clear: Encouraging riots is both foolish and dangerous.However angry people might be, we're still a nation of laws. The legal system has to function for justice to be done. Rioting is a breakdown of public order that can ruin neighborhoods, communities and entire cities.That's why Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake's comments are truly astounding. Not only did she not tell those who were demonstrating to wait until all the facts were in, she seemed to encourage the worst elements among them to do violence.In a press conference Sunday, Rawlings-Blake said, ""I ... instructed (the police) to do everything that they could to make sure that the protesters were able to exercise their right to free speech. ... We also gave those who wished to destroy space to do that.""""Space"" to rob, loot and commit arson? Even after 35 people were arrested and six police officers injured during the protests? It was an extraordinarily inflammatory comment.Meanwhile, Baltimore police report ""credible information"" that an alliance of gangs has formed to ""take out"" cops — possible fallout from the mayor's remarks.It has been claimed that this violence was all the handiwork of ""outsiders."" ""The Baltimore Police Department believes that outside agitators continue to be the instigators behind acts of violence and destruction,"" Police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts told the media.Yes, some fanning the flames were outsiders. As several news organizations reported, one of them was Malik Shabazz, president of Black Lawyers for Justice and former head of the New Black Panther Party.Even so, you can't blame all the violence on Shabazz and other outsiders. The police blotter shows that of the 35 arrested, just three came from outside Maryland. So the discontent was mostly homegrown — the flames fanned by the city's own leaders.Baltimore's mayor should have had a very different message: That is, despite the anger, political violence won't help African Americans in Baltimore. Far from it. It will destroy businesses and property values and kill jobs — damage from which it will take years to recover.The police face a May 1 deadline for submitting their findings in the Freddie Gray case to Maryland's state prosecutor. The prosecutor, weighing the evidence, will then decide whether to press charges.Shouldn't people find out all the facts before protesting? And shouldn't politicians encourage peace rather than the destruction of the very communities they lead?

566,MO,"A shakeout among solar module makers will continue as the largest suppliers take advantage of manufacturing scale and squeeze rivals, says a Bernstein Research report.By 2018, solar combined with energy storage solutions will be much more competitive in supplying electricity, says Bernstein Research in a report. By then, consolidation could reshape the industry, writes Michael Parker, a Bernstein analyst.Module makers with manufacturing scale — Trina Solar (TSL), Canadian Solar (CSIQ), Jinkosolar Holding (JKS), JA Solar Holdings (JASO) and possibly Hanwha — will take market share from rivals with weaker balance sheets, he says.""The five large Chinese module manufacturers are likely to be around 40% of the market in 2015,"" Parker said in a report. ""The economics and the pricing power of the module manufacturers is changing, and arguably, barriers to entry in the form of scale are arising. We think the consolidation trend of the module/panel makers will continue, with the top 4-5 module makers taking more share from the smaller Japanese and Chinese makers.""Solar energy stocks plunged along with oil prices in 2014. IBD's Solar-Energy group has bounced back somewhat, now ranking No. 80 out of 197 industry groups from No. 190 three months ago. Stocks with the highest composite ratings include Canadian Solar, which has most of its manufacturing in China; JA Solar; Enphase Energy (ENPH), Solaredge Technologies (SEDG) and No. 1 solar panel maker First Solar (FSLR).""In our view, the panel manufacturers are breaking into three camps: scale, low-cost manufacturers taking share (Trina, Canadian Solar, Jinkosolar and JA Solar plus, arguably, Hanwha); downstream-focused businesses and manufacturers without the balance sheet flexibility to expand (First Solar, SunPower (SPWR), Yingli Green Energy (YGE), SolarWorld, REC Solar, Mo-tech and Renesola (SOL); and everyone else,"" said Parker in the report.Canadian Solar recently became the latest solar energy company to announce plans to form an asset-holding yield company, sending shares rising despite a Q4 earnings miss.Module makers, meanwhile, will see upside from over-capacity in the polysilicon market, says Parker. Polysilicon is the key ingredient used to make solar cells.In 2014, average gross margins were about 20% as production costs fell far faster than prices, he says.""The (polysilicon) industry has remained in a position of excess capacity,"" said Parker. ""Even with demand rising this year, inventories and new capacity should keep a cap on prices.""Parker says solar energy will become more competitive with gas, oil and coal. By 2018, he says solar and batter-based storage technologies will be competitive in providing residential electricity in markets such as Australia, Japan, Spain and Brazil, as well as parts of California.

Conceit is self-given; be careful.""He wrote in ""Wooden: A Lifetime of Observations and Reflections on and Off the Court,"" with Steve Jamison: ""Though I was pleased with the titles and championships, I mainly derived satisfaction from the preparation and knowing that I had done everything I could do to get the team ready. That is what pleased me most.""Ready For ActionGary Cunningham, who played for the Bruins and coached them a couple of years after Wooden retired, said: ""Coach Wooden didn't talk about winning; he felt if you did the work during the week's practices, the games on the weekend would take care of themselves. He was proactive in terms of preparation. He used to use the phrase failing to prepare is preparing to fail. He was a great teacher.""Of his NCAA domination, Wooden said: ""My players will tell you I never said to them, 'Here's our goal: a championship! If you don't do it, you haven't succeeded.' They understood very well what I considered success.""He spent years formulating his Pyramid of Success, pointing out: ""Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did the best to become the best you are capable of becoming."" Wooden's best was stellar: As a college basketball coach for 29 years, first at Indiana State from 1946-48, then at UCLA from 1948-75, he went 664-162 for an .804 winning percentage. He never had a losing season. His UCLA teams won seven straight titles from 1967-73. Won 88 straight games from January 1971 to January 1974. He became the first person elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as both a player and a coach.""John Wooden is the greatest basketball coach of all time,"" wrote former UCLA center and Hall of Famer Bill Walton for the book ""Wooden."" ""Wooden taught us how to focus on one primary objective: Be the best you can be in whatever endeavor you undertake.""""Character is the basis of leadership, and Coach Wooden he had it,"" said another former UCLA center, Ralph Drollinger. ""His character was impeccable.""Said Cunningham: ""Coach Wooden demanded excellence and demanded we do things correctly.""Another former UCLA center and Hall of Famer, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, wrote: ""Coach taught us self-discipline, and was always his own best example.""Born in Hall, Ind., Wooden was a product of the moral values and work ethic of his parents, Joshua and Roxie. Joshua instilled in John and his brothers uncompromising honesty, being true to oneself, perseverance, empathy and kindness.As a scholar and a basketball star at Purdue University, Wooden was a three-time All-American and the College Player of the Year in 1932. He led the Boilermakers to the national championship that year, pre-NCAA tournament.Bliss And BasketballWooden had found the love of his life in high school when he met Nellie Riley. The two married in 1932 and raised two children until her 1985 death. He remarked in his later years that he didn't fear death because he'd be reunited with her.Wooden began his coaching career at the high school level in the 1930s and early '40s until World War II service in the Navy called.A year after war's end, he became the head coach at Indiana State.He made his mark there with a 17-8 record his first season, then helped integrate the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics tourney in Kansas City, Mo. He refused its 1947 invitation because it banned black players, and Wooden had one, Clarence Walker. The NAIA relented the next year.In the fall of 1948, Wooden took over at UCLA. He produced winning seasons in the most difficult of conditions, which included no permanent home arena or proper practice facility until Pauley Pavilion opened on campus in June 1965.Wooden's first taste of the Final Four didn't come until 1962, when his Bruins lost in the semifinals.Then came the NCAA titles. The constant throughout was Wooden's preparation. ""He was such a great X's or O's coach because he was prepared,"" Drollinger said. ""He was just a great practice coach. We didn't waste a minute in terms of preparation.""Cunningham, a Wooden assistant for a decade, said his boss ""believed in fundamentals and he was a great teacher. We would plan practices in the morning; every practice was intimately planned.""Wooden wrote in ""My Personal Best,"" also with Jamison: ""Organization, which I define as knowing what must be done and doing it in the allotted time, became a strength of mine."" He planned practices ""down to the exact minute on three-by-five inch cards and in notebooks, so there was never any standing around waiting for something to happen. Planning the practice took longer than the practice itself.""The 1973-74 season saw UCLA's record winning streak come to an end, as did its title streak. And future Hall of Famers Walton and Jamaal Wilkes graduated.The next season, even with Dave Myers, Marques Johnson and Richard Washington starting, pundits dismissed the Bruins' title shot.Wooden responded by producing a 23-3 regular season, then three tournament wins to return to the Final Four. Now Wooden faced his longtime assistant, Denny Crum, who was Louisville's head coach. The Bruins won in overtime. After congratulating Crum on what Wooden called a perfect game, the Wizard of Westwood began his routine of going to the pressroom for a postgame interview. Then it hit him.""I just couldn't bring myself to talk to reporters about the game. I don't know why, but something in my head just said, 'It's over,'"" he wrote. So he headed to the locker room instead of the pressroom.Amid the excitement of his players reaching the title game, Wooden waited for them to quiet down, then spoke: ""You've given me as much pleasure as any team I've ever coached, and never caused a single problem on or off the court. I want to thank you for that. It means so much to me, because you are the last team I will ever coach. I'm bowing out.""He later insisted he didn't share his retirement plans with the team for motivational purposes: ""There should never be a need for me to give a pep talk. ... The motivation must come from the players' belief — deeply entrenched — that the ultimate success lies in giving their personal best. More than anything, I wanted players to love the process of doing that.""Two days later, Wooden won his 10th national title as UCLA beat Kentucky 92-85.Of his decision to retire, he recalled thinking, ""It was time to get on with other things."" And he did for the next 35 years.Wooden went on to write numerous books sharing his wisdom.When Orlando Magic Executive Vice President Pat Williams came calling, Wooden, in his mid-90s, happily assisted in Williams' book ""How To Be Like Coach Wooden.""Meanwhile, Wooden was an in-demand speaker. And his legendary Encino, Calif., condo became a pilgrimage spot for former players, assistants, their families and anyone who made arrangements to meet the coach.""As we say goodbye for now,"" he wrote in ""The Wisdom of Wooden,"" his last with Jamison soon before dying, ""I would like to remind you of my dad's advice. ... 'Make each day your masterpiece.' For the better part of a century I have attempted to do that.""

580,MO,"Justice: The shooting of two police at a ""peaceful"" Ferguson, Mo., demonstration can be linked to Eric Holder's policies. Loretta Lynch must be brought back to the committee and asked if things will change if she replaces him.Federal prosecutor Lynch's nomination to succeed Attorney General Eric Holder has been delayed over immigration issues and a human trafficking bill. But as refreshing as it may be to see the Republican Senate not rubber-stamp such a crucial Obama appointment, the real issue, which Republicans should not be shy to weigh in on, is whether Lynch will continue Holder's extreme policies.The advertising on the Obama presidency was always that it would unite the nation, especially racially: no more blue America or red America, but the United States of America. Black, white, brown and yellow would all mix into a peaceful pastel. The first president with a particular skin color, assisted by the first such AG, would bring the country together.Certainly, millions of non-black voters were convinced by the promise. Instead, the two have gone out of their way to divide Americans.Holder's Justice Department earlier this month issued an analysis contending that the police in Ferguson, where Officer Darren Wilson was found innocent of wrongdoing in the shooting of Michael Brown, practice systemized racial discrimination, and Holder threatened to dismantle the force.The Ferguson demonstrations against the police surely would have petered out without the report. But during one such protest last week, two police were shot. Holder responded with one of the left's neat damage-control tricks: start sounding like someone on the right.The incident was ""a pure ambush,"" he said. ""This was a damn punk,"" Holder said of the suspect. But it was Holder who fanned the flames, whatever his feigned after-the-fact claims to be shocked — shocked! — to find violence now going on against the police.Republicans newly elected to power in the Senate cannot allow this to continue. And that's why it's not enough just to delay a Loretta Lynch floor vote; she must be brought back and asked whether she intends to continue Holder's war on law enforcement. The lives of the brave men and women who wear blue are of more importance than any other issue regarding Lynch.Currently on the fence regarding her nomination are GOP Sens. Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker of Tennessee, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rob Portman of Ohio. Now would be a good time for them to stand up for police departments across the nation against mob violence and demand the Obama Justice Department start doing the same.Democrats always take the opportunity to derail Republican presidents' nominations — most shamelessly in the case of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who was dragged back before the Senate Judiciary Committee to answer slanderous, unsubstantiated charges. How about some hardball from the GOP for the sake of a good cause — protecting the nation's police from unfair racialist accusations?Get back in front of that committee, Loretta.

590,MO,"Lawlessness: The latest casualties in Eric Holder's anti-cop race war are two Ferguson, Mo., officers shot at a protest rally. The ambush follows the attorney general smearing the entire Ferguson police force as racist.'Acknowledgment nine months ago would have kept that from happening!"" one protester shouted, referring to the August police shooting of Michael Brown.""It's time for the (people) to finally fight back against these racist ass pigs!"" another protester tweeted.Just hours earlier, Ferguson's police chief stepped down in response to Holder's 100-page report claiming Ferguson police engaged in systemic racism against local blacks.""Nothing in this travesty of a report proves that, and the fact that Justice produced a report so buffoonish, so replete with conclusions unsupported by facts, so lacking in basic methodological rigor, is an embarrassment,"" blasted U.S. Commission on Civil Rights member Peter Kirsanow, who is black.But ""the report has accomplished its objective,"" Kirsanow added. ""It's smeared police officers across the country, giving the administration excuse to exert greater control over local police departments.""It's also enlarged the target on their backs. Holder excused anti-cop violence that broke out after the Brown shooting, suggesting it was justified by his overall findings.""Members of the community may not have been responding only to a single isolated confrontation, but also to a pervasive, corrosive and deeply unfortunate lack of trust — attributable to ... abuses, unreasonable searches and seizures, and excessive and dangerous use of force ... against African Americans,"" he said, only encouraging more violence against cops.Remember: The first casualties in Holder's war on cops were the two New York Police Department officers assassinated in December by a young black man seeking revenge for what Holder claimed were racially motivated police shootings of black men.Before Ismaaiyl Brinsley ambushed and killed the NYPD cops as they sat in their cruiser, Holder personally egged on anti-cop protesters in St. Louis and New York with his race rhetoric. He even huddled with racial arsonist Al Sharpton to coordinate an agitation campaign as he did in Sanford, Fla., after the Trayvon Martin shooting.Holder insisted that law enforcement do not treat black citizens fairly, that they profile young black men in particular. Blacks have good reason to distrust police, he said, given the history of discrimination in America.Holder even said he's been personally harassed by police and has counseled his son to be wary of cops. He announced that he was doubling the number of civil rights investigations of police departments, already numbering 20.Message: The Ferguson police, NYPD and many other police forces across the country are a bunch of racists; and if you are black, you may be in their cross hairs.So now we have two racially charged cop ambushes, and the blood of these victims is on Holder's hands. It's clear he has a personal grudge against cops and that he wrote his specious report to confirm his own biases.Now he says he's sorry the cops got shot in the backlash he fueled. But does he really find the attacks ""repugnant""? Do they really ""turn"" his stomach?After all, this is the same man who tried to hire the top defender of unrepentant cop-killer Mumia Abu-Jamal as his civil rights chief, and who has refused to seek the death penalty for four black cop-killers in Virginia.And now he won't demand the extradition of cop-killer Joanne Chesimard from Cuba, despite normalized relations. She and Abu-Jamal were Black Panthers, the same militant group Holder refused to prosecute for trying to intimidate white voters into voting for Obama in the 2008 election.Holder has his own ""unconscious bias,"" as he likes to accuse cops of having, and we fear it runs deeper than just smearing cops as racist.

593,MO,"Selma: After ignoring the battle that ended slavery under the first Republican president, President Obama at the 50th anniversary of Democrats' blocking the Selma bridge says, ""We're the slaves that built the White House.""The parts of American history that this president chooses to commemorate and what he says about them speaks volumes about his view of America and American history.His America is not only unexceptional, it is perpetually and deeply racist, an overbearing world bully with no right to lecture the world about morality, democracy or freedom.He reminded us over the weekend that despite any progress since then, ""We just need to open our eyes, our ears and our hearts to know that this nation's racial history still casts its long shadow upon us."" Or just look at the police department in Ferguson, Mo.?To Obama, the White House is not the home of the leaders of the world's oldest democracy, but a structure built by slaves.It's also the place George Washington made beer, he told NBC's Samantha Guthrie in a Super Bowl interview. Problem is, the White House was finished in 1800, George Washington never slept there and the first president to live there was our second, John Adams.His reference to slaves building the White House came during the observance of the 50th anniversary of the civil rights march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala.It is a significant part of American history and one that deserves commemoration. But it should not be exploited as a springboard for distorting that history or for continuing to paint an America that elected and re-elected an African American president as perpetually and irredeemably racist.The bridge was named for Edmund Winston Pettus, a Confederate brigadier general, U.S. senator from Alabama and grand dragon of the Alabama Ku Klux Klan. He was a Democrat, as were the officeholders in the ""solid South"" of 1965.We tend to forget it was Democrats who unleashed the dogs and turned fire hoses against civil rights marchers. It was Democrats who stood in the schoolhouse door and are still there by opposing school choice and trapping minority children in failing schools.We forget that it was Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia, a former ""grand kleagle"" in the Ku Klux Klan, who led a 62-day filibuster against the Civil Rights Act of 1964.We forget that the act would never have been possible without Republican leadership, that legislation was not only a personal victory for Illinois Republican Sen. Everett Dirksen, then minority leader, but Republicans in both the House and Senate who supported the measure in far greater percentages than Democrats.Only six GOP senators voted against the act, compared with 21 Democrats.Speaking at the Selma ceremony, President Obama rightly noted that there ""are places and moments in America where this nation's destiny has been decided"" and that many ""are sites of war — Concord and Lexington, Appomattox and Gettysburg.""Except he never made it to the 150th anniversary of the Gettysburg Address, celebrated at a site just 65 miles from the White House built by slaves.It was an address by the first Republican president to commemorate the battle that saved the Union and ended slavery, at the very high cost of 51,112 men's lives.President Obama announced his presidential candidacy in 2007 near Lincoln's law office in Springfield, Ill. In 2009 and 2013, he took the oath of office using Lincoln's Bible.Yet he couldn't make it to Gettysburg, where the long and difficult struggle towards true racial justice and equality really began.Gettysburg is where we as a nation apologized for slavery.

678,MO,"Law And Order: As President Obama's government wages its War on Cops, a new report finds a 56% jump in cop-killings — many ambushed and shot by black suspects, just like the two NYPD officers executed in Brooklyn.The mainstream media have written off the Dec. 20 shooting deaths of NYPD officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos as an ""isolated incident,"" arguing the real threat is from white cops ""targeting"" black men.They say their black killer, Ismaaiyl Abdullah Brinsley, was ""deranged"" when he sneaked up to their parked patrol car and shot them in the head. They dismissed his vengeful act as a ""one-off"" or ""lone"" event.In fact, Liu and Ramos were two of 50 law enforcement officers shot and killed in the line of duty in 2014. That number is up 56% from 2013, when 32 gun-related police deaths were reported, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund.Brinsley was hardly alone in targeting and ambushing police. His attack was more of a copycat crime. ""Fifteen officers were shot and killed in ambush, more than any other circumstance of fatal shootings, in 2014,"" said the Washington-based police fund.The White House and its press popinjays have made great hay of the racial element in the Ferguson, Mo., and Staten Island, N.Y., cases involving black suspects who died while resisting arrest.But they completely overlook the race factor in recent shootings of police. Here is a sampling: December: Marco Antonio Parilla Jr. allegedly shot and killed — and even ran over — Tarpon Springs (Fla.) officer Charles Kondek after the former NYPD cop responded to a noise complaint at a home near Tampa. Parilla, 23, is biracial, while Kondek, 45, was white. July: Police say Lawrence Campbell, a 27-year-old African-American, ambushed and murdered Jersey City, N.J., police officer Melvin Santiago and his partner after they answered a robbery-in-progress call at a drugstore. Santiago, 23, was gunned down in a hail of bullets fired by the ex-con, who moments earlier boasted to a bystander he was ""going to be famous."" July: Carl Le'Ellis Blount Jr., a 25-year-old black man, was charged in the shooting death of Gary, Ind., police officer Jeffrey Westerfield, who was white. Westerfield was responding to a shots-fired call in a domestic dispute when Blount allegedly shot him while he sat in his squad car. The officer, who would have turned 47 that day, never even pulled his weapon before he was shot in the head. July: Authorities say Major Davis Jr. shot and killed Indianapolis police officer Perry Renn after the 25-year-old black suspect brandished an assault rifle and Renn and another officer confronted him. Davis refused orders to put the gun down, and a five-minute gun battle ensued. Twenty-two-year veteran Renn, who was white, died shortly after being struck by bullets, while Davis survived surgery from his gunshot wounds. June: Two young black men — Quintylan Richard, 20, and Baylon Taylor, 19 — allegedly murdered Vermilion Parish, La., Sheriff's Deputy Allen Bares, as the 51-year-old officer investigated a home break-in. The white officer was shot several times. May: Police say Marvin Louis Guy shot Killeen, Texas, Police Det. Charles ""Chuck"" Dinwiddie in the face as he and SWAT officers served a warrant at his home. Guy is black, Dinwiddie was white. The 50-year-old Guy, who allegedly wounded two other officers in the assault, faces one count of capital murder and three counts of attempted capital murder.Evidence clearly shows police face a lethal and growing threat from black criminals. So when will the pundits talk about this disturbing trend?

685,MO,"War On Cops: As two NYPD officers were laid to rest, deadly attacks against police have exploded across the country, the outcome of leftist anti-police protests. The left can't wash its hands of this with phony tears at funerals.The murdered New York officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were barely in their graves after being eulogized by Vice President Joe Biden and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio when new attacks — from targeted shootings to credible Internet threats — flared up across the land.In Durham, N.C., police were shot at in an unprovoked Christmas night attack, while on Sunday officers were shot at with rifles in Los Angeles, prompting a citywide alert. There was another shooting in the Tampa Bay area of Florida. And 11 would-be shooters in Chicago, Pennsylvania and New York all posted credible Internet threats.In an atmosphere like this, it's pretty obvious that there's a war against the police, and not surprisingly the security of all law-abiding people is already suffering.On Monday, the New York Post reported that police were refraining from enforcing penalties for small crimes now, fearful of any confrontation that might inflame racial tensions.That's exceptionally bad news, given that New York was cured of its ugly ""Shattered"" and ""Fun City"" reality (as Mick Jagger and Bill Buckley respectively put it) only by Mayor Rudy Giuliani's emphasis on enforcing punishment for small crimes so that large ones could not occur — the so-called ""broken windows theory"" of law enforcement.There's little doubt where the blame lies: with the race-baiters and communist organizing groups who have taken their cues from the wink-and-nod encouragement from political leaders at the top.Leaders from President Obama to de Blasio have embraced the radical ""narrative"" that all police are ""Bull Connor""-style predators on black people, along with the de facto message that the police do not have the right to defend themselves in a confrontation.That was clearly evident in these political leaders' stances in favor of mob protests over grand jury rulings, first in Ferguson, Mo., when a thug attacked a cop to a bad end. It was the cop, cleared by a grand jury, who was forced to resign amid protests. Similar incidents occured in New York and Cleveland.It didn't help that Obama used race-baiter Al Sharpton as a go-to man on race, inviting the ""leader"" to the White House 81 times. It also didn't help that he made apologetic remarks to the U.N. about Ferguson, again underlining that police have no right to self-defense.With a message like that, it shouldn't surprise anyone that thugs with rifles and an urge to scream fire in a crowded theatre would act up — and very quickly.It's a disastrous and foolish action, effectively announcing to criminals that the consequences for hunting down cops is nonexistent to small.Personal security is the foremost of human rights, as writer Robert Young Pelton has noted, and there's no disputing that cops protect far more than they harm.It's time for a serious response from political leaders, because the fire this time has already started.

732,MO,"Incitement: Leftist groups, whose inflammatory, racialist rhetoric incited Isamaaiyl Brinsley to kill two New York police officers, have made it clear: They'll keep on sowing hate and divisiveness despite the murders.Democratic leaders, ranging from President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder to New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and ""civil rights leader"" and MSNBC showman Al Sharpton, have been complicit in whipping angry crowds into a frenzy in recent weeks and months.It came to a head last week at a rally protesting the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner led by Sharpton, where this chant was heard: ""What do we want? Dead cops.""Well, they got their wish. Ismaaiyl Brinsley, the alleged killer who may have had ties to the radical, prison-based Black Guerrilla Family, attended the rally, according to police officials. He took video of the protest, which included threats of violence directed at the police.Obviously agitated, Brinsley put this chilling post on Instagram shortly before NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were murdered: ""I'm putting wings on pigs today. They take 1 of ours . .. let's take 2 of theirs,"" an apparent reference to the killing of Brown and Garner by police.There can be no doubt that the demonstrations had a serious impact on Brinsley — and, who knows, maybe others just like him who have yet to act.As such, you might think that even left-wing anti-police groups would have a twinge of conscience following the brutal cold-blooded assassination of two minority New York cops. But you'd be wrong.Sharpton immediately moon-walked away from responsibility, expressing remorse for the deaths but refusing to call off further demonstrations. He did what all demagogues do — he legalistically parsed words: ""Is a vigil a protest?"" he asked. ""Is a rally?""Taking his lead, New York activist groups flatly refused Mayor de Blasio's request to not hold any demonstrations until after the slain officers' funerals. The Answer Coalition, the extreme-left umbrella group that has fueled the protests, called de Blasio's attempt to cool things off ""outrageous.""It wasn't just in New York. Leftist organizers in Ferguson, Mo., where 300-pound petty criminal Michael Brown was killed after attacking a police officer, said they hoped to revive demonstrations in the small town.Bassem Masri, who had the grand distinction of being invited to Holder's Justice Department to consult on police reform, took to the microphone Saturday to mock the murder of the two New York policemen.""Pigs in a blanket,"" he and others chanted, ""smell like bacon."" By the way, Brinsley Instagrammed that first phrase — ""pigs in a blanket"" — before gunning down the two officers as they sat in a police car in Brooklyn.So the obscene assault by the left and their enablers in the Democratic Party on civil society — and the police who stand between us and chaos — continues.And this is more than a little ironic, given new revelations emerging from our federal government about the harrassment of conservative groups by the IRS and others in the Obama government.A new report by Rep. Darrel Issa's House Oversight Committee brings further evidence that IRS employees went after, as one lefty bureaucrat put it, ""icky"" conservative organizations. It's part of a pattern.For the last six years, conservative Tea Party groups and citizens like the wealthy Koch brothers have been vilified and harrassed by the Obama government, the media, left-wing groups and organized labor.Democratic politicians have routinely accused law-abiding conservative groups of harboring violent and racist tendencies. No proof. Just accusations.Meanwhile, Democratic politicians have instigated, led and encouraged the extreme-left demonstrations now spinning out of control. They are, in fact and reality, violent — and have now even led to murder. Where's the outrage about that?That this is happening now should come as no surprise. After six years, it is, sadly, the racially and politically divided America that our failed president has bequeathed.

Taser crossed above its 50-day line on Oct. 28 and is far extended above the 50-day and 200-day.Police agencies have adopted officer-worn cameras and video storage systems in the wake of a series of prominent police shootings, including lack teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in August; and Ezell Ford by two L.A. police officers on Aug. 11.L.A. will place an initial order for the first 860 Taser cameras this quarter for delivery in the first half of 2015. In all, the city plans to buy about 7,000 cameras.No financial terms were given. But based on prior contracts with law enforcement agencies, the agreement will amount to millions in added revenue for Taser over the five-year rollout period.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.

745,MO,"Black Crime: If President Obama had a son, he might look like 15-year-old Demario Bailey, one of three killed and 30 wounded in a typical Chicago weekend by thugs who wanted his Bulls jacket.As Bailey was being murdered while walking with his twin brother to a school basketball game, protestors of police brutality marched down Chicago's ritzy Michigan Avenue. They told high-end shoppers there that ""black lives matter,"" held up their hands and said ""don't shoot,"" and wore shirts that proclaimed ""I can't breathe."" The protest was part of a series of demonstrations also being held in Washington, New York, Boston and California.""We're going to keep the light on Mike Brown .. . on all the victims. The only way you make roaches run is to keep the lights on,"" said Al Sharpton, who will not be attending Demario's funeral due to scheduling conflicts, and whose National Action Network organized the Washington rally.We should instead keep the light on Demario and the other young African-Americans whose lives are snuffed out every day, many for refusing to join gangs. They are young men accused of ""acting white"" because they don't drop out of school to hang on street corners, who do their homework at night, who speak in intelligible sentences and who walk with their siblings to school basketball games.These black victims do not commit strong-armed robberies of convenience stores or assault police officers and struggle for their guns, as Brown allegedly did in Ferguson, Mo. If the outcome there had been different, we might not even know Brown's name and Darren Wilson would have been just one more dead police officer in America.We should shine a light on the truth that, according to recent FBI statistics and data from the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice at the Centers for Disease Control, young black males are likely to be killed by other black males, and white officers are more likely the victims than the villains in gun violence involving African-Americans.The CDC statistics show that police killings of blacks have declined 70% over the past 50 years.In 2012, 123 blacks were killed by officers with guns vs. 326 whites. Fact is, 60% of black victims of homicide are killed by other blacks, as was the case with Demario. In 2013, blacks committed 5,375 murders while whites committed 4,396.According to the FBI, which just released its supplemental homicide data for 2012, ""white"" homicide victims, a category that includes Hispanics, are twice as likely to be killed by black assailants than black homicide victims are to be killed by ""white"" assailants. There were 431 black killers of whites vs. 193 ""white"" killers of blacks.These statistics are made more remarkable by the fact that blacks represent only 13% of the population. Blacks are also disproportionately represented among cop killers. In 2013, blacks made up 42% of all cop-killers whose race was known.Last year, Janay McFarlane, 18, was killed just hours after her younger sister was among a group of teens who were onstage as President Obama gave a speech in Chicago on gun violence. Destini McFarlane, 14, sat just feet away as the president spoke of a similar murder of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton.There will be more black victims such as these, and more Demario Baileys, until self-appointed and self-righteous leaders, Sharpton included, are drowned out by those who recognize that the danger to black lives is not white cops but black thugs.

746,MO,"Justice: Led by the Senate chaplain, of all people, congressional staffers fan the flames of racial division by doing something that Michael Brown of Ferguson, Missouri, never did before he assaulted officer Darren Wilson.It mattered not to the congressional aides who walked off their jobs Thursday to protest the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and Eric Garner in New York that a police officer dies while on duty every 58 hours — or that a grand jury found that officer Darren Wilson had reason to fear becoming one of them.There they were, raising their hands in a gesture that black witnesses testifying before a grand jury said Michael Brown never made as he charged Wilson ""like a football player"" and after he punched Wilson and struggled for the cop's firearm.There was Senate chaplain Barry Black, standing in front of 210 staffers and a few congressmen, saying, ""Forgive us when we have failed to lift our voices for those who can't speak or breathe for themselves.""That was a thinly veiled reference to what Garner reportedly said as he struggled with police officers led by a black female sergeant, all unaware of his medical issues, in New York.The fact is, if neither Garner nor Brown had resisted arrest, both would be alive today.No longer able to speak or breathe for themselves are the 1,501 police officers that the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund reports have died in the line of duty in the past 10 years, an average of one every 58 hours. Over that decade, on average, have been 58,261 assaults against police officers every year, resulting in 15,658 injuries annually caused by criminal assailants who, like Brown, never put their hands up.One of those cops was Daryl Pierson, 32, of Rochester, N.Y., who was killed by Thomas Johnson III, wanted for a parole violation, as he fled from one of those routine traffic stops the likes of Al Sharpton cite as racial profiling and ""driving while black.""President Obama once famously said that if he had a son he would look like Trayvon Martin, the Florida teen shot and killed by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. It is not known if he is willing to make the same claim about Johnson.""These congressional staffers put in incredibly long hours, nights and weekends, to pass legislation to help people lead better lives, so I fully support them,"" said Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who said the protest was to show how ""incredibly frustrated"" they are by the Brown and Garner deaths and the ""mistrust"" these and other protesters have in the criminal justice system.Would that be the same criminal justice system that put Thomas Johnson III back on the streets?Cops of all colors also put in incredibly long hours, nights and weekends protecting those people striving to lead better lives. Instead of thanks, they get lectures on profiling and racial sensitivity from grandstanding politicians and Attorney General Eric Holder.Waynesboro, Va., is not Ferguson, Mo., and 45-year-old reserve police officer Kevin Quick is not Michael Brown.According to police, Quick was set upon by three siblings and a fourth man, and was carjacked, kidnapped and taken from bank to bank to withdraw money using his own debit card at gunpoint before being shot to death.Holder has taken the death penalty off the table in this case, and the four defendants will instead face the possibility of life without parole, lest they unfairly face the ultimate penalty from a mistrusted criminal justice system. Kevin Quick's death penalty cannot be revoked, a risk every cop faces every day.When a cop dies, there are no riots or protests. Just another cop funeral.

751,MO,"War On Cops: True to his word, Attorney General Eric Holder has released new national ""anti-profiling"" guidelines directing law enforcement to ignore ""statistical evidence"" generated by his own department.'Even if there were overall statistical evidence of differential rates of commission of certain offenses among individuals possessing particular characteristics, the affirmative use of such generalized notions by law enforcement officers in routine, spontaneous law enforcement activities is tantamount to stereotyping,"" and therefore punishable, Holder warned in his 12-page guidance.""Even if?"" Holder's acting dumb. He's fully aware such evidence exists. And it's highly relevant to proactive policing, because it shows stark differences in criminal behavior between blacks and whites.In fact, recent Justice Department reports reveal that African-Americans commit 53% of all murders, and 10 times more violent crime than whites. Young black men, more alarmingly, make up only 1% of the population but commit a whopping 27% of the nation's murders.Most of this violent crime occurs in urban areas. But now, under the new federal anti-profiling regime, law enforcement cannot target these high-crime areas if they're predominantly black or Latino. Nor can they associate ethnic gangs with ""a certain ethnicity.""The federal guidelines are expected to heavily influence local law enforcement.Holder this week is also briefing local police chiefs on the policy changes. He hopes that once federal agencies implement these standards, they'll set an example for local law enforcement agencies to adopt as well.Holder's also requiring federal agents to go through ""de-biasing"" training, something he's already mandated for several major city police departments as part of consent orders he's forced through discrimination investigations. The training, which tries to cleanse cops of ""unconscious bias,"" has led to a phenomenon known as ""de-policing"" in high-crime areas.Seattle, for one, is suffering a crime wave following federally mandated police retraining. Its cops are suing Holder for forcing them to ignore crime in the hood. Downtown residents have complained to the mayor that police are no longer protecting them from thugs.New Orleans also has seen crime spike since falling under Holder's de-biasing orders.Holder says the guidance is necessary to end ""racial profiling"" in the wake of ""recent incidents"" in which black men have died in confrontations with white police officers. But neither of the cases he's referencing had anything to do with profiling.In Ferguson, Mo., police were responding to a robbery by a man described as black. In Staten Island, N.Y., police were responding to complaints from business owners that a man described as black was bootlegging cigarettes outside their stores. In both cases, the suspects died while resisting arrest.Holder wants cops to do more ""community policing,"" which means more talking and less arresting.""Good law enforcement work also requires that officers take steps to know their surroundings even before there is a specific threat,"" the guidance intones. ""Getting to know a community and its features can be critical to building partnerships and facilitating dialogues, which can be good for communities and law enforcement alike.""But that didn't work in Ferguson. According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Ferguson police were known for reaching out to residents even in the violent neighborhood where Michael Brown was shot. Officers were ""on a first-name basis with residents"" there, and even gave ""people rides home during snowstorms."" The chief put patrolmen through diversity training each year.Still, Holder says it's OK to target a high-crime minority neighborhood for community outreach, just not for crime-fighting.His guidance actually urges law enforcement to ""map out the features of the city within its area of responsibility in order to gain a better understanding of outreach opportunities"" and obtain ""information from public sources regarding population demographics, including concentrations of ethnic groups.""""This activity is permissible,"" Holder says, failing to see the contradiction in his policy.If police back off from effectively policing high-crime areas, the law-abiding minorities under violent siege there will be hurt the most.

754,MO,"Racial Politics: The boy who cried wolf has more credibility than this president and his attorney general. They cried ""Racism!"" in Sanford, Ferguson and now Staten Island, and have been proved wrong in each case.Within minutes of jurors clearing a white NYPD cop in the death of African-American suspect Eric Garner, President Obama phoned Eric Holder, who, in turn, launched a federal investigation into perceived civil-rights violations. The probe follows those already underway in Ferguson, Mo., and Sanford, Fla.Never mind that a predominantly minority grand jury, sifting through all the evidence, found that the force used to subdue the 6-foot-3-inch, 350-pound Garner was reasonable. Or that Garner was caught on video repeatedly resisting arrest after breaking the law, though the career criminal knew the drill following 31 previous arrests. Or that cops showed no racial animus. Or that a black sergeant supervised them.Such exonerating facts have zero effect on Obama, who seems bent on seeding distrust in the U.S. justice system as part of a radical racial agenda.Hoover Institution scholar Thomas Sowell said the president ""wants to spread paranoia"" in the black community, adding, ""What amazes me is how long it has taken so many people to see through this man.""Obama asserted the Garner case ""speaks to the larger issues that we've been talking about now for the last week, the last month, the last year — and, sadly, for decades — and that is the concern on the part of too many minority communities that law enforcement is not dealing with them in a fair way.""Implying America remains institutionally biased against blacks is a serious charge. And it's a scurrilous one. Study after study has found no bias in the arrest, prosecution or sentencing of African-Americans.Tearing down respect for the justice system is bad enough. But it's hardly the only institution Obama has accused of structural bias. He and his race-baiting attorney general have also framed banking, education and housing, among others, as equally racist.Consider everyone they've accused of bias in the past six years: mortgage lenders, loan service companies, auto lenders, small business lenders, payday lenders, student loan companies, home insurers, investment bankers, credit card companies, branch bankers charging overdraft fees, credit reporting agencies, medical debt collectors, supermarket chains without enough stores in blighted areas, mayors and local zoning boards limiting subsidized housing, the 48 states barring felons from voting and employers using criminal and credit background checks to screen job applicants.They've even accused school principals, teachers, resource officers and curriculum directors of discriminating against black students.In this massive calumny, they've failed to cite a single example of intentional discrimination. Or ID a single victim by name. In every complaint, they've leveled ambiguous charges of ""implicit"" bias based on ""disparate impact,"" a discredited theory based on raw stats which fail to control for legitimate factors explaining racial disparities. That's because they have no proof, just like in Sanford, Ferguson and Staten Island, N.Y.Yet hundreds of billions of dollars are being redistributed based on these false claims of discrimination.Worse, policies governing everything from bank lending and school discipline to hiring and credit-risk analysis are being revamped to produce the desired racial outcomes — that is, quotas — demanded by this president.Now, with the administration investigating more than 20 police departments across the country for ""biased policing,"" the same will be done for arrest, stop and search policies in communities of color.

756,MO,"Ferguson: Charles Barkley could sit back and enjoy the fruits of his stellar basketball career. Instead, placing others before himself, he's telling the charlatans who pose as black leaders where they can get off.It takes guts to tell your own people hard truths, but famed power forward Sir Charles has always displayed toughness. In 1991, he got into trouble for spitting at a white New Jersey Nets fan shouting racist names at him — only for it to land on the wrong fan.No one can say Barkley is oblivious to racial bigotry. ""We've always had a racial issue in this country,"" he told CNN on Wednesday. ""And the biggest problem with it is, we never discuss race until something bad with it happens.""Now his aim is true, and he's got Al Sharpton in his sights, along with the other parasites who feed on black misery, set the stage for rioting and blame every black problem on white racism while ignoring the corrosive effects of government-instigated pathologies like welfare dependency and single motherhood.With another grand jury refusing Wednesday to indict a white police officer — this one New York City's Daniel Pantaleo in the chokehold death of Eric Garner, a black man who was allegedly resisting arrest — Barkley's courageous comments couldn't be better timed.Garner's mother and son are making statements alongside Sharpton in the wake of the grand jury decision, so the same dangerous climate of possible street violence is now brewing, this time in the Big Apple.Barkley said that he won't back away from calling the looters in Ferguson, Mo., ""scumbags.""  ""When you're looting people's property, that's what you are,"" he said.  ""You wouldn't want people to do it to your house.""He also calls it ""just flat-out ridiculous"" to believe that white cops purposely kill black people. ""Cops are actually awesome,"" he declared. ""You know, they're the only thing in the ghetto between this place being the wild, wild west.""""We as black people, we got a lot of crooks,"" Barkley added. ""We have to look ourself in the mirror. There's a reason they racially profile us at times. Sometimes it's wrong, but sometimes it's right. So to sit there and act like we hold no responsibility for some of this stuff, that's disingenuous.""The man known in the NBA as ""the Round Mound of Rebound"" said that the jury in Ferguson got it right in not indicting white officer Darren Wilson in the killing of 18-year-old black robbery suspect Michael Brown.  Barkley was also sure to ruffle feathers by saying of the killing and its riotous aftermath: ""We don't have to have Al Sharpton go there.""""We have the same sad sack of black characters"" after every controversial incident in the black community involving race, Barkley said. Instead, he contended, ""We need some strong black men in St. Louis to stand up and say, 'Hey, let's handle this situation.'""Barkley is the opposite of Sharpton. When black well-being improves, Sharpton loses relevance — and revenues. Barkley, on the other hand, has nothing to gain and everything to lose from speaking tough truths.He could spend the rest of his life charging fans for autographs and making endorsements; instead, he offers real leadership and risks making himself unpopular and unjustly targeted for ridicule by Sharpton and the rest of the phony leaders and their blind followers.It takes a black sports icon to exercise the leadership that should be coming from the first black president.

757,MO,"Crime: A pointless national task force on Ferguson, Mo., won't reverse an unassailable grand jury decision on officer Darren Wilson. The ""solvable problem"" that President Obama says ""Ferguson laid bare"" isn't the problem.When it comes to the challenges of urban crime, law enforcement, racial friction and seemingly intractable poverty, one objective should top the list for our elected leaders: Keep innocents who live and work in places like Ferguson, most of whom are black, safe from criminals, most of whom are black.To that way of thinking, a youth who steals cigarillos from a convenience store, then roughs up the clerk, is the enemy of the community — not the police officer who, sadly, ends up shooting him.But that's not the mindset of this president. To him, the killing of Michael Brown ""laid bare"" an age-old national problem: ""a simmering distrust that exists between too many police departments and too many communities of color.""And so now ""a task force"" will not only ""reach out and listen to law enforcement and community activists and other stakeholders, but report to me specifically in 90 days with concrete recommendations"" on how ""we at the federal level"" can ""work with the state and local communities"" to get ""best practices for communities where law enforcement and neighborhoods are working well together ... institutionalized.""Similarly, Democratic Party adviser Donna Brazile says: ""we need a national commission on justice. One that is more than a fact-finding commission,"" and which would be modeled on Bishop Tutu's South African ""Truth and Reconciliation Commission"" — of which Tutu said, ""forgiveness also requires acknowledgment on the part of the perpetrator that they have committed an offense.""But Wilson did not commit any offense to acknowledge; Brown did.What exactly will such task forces and commissions end up doing? Reversing legal decisions like that of the true fact-finders: Ferguson's ultra-thorough grand jurors, whose evidence included six black eyewitnesses who helped exonerate Officer Wilson?Will the federal government eventually veto local criminal-justice decisions in hopes of preventing Ferguson-like riots? That would trample the rule of law in America.If you listen to the president's latest long-winded speech — Monday's was 1,450 words — this great national problem exposed by Ferguson is all about ""people feeling marginalized and distrustful."" Feelings?The president even concedes that ""there have been commissions before, there have been task forces, there have been conversations, and nothing happens.""That about says it all.

A federal war on police begins.Scholar Heather MacDonald of the Manhattan Institute's City Journal charges that ""President Obama betrayed the nation"" and ""perverted his role as the leader of all Americans and as the country's most visible symbol of the primacy of the law"" in his comments after a grand jury found no evidence of wrongdoing by white police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting of black suspect Michael Brown.""The testimony of a half-dozen black observers at the scene demolished the early incendiary reports that Wilson attacked Brown in cold blood and shot Brown in his back when his hands were up,"" MacDonald noted, with witnesses claiming brutality by Wilson exposed as inconsistent and finding themselves ""contradicted by the physical evidence and by other witnesses, who corroborated Wilson's testimony that Brown had attacked him and had tried to grab his gun.""Obama should have praised the grand jury's conclusion, coming after a thorough examination of all the evidence, and affirmed the integrity of America's criminal justice system.  But like the violent, looting protesters in Ferguson, Mo., our president is uninterested in the truth.No wonder a demagogue who personifies politicized lies like Al Sharpton is welcomed into the White House — not by any means for the first time — to advise Obama.Too many have forgotten who Sharpton is.  He came to fame peddling the elaborate Tawana Brawley hoax in upstate New York in 1987, in which a black teen fabricated the claim she was gang-raped by a white policeman, a local white prosecutor and four other white men, her clothes torn and burned, her body smeared with excrement, and ""KKK"" and the N-word and ""bitch"" written on her torso with a a charcoal-like substance.After a grand jury spent seven months confirming it was all a lie, Sharpton and Brawley were successfully sued for slander to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars.Sharpton has never been elected dog catcher anywhere. But according to CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" he is ""a trusted White House adviser who has become the president's go-to black leader, campaigning around the country for President Obama and his agenda.""  Obama has called him ""the voice of the voiceless and a champion for the downtrodden.""In August, the IBD/TIPP Poll found 64% of the public with an unfavorable opinion of Sharpton; only 29% had a favorable view.  A Zogby poll commissioned last year by Black Entertainment Television founder Robert L. Johnson found that while one in four blacks considered Sharpton to be their voice, significantly more — 40% of blacks — said no one speaks for them.Undoubtedly a great many of those black Americans are sick of self-promoting parasites like Sharpton who exist on black violence and economic misery.  Instead of exercising real leadership of their community — which would mean confronting the long-term epidemic of black-on-black crime whose casualties number in the thousands every year — Sharpton blames the cops who risk their lives saving countless black lives in high-crime neighborhoods.Now Obama reportedly plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to force police to wear video cameras on their persons and ""demilitarize"" law enforcement. In other words, further endangering our men and women in blue.A president who promised to unite America has found yet another way of dividing it.

778,MO,"Starting Over: A black woman who sold cake at flea markets to save enough money to open her own shop saw it vandalized and looted by those who claim white cops are the major problem facing black America.Natalie Dubose's Ferguson, Mo., business, Cakes & More, barely survived the arson, rioting and looting that followed a grand jury's not indicting officer Darren Wilson in the shooting of Michael Brown. Her tears then turned to sweat as she struggled to fill Thanksgiving cake orders just as she labored to build her business from the ground up.President Obama once famously told people such as Dubose that she ""didn't build that,"" and that she was the mere beneficiary of a benevolent government and its social engineering.Well, she did build that, and no one from the government helped her bake her cakes or rebuild her business after rioters smashed one of two large windows and damaged her baking equipment.""If I can't open my doors in the morning, I can't feed my kids in the evening,"" Dubois told CNN over the weekend and before the Monday verdict and the subsequent rioting.""Just don't burn my shop down, don't destroy it,"" she pleaded before looters decided to ""protest"" the grand jury's decision not to indict Wilson, who confronted Brown after a strong-armed robbery of Ferguson Market & Liquors.Ferguson Market & Liquors was again a target Monday night as looters, whom some have dubbed undocumented shoppers in a bit of gallows humor, ran in and out, knocking over a Fox News camera in the process as they clutched pilfered bottles of vodka and bourbon, trophies of their fight against social injustice and the perceived bigotry of their oppressors.Dubose opened her shop in June, shortly before Brown was shot in August. The riots after the shooting almost shut down her fledgling business. For two weeks after the shooting, reports the Washington Post, not a single customer entered her shop.This time, as she returned to board up her shop and see what she could do, white racist America came to her aid with two GoFundMe campaigns raising more than $90,000 to help Dubose repair her shop.Celebrities Patricia Heaton and Brandi Glanville urged their Twitter followers to help and they did. It's not known whether Al Sharpton contributed, or even knows who Natalie Dubose is.""I am a single mom, a mother of two,"" Dubose told CNN Money. ""This is everything I own; I can't walk away from it. I just got to start up and start baking again.""Dubose added: ""We have orders to go out for Thanksgiving. I can't tell the people — I won't tell the people — that I'm canceling.""About 25 Ferguson businesses were burned Monday night, most of them minority-owned. They were started in the face of the real problems facing blacks in America — rising illegitimacy, crime, poverty and lack of education, and a war on poverty that succeeded only in destroying the black family as it subsidized a culture of dependency on government.Dubose refused to be a victim of crime or culture and still refuses, even as those from President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder to Jesse Jackson and Sharpton seek to stoke the flames of racial division and the culture of victimhood.Dubose is a real leader of the black community, someone who is the rightful heir of the marchers on that bridge in Selma, Ala.Like Martin Luther King, she has a dream too.If you're ever in Ferguson, Mo., there's a cake shop we'd like to recommend.

779,MO,"Smith & Wesson's stock got a lift early Wednesday after the company announced a $130 million all-cash bid for privately held Battenfeld Technologies, a hunting and shooting accessories provider.Smith & Wesson (SWHC) — which is expected to disclose soft second-quarter earnings after the market closes on Thursday, Dec. 4 — says that the acquisition will beef up its accessories business.CEO James Debney said that the purchase ""allows us to move more strongly into the hunting vertical as well as establish a strong platform for growth in our existing firearm accessories business, which has been a small but highly profitable part of our company.""Based in a 145,000-square-foot facility in Columbia, Mo., Battenfeld makes shooting, reloading, gunsmithing and gun cleaning supplies under several brands.Battenfeld CEO Jim Gianladis will stay on as president of the accessories unit, reporting directly to Debney.Smith & Wesson says that it expects the deal to close in mid- to late December and that the acquisition will be accretive to its earnings in about a year.The No. 2 U.S. firearms maker by revenue, behind archrival Sturm Ruger (RGR), could use a lift.Smith & Wesson enjoyed double-digit quarterly sales growth in recent years, but it turned to shrinking sales the last two quarters in a row amid a firearms glut. Its stock price has plunged about 44% since June 11, including Wednesday's gain. By late afternoon, shares were up 1.4% in the stock market today.Smith & Wesson is forecast to report Q3 earnings of 7 cents per share, far below the 28-cent profit that it posted a year ago. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the gunmaker to report lower EPS for the next three quarters.Revenue for the quarter is projected to drop 24% to $105.8 million.On Oct. 29, Sturm Ruger reported a much worse than expected drop in sales and profit, and its stock fell 10% the next day.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.

793,MO,"President Obama and his race-baiting henchmen Eric Holder and Al Sharpton are now 0-2. Just when they thought they had a flash point for a race war in Ferguson, Mo., after the one manufactured in Sanford, Fla., fizzled, the forensic evidence snuffs it out.They've been caught, once again, crying wolf about discrimination in another white-on-black shooting. You'd think they'd stop demagoguing, but they're only doubling down.""Communities of color aren't just making these problems up,"" Obama insisted, blaming their trouble with law enforcement on ""the legacy of racial discrimination"" and even claiming their rioting is ""an understandable reaction.""But multiracial jurors don't buy it and neither does a public growing weary of a black president making excuses for black criminality.African-Americans still represent less than 13% of the population but now commit an astounding 53% of the nation's murders. In urban centers like St. Louis, as well as Chicago and New York, their share of homicides is even higher, based on Holder's own data.Still, Obama uses Michael Brown as a poster boy for ""much-needed criminal justice reform,"" including diversifying local police forces, training cops in ethnic sensitivity and banning criminal profiling. He's planning prejudice powwows, with federal funding tied to compliance with reforms.""I have instructed Attorney General Holder not just to investigate what happened in Ferguson,"" he announced last week in Chicago, ""but also identify specific steps we can take ... to make sure that law enforcement is fair and is being applied equally,"" as if it isn't already.This is the same fair-minded attorney general who prejudged the Brown shooting as a racist execution, even likening it to the 1955 murder of Emmett Till. ""Reform"" also includes Holder's overseeing the early prison release of some 50,000 crack felons next year.Blaming black crime on racism does nothing to solve the problem. It only keeps the furnaces of hate burning in the hood and encourages young black men to use race as a pretext to resort to lives of crime. And tragically, it leads more to commit suicide by gang or cop.To portray Brown as a civil-rights martyr is the height of dishonesty. The record now shows he was a wannabe gangsta, victim only of the welfare plantation that left him fatherless and living in subsidized housing where he idled away in a pot-smoking haze.His partner in crime, Dorian Johnson, shocked grand jurors by casually testifying he smokes dope first thing in the morning. The 22-year-old baby daddy doesn't get up and get dressed for work. No, he gets up and starts rolling blunt.""I smoke marijuana in my mornings when I start my day off,"" the jobless Johnson boasted, adding he and Brown were on a quest to score some ""rillos,"" or cigarillos.Like too many young black men, he and Brown would cut open the slim cigars, empty out the tobacco and replace it with weed, turning them into oversized joints.This ambition-robbing daily habit led to the Ferguson tragedy. Smoking blunt was all they cared about — get up, get ""rillos,"" get back, roll blunt and get high another wasted day — even if it meant robbing a convenience store.And a cop out doing his job got in the way of that pathetic goal.There's no ""racial divide,"" as the race baiters claim. But there is a cultural divide, and it only widens with each round of apologia from black leaders who stand guilty of black-on-black political crimes. Brown was immersed in that culture, and it cost him his life.Brown wasn't stopped because he ""was a big, black, scary man,"" as the racial arsonists like to say; he was stopped because he was a big bully. And he was shot because he was an attempted cop killer.Maybe Brown didn't deserve to die, but given his threatening actions, he was certainly asking to. Both a police sergeant and FBI agent testified that Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson told them contemporaneously that Brown reached into his waistband just before he charged him, a motion that made Wilson think Brown might be pulling out a weapon. Witnesses say Brown ignored repeated orders to stop.White cop or black cop, the result would have been the same: justifiable homicide.One of the Brown family lawyers, in excusing Michael's strong-arm robbery, said it's not like he gave the store clerk ""a beat down."" The culture of violence in the black community is so pervasive that black lawyers reason like thugs.Johnson, who's still lying about the shooting, nonetheless confirmed to jurors that he and his pal Brown had an attitude that fateful morning, daring cops to bust them as they jaywalked with their stolen loot. Even now, he doesn't see anything wrong with such behavior. Instead of shunning this perjurious punk, the black community has embraced him.Obama is wrong: Racial discrimination isn't the issue behind Ferguson, not even remotely. It's black criminality and its enablement.Rather than feeding into street paranoia about bigoted cops, a responsible leader would educate the black community in the same basic rules of conduct every white person must follow when interacting with police. Sperry, formerly IBD Washington bureau chief, is author of ""The Great American Bank Robbery,"" which exposes the racial politics behind the housing crisis.

795,MO,"Leadership: In ways possible for no one else, a black president and a black attorney general could have quelled the latest violence in Ferguson, Mo. Instead, they invited mayhem.Clay Risen, author of ""A Nation in Flames: America in the Wake of the King Assassination,"" wrote in Smithsonian magazine that the 1968 Martin Luther King riots forced President Johnson to realize ""he had naively hoped that a massive assault of federal spending would relieve conditions in the ghetto overnight.""""When 125 cities erupted over one weekend, he had to confront the fact that nothing he had done seemed to have had an effect.""Still, imagine if it had been a black president, once a state senator from Chicago's South Side, who had said:""I ask every citizen to reject the blind violence that has struck Dr. King, who lived by nonviolence.""LBJ was soon forced to admit he was ""not getting through."" Regrettably, some of what President Obama said after a grand jury declined to indict the white police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown did get through.Obama called anger ""an understandable reaction"" and warned police not to work ""against the community."" This supposed uniter said, ""A deep distrust exists between law enforcement and communities of color. Some of this is the result of the legacy of racial discrimination in this country.""Calling for ""much-needed criminal justice reform,"" Obama said, ""Communities of color aren't just making these problems up,"" ""The law too often feels as if it is being applied in discriminatory fashion"" and ""These are real issues, and we have to lift them up and not deny them or try to tamp them down.""According to the president, ""Those who are only interested in focusing on the violence and just want the problem to go away need to recognize that we do have work to do here, and we shouldn't try to paper it over.""Using his statement to promote discredited liberal policies dilutes its accompanying admonitions against ""throwing bottles"" and ""smashing car windows,"" because he just told those committing the ""blind violence"" LBJ condemned that their rioting is actually rational — their anger is ""an understandable reaction.""America's first black attorney general, Eric Holder, meanwhile mulls federal charges against officer Darren Wilson, in spite of the multiracial grand jury's decision.What could Obama and Holder have done as the first black president and attorney general to protect lives and livelihoods, mostly black? Travelled to Ferguson and told one and all to respect a lawful grand jury finding.The follow-up could have been the words of former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who said, ""The first minute you break a window, you are put in handcuffs"" — whatever your race.

796,MO,"Media Bias: The lens through which the dominant media present events in Ferguson, Mo., projects a distorted, hall-of-mirrors image to the public. Report reality, not alternate reality filtered through ideology.NBC's idea of legal commentary Tuesday on the Michael Brown killing was to have Hollywood lawyer Gloria Allred's daughter tell viewers that ""charging"" (Officer Darren Wilson's straightforward description of how Brown attacked him) is ""a racially tinged offensive word.""What other ""racist"" words must we purge from the English language? Stabbing? Looting? Raping? Burglary? The Washington Bullets basketball team had to change its name because so many bullets were flying in the nation's capital.CBS interviewed Brown's parents about Wilson's account of Brown's death, and his mother assured us, unchallenged, that ""he would never provoke anyone to do anything to him and he wouldn't do anything to anybody"" — so don't believe that surveillance video that clearly shows Brown stealing cigars and assaulting a clerk at a convenience store, just minutes before his violent encounter with Wilson.Announcing the grand jury's not-to-indict decision at night was obviously an attempt to protect life, letting innocent residents get home after work. But Rosie O'Donnell, resident intellectual on ABC's ""The View,"" called it ""a calculated decision in order to incite people.""Sociologist Michael Eric Dyson on MSNBC said Wilson shot Brown not in self-defense, but because as a white ""you infantilize yourself"" and view a black male as ""the demonization of black masculinity.""Ex-Washington Post blogger Ezra Klein calls Wilson's account ""unbelievable"" because why would ""an 18-year-old kid headed to college ... refuse to move from the middle of the street to the sidewalk?"" Or ""curse out a police officer?"" Because, ""while he might have been stoned, this isn't how stoned people act.""Klein has to get out more.""The venal, incompetent mainstream media has already convinced millions of people that they just know Darren Wilson is guilty and that the whole justice system is racist and corrupt for refusing to throw him in jail for the rest of his life,"" Federalist senior writer Robert Tracinski wrote.The media's ""early reports were very clear that Michael Brown was a good, kind-hearted young man bound for college, that the shooting was totally unprovoked, that he was shot multiple times in the back, that he was executed in cold blood,"" he added. ""Then the evidence . .. knocked down each of these claims one by one.""Ironically, all this media distortion happens in spite of multiple recent street assaults of TV news crews, showing it is arguably more dangerous to be on the scene covering Ferguson than reporting from the Islamic State.Instead of portraying a thug as victim, and violent mobs as the righteous oppressed masses, the establishment media ought to stop peddling their leftist ideological delusions and get back to what they claim their business is: reporting facts, not fantasies.

"
798,MO,"Law Enforcement: Despite a grand jury's exoneration of officer Darren Wilson after hearing all the evidence and testimony from key black witnesses, the attorney general pursues his vendetta. This is 2014, sir, not 1964.The lesson drawn from the grand jury decision in the shooting of Michael Brown is that if young blacks don't want to be shot by a police officer of any color, then don't rob a convenience store and don't wrestle that officer for his gun.It is a lesson lost on Attorney General Eric Holder, who plays with a deck that has 52 race cards in it and who thinks every police department is run by the descendants of Bull Connor.Despite the fact that a grand jury didn't see enough evidence to indict Wilson, Holder has announced that the federal investigation of the Brown shooting will continue, even though he has seen the same forensic evidence and witness testimony that the grand jury saw. There isn't a separate set of facts to be found.In a matter-of-fact presentation after the grand jury declined to indict Wilson, St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch laid out the evidence.He said that Brown, after a strong-arm robbery of a convenience store, was confronted by Wilson, who was aware of the robbery. Brown matched a description of the suspect.Multiple black witnesses testified to a struggle as Brown punched Wilson and struggled with him for his gun. Shots fired in the car were consistent with the gunpowder residue on Brown's thumb.Witnesses also testified that Brown later ran toward Wilson in ""full charge,"" not with his hands up, but with them tucked in his waistband. Wilson had no way of knowing that Brown, who had not been frisked, was not armed.Once you assault a police officer, everything that happens after that is on you. It was in fear for his life that Wilson shot the raging, 6-foot-4-inch, 289-pound man-child who had just rushed him. Which part of that does Holder dispute or not understand? If Brown had succeeded in the attack described by Wilson and witnesses, we might have one more dead cop and might not be having this conversation.One of the hidden ironies here is that McCulloch, who presented all the evidence and testimony available to the Ferguson grand jury along with the five possible options for an indictment of Wilson, was a member of the 2008 Obama Missouri Truth Squad.According to a September 2008 CBS St. Louis affiliate report, this offshoot of the Obama campaign was ""asking Missouri law enforcement to target anyone who lies or runs a misleading television ad during the presidential campaign.""McCulloch, now accused of being the tip of the spear for a racist police state, spent 2008 trying to get Obama elected as the first African-American president of the United States. He is no white supremacist with police dogs and fire hoses.Last year, 76 police officers were killed in the line of duty, and we doubt Holder could name one of them without looking it up. This statistic includes shootings in Chicago, where ""communities of color"" see blacks killing blacks at an appalling rate that fails to spark administration concern or action.The Ferguson, Mo., of 2014 is not the Selma, Ala., of 1965, where on March 7 of that year some 600 civil-rights marchers were met by state troopers who attacked them with dogs, billy clubs and tear gas. This is not the Jim Crow era, and Michael Brown was not marching for civil rights as he walked away from the convenience store that officials say he had just robbed, clutching stolen cigars.If Holder has found a different set of facts that contradicts those that have been established, he should let everyone know.If not, he needs to call off his vendetta.

836,MO,"Justice: Eric Holder, who dropped the New Black Panther case and almost
"
837,MO,"had a defender of cop-killer Mumia abu-Jamal as an assistant, takes the
"
838,MO,"death penalty off the table for four alleged Virginia cop-killers.The National Guard has not been called up, Al Sharpton has not made an appearance, and neither have 40 FBI agents been dispatched to ensure the convictions of the four gang members who allegedly murdered a Virginia police officer.Nor will there be riots and looting if they are acquitted.When cops are the victims instead of the accused, a different standard of social justice seems to apply.Waynesboro, Va., is not Ferguson, Mo., and 45-year-old reserve Virginia police officer Kevin Quick is not Michael Brown, shot and killed by Ferguson officer Darren Wilson.In February, officer Quick never made it after he texted his girlfriend that he was on his way to see her.According to police, Quick was set upon by three siblings and a fourth man, and was carjacked, kidnapped and taken from bank to bank to withdraw money using his own debit card at gunpoint before being shot to death.His body was found in a wooded area in Goochland County six days later.Siblings Daniel Mathis, Shantai Shelton and Mersadies Shelton have been charged along with a fourth man, Kweli Uhuru, in a federal indictment that lists them as members of a street gang called the ""99 Goon Syndicate,"" an offshoot of the infamous ""Bloods"" gang, and allegedly committed the murder to climb in the gang ranks.The alleged killers now await trial, which is currently set for May 4, 2015.Federal prosecutors say that U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has taken the death penalty off the table in this case and that the four co-defendants will instead face the possibility of life without parole.No official reason has been given in this case of premeditated murder. But we suspect the reasons include Holder's opposition to the death penalty and his sharing of the belief that the death penalty in particular and the justice system in general are skewed against minority defendants such as these four accused.Fox News reports that of the 1,236 death penalty cases brought before Holder's DOJ through 2013, only 27 have been approved for the death penalty.After the botched execution of convicted killer Clayton Lockett in April, who reportedly writhed in pain before dying of a heart attack after his lethal injection, President Obama tasked Holder with a national review of the death penalty.""Racial bias. Uneven application of the death penalty. Situations in which there were individuals on death row who later on were discovered to be innocent ... All of these do raise significant questions about how the death penalty is being applied,"" Obama said in calling for the review. ""I think as a society, we have to ask ourselves some difficult and profound questions.""Yes, we do.Holder, who once called the United States a ""nation of cowards"" regarding discussions of race, is the AG who failed to prosecute one of the clearest cases of voter intimidation in American history in Philadelphia by black militants, members of the New Black Panther Party.If they had been white supremacists in, say, Alabama, we suspect that he would not have been so reluctant.Holder expressed no opposition to Debo Adegbile, Obama's nominee to be assistant attorney general for the civil rights division at the Department of Justice.Adegbile fought to free from prison and save from the death penalty one Mumia abu-Jamal, the cold-blooded killer of Philadelphia cop Daniel Faulkner.If anyone deserves the death penalty, cop-killers do, and if there is any uneven application of the death penalty, it is the one meted out to the victims of these thugs.Their deaths cannot be taken off the table, and Holder's Justice Department appears to be anything but colorblind.

878,MO,"Cabinet: After Eric Holder, who put politics over the rule of law, the president's next attorney general deserves extra scrutiny. Hustling the nominee through the lame-duck session would be a bad first step after the election.Voters sent a resounding message to the White House that it doesn't like the direction it's taking the nation. Specifically, they said in exit polls they don't like the souring of race relations that's occurred under Holder's polarizing tenure.Obama's nod, U.S. attorney Loretta Lynch, should be thoroughly vetted by the new Senate that voters elected to power. Confirmation hearings should wait until the Republican majority is seated.Senators have a duty to make sure Lynch isn't just a female version of Holder adopting his same radical, race-baiting agenda.Why rush her confirmation? There's no urgency: Holder told Obama he would stay on as long as needed. So there will be no gaps in Justice Department leadership.""Eric has agreed to stay on as attorney general until I nominate his successor and that successor is confirmed by the Senate,"" Obama said after announcing Holder was stepping down.Having Democrats rubber-stamp the nation's chief law enforcement officer would be a grave mistake. The nation deserves to hear Lynch's answers to a host of critical questions, including:1. What about the laws governing the president's executive powers and immigration? Are Obama's executive amnesty plans constitutional and legal? Will you enforcethe immigration laws Congress has passed?2. Will you cooperate with congressional probes of the Fast and Furious gun-running scandal now that a federal judge has demanded full document disclosure?3. Will you unblock the investigation into the IRS' targeting of Republican nonprofit groups, including the Tea Party, during the 2012 presidential election?4. Your predecessor has refused to defend the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act, despite reasonable arguments by Justice in previous cases that DOMA is, in fact, constitutional. Will you defend it?5. In an August speech before The Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, you supported Holder's offer of clemency to thousands of criminals whose drug sentences he thinks shouldn't have been put away. You called for an ""expansion of the clemency program"" and stated, ""This is not an abandonment of prison as a means to reduce crime, but rather a recognition that, quite often, less prison can also work to reduce crime."" Do you stand by these remarks?6. Did the Justice Department draw premature conclusions by rushing into the shooting cases in Sanford, Fla., and Ferguson, Mo.? Should it have waited for the facts in these cases to play out, for local authorities to do their work, before rushing in? Did federal interventions there pour fuel on the fire? Do you believe that law enforcement in this country is racist?7. You helped bring discrimination charges against the New York City Fire Department under ""disparate impact"" theory. Do you think this theory should be used to enforce civil-rights laws against mortgage lenders? Auto lenders? Insurers? School districts? Who else?8. Do you think America is a ""nation of cowards"" when it comes to racial issues?9. Federal Election Commission records show you have donated almost $14,000 to Democrat candidates for federal office. How politically active are you, and how will you separate your activism from objective enforcement of the law?Not since before the Civil War has an attorney general been nominated and confirmed in a lame-duck session of Congress. Newly elected senators should be able to participate in the confirmation process.

899,MO,"Election 2014: The Democratic Party, in full league with the establishment media, is fomenting racial hysteria that will almost certainly encourage street violence. The objective: save the Senate for Democrats.The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported on Tuesday that an early-voting turnout mailer distributed by the Georgia Democratic Party invokes the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson, Mo., which led to weeks of race riots.Above a photo of two small black children holding signs that say ""Don't Shoot"" accompanied by bloody handprints, the flyer reads, ""If You Want To Prevent Another Ferguson In Their Future . ..""Then it shows a black youth kneeling with hands up as police explosives go off beside him. Giant red letters spell out ""VOTE,"" then below, in smaller black type, it says, ""It's up to you to make change happen.""The mailer pronounces the police officer involved guilty before an investigation has been completed and without his being charged with anything: ""On August 9, 2014, an unarmed 18-year-old African American named Michael Brown was fatally shot six times and killed by a white police officer,"" the mailing said, ""his body left in a pool of blood in the street for four hours.""It then noted that Ferguson is 67% black, but its mayor, five of its six city council members and 94% of its police are white. Then in italics: ""What are we going to do about it?""When the newspaper collared the very-much-white Georgia Democratic Party chairman, DuBose Porter, he actually claimed the racially inflammatory message in the mailer ""echoes the message for job training and opportunity ... from our entire (state party) team.""One might ask the party's national leader: Mr. President, how does the Georgia Democrat flyer fit in with your publicly expressed hope in the aftermath of the shootings of Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona and Judge John Roll, nearly four years ago now, that their shootings ""help usher in more civility in our public discourse . .. because only a more civil and honest public discourse can help us face up to our challenges as a nation in a way that would make them proud""?It is highly doubtful that Obama, who in an interview this week with Al Sharpton told fellow Democrats, ""You do what you need to do to win,"" will call for civility two weeks before Election Day as Democrats rile up racial animosity that could easily lead to bloodshed.Myths about Ferguson are fading. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch said Wednesday that the official autopsy and toxicology report found marijuana in Michael Brown's system and that he apparently was not killed while running away, according to analysis by two outside experts. The finding contradicts witness testimony.But Democrats got an assist in race-baiting a week ago in the form of a widely covered analysis by ProPublica and Slate titled ""Black Teens Vastly More Likely to Be Killed by Police Than Whites Even After Adjusting for Crime Rates.""This week, John R. Lott, former U.S. Sentencing Commission chief economist, debunked those ""findings"" in a FoxNews.com article pointing out that ""black male teenagers were nine times more likely to commit murders than similarly aged white males, not two to three times as likely,"" as the article contended.Lott also found that the article, covered with no objective scrutiny by the New York Times, National Public Radio and the major networks, mis-cited crime data expert David Klinger of the University of Missouri-St. Louis.Klinger had told Lott that he warned ProPublica that the FBI's crime data on justifiable police homicide was ""no good.""The maxim of today's Democratic Party and its major media allies is apparently this: ""You can't make a successful election without breaking a few heads"" — by fomenting race riots.

Revenue increased 9% to $677.5 million.Consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters was $1.26 EPS on $671.8 million.The company said that growth was led by a 28% hike in autos and a 13% increase in industrial and consumer products. Overall carload volumes were 4% higher than in third quarter 2013.Its stock fell as much as 2% early Friday but had recovered to an 0.8% loss in early afternoon trading on the stock market today.Kansas City Southern's strong growth may have been factored into its stock price after CSX (CSX) late Tuesday topped analyst views and forecast double-digit gains in the next fiscal year.Analysts said that they expected Kansas City Southern and Union Pacific (UNP), which will announce earnings Thursday, to report double-digit percentage earnings gains.CSX and Union Pacific rose 2.4% Friday afternoon.Kansas City Southern's initial share drop could also be partly due to concerns that the hot auto market — which spurred KCS's growth last quarter — is cooling.On Sept. 29 Ford (F) slashed its pretax earnings outlook for this year and warned that results in Europe will be worse than expected.

934,MO,"Leadership: The vice president keeps piling up gaffes, from a made-up number of storm deaths to a diplomatic blunder he had to ""walk back."" That he's next in line for the Oval Office makes us more than a little queasy.It's amazing how Joe Biden has survived through a long career of making wild, exaggerated, fictitious and just plain nutty statements in public. But maybe it's not so inexplicable. Rather than getting the Dan Quayle treatment, he always gets a free pass.Hey, say the media and his party pals, that's just ""Ol' Joe"" talking, ""Joe Biden being Joe Biden."" ""Uncle Joe"" doesn't mean any harm; he's just a hail fellow who sometimes misspeaks when he gets excited.But what the press and Biden's Democratic protectors find endearing we find alarming. Just consider the latest examples of how the vice president of the United States cannot govern his mouth: On Friday, he went to Joplin, Mo., and lamented the ""161,000 brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, grandparents lost"" in that city's tornado in 2011. Except the real death toll was 161, not 161,000, which is more than three times the city's population of roughly 50,000. On Thursday, Biden ate shoe leather while speaking at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. During a question-and-answer period, he said U.S. allies Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates funded and armed terrorists. He has since apologized for making the remarks.Though Biden might have been right (see nearby editorial), he didn't need to make the statement in public. That he did shows he simply can't be trusted to speak for his country — or, for that matter, allowed anywhere near a microphone. During the same appearance, the man who would be president said his current job — hardly regarded as a back-breaker — is a ""bitch."" A few weeks earlier, Biden had what the Washington Post called the ""worst week in Washington."" The ""gaffe hat trick"" began when Biden offended the Jewish community by grumbling about the ""Shylocks"" who lend to military members and families. It continued when he designated Singapore's first prime minister ""the wisest man in the Orient.""And it was capped when he praised one-time Republican Sen. Bob Packwood — a man who quit amid charges of sexual harassment and assault — during a speech at a Democratic leadership forum for women.Joe Biden for president? Please, not the man who can't control his tongue and whose importance lies in ensuring Barack Obama will never be impeached.

He'll be talking for dollars three times today in New York City and Greenwich, Conn. while Vice President Joe Biden works Los Angeles and then San Francisco donors. Thursday through Saturday Obama will ka-ching the liberal California cash machine in both LA and San Francisco.But what's been the most interesting thing in recent days is the need for Press Secretary Josh Earnest to explain what Barack Obama really meant in his '60 Minutes' interview last week and what Vice President Joe Biden really meant when he accused alleged allies in the Middle East of initially supporting ISIS and other extremists with millions of dollars and hundreds of tons of weapons.Remember, Obama was supposed to be the golden-tongued orator whose words would woo the masses and hold back the tides of time. As long as he could rely on a teleprompter, that was true for a while. Now, his mis-steps with those of Pancho Biden resemble circus clowns running into each other.Biden has said so many stupid things so often, you'd think he should have been replaced in 2012. But he may be Obama's best insurance against impeachment.Back in September of 2008, you may not recall, Joe informed one campaign town hall that Hillary Clinton would have been a better VP choice for Obama. For someone as insecure and thin-skinned as Obama, that was major criticism.You didn't read much about it then because the media was focused on Sarah Palin quotes to Katie ""I've Had Several Employers Since Then"" Couric. But Biden was immediately muzzled more than Palin.Still, he yabbers on. Last week in Joplin, Mo., a city of about 50,000 residents, Biden sympathetically recalled the 2011 tornado that devastated part of the town and claimed 161,000 lives. But his Thursday comments at Harvard ignited international reaction.In his best 'I'm-on-the-inside-tone,' Biden confided to students that Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates had all helped Syrian insurgents including ISIS and al Nusra and quoted from a private conversation with Turkish President Recep Erdogan.Such clandestine maneuvering across the Middle East's shifting sands is most likely true. But such undiplomatic candor and loose lips could sink Obama's desperate efforts to lure those three Arab nations and others into his coalition of the reluctant now pretending to fight ISIS here and there in Syria and Iraq.Erdogan publicly demanded an apology. He got a personal call from Biden Saturday. The UAE's crown prince got one Sunday. The Saudis, apparently, are on their own.On Monday Earnest explained: ""The fact that he called the leaders of those, or at least senior officials in both of those countries to apologize is an indication that he himself wishes that he had said it a little bit differently....""What the Vice President did was clarify his remarks to indicate that he was not attempting to imply that the UAE had facilitated or supported ISIL, al Qaeda or other extremist groups in Syria."" Of course, Biden was implying no such thing. He was saying it outright.Obama told '60 Minutes': ""Well I think, our head of the intelligence community, Jim Clapper, has acknowledged that I think they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria.""Earnest was forced to attempt a difficult explanation for his boss, the congenital passer-of-the-buck. That the president was not passing the buck. That what the president was really saying was ""everybody"" had been ""surprised by the rapid advance earlier this summer that ISIL was able to make across the Syria-Iraq border in the face of Iraqi security forces.""Which, of course, was not at all what Obama said.It's what his spokesman now says he said, which has become the New Truth.In Washington, this kind of nonsense makes sense.RELATED:What's Michelle really campaigning for?Voters decide to send Obama a midterm message

949,MO,"For Mickey Mantle, dad knew best, especially when it mattered most.Mantle was born with top physical ability and a father who knew how to get the most out of him. A semipro player, Mutt Mantle didn't push his son to play baseball as much as he taught him to love it.And America loved Mickey Mantle (1931-95). He epitomized the baseball era of the 1950s, when the game was king, the New York Yankees its royal family and Mantle, with his all-American good looks, enthusiasm, blazing speed and prodigious home runs, its prince.But the future Hall of Famer, who helped the Yankees capture seven world titles — while slugging a record 18 World Series homers — almost quit before he started.Mantle hit well in his two minor league seasons, 1949 and 1950, before making New York's opening day roster in 1951 on the basis of an impressive spring training. But by July 15, manager Casey Stengel decided the 19-year-old needed more seasoning in the minors.Down, Not OutAt the club's Triple A affiliate in Kansas City, Mo., Mantle fell into an 0-for-22 batting slump. His one hit before that had been a bunt single that he was quite proud of. Manager George Selkirk wasn't, snapping after the inning, ""They sent you down here to hit.""Finally, Mantle reached his breaking point. ""Whatever I had had, I told myself, I had lost it now and my baseball career was over,"" he wrote in 1967's ""The Education of a Baseball Player."" ""I would go back home, take my job in the (lead and zinc) mines, play (semipro) ball for money in the summer. ... I knew my father would sympathize with me, for he had had his own disappointments in baseball.""Not quite. Mickey asked Mutt to come to KC. Face to face, with tears in his eyes, son told Dad to take him home. The reply was harsh: ""If that's the way you're going to take this, you don't belong in baseball anyway. If you have no more guts than that, just forget about the game completely. Come back and work in the mines, like me.""""His tone, as much as his words, went right down through me,"" the Mick recalled. ""There was not a trace of sympathy in his eye. I had been looking for a comforting pat on the back, and I had not even gotten a handshake.""That night, Mantle hit two home runs — and his trajectory was straight up. He returned to the Yankees for good in late August and starred for them over 18 seasons.""That ... was the greatest thing my father ever did for me,"" he said. ""All the encouragement he had given me when I was small, all the sacrifices he made so I could play ball when other boys were working in the mines, all the painstaking instruction he had provided — all these would have been thrown away if he had not been there that night to put the iron into my spine when it was needed most.""That mettle sustained the switch-hitting Mantle through 1964, with two of his greatest seasons coming in 1956 — the Triple Crown while leading both leagues in batting average, home runs and runs batted in — and 1957, when his on-base percentage soared to .512.He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974 and to Major League Baseball's All-Century Team in 1999. ""What made me a success at hitting was not what anyone taught me, but what I taught myself in hours and hours of practice,"" said Mantle, also a Gold Glove center fielder.Mantle's Yankees won 12 American League pennants. In those dozen World Series, his 40 RBIs, 42 runs and 123 total bases stand along with his homers as records.""Mickey had the will to win, and that will probably came out even more in the important ballgames, and certainly the World Series would qualify for that,"" teammate Bobby Richardson told IBD.Mantle's son Danny told IBD that his father ""was always such a competitor. The Yankees winning was very important to him.""The slugger put it another way in his 1985 book, ""The Mick"": ""I'm really a bad loser.""Take the 1960 World Series. Mantle hit .400 with three home runs and 11 RBIs, but the Yankees lost to the Pittsburgh Pirates on Bill Mazeroski's season-ending home run in the bottom of the ninth of Game 7.""I'm not embarrassed to say I cried in the clubhouse,"" Mantle wrote in 1994's ""All My Octobers."" And it lingered. ""Except for someone close to me dying, I felt as bad as I ever felt in my life.""ApplauseBobby Brown, a Mantle teammate who became the American League's president, said: ""Mickey played hard every minute he was on the field. He was a very good guy, extremely popular with all of his teammates as well as the opposing players.""Mantle's legacy also lives on through the Mantle family's charitable work. The Mickey Mantle School in New York City helps underprivileged kids with learning disabilities. The Mickey Mantle Family Fund works with the American Cancer Society. Before he died of cancer at age 63, his golf tournaments benefited the Make-A-Wish foundation. ""Dad was a very giving person,"" Danny Mantle said.The Mick was born in Spavinaw, Okla., and grew up in nearby Commerce, where his father worked in the mines. After a grueling day of work, Mutt would pitch tennis balls to the boy.Mutt had the foresight to insist Mickey learn to bat from both sides of the plate. Dad felt the game was shifting to more platoon baseball, and a good switch-hitter wouldn't be benched simply because a pitcher was a lefty or righty.By age 15, Mickey was playing in a semipro baseball league where the players could be as old as 21. This is when Yankees scout Tom Greenwade discovered the power hitter.On the day of his high school graduation in 1949, Mantle signed with the Yankees for $140 a month and a $1,150 signing bonus.Banged UpReturning to the Yankees in late August 1951 after his hot minor league stint, Mantle helped them reach the World Series.Then came disaster. In the Fall Classic against the New York Giants, Mantle wrecked his right knee trying to make a catch.He wound up in a hospital room with his father, who was dying of Hodgkin's disease, a nemesis of the Mantle family. Mutt was only 41 when he died in May 1952.Mantle's leg injury would plague him the rest of his career, but he managed to play through the pain and keep his incredible speed.In December 1951, Mantle married Merlyn Johnson. The union produced four sons. The family wrote a 1996 book called ""A Hero All His Life."" Mantle himself was candid in later interviews about how his alcoholism hurt him and his family and friends.In his prime, Mantle seemed indestructible. He said of his batting prowess: ""The number one consideration is to be comfortable"" at the plate. This meant developing his own batting stance and swing.Although he said he never modeled himself after any other player, he did take note of the Boston great Ted Williams, whom he called the best hitter he ever saw.""Ted showed me what it means to be aggressive at the plate,"" Mantle said. ""When he decided to go after a ball, he really attacked it, as if he meant to demolish it entirely. There was never anything defensive about his ways at the plate, no halfhearted swings or pokes. He exploded at a ball, trying to drive it as hard and as far as he could.""As Mantle played toward his final season of 1968, he found injuries harder to shrug off.""Dad played his whole career hurt,"" Danny Mantle said.Richardson said: ""His preparation was good. Mickey was ready to play every ballgame. I can't remember anytime when he wasn't ready to play and didn't inspire the other teammates.""

Lorillard is a leader in electronic cigarettes, seen as a smokeless, less dangerous alternative to traditional smoking and considered one of several hot spots within the industry.British American Tobacco (BTI) owns 42% of Reynolds. Another British tobacconist, Imperial Tobacco, announced Friday that it was discussing a possible acquisition of assets from both Reynolds and Lorillard.Lorillard shares have easily outpaced the market this year, rising 31% since Dec. 31. The stock eked out a new high Friday but has had trouble breaking free of its 10-week moving average since clearing a flat base in May. The company's dividend yields 3.9%.Reynolds is up 23% year to date and has tested 10-week support once since a March breakout. Its dividend yields 4.3%.

998,MO,"Stock futures traded lower, but steady ahead of Monday's open as oil prices and the Federal Reserve tested investor confidence. Dow futures traded 40.2 points below fair market value. S&P 500 futures hung 5.5 points below the line. Nasdaq 100 futures were off a mild 7.6 points. Small caps were under disproportionate pressure, with Russell 2000 futures falling 8.2 points.The stock market today opens under a clear caution flag ahead of Wednesday's policy decision from the Federal Reserve. The Nasdaq dropped 4.1% last week, slicing below support at both its 200-day and 50-day moving averages. The S&P 500 crumpled 3.8%, also violating both levels of support. That means all bets are off on the market's direction for the next two days.Within that uncertainty, oil prices continued diving early Monday, with West Texas Intermediate down more than 2% to below 35% a barrel, its lowest mark in more than a decade. Brent crude dropped nearly 3%, below $37, to its weakest level since 2008. Both benchmarks have logged steady losses since the Dec. 4 Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting, in which the group failed to agree on a production quota, permitting member countries to continue current production levels.Despite the oil price slump, it was DuPont (DD) and Apple (AAPL) that dragged down the Dow before the open. DuPont dipped more than 1%.Apple trimmed its premarket loss to 1%, up from a 3% dive, after Morgan Stanley cut its price target to 143 from 162, citing pressure on international iPhone prices due to oversupply outside China. Apple ended Friday well off an August low, but struggling to retake its 10-week moving average within a five-month consolidation.Jarden (JAH) jumped 5%, Newell Rubbermaid (NWL) slipped more than 2% after Newell said it would pay $13.2 billion in a cash/stock deal to acquire the Boca Raton, Fla.-based maker of Sunbeam irons, Marmot outdoor gear and Crock-Pot cookware.Newell management said the combination is targeting $500 million in annualized cost savings, would be immediately positive for earnings, and should close in Q2 of 2016. Jarden rose 9% last week on merger speculation, moving the stock up the right side of a five-month consolidation.China-based maker of solar electrical components Trina Solar (TSL) spiked 9% on news reports that the company had received an offer to be taken private at $11.60 per share by Shanghai Xingsheng Equity Investment & Management. The offer was 321% above Friday's closing price.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) was confusing brokerage data collection systems in premarket trade, as it prepared to go live with its 2-for-1 stock split at today's open. It is the company's first stock split since May 2010.Overseas, Europe's stocks came off their lows near midday. London's FTSE 100 reversed early losses and wrestled into narrowly positive territory. Frankfurt's DAX was down 0.8%, up from a 1.2% loss. The Cac-40 in Paris eased to a 0.4% loss, from 0.6%.Asia's markets were widely mixed: Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dipped 0.7%, the Shanghai Composite jumped 2.5% and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo stumbled to a 1.8% loss.

Its lineup includes gypsum wallboard and recycled paperboard, which sell mainly to the housing market. It also makes aggregates, concrete and cement, including specialty cement used in oil and natural gas wells.
"
1019,MO,"Another offering that Eagle has recently added to the mix — an important one — is frac sand. It's a crush-resistant sand that drilling companies use in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to get oil or natural gas out of the ground.
"
1020,MO,"The Dallas company has delivered a long winning streak, buoyed by the housing market recovery that has led to strong demand for products such as wallboard and cement, and price increases along the way.

1022,MO,"Newly added to its lineup, frac sand may spur more growth.
"
1023,MO,"Frac sand is a so-called proppant used in the hydraulic fracturing process to help get oil and natural gas from rocky areas such as shale. In fracking, liquids are injected into the ground to make space for underlying oil or natural gas to flow through. Proppants are solids used to prop the space open during or after fracking.
"
1024,MO,"Last year, Eagle completed a facility in Corpus Christi, Texas, to produce frac sand, and in fiscal 2015's first quarter, which ended June 30, it received the final permit needed to start operating its frac-sand mine in Utica, Ill. During the quarter, Eagle continued to process and sell purchased sand in Corpus Christi awaiting the opening of the mine in Illinois.
"
1025,MO,"With the receipt of the final permit necessary to start up its mine, Eagle expects to be able to sell its sand through its Corpus Christi facility no later than the fiscal third quarter, primarily into Eagle Ford shale-drilling applications. The Eagle Ford shale formation is in South Texas.

1055,MO,"Jihad: Islamist militias seized nearly a dozen airliners at the Tripoli, Libya, airport last month. At about the same time, an American who worked at the Minneapolis International Airport was killed while fighting as a terrorist.As we approach the 13th anniversary of the day when Middle Eastern males armed with nothing but airplane tickets, box cutters and Islamist fanaticism turned passenger jets into cruise missiles, we are reminded that it could happen again. Civilian planes are once again in the hands of terrorists and Islamic State sympathizers who are not only here but actually working at our airports.We might not have a strategy to deal with the Islamic State, but it has a plan to deal with us, and it includes recruiting those who live here, or have passports to get here, or who might be able to sneak or have a paid ""coyote"" get them across our porous southern border.Fox affiliate KMSP-TV in Minneapolis-St. Paul has reported the case of Abdirahmaan Muhumed, who, before he went to Syria to fight and die for IS, worked at Delta Global Services, a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta Air Lines. His job was to clean aircraft, and he had a security clearance that gave him unfettered access to the tarmac and passenger jets.As we recently noted, IS posted photos on social media of its flag and a hand-written message in Arabic in front of the White House and Chicago's Old Republic Building on Michigan Avenue, warning:""We are in your state, we are in your cities, and we are in your streets.""They are also, apparently, working at our airports,The New York Daily News reports that the 29-year-old Muhumed died in the same battle as 33-year-old Douglas McCain, another Minnesotan recruited by IS. Muhumed and McCain were said to be friends in high school, with Muhumed becoming politically active in the Twin Cities Somali community. He was one of at least 16 Minnesotans, according to Reuters, who have gone overseas to fight and train with IS.As John Hinderaker notes at his Power Line blog, it wasn't many years ago that Minnesota would not have been a hotbed of Islamist recruiting.But the mass immigration of Somalis to the area has made it fertile ground for the Islamic State. It appears to be copying the recruiting strategy of al-Shabab, the Somali terrorist group that has been successful in recruiting young men from the Twin Cities region.All of which begs a couple of questions:One, if the Department of Justice is willing to send 40 FBI agents to Ferguson, Mo., to investigate the death of one man, what is it doing to investigate the IS and al-Shabab terrorist recruiting network in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area?Two, is Ferguson's police department considered a greater threat to our nation than the Islamic State, which had one of its recruits working on our passenger jets?Have we forgotten that it was not terribly long ago that a passenger jet was nearly blown up over Detroit? That attack failed only because the device worn by ""underwear bomber,"" identified by officials as Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, failed to detonate properly. Aircraft are still a favorite target of terrorists, and we should be paying as much attention to those working on them as those boarding them.The Muhumed affair comes as 11 passenger jets were seized in late August following the takeover of the Tripoli airport by the terrorist group Libyan Dawn. Its members were last seen diving into the pool at our evacuated U.S. Embassy, another triumph of the strategy-less Obama foreign policy.The terrorist attack on our Benghazi mission occurred on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attack on New York and Washington. President Obama had better put down his putter and pay attention to the gathering storm of Islamist terrorism both abroad and in our streets.

1056,MO,"Digital Ally's (DGLY) stock soared Thursday after the camera maker's contract with the Michigan state police was expanded with an order valued at more than $1.1 million.The contract now includes Digital Ally's DVM-800 in-car video system, which the state recently tested and evaluated before it decided to ink the deal, and VuLink, which connects the in-car and body-worn video streams.Shares for the company vaulted more than 25% on the stock market today, adding to a massive rally that has seen the stock more than quadruple in two weeks after inquiries about its body cameras rose following the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.""Many of our current and potential customers are evaluating our new DVM-800 in-car-video system and FirstVU HD body-worn cameras, together with the patented VuLink interconnectivity device,"" said CEO Stanton Ross in a statement Thursday.""The test results have been positive, and we believe a majority of customers that have undertaken such test and evaluation programs will select our total package, which addresses the need for secure video and audio evidence from many different viewpoints as incidents in the field unfold.""Digital Ally has worked with Michigan's state police force for several years, and the latest contract addition puts its total value at $6.5 million.Taser (TASR), which also produces body cameras for law enforcement, has seen a more modest stock rally since the Ferguson shooting, but a JPMorgan Chase analyst said last week that Taser is well positioned because it already has ties with many law enforcement agencies with its stun guns.

1062,MO,"Crime: Attorney General Eric Holder's star witness in the allegedly racist police shooting of a black St. Louis teen is a hoodlum with a history of making false statements to police.Dorian Johnson, 22, the main source of the media's racist cop narrative, has lost all credibility. So why is Holder still taking his testimony? And why isn't he behind bars?An ABC News affiliate in St. Louis reported that Johnson is wanted in Jefferson City, Mo., on a 2011 theft charge and also for filing a false police report that same year. Johnson allegedly gave a bogus name and age to investigators in the case.Johnson was walking with Michael Brown when his friend ""Big Mike"" was shot by a local patrolman. He told reporters and anyone who would listen that the unarmed Brown was ""shot like an animal"" by a ""white cop,"" as he raised his hands to surrender.""Me and my friend was walking down the street, wasn't causing any harm to nobody,"" he said, when Officer Darren Wilson pulled up in his patrol car and ""reached his arm out the window and grabbed my friend around his neck. ... (He) was trying to choke my friend.""He claimed Brown broke loose and started to run away when Wilson shot him from behind, then finished him off at close range, execution style.His chillingly vivid account spurred nationwide protests, including the looting and torching of dozens of businesses. Civil rights leaders embraced Johnson. So did Holder.But then, piece by piece, his story started to fall apart.First came the release of a video from a liquor store surveillance camera showing Johnson involved in a robbery with Brown just moments before the shooting. A police report ID'd Johnson as a suspect (though charges were mysteriously dropped as federal authorities stepped in to investigate the case).Then came the family autopsy showing Brown was not, in fact, shot from behind.Next, a friend of Wilson described in a radio interview how Johnson and Brown pushed Wilson back into his patrol car as he opened the door to question them.And now we know Johnson has a habit of lying to authorities. His arrest record should sink his credibility as a key witness before the grand jury.
"
1063,MO,"Due Process: The Criminal Section of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division that is handling the shooting of Michael Brown was once smacked down by a federal judge for gross prosecutorial misconduct.Demonstrating the same relentless pursuit of truth and justice that occurred after the New Black Panther voter-intimidation case or the death of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry in Fast and Furious, Attorney General Eric Holder and his team of leftist lawyers and ideologues have descended on Ferguson, Mo., to assure, as Gov. Jay Nixon put it, justice is done for Brown and his family.Justice for Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson is another thing, as it was for five members of the New Orleans Police Department. They faced federal charges for, and were convicted of, shooting suspected looters on New Orleans' Danziger Bridge after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The presumption of innocence was also cast aside in that case, and the end of finding the officers guilty of civil rights violations justified any means.As Hans von Spakovsky has documented in National Review Online, antics by Justice Department lawyers from the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division included: leaking supposedly secret grand jury proceedings and conducting a PR campaign to influence the jury and inflame public opinion that included blogging on the website of the Times-Picayune newspaper.The defendants justifiably petitioned for a new trial and on Nov. 26, 2012, in a scathing ruling unnoticed by the media, Louisiana Federal District Court Judge Kurt Englehardt reversed the convictions of the defendants, citing the ""perfidy"" and ""skullduggery"" of the Justice Department attorneys.Spakovsky points out that in his order, Englehardt — who labeled the department's misconduct ""grotesque"" — noted the website postings ""mocked the defense, attacked the defendants and their attorneys, were approbatory of the United States Department of Justice, declared the defendants obviously guilty, and discussed the jury's deliberations.""On Sept. 17, 2013, Englehardt ordered a new trial, noting that federal ""prosecutors, acting with anonymity, used social media to circumvent ethical obligations, professional responsibilities, and even to commit violations of the Code of Federal Regulations.""In their words and actions, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon and Attorney General Eric Holder have similarly declared to the world their belief that Wilson is obviously guilty — and not of defending himself from a physical assault by someone who allegedly had just committed the strong-arm robbery of a convenience store, but of shooting an innocent teen out for a stroll.As pointed out by J. Christian Adams, who now writes for PJ Media and once worked in Justice's Voting Rights Section, many of the Justice Department attorneys who participated in the New Orleans fiasco still work in the Civil Rights Division and the ""anti-police biases of lawyers in this unit have resulted in gross prosecutorial misconduct against police officers.""Adams left Justice after Holder refused to pursue what looked like a clear case of voter intimidation by the New Black Panthers at a Philadelphia polling place in 2008.As they say, someone's point of view often depends on whose ox is being gored. And if anyone wanted to know Holder's view of police officers, let's remember, as we have mentioned before, that the administration nominated Debo Adegbile to head the Civil Rights Division. His claim to fame was being the lawyer who fought to free from prison Mumia Abu-Jamal, the convicted killer of Philadelphia Police Officer Danny Faulkner.Justice is supposed to be blind, and that includes being colorblind, and should take investigators where the facts lead them. Justice doesn't start with a predetermined verdict and actions that taint the jury pool. The track record of Holder and the Civil Rights Division does not speak well of any desire for true justice.

1064,MO,"Wearable camera makers Taser International (TASR) and Digital Ally (DGLY) are getting a close-up viewing by investors and analysts as their share prices took off this week.Digital Ally shares soared 90% on Tuesday as inquiries about its FirstVU HD Body Camera rose amid the civil unrest in Ferguson, Mo. The jump came even though the company hadn't reported any new orders.On Wednesday, Digital Ally did issue a report saying inquiries from law enforcement agencies increased dramatically this week, pushing its shares up as much as 25% midday.But some observers said its stock was in a bubble.TheStreet.com, for example, noted increased interest in its cameras but said it put a sell rating on Digital Ally.""This is driven by multiple weaknesses, which we believe should have a greater impact than any strengths, and could make it more difficult for investors to achieve positive results compared to most of the stocks we cover,"" the analyst said.Digital Ally reversed hard and fell 18% by the end of trading on Wednesday.Phoenix-like, it rose 35% by early afternoon Thursday before easing.Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase analyst Paul Coster said he thinks Taser is well positioned to gain in the on-officer video market because it has developed ties with many law enforcement agencies with its electronic control devices.Some 16,000 of the 18,000 police departments in the U.S. are Taser stun gun customers. Large departments such as Las Vegas and New Orleans have also adopted its Evidence.com evidence collection and storage system. Taser has paired data from its on-body cameras with its Evidence.com program.In a recent report, Coster cited data showing police agencies that have tried or deployed on-officer cameras like those sold by Digital Ally and Taser saw a 59% reduction in ""use of force"" by officers, and a 93% drop in litigation expenses.Taser shares were up 1.6% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, Thursday.Elsewhere in the Security/Safety products group, top U.S. gun makers Sturm Ruger (RGR) and Smith & Wesson Holding (SWHC) were up less than 1% and down 1%, respectively.Gunmakers as a group have been going through a slow period.

1067,MO,"Malignant Neglect: The president talks about Ferguson, Mo., but not about a Chicago weekend where three dozen people were shot, seven of them killed, including a 16-year-old black girl who wanted to be a doctor.To his credit, President Obama was more judicious than usual talking about the shooting of Michael Brown outside St. Louis. He did not say the police acted stupidly. He actually made a rare attempt at acknowledging individual responsibility when he said that when young black men ""commit a crime, they need to be prosecuted, because every community has an interest in public safety.""One of those communities is Chicago, about whose routine carnage the president has said little of substance, and where last weekend, as the fires of looted stores in Ferguson burned, seven people were shot dead and 29 were wounded. No need to put out the fires of perceived racial animosity or place special focus on the situation when it is young blacks routinely killing other young blacks.If Sasha and Malia Obama, the president's young daughters, had another sister, she might look like 16-year-old Shaquise Buckner. Chicago police say Shaquise, who was the same age as Malia, appeared to have been the unintended target of a gang-related drive-by shooting early Saturday morning.Yet Attorney General Eric Holder went to Ferguson, not Chicago. Thirty-six people are shot in Chicago in a single weekend, seven of them fatally, yet the FBI sends 40 agents to Missouri to investigate the shooting death of one young black male.In his remarks on Ferguson and the difficulties of young black men, Obama spoke of ""communities that feel left behind; who, as a consequence of tragic histories, often find themselves isolated, often find themselves without hope, without economic prospects. You have young men of color who are more likely to end up in jail, or the criminal justice system, than they are to end up in a good job or college.""One of those communities is Chicago.The plight of young men of color didn't just happen overnight. It took decades of Great Society paternalism to destroy the black family, subsidize illegitimacy, impose a substandard educational system in thrall to teachers' unions, and to excuse inner city crime as the fruits of poverty. Obama spoke of his efforts to deal with the ""root causes"" of young black hopelessness, but here's one for you — the left turn in American politics.In 1950, black women were likelier to be married than white women, and only 9% of black families with children were headed by a single parent. Today the black out-of-wedlock birth rate is an alarming 72%. Yet the emphasis is more on promoting gay marriage than saving the black family.Obama's efforts at attacking ""root causes"" have fallen short. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, from the day Obama took office on Jan. 20, 2009, to April 2014, unemployment among blacks ages 16 to 19 grew from 35.3% to 36.8%. As Deroy Murdock points out in National Review, while 29.6% of blacks 16-19 were working when Obama took power, only 27.9% were employed as of April.The latest data available from the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey show the percentage of black Americans living in poverty expanded from 25.8% to 27.2% from 2009 to 2012. The latest Agriculture Department statistics show that among blacks, food stamp recipients rose from 7.4 million when Obama took office to nearly 11 million in 2012.Decades of Great Society paternalism, continued under Obama, have created a generation of young men without jobs or fathers, and catastrophes played out daily on the streets of Chicago and other urban centers. The tragedy is that we pay more attention to the reason Michael Brown was shot than to the reason Shaquise Buckner will never grow up to be a doctor.

1070,MO,"Second Amendment: An African-American single mom on her way to a birthday party for one of her kids faces 10 years in prison for straying into the Garden State carrying a firearm in her purse licensed in Pennsylvania.Shaneen Allen is less well-known than Michael Brown, the man shot by police in Ferguson, Mo., and it's doubtful Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton will pay her a visit anytime soon. They're busy elsewhere. A mother exercising her Second Amendment right not only to keep but to bear arms to protect her family is of little interest to them.Allen is a resident of Pennsylvania and has a Pennsylvania right to her permit. In October 2013, she was pulled over by New Jersey state troopers for an ""unsafe lane change.""When one trooper approached and asked for her identification, she remembered she had left her newly acquired firearm in her purse, which can happen to a single mom who works more than one job and leaves her home at odd times of the day.She had obtained the firearm after two robberies raised her concern for her and her family's safety.She was arrested and charged with illegal possession of a firearm because she didn't realize that New Jersey is one of 20 states that does not recognize Pennsylvania's permit. Ignorance of this law is apparently no excuse for New Jersey authorities failing to see that here was someone who obtained a firearm to prevent crime and not to commit one.""I got pulled over by the police,"" Allen told Fox News' Martha MacCallum last week.""I really didn't even think about, you know, the firearm being in my purse at the time until he asked for my credentials. When I went in my purse, before I went to get my credentials, I saw my firearm laying there. So, I let them know, you know, I had my license to carry on me, and I had my firearm in my purse.""As I let them know that, you know, that's when they started to, you know, lock me up and told me to step out of the vehicle and put cuffs on me.""Prosecutor Jim McClain, under New Jersey law, could have essentially given Allen a warning and a pass, treating it merely as a misdemeanor and sending her to municipal court or letting her enroll in one of the diversionary programs that New Jersey has established for peaceful first-time offenders.Yet he chose not to, and the unanswered question is: Why not?Allen's case mirrors that of Brian Aitken, a 27-year-old Colorado man who was divorced and chose in 2009 to move to New Jersey, where his ex-wife had moved, to be near his son. As Radley Balko told the story in Reason Magazine, police confronted Aitken after an innocent call by a mother concerned about her son's safety and state of mind.When they searched his car, they found his handguns, which were legally purchased in Colorado, locked, unloaded and stored in the trunk, as federal and New Jersey laws require for guns in transport.The police arrested Aitken anyway, charging him with unlawful possession of a weapon.New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie eventually commuted Aitken's sentence, and he should pardon Shaneen Allen. Neither is a criminal and neither should have been charged in the first place.All states should be required to respect the gun laws of other states and respect the rights of citizens to legally own guns, which is in the U.S. Constitution, just as they are being asked to with gay marriage, which is not.All jurisdictions should also know why private citizens obtain defensive firearms in the first place and do a better job of determining just who are the real criminals and who are not.

1084,MO,"Gun Control: A federal judge rules that the AR-15 and similar weapons commonly used in self-defense ""fall outside Second Amendment protection as dangerous and unusual arms,"" and we have no right to keep or bear them.Nobody looted the gun shop and tattoo parlor that share a storefront in a strip mall less than 10 minutes from Ferguson, Mo., where riots followed the police shooting of Michael Brown.According to the local Riverfront Times, the owners of County Guns and Tattoo Studio arrived with friends to protect their businesses. One owner carried a rifle and pistol and wore a vest, while the other had his own rifle.Their defensive use of firearms as rioters burned and looted other stores in the strip mall couldn't have occurred in Maryland. There, AR-15-style weapons are banned, more because of the rifles' ""scary"" appearance than their lethality. Maryland's Firearm Safety Act of 2013 makes their possession and open carry illegal.As the Ferguson riots raged, U.S. District Judge Catherine C. Blake, appointed by President Clinton, issued a ruling that upheld the Maryland law, saying, ""the court seriously doubts that the banned assault long guns are commonly possessed for lawful purposes . .. and is inclined to find the weapons fall outside Second Amendment protection as dangerous and unusual.""Now the Second Amendment, written in the era of muskets, does not mention what arms we have the right to keep and bear. But we have an idea, based on how they were used: to protect their owners' homes, businesses, farms and families, and to fight the tyranny of the British crown. It's been said that the Second Amendment was put in the Bill of Rights to protect the other nine.Gun control advocates say, with some snarkiness, that the Second Amendment doesn't allow one to own nuclear weapons or tanks, so it's merely a question of where we draw the line. They would draw the line at the AR-15 and its counterparts — which, despite the judge's claim, are commonly used for legal, defensive purposes.The AR-15 is among the guns that must be registered. They've made up 50%-60% of U.S. rifle sales in recent years, federal figures show. The New York Times recently called the AR-15 ""The Most Wanted Gun In America."" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has been pushing a bill to reintroduce the ineffective assault weapons 1994 ban that expired in 2004 with no impact on the crime rate.Feinstein's legislation would outlaw more than 150 types of weapons, from rifles to pistols to shotguns. They include the Streetsweeper and Striker-12, which, again, have frightening appearances yet chamber the same 12-gauge shells that are used to hunt birds.While used in several high-profile mass shootings, the AR-15 is favored among homeowners, hunters and sport shooters. It's popular for both sport and self-defense among women, who find it easy to carry and handle.Crime rates and homicides have dropped as concealed-carry laws spread nationwide. As more citizens are armed, predators find it harder to find unarmed victims except in gun-free zones such as the school in Newtown, Conn., or the theater in Aurora, Colo.All guns are dangerous, particularly when used by rioters and other criminals. But in the hands of law-abiding citizens, they are exactly what the Founding Fathers had in mind when they wrote the Second Amendment.

1088,MO,"Sprint and T-Mobile shareholders punished both stocks on Wednesday after merger talks between the two wireless carriers ended, but Dish Network rose as its CEO demurred on any takeover bid.Struggling Sprint (S) halted its pursuit of T-Mobile US (TMUS), the industry's comeback kid, after concluding that a deal would not win regulatory approval. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler praised Sprint's decision. U.S regulators prefer a national market with at least four players, including leaders Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&T (T), rather than three.Besides announcing that it wouldn't pursue T-Mobile any longer, Japan's SoftBank, which owns 80% of Sprint, replaced Sprint CEO Dan Hesse with Marcelo Claure, the former CEO of wireless phone distributor Brightstar.Sprint stock plunged 19%, while T-Mobile stock fell 8.4%. Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY), which owns 67% of ""Uncarrier""-branded T-Mobile, saw its U.S. shares slip 2.7%. SoftBank's stock tumbled 3.5% in Japan.Analysts see Dish Network (DISH); France's Iliad, which has made an offer; America Movil (AMX); and No. 1 cable TV firm Comcast (CMCSA) as potential buyers of T-Mobile, which has gained market share thanks to its aggressive marketing.Despite earlier statements of interest, Dish Network Chairman Charlie Ergen was cautious on the satellite broadcaster's earnings conference call early Wednesday.""It's not a surprise that Sprint is walking away from T-Mo. Regulatory officials sent clear messages,"" Ergen said. ""Obviously, we need to re-look at things based on what's happened on the M&A side the last 24 hours.""The No. 1 U.S. satellite TV broadcaster, DirecTV Group (DTV), agreed in May to be purchased by AT&T.""Obviously the AT&T-DirecTV deal probably lessened some optionality that we had. The Sprint announcement probably increases some optionality,"" Ergen said.In May, Ergen said that if Sprint and T-Mobile didn't merge, then he would be interested in T-Mobile. And last November, Ergen said that buying T-Mobile was still ""on the table"" despite Sprint's interest.Ergen has touted mobile video services as the satellite-TV firm's next growth engine as its core business matures.For Q2, Dish reported fewer video subscriber losses than expected but turned in a financially mixed quarter, with EPS light and revenue in line with estimates. Dish said that it lost 44,000 subscribers in Q2, compared with 78,000 in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts had expected a loss of 77,000 subscribers. Dish had 14.05 million customers as of June 30.Ergen Controls Dish VotingErgen, who holds nearly 90% of Dish's voting power, has had wireless setbacks. At one time, Dish pursued MetroPCS Communications, a regional wireless carrier eventually acquired by T-Mobile. Last year, Dish lost takeover battles for Sprint and Clearwire to SoftBank.Federal regulators in 2012 granted Dish a waiver to use airwaves that it acquired from two bankrupt satellite companies for 4G wireless service, as long as Dish builds out a network. To do that, Dish needs to find a wireless partner or to make an acquisition.Sprint — which will likely need cash for building out its 4G network and for upcoming spectrum auctions — and T-Mobile loom as possible Dish targets or partners.""With Sprint out of the way, this may finally be Dish Network's moment to bid for T-Mobile,"" said William Power, an analyst at R.W. Baird""Deutsche Telekom still has several exit options, the best strategically being Dish — who would bring a material amount of spectrum, a customer base, the potential for video bundling and experience in the U.S. market,"" Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Paul de Sa said in a research report.French telecom upstart Iliad last week made a surprise $15 billion, $33 per share bid for a controlling stake in T-Mobile. But Deutsche Telekom has said that it's not in talks with Iliad, which has been a price cutter in France.According to Reuters, Iliad is speaking with Dish and other U.S. firms to pursue a joint bid for T-Mobile. Potential partners include cable TV firms.Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, is skeptical of a Dish bid for T-Mobile.""Is Ergen now a buyer rather than seller?"" Moffett asked in a report. ""Dish's valuation assumes the company will sell its spectrum. Whether it would be accorded the same valuation (as a buyer) is unclear.""Dish has more than $9 billion in cash on its balance sheet and could borrow from banks to fund a wireless deal. Analysts have pegged the value of Dish's spectrum to a wide range of $7 billion to $17 billion. It's not clear if regulators would set conditions on a sale.Moffett, on the other hand, also said that ""the logic of an America Movil bid (for T-Mobile) looks very compelling.""Mexico-based America Movil, controlled by Carlos Slim, operates U.S. prepaid firm TracFone. TracFone, which leases network capacity from AT&T and Verizon, has almost 26 million U.S. subscribers. AT&T in June sold its 8.27% stake in America Movil for $5.57 billion, making it more plausible that the Latin American firm might make a push into the U.S.Mobile VideoMeanwhile, AT&T's proposed acquisition of DirecTV Group could spur Comcast to bid for T-Mobile US to compete better with AT&T in mobile video services, speculates UBS analyst John Hodulik.Comcast, a one-time investor in Sprint, has touted its plans to expand public Wi-Fi networks. Comcast also has the option to lease wholesale network capacity from Verizon Wireless under the terms of a radio-spectrum sale. But Hodulik says that Comcast would be better off owning a wireless network.Comcast is seeking regulatory approval to acquire No. 2 cable firm Time Warner Cable (TWC).

1090,MO,"Developing trust is a vital building block of any relationship, whether it's with an organization, family or marriage, says Rodger Dean Duncan, a Liberty, Mo.-based executive coach.""I tell my clients that trust is the operating system of any culture,"" he told IBD. ""You can have wonderful software programs, but if the operating system is flaky, you're going to have a lot of problems.""Here's how to build that trust:• Get familiar. When Paul Hiltz took over as CEO of Mercy Hospital in Cincinnati in 2006, it was struggling financially and having problems retaining employees. Hiltz told Shawn Hunter, author of  ""Out Think,"" that he got to know each employee and got his to-do list from their suggestions. Some ideas weren't expensive, like fixing equipment and replacing carpet.""Instead of delivering edicts from on high, he asked people who had been there for 10 years,"" said Hunter, vice president of leadership matters at online education software provider Skillsoft. ""It gave them a sense of hope and aspiration.""• Be genuine. Howard Behar, former president of Starbucks' (SBUX) North America unit, once worked for a struggling company and had to fire a batch of people.He told Hunter that someone left a memo on the copier outlining the move, and employees found it. Some of his executives suggested he say the memo wasn't true. But his assistant said, ""Howard, only the truth sounds like the truth.""Behar came clean with employees, telling them about the firm's woes. They quickly pitched in with solutions. ""Truth and transparency build trust,"" Hunter said.• Be clear. Talking around a topic or giving selective facts — like saying you led a project without mentioning that six others helped lead it too — causes others to lose faith in you. ""Clear the fog,"" said Duncan, author of ""Change-Friendly Leadership."" ""Talk to people the way you want them to talk to you.""• Give useful feedback. People tend to tell people ""good job"" without explaining. Duncan suggests telling them what they did well, such as: They were attentive to the audience's needs and gave good examples during a presentation.• Show the way. Do what you've said you would. ""Otherwise, your credibility will be eroded immediately,"" Hunter said. One study showed kids were likelier to share candy with others when adults did so rather than told them to do it.• Listen. Campbell Jones, chief operating officer of auto auctioneer Manheim Australia, regularly gets out of the office to meet with customers, listen to employees' issues and back them up, Hunter says. That's important.• Seek dissent. Duncan worked at Campbell Soup (CPB) years ago when Gordon McGovern was CEO. When someone argued with him, McGovern would say, ""Oh, terrific, you disagree. Help me understand how you see it.""Said Duncan: ""You can use resistance as a springboard to dialogue.""• Display the result. Show your people the effect of their work. A study found that University of Michigan students were more effective in raising scholarship money when they met the potential recipients than if they didn't know who would get the money.""It gets people deeply vested in the process,"" Hunter said.• Emphasize the good. Duncan met a Scotland Yard expert in counterfeit currency who concentrated on what the real thing looked like. An NFL coach often stopped practice to tell a receiver what he did right. ""That's a wonderful leadership principle, to focus on the behavior we want,"" Duncan said.

1104,MO,"Regulation: Governments from the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles to the city of Los Angeles have ordered a legitimate business to cease operations. Is America no longer the land of free-market opportunity?Large and growing numbers of Americans have availed themselves of the services of Uber, Lyft and other businesses that compete with traditional taxicabs. These rideshare companies are finding favor because, in words of Brian Doherty writing in Reason's blog, they are ""superhelpful, wonderful"" and make life easier for nearly everyone.The companies use a smartphone app to pair car owners with people who need rides. Writing in USA Today, Glenn Reynolds, law professor and Instapundit blogger, said rideshare offers ""the comfort of a limo service, with the convenience of a taxicab."" ""I get a better service,"" he says, and ""the driver gets a job.""One Lyft driver told news site RYOT last year that he's learned from customers that many use his services because they feel safer and more comfortable than they do in cabs and buses.Uber has been valued at $18 billion while Lyft said in April said it was raising $250 million in capital. Clearly, consumers and investors are smitten with the companies — but regulators, not so much.The Virginia DMV has ordered both companies to cease and desist operations. Officers in Miami-Dade County, Fla., are posing as riders so they can seize cars and fine rideshare drivers up to $2,000.Kansas City, Mo., police have ticketed drivers while New Mexico's Public Regulation Commission has voted to order Lyft to shut down operations in the state. Austin, Texas, is also citing rideshare drivers and taking their cars. Last year, Los Angeles told the companies to stop providing rides.Time magazine reports that ""no fewer than 14 states have issued warnings"" to the rideshare businesses.And for what? What harm are these companies doing? Why are we criminalizing people who willingly give lifts to people who need rides and allowing government to choke off golden business and work opportunities?On one level, it's hard to understand why the startup rideshare companies are drawing bureaucrats' fire. After all, the parties enter into the arrangement voluntarily: Riders glad to get where they need to go, and drivers glad to get paid for taking them there.But then, rideshare companies are operating outside bureaucrats' and politicians' sphere of control. The businesses aren't licensed. (Is that really necessary?) Drivers aren't trained. (Is there some compelling reason that they should be?) And neither are they certified. (No one would suggest that drivers should be certified to give rides to their friends and family — so why does providing rides to strangers be any different?)Governments defend fees, licenses and certification as necessary components of consumer safety. But they also benefit from the hurdles they place in front of businesses. Combine the staggering amounts of money at stake with the government-caused artificial scarcity of taxicab licenses, and the outcome is poison fruit ripe for corruption.The licenses, or medallions, required for taxicabs to operate in New York City now cost more than $1 million per vehicle. In Boston, the price is north of $600,000.Governments rake in the cash and, in return for the high fees, cab companies are protected from competition by government, which caps the number of medallions it will issue. This creates an environment in which cab owners have a strong incentive to bribe officials to obtain new licenses.The argument for government oversight falls even flatter considering that rideshare companies screen drivers, buy liability insurance, require drivers to provide their own insurance, inspect drivers' cars, insist they drive relatively new vehicles and accept feedback.Instead of punishing innovators who benefit consumers and create jobs while favoring companies that pay for government protection, policymakers should be opening up this market consistent with America's free-enterprise tradition.

1107,MO,"It was the early 1870s, and that uncle, Jay Decker, owned a meatpacking concern in Chicago.
"
1108,MO,"George, the second of 11 children, left school at 12 to work and made his way to Jay's shop.
"
1109,MO,"""My hours were long and the work exhausting. At a busy time I often worked 14 hours at a stretch,"" wrote Hormel in his unpublished memoir, ""The Open Road."" ""I was young and tough, but at the day's end I tumbled into bed like a felled ox. When morning came, someone often had literally to kick me out to waken me. I often wonder how I stood that killing pace as well as I did. But I learned things working for my uncle I might otherwise never have learned so thoroughly.""
"
1110,MO,"That experience proved invaluable. When Hormel was 31, he opened his own meatpacking company, Geo. A. Hormel & Co., and turned it into one of the biggest in the country.
"
1111,MO,"By the time he retired 36 years later, the company had annual sales of $74.6 million, according to HormelFoods.com. Along the way, he created well-loved classics, such as Spam and Dinty Moore beef stew, that generations of Americans grew up on.

"
1114,MO,"Hormel (1860-1946) was born in Buffalo, N.Y., to John and Susanna Hormel, German immigrants.
"
1115,MO,"By the time he was 6, the family had moved to Toledo, Ohio, where his dad opened a tannery, according to a profile by Anita Gaul in Immigrant Entrepreneurship.
"
1116,MO,"George worked in the tannery after school and on weekends and became skilled. But as the country plunged into financial depression in 1873, he left school and worked full time to help support the family.
"
1117,MO,"Holly Johnson, executive director of the Hormel Historic Home, an independent nonprofit not connected to Hormel Foods, says of George striking out on his own: ""It's not like he was one to sit around and play or read books. He was a hard worker; he saw his father working hard.""
"
1118,MO,"George worked first in construction for menial wages.
"
1119,MO,"He moved on to a meat market, loading ships and the Western Railway Co. After that was the stint with Uncle Jay.
"
1120,MO,"Turning 19, George wanted more money. He was making $7.50 a week (worth $180 now), less than half what skilled workers earned, wrote Gaul. So George left Chicago with a friend for Kansas City, Mo., where the boys imagined jobs would be plentiful.
"
1121,MO,"In fact, it took weeks of searching before they found work. He wrote in his memoir of finally receiving an offer from a hide and wool company that he was ""speechless with surprise and relief and also fright at this sudden turn of fortune.""
"
1122,MO,"In a Hormel Historic Home blog post, Johnson wrote, ""Throughout his writing he mentions several times in his life and career when the freedom to attempt something, however risky or scary, often led to his greatest successes.""
"
1123,MO,"That job was short-lived. Soon George was back in Chicago, working as a traveling salesman buying animal hides. Yet he yearned for more. Mulling a question his father asked of him, ""When are you going to begin working at something you can show me in 30 years?"" and nursing a desire to open a business of his own, George scoped out buying opportunities.
"
1124,MO,"In 1887, he found one. A customer in Austin, Minn., along Hormel's route, was selling a meat shop. George saw his chance and bought the business.
"
1125,MO,"He had loftier goals than just being a butcher, Johnson told IBD: ""He was disappointed that he was 27 years old and didn't have much to show for it in terms of saving or settling, so this was his chance to achieve that goal.""
"
1126,MO,"Hormel borrowed $500 (worth $12,600 now) from his hide employer and bought the business in partnership with another man.
"
1127,MO,"The two soon had differences on how to run the business, so they dissolved the partnership. With that money, Hormel established his own packinghouse in Austin, a town in southeast Minnesota, and named it Geo. A. Hormel & Co.
"
1128,MO,"The new venture was in the thick of a highly competitive industry, notes Gaul. The Big Five packers, which included names still known today such as Armour and Swift, were all based in Chicago.
"
1129,MO,"They dominated the volume of business and set the technological standards for the industry.

"
1131,MO,"""As a small, fledging meatpacker, Hormel could not even begin to compete in terms of market share with the Big Five, particularly because he did not own any refrigerated railcars until after the turn of the century,"" Gaul wrote.
"
1132,MO,"Meanwhile, George married an Austin native, Lillian Gleason, in 1892. Their one child, Jay, was born later that year.
"
1133,MO,"Hormel knew he had to specialize in other ways, so he made a calculated decision to specialize in pork. He figured it offered the best return on investment because the entire pig's carcass could be used, unlike with other animals.
"
1134,MO,"He was also devoted to quality, which, he wrote, ""was our only defense against the competition we had to meet from the big packers.""
"
1135,MO,"Said Johnson: ""He just knew that as the cost of labor and goods was going up and his competitors were opting for cheaper and less sanitary ways of doing things, he wouldn't budge on that. He credits that to his mother, who was German; he learned that lesson shining shoes on Saturdays.""
"
1136,MO,"Hormel expanded and opened two more meat markets in Austin, increasing the number of hogs he slaughtered from 610 in his first year to 8,666 five years later and 42,538 in his 10th year, wrote Gaul.

"
1138,MO,"Hormel was well-loved by his workers because he worked alongside them and felt personally invested in their success, notes Gaul.
"
1139,MO,"Austin became bound up with the Hormel company. The firm emphasized hiring from the local community while offering opportunities for advancement. And it was one of the only meatpackers to keep workers employed year-round, rather than laying them off after the slaughter, as most did.
"
1140,MO,"Geo. A. Hormel was incorporated in 1901, when it became so big that George could no longer run it as what he called ""a one-man show."" Sales were $710,795 in 1902 and rocketed to $5 million (worth $124 million now) in 1912, Gaul wrote. The firm was slaughtering 1 million hogs annually by 1924.
"
1141,MO,"For all its growth, some technological changes, such as developing a canned ham, had been elusive.
"
1142,MO,"Then Jay came marching home. The son, fresh from World War I, came up with creative ideas about marketing and packaging food and implemented them. The son was particularly interested in canned food, which was ""pretty deeply entrenched"" in America, said Anna Zeide, a University of Wisconsin scholar specializing in food history.
"
1143,MO,"Commercial canning took off in the late 19th century and flourished during the world wars when women entered the workforce and placed a premium on convenience food, says Zeide. Hormel's canned ham launched in 1926. Dinty Moore stew and Hormel chili entered the market in 1935.
"
1144,MO,"The company's greatest success, Spam, hit store shelves in 1937 and grabbed an 18% market share among canned ham products within its first year.
"
1145,MO,"Spam was a bonanza for Hormel because it was made of the pork shoulder, which had been considered ""a throwaway piece of meat,"" said Carolyn Wyman, author of ""Spam: A Biography.""

So George left Chicago with a friend for Kansas City, Mo., where the boys imagined jobs would be plentiful.In fact, it took weeks of searching before they found work. He wrote in his memoir of finally receiving an offer from a hide and wool company that he was ""speechless with surprise and relief and also fright at this sudden turn of fortune.""In a Hormel Historic Home blog post, Johnson wrote, ""Throughout his writing he mentions several times in his life and career when the freedom to attempt something, however risky or scary, often led to his greatest successes.""That job was short-lived. Soon George was back in Chicago, working as a traveling salesman buying animal hides. Yet he yearned for more. Mulling a question his father asked of him, ""When are you going to begin working at something you can show me in 30 years?"" and nursing a desire to open a business of his own, George scoped out buying opportunities.In 1887, he found one. A customer in Austin, Minn., along Hormel's route, was selling a meat shop. George saw his chance and bought the business.He had loftier goals than just being a butcher, Johnson told IBD: ""He was disappointed that he was 27 years old and didn't have much to show for it in terms of saving or settling, so this was his chance to achieve that goal.""Hormel borrowed $500 (worth $12,600 now) from his hide employer and bought the business in partnership with another man.The two soon had differences on how to run the business, so they dissolved the partnership. With that money, Hormel established his own packinghouse in Austin, a town in southeast Minnesota, and named it Geo. A. Hormel & Co.The new venture was in the thick of a highly competitive industry, notes Gaul. The Big Five packers, which included names still known today such as Armour and Swift, were all based in Chicago.They dominated the volume of business and set the technological standards for the industry.Cold Reality""As a small, fledging meatpacker, Hormel could not even begin to compete in terms of market share with the Big Five, particularly because he did not own any refrigerated railcars until after the turn of the century,"" Gaul wrote.Meanwhile, George married an Austin native, Lillian Gleason, in 1892. Their one child, Jay, was born later that year.Hormel knew he had to specialize in other ways, so he made a calculated decision to specialize in pork. He figured it offered the best return on investment because the entire pig's carcass could be used, unlike with other animals.He was also devoted to quality, which, he wrote, ""was our only defense against the competition we had to meet from the big packers.""Said Johnson: ""He just knew that as the cost of labor and goods was going up and his competitors were opting for cheaper and less sanitary ways of doing things, he wouldn't budge on that. He credits that to his mother, who was German; he learned that lesson shining shoes on Saturdays.""Hormel expanded and opened two more meat markets in Austin, increasing the number of hogs he slaughtered from 610 in his first year to 8,666 five years later and 42,538 in his 10th year, wrote Gaul.Nurturing EmployeesHormel was well-loved by his workers because he worked alongside them and felt personally invested in their success, notes Gaul.Austin became bound up with the Hormel company. The firm emphasized hiring from the local community while offering opportunities for advancement. And it was one of the only meatpackers to keep workers employed year-round, rather than laying them off after the slaughter, as most did.Geo. A. Hormel was incorporated in 1901, when it became so big that George could no longer run it as what he called ""a one-man show."" Sales were $710,795 in 1902 and rocketed to $5 million (worth $124 million now) in 1912, Gaul wrote. The firm was slaughtering 1 million hogs annually by 1924.For all its growth, some technological changes, such as developing a canned ham, had been elusive.Then Jay came marching home. The son, fresh from World War I, came up with creative ideas about marketing and packaging food and implemented them. The son was particularly interested in canned food, which was ""pretty deeply entrenched"" in America, said Anna Zeide, a University of Wisconsin scholar specializing in food history.Commercial canning took off in the late 19th century and flourished during the world wars when women entered the workforce and placed a premium on convenience food, says Zeide. Hormel's canned ham launched in 1926. Dinty Moore stew and Hormel chili entered the market in 1935.The company's greatest success, Spam, hit store shelves in 1937 and grabbed an 18% market share among canned ham products within its first year.Spam was a bonanza for Hormel because it was made of the pork shoulder, which had been considered ""a throwaway piece of meat,"" said Carolyn Wyman, author of ""Spam: A Biography.""During World War II, contracts with the military boosted Hormel, with sales doubling from 1939 and 1942, thanks largely to Spam.In 1927, George appointed Jay president of the company and moved with Lillian to Beverly Hills, Calif. After he died at age 85, he was buried in Austin.

"
1194,MO,"Two weeks before his 12th birthday in 1918, a resume of fighting, truancy and stealing became the basis for a court order putting him in a black reform school for juveniles. The scared Satchel was ordered to stay until he was 18.

1203,MO,"After his reform school release, he returned home, where his mom told him it was time to work and help the family. He ended up making money with the semipro Mobile Tigers, with whom his brother Wilson also pitched.
"
1204,MO,"By the mid-1920s, Paige was pitching for the Chattanooga White Sox of the Negro Southern League. His monthly salary was $250, worth $3,400 today. He'd eventually earn more money than any player, black or white, drawing $30,000 annually — worth $490,000 now — barnstorming in exhibitions.
"
1205,MO,"Paige didn't take his stardom for granted. ""I was putting in plenty of hours (of practice) before the other players got up in the mornings and after they went home at nights,"" he noted. ""I'm still trying to rest up from all that practice.""
"
1206,MO,"Alex Herman, a former semipro player and owner of the Chattanooga team, mentored Paige.

"
1214,MO,"Paige expanded on what he meant: ""When you look back, you know how long you've been going, and that just might stop you from going any farther. And with me, there was an awful lot to look back on. So I didn't. That let me keep on going, and keeping going more than anything else made Ol' Satch the reputation he had.

""Satchel had to outwit his opponent.""Even with his blazing fastball, Paige reflected: ""If you can't overpower 'em, outcute 'em.""Paige was also taught how to study a batter to find weaknesses to exploit, and to refine his delivery.""My coach showed me how to kick up my foot so it looked like I'd blacked out the sky,"" he wrote. ""And he showed me how to swing my arm around so it look like I let go of the ball when my hand was right in the batter's face.""After his reform school release, he returned home, where his mom told him it was time to work and help the family. He ended up making money with the semipro Mobile Tigers, with whom his brother Wilson also pitched.By the mid-1920s, Paige was pitching for the Chattanooga White Sox of the Negro Southern League. His monthly salary was $250, worth $3,400 today. He'd eventually earn more money than any player, black or white, drawing $30,000 annually — worth $490,000 now — barnstorming in exhibitions.Paige didn't take his stardom for granted. ""I was putting in plenty of hours (of practice) before the other players got up in the mornings and after they went home at nights,"" he noted. ""I'm still trying to rest up from all that practice.""Alex Herman, a former semipro player and owner of the Chattanooga team, mentored Paige.""Lesson one was location, location, location,"" Tye wrote. ""And the key to great control, Herman reiterated to Paige, was practice.""Paige said his pitching philosophy ""is simple: You gotta keep the ball off the fat part of the bat.""So was his strategic approach: ""If a man can beat you, walk him.""And his mastery of control: ""Just take the ball and throw it where you want to. Throw strikes. Home plate don't move.""Soon before joining the Indians, Paige married for the third time, to Lahoma Brown. The couple had several children, the last one born when Satchel was in his 50s.Looking AheadPaige was 58 when he made that last MLB appearance, with Kansas City, tossing three scoreless innings. Among his rules for staying young was perhaps his most lasting: ""Don't look back. Something might be gaining on you.""Paige expanded on what he meant: ""When you look back, you know how long you've been going, and that just might stop you from going any farther. And with me, there was an awful lot to look back on. So I didn't. That let me keep on going, and keeping going more than anything else made Ol' Satch the reputation he had. That and a good fastball.""

And Google in 2012 reportedly talked with Dish Network (DISH), a satellite broadcaster that has been amassing wireless spectrum.Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan, in a research report Friday, speculated that Google might even acquire T-Mobile US (TMUS), which is 67% owned by Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY).Google said in February that it's in talks with 34 cities in nine U.S. markets to expand its 1 gigabit-per-second Internet service.

The company says it's in talks with government officials in Portland, Ore.; San Jose, Calif.; Salt Lake City; Phoenix; San Antonio; Nashville, Tenn.; Atlanta; and North Carolina's Charlotte and Raleigh/Durham.None of Google's proposed or already built-out markets include areas where East Coast-based Verizon sells its FiOS broadband and TV service via a high-speed broadband network.Another potential partner for Google could be Globalstar Telecommunications, which is seeking regulatory approval to use 2.4GHz spectrum for a large-scale urban Wi-Fi network, says Stephen Sweeney, an analyst at institutional broker-dealer Elevation. Amazon.com (AMZN) has been linked to Globalstar.RELATED: Google, eBay Merger Suggested

Moreover, all three are trading near new highs.Altria Group (MO), best known for Marlboro cigarettes, pays a quarterly dividend of 48 cents a share. That translates to an annualized yield of 5.1%. Altria raised its dividend from 44 cents on Aug. 23, making the 47th increase in the past 44 years.In Q3, the company beat earnings and sales expectations and raised its guidance. The stock is testing resistance around 37.Reynolds American (RAI), the nation's No. 2 tobacco company, is paying 63 cents per quarter, for an annualized yield of nearly 5%.Reynolds raised the dividend in May, lifting it by 4 cents. Just three years ago, the quarterly dividend was 45 cents a share.The company's earnings growth has ranged from 6% to 14% the past six quarters, making it one of the most steady in IBD's database.The stock broke out of a cup with handle last week. It remains near the 51.35 buy point.Lorillard (LO)'s quarterly payout is 55 cents a share, for an annualized yield over 4%. In February, the dividend went up from 51.7 cents. Four years earlier, it was 30.7 cents.Lorillard, which also has one of the steadiest earnings histories, has shot up more than 12% from an Oct. 10 breakout past 45.70.Tobacco firms have the advantage of making products that are habit-forming. That makes the stocks attractive for income investors. But the industry also faces heavy regulation, continued litigation over health risks and a publicity campaign against smoking.The industry is trying to compensate by offering smokeless tobacco products such as electronic cigarettes. They look like regular cigarettes but don't produce smoke, ashes or smell, while creating a vapor containing nicotine.

1276,MO,"Driven to help solve their clients' problems, advisors tend to derive great satisfaction from their work. But sometimes, mundane aspects of the job get in the way.Dealing with administrative hassles, compliance issues, and squabbles among staffers can lead to burnout. Conducting daily client reviews can turn what was once a stimulating experience into boring, repetitive drudgery.Ensnared in a workaday routine, advisors may not notice their eroding enthusiasm until it's too late. As their listlessness deepens into a more serious funk, they can lose their spark and might dread coming into the office.The most attentive advisors ward off burnout before it intensifies. They take proactive steps — such as taking time off or at least not overloading their schedule — so that they stay fresh and committed to providing excellent service.""Years of ups and downs in the market can wear on you,"" said Tony Perrone, an advisor in Orlando, Fla. ""And then there's what I call 'compliance burnout' with all the changes in compliance that can seem overwhelming.""For Perrone, 47, the solution is adopting a four-day workweek as much as possible. For the last four years, he has taken off most Fridays.""It's a good remedy that lets the staff catch up with you not there,"" he said. ""You give them that time to breathe, and that makes them happier. When they're in a better mood, I'm in a better mood the other four days.""Perrone acknowledges that he has the option to take one day off a week because he's paid his dues. He launched his career 24 years ago, and he says that for the first 20 years ""you've got to run full speed.""He cites two side benefits from skipping most Fridays. For starters, Perrone feels less compelled to take extended vacations. He says that the longest he's been away from the office is five business days.""And I probably took 10 client calls that week,"" he added.Second, his three employees enjoy operating autonomously when he's not around. His absence gives them a chance to take more responsibility and build stronger relationships with clients.Other advisors view sabbaticals as a welcome option to combat a midcareer lull. Taking a month or more to step away from the business can reignite an advisor's passion.A handful of larger firms offer sabbaticals, and some implement programs to encourage advisors to recharge periodically. A few firms go further, requiring advisors to take extended leave.At BKD Wealth Advisors, every advisor takes a one-month paid sabbatical every five years. It's a non-negotiable condition of employment.""The firm asks a lot from you for the other four years and 11 months,"" said Jack Thurman, managing partner at the Springfield, Mo.-based company. ""Everyone loves the sabbatical.""Over the 17 years that BKD's program has been in place, Thurman has qualified for three sabbaticals. He's enjoyed leisure travel, including fly fishing, and spent the last week at home to smooth the transition back to the office.Part of the rationale for mandatory sabbaticals is that it forces advisors to provide extensive professional development to employees. They must train their team to handle myriad tasks while they're away for a month.""We believe that you have to be replaceable and set up duplicative processes,"" Thurman said. ""You have to teach people to be better than you. A sabbatical won't be successful for those who don't like to delegate.""To minimize disruption, BKD advisors commit to their month off a year in advance. This enables colleagues to plan for their absence.During their month away, they cannot access their work email or voice mail. Co-workers provide client service and manage other duties so that the advisor can relax without worrying about paperwork piling up.""You turn it off for one full month and you turn it off hard,"" Thurman said. ""When you get back, you should have no email, so there's no need to play catch-up.""The forced vacation allows some midcareer advisors to reassess their careers. Thurman says that while some partners in their 50s return with renewed verve, others decide to take early retirement. The sabbatical thus affords them a chance to reflect on their personal and professional priorities.Thurman, 55, returned from his last sabbatical two years ago with a clearer picture of how he intends to harness his energy. To pave the way for his retirement, he seeks to create a lasting system of excellence.""I want to leave a legacy at this firm,"" he said. ""I'm focusing on a good risk structure and building operational efficiencies so that when I leave, I've laid the groundwork for a successful transition.""RELATED:Top Advisors Discuss Their Most Valuable LessonsStarting Over: Setbacks Vanquished And Lessons Learned

1278,MO,"Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is telling advertisers it's stepping up spending on YouTube's original content, but Google's programming slate will still look much different from that of big-budget producers Netflix (NFLX) or Amazon.com (AMZN).At an annual advertising event Thursday night, Google hinted at spending hundreds of millions of dollars for new, professionally produced original content, as opposed to its regular fare of uploaded video. But its spending will still pale in comparison to that of Amazon and Netflix — both of which have scored awards for TV shows and movies.Amazon is set to spend some $4.5 billion on video in 2017, JPMorgan estimated in April, while Netflix's tab could top $6.5 billion.Google told advertisers it will team with celebrities Kevin Hart, Katy Perry and Ellen DeGeneres to create shows as well as YouTube's own stars, Rhett & Link and The Slow Mo Guys. Singer Demi Lovato is also expected to produce a TV show.Google also spends on content for YouTube Red, a $10 monthly subscription service without advertising. Google launched YouTube Red in late 2015, but hasn't disclosed subscriber totals.YouTube Red's originals have been mostly spun off from a roster of young stars who developed large audiences with their ad-supported videos. Google, at the advertising event, reportedly told agencies that it's increasing spending on high-quality programming.IBD'S TAKE: Alphabet stock has climbed 20% in 2017, with much of that gain coming in low volume since it reported Q1 earnings. Alphabet stock is extended from an 874.52 technical buy point but has underperformed its FANG (Facebook, Amazon.com, Netflix) peers.

1281,MO,"The Obama administration claimed that it negotiated with Syria and Russia to eliminate ""100%"" of Syria's chemical weapons. After President Barack Obama's 2012 ""red line"" warning to Syria about using chemical weapons, Syria launched a chemical attack in August 2013. But U.S. military action was avoided by the alleged Russian/American/Syrian diplomatic accomplishment, achieved without ""firing a shot."" Here's what we were told:President Obama, on April 28, 2014: ""We're getting chemical weapons out of Syria without having initiated a strike.""Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., crowed on June 1, 2014: ""We're getting the chemical weapons out of Syria."" And Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., chimed in July 6: ""We should commend the administration for the result that they got.""Then-Secretary of State John Kerry, on July 20, 2014: ""We got 100% of the chemical weapons out (of Syria).""President Obama, on Aug. 18, 2014: ""Today we mark an important achievement in our ongoing effort to counter the spread of weapons of mass destruction by eliminating Syria's declared chemical weapons stockpile.""Kerry on Oct. 31, 2014: ""We ... cut the deal that got 100% of the declared chemical weapons out of Syria, and people nevertheless have been critical — of one day of bombing versus the virtue of getting 100% of the chemical weapons out of Syria.""Kerry reiterated the accomplishment on Feb. 24, 2015, telling the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: ""We got, as you know, last year, all the chemical weapons out of Syria.""True, Bloomberg reported on May 13, 2015: ""The U.S. government was informed months ago that an international monitoring body found traces of chemical weapons that President Bashar al-Assad had promised to turn over, including sarin gas — a clear violation of the deal he struck with President Obama after crossing the administration's 'red line' two years ago.""Officials from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons told the Obama administration early this year that its inspectors had found traces of two banned chemical weapons during an inspection of the Syrian government's Scientific Studies and Research Center in the district of Barzeh near Damascus, two administration officials told us. A report by Reuters May 8 said that OPCW inspectors had found traces of sarin and VX nerve agent at the site in separate inspections in December and January.""After the Bloomberg story, then-White House press secretary John Earnest initially admitted: ""We're aware that the OPCW continues to receive credible allegations that the use of chemical weapons in Syria is still taking place."" But a month later, on June 17, 2015, Earnest responded: ""(Syria's) declared chemical weapons stockpile that Assad previously denied existed has now been acknowledged, rounded up, removed from the country and destroyed precisely because of the work of this administration and our successful efforts to work with the Russians to accomplish that goal.""But Susan Rice, then Obama's national security adviser, on Jan. 16, 2017, said, ""We were able to find a solution that didn't necessitate the use of force that actually removed the chemical weapons that were known from Syria, in a way that the use of force would never have accomplished. ... We were able to get the Syrian government to voluntarily and verifiably give up its chemical weapons stockpile.""After last week's chemical weapons attack that left nearly 100 Syrians dead, former Obama advisers now say they always knew that not all of chemical weapons were eliminated — and that turning over all their weapons is not exactly what tyrants tend to do.Antony J. Blinken, a former deputy secretary of state, recently said, ""We always knew we had not gotten everything, that the Syrians had not been fully forthcoming in their declaration.""Michael McFaul, Obama's former ambassador to Russia, said, ""For me, this tragedy underscores the dangers of trying to do deals with dictators without a comprehensive, invasive and permanent inspection regime.""Tom Malinowski, an assistant secretary of state for human rights under Obama, laments: ""The difficult and debatable choice the Obama administration ... made not to use military force when Assad last used nerve gas against his people (in 2013) will shape our thinking about this and similar crises for a long time to come. The lesson I would draw from that experience is that when dealing with mass killing by unconventional or conventional means, deterrence is more effective than disarmament.""This brings us the Obama's Iran deal that allegedly prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Why should we believe that Obama was any less duped here than when he claimed the elimination of ""all"" of Syria's chemical weapons?We shouldn't.
"
1282,MO,"In October 1945, as he prepared to announce the signing of Jackie Robinson to break the color barrier in Major League Baseball, Branch Rickey visited his friend, the well-known broadcaster Lowell Thomas.""Branch, all hell will break loose!"" Thomas told Rickey, as recounted by Lee Lowenfish in ""Branch Rickey: Baseball's Ferocious Gentleman."" ""No, Lowell,"" Rickey replied. ""All heaven will rejoice.""Rickey, then the Brooklyn Dodgers' president and general manager, is remembered for his courage and foresight in breaking baseball's color line, the unofficial racial barrier which had stood firmly since the late 1800s. Robinson played his first game as a major leaguer 70 years ago this week.Rickey often said that he was drawn to the cause of racial equality when, in 1903, he observed Charles Thomas, the only black member of the Ohio Wesleyan University baseball team, being denied a hotel room in South Bend, Ind. ""I never felt so helpless in my life,"" said Rickey.A 1949 Newsweek profile noted that Rickey spent ""two intensely secretive years"" considering the implications of breaking baseball's color barrier, not even informing the Dodgers' scouting department of his potential move.""When Robinson was signed, it effectively opened up the biggest pool of talent in history,"" said Daniel R. Levitt, co-author with Mark L. Armour of ""In Pursuit of Pennants: Baseball Operations from Deadball to Moneyball.""Rickey's innovations are seen throughout baseball today. He established the first ""farm system"" for developing major league talent and encouraged the use of statistical analysis in evaluating players. He promoted modern training methods and equipment.More broadly, Rickey elevated and exemplified the baseball general manager position, a role that most often had been taken on by an owner or team president. Under Rickey, it would include everything from player development to scouting.Rickey left an ""unmatched resume in the game,"" wrote Armour.  ""As a general manager he dramatically changed how teams find and develop players, and what players are allowed to play the game. His place as the greatest GM in baseball history is secure.""Wesley Branch Rickey (1881-1965) was born in Stockdale, Ohio, to Frank and Emily Rickey. Lowenfish writes that the family had a ""hardscrabble existence,"" trying to subsist on a vegetable farm.Born into a pious family, Rickey's name derived from John Wesley, a founder of Methodism. The name ""Branch"" came from scripture, possibly from a passage in the Old Testament.Rickey studied at Ohio Wesleyan, arriving on campus as ""the picture of the hayseed,"" according to Lowenfish, and experienced a difficult transition. He made his mark on both the football and baseball fields, showing ""plenty of pep and ginger"" as a catcher.In 1903, Rickey witnessed the stellar performance of Charles Follis, who is believed to have been the first black professional football player. Follis' on-field achievements, combined with his poise in the face of racial pressures, impressed Rickey, planting a seed for his determination years later to integrate baseball.After signing a minor league baseball contract in 1903, Rickey debuted in the majors with the St. Louis Browns in 1905. His playing career over four seasons was pedestrian. While catching, he allowed a stunning 13 stolen bases in a single game, setting a dubious record. Following an arm injury and a bout of tuberculosis, Rickey enrolled at the University of Michigan Law School. He also became the baseball coach at Michigan.In 1913, Rickey became an executive for the Browns, signing future Hall of Famer George Sisler and later managing the team for more than two seasons. In 1919, Rickey joined the St. Louis Cardinals as team manager and president. In 1925, he was fired as manager by owner Sam Breadon, a serendipitous move which allowed Rickey to focus exclusively on being an executive.Rickey revamped the Cardinals' roster, laying the groundwork for six pennants and four World Series during his 24 seasons there. He quickly released players who did not meet his standards, turning around a previously mediocre franchise. Rickey acquired eventual stars Joe Medwick and brothers Dizzy and Daffy Dean, who shaped the Cardinals' ""Gashouse Gang"" in the 1930s.Though Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis was dismissive of Rickey's farm system, fearing it would destroy the existing structure, Rickey used it to great success.  The World Series-winning 1942 Cardinals were built with players Rickey's system developed, including Stan Musial, the best player in franchise history.Rickey reshaped the entire organization:""The farm system allowed Rickey to institute the 'Cardinal Way,' "" said Levitt.  ""It was an organizational philosophy extending from the lowest farmhands to the Major League team. It instituted organizationwide training techniques and defined what sort of players the team's scouts would seek.  There became a pride in being a Cardinal. Rickey was the first baseball executive to develop this kind of organizational framework.""Rickey joined the Dodgers before the 1943 season. The core players of Brooklyn's six World Series teams between 1947 and 1956 were acquired and developed under Rickey. With Brooklyn, Rickey hired the first team statistician, opened a team spring training facility in Vero Beach, Fla., and implemented new training techniques, including the use of pitching machines.Rickey was acutely aware that he needed to sign the right player to break baseball's color barrier.""Mr. Rickey knew he needed a superb player or the man wouldn't stand a chance,"" said Carl Erskine, a member of the Dodgers from 1948 through 1959 and a teammate of Jackie Robinson for nine seasons. ""Robinson was a four-letter man at UCLA. His best sport may have been football, not baseball.  And he had to be intelligent.  Jackie certainly was.""Mr. Rickey said to Jackie: 'If a fight starts on the field, I'm picking you. You're quicker, you're faster, and you're stronger. You're going to win the fight. But are you strong enough not to fight? You must tell me that you're willing to commit yourself not to fight.' When Jackie said, 'I think I can do it,' Mr. Rickey read to him a paraphrased version of 'Turn the Other Cheek,' a verse in the Bible, about having the courage to resist.""Rickey, according to Erskine, stressed the Christian faith of both of their mothers in making his plea and offer to Robinson. ""That was a critical moment, often unmentioned in history, when Jackie made the commitment.""Robinson, who debuted 70 years ago this week, was National League Rookie of the Year in 1947 and led Brooklyn to the World Series. Robinson's struggles and triumphs are an integral part of American history, and his importance to baseball and its growth is immense.Rickey encouraged Cleveland to sign Larry Doby, the first African-American to play in the American League, because he did not want to ""corner the market on black players,"" wrote Lowenfish.""Mr. Rickey unselfishly gave up a Hall of Famer for the American League to be integrated,"" said Erskine. ""That was selfless and is too often forgotten.""The African-American players whom Rickey signed, including Don Newcombe and Roy Campanella, were central to Brooklyn's success throughout the 1950s. After losing a power struggle, Rickey left the Dodgers for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1950. While the team struggled during his time as general manager, Rickey acquired many of the top players on Pittsburgh's 1960 World Series-winning team, including Roberto Clemente.""There was no one quite as good at seeing greatness in raw talent,"" Lowenfish told IBD. ""In evaluating players and hiring quality scouts, nobody quite matches Rickey.""But, while his farm system allowed him to acquire players cheaply, ""he was hated because he made the money and the players didn't,"" said Lowenfish. Erskine said that Rickey was often referred to as El Cheapo, connoting a reputation for miserliness which Rickey had difficulty shaking, even though he sometimes spent profusely on players.Some suggested that Rickey's decision to sign Robinson also had underlying financial motivations.  Others criticized Rickey for never coming to the ballpark on Sundays, as he honored the Sabbath to pay homage to his mother.Erskine said that Rickey tested players, trying to learn how they processed information.""He helped many players excel, through his patience and his unique methods. In spring training, he used to talk to players as they worked out. He wanted to see if you had aptitude.""He had a $5 bill which he'd lay on home plate. He'd say: 'Son, I want you to throw the ball with your hand backwards to the plate. If you can hit that $5, you can have it.' He often gave us little tests which helped him make judgments about players. He wanted to know if you could learn unconventionally.""On Dec. 9, 1965, Rickey died at age 83 of heart failure in Columbia, Mo. Nearly a month earlier, he had collapsed while giving a speech during his induction to the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame and never regained consciousness. He was survived by his wife, Jane, and five daughters.""Mr. Rickey was a human dynamo,"" said Erskine. ""He truly kept going until he stopped.""Rickey's most prominent contribution will always be signing Robinson to break baseball's color barrier:""To me, Rickey and Robinson were the right combination,"" said Lowenfish. ""The years when they were together were vital to the country. Rickey was the indispensable man in that move. He also deserves credit for two other revolutions: the farm system and trying to establish the Continental League, a rival league which didn't succeed but which certainly prompted expansion.""What he was able to achieve was remarkable. Given his humble beginnings and extraordinary achievements, Rickey really was the Horatio Alger story writ large.""Innovative baseball executive who helped break baseball's color barrier by signing Jackie Robinson.Overcame: Widespread resistance to baseball's integration and to many of his innovations.Lesson: Importance of thinking strategically and maintaining focus on long-term goals regardless of opposition.""Ethnic prejudice has no place in sports, and baseball must recognize that truth if it is to maintain stature as a national game.""MORE ABOUT LEADERS:Roy Campanella Was A BattlerEwing Kauffman Applied His Winning Formula To Sales, Education, BaseballVin Scully Prepared To Become Baseball's Master Storyteller

1284,MO,"From advertising to billing to record-keeping, advisors face a slew of rules. Even the most diligent, honest practitioners can get headaches — or worse — as they try to obey compliance directives.As advisors grow their businesses and hit certain thresholds for assets under management, they must register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. State securities laws and registration requirements also hold sway for many advisors.Compliance issues are fluid. The ever-changing nature of the rules, along with the volume of records to maintain, can pose a challenge to advisors and their staffs.Many advisors outsource compliance to specialized firms that monitor the latest rulings and provide services, support and technology platforms to streamline processes. Their software centralizes relevant tasks so that advisors and their employees need not develop their own checklists, document management and alert systems.But whether they farm out compliance support or manage it internally, advisors who stay out of trouble adopt best practices and fold them into their everyday routine.""The SEC expects an advisor's compliance program to be a living, breathing, organic thing that's integrated into their practice,"" said Mark Perlow, a San Francisco-based partner at Dechert, a law firm. ""It really has to be part of your day-to-day operation, as opposed to thinking of it as some rules in a book on a shelf that's purely your compliance officer's job.""For many advisors, keeping up with technological advances tests their compliance protocols. The prevalence of mobile devices adds a wrinkle.Andrew Denney, an advisor in Springfield, Mo., notes that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) requires a broker-dealer to retain all forms of communication, including texts. As a result, he says that many advisory firms impose a no-texting rule because of the difficulty of archiving text messages.""Say someone steals a client's cellphone and texts the advisor with a request to 'send $10,000 to my account,'"" Denney said. ""You have no way to verify who's sending that text message.""As consumers gain awareness of a fiduciary's role to act in their best interest, it has intensified the scrutiny of transactions that pay a commission. Advisors are taking steps to disclose the details of such moves.""Anytime we sell a product with a commission like a mutual fund, we send the client an 'investment switch letter,' "" Denney said. ""Before our advisor goes out of product A into product B, the client and our compliance officer must approve the switch by signing off on the letter.""In addition to preventing advisors from generating excess commissions on a client's account, the switch letter protects advisors if a client later questions the transaction. The documentation summarizes the advisor's rationale for the transaction in plain English along with any investment-related fees.For advisors at larger firms who are registered with — and regulated by — the SEC, issues of disclosure take on many forms. The federal agency periodically audits advisory practices to evaluate their adherence to various rules.In February, the SEC released a list of the five compliance topics most often identified in deficiency letters that its examiners sent to advisors. The issues related to general compliance measures (such as maintaining customized compliance manuals and conducting annual reviews of internal policies), regulatory filings, custody, code of ethics, and books and records.The SEC treats all five compliance areas as important and its inspectors seek proper documentation to show that advisors follow the rules. But some of the topics are harder to understand than others.""Among those five areas, the one that engenders the most confusion and misunderstanding is custody,"" Perlow said. ""That's because the SEC's rules are strict, complicated and not always clear.""The custody rule applies to advisors who have access to client cash or securities. It aims to protect client funds from advisors who engage in unlawful activities or face financial difficulties.Advisors who have custody of client assets are subject to surprise exams. The definition of custody is not static; for example, the SEC recently amplified its interpretation of the rule when clients sign a letter of instruction to authorize their advisors to transfer assets.""The surprise exam requirement is burdensome so advisors try not to have custody,"" Perlow said. ""But the SEC keeps tightening the screws on custody.""When Perlow conducts mock SEC exams for advisors, he likes to ask the firm's managing partner or chief executive, ""What are the top three to five issues that require the most compliance attention?""""They need to practice so that they answer quickly, succinctly and persuasively,"" he said. ""The SEC wants to see that you have a good grasp of how your firm is solving those compliance needs.""RELATED:What's Happening In The Stock Market Now?Win Over Millennials By Helping Them Attain The Lifestyle They WantSafeguard Your RetirementDo You Have The Best Performing Mutual Funds In Your Portfolio

1285,MO,"While places like Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C., grab headlines for their skyrocketing rents, better profit-growth potential can be gotten in Southern and Rust Belt markets, argues a recent report from Attom Data Solutions.When it comes to return on investment, says Attom, places like Clayton County, Ga., in the Atlanta area, Bibb County, Ga, in the Macon area, and the city of Baltimore all had annual gross rental yields of more than 23% on single-family rentals — the highest in the country.Not far from Baltimore, though, in Arlington County, Va., gross rental yields for similar properties were the lowest in the U.S. — at 3.4%. Silicon Valley's Santa Cruz and Santa Clara counties weren't much better, at 4.1% and 4.2%, respectively.In looking at markets with the greatest potential returns this year, however, Attom's list is dominated by Rust Belt counties like Trumbull, Lucas, Greene, and Clark in Ohio, and Dauphin, Delaware and Westmoreland in Pennsylvania. In these places, year-over-year wage growth was at least 5% and annual wage growth beat any price increases in fair market rentals. The provider of real estate data expects those counties, among several others, to see average gross rental yields of at least 12% on single-family homes.""While good returns on single family rentals are hard to come by in high-priced coastal markets and in some other housing hot spots such as Denver and parts of Dallas, Austin and Nashville, solid returns on single-family rentals will continue to be available in many parts of the Southeast, Rust Belt and Midwest for investors purchasing in 2017,"" said Attom's senior vice president, Daren Blomquist, in the report's news release. ""And single family rentals should continue to yield strong returns in many parts of the country going forward given the market undercurrents of low rent-ready housing inventory and low homeownership rates.""In estimating the yields on single-family rentals, Attom looked at three-bedroom properties in 375 U.S. counties with populations of at least 100,000, then divided their annualized gross rent income by the median purchase price.Attom's analysis also found:MORE ABOUT RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE:Why 3 of 4 Homebuyers Expect To Be Stressed This YearCities Where Millennials Are Taking Over The Housing MarketHousing Market's Lost Generation Is Finding Its Way HomeAre These The Hottest-Selling Suburbs In U.S.?

1286,MO,"DepoMed (DEPO) stock tumbled to a low Wednesday not seen since a year ago, after the company pre-released negative first-quarter guidance and saw its chief executive resign amid a management shake-up and a U.S. senator's probe into opioid marketing.At the closing bell on the stock market today, DepoMed shares fell 3.1% to 13.79, after earlier falling as much as 5%. Shares hit an intraday 12-month high in late September but are down nearly 50% since then.Late Tuesday, DepoMed guided to $95 million to $100 million in first-quarter sales, lagging analysts' broader views by $15 million. That guidance will be revised May 8, during the Q4 conference call.The company also announced a management shift that saw Arthur Higgins replace former CEO James Schoeneck. Gavin Molinelli and William McKee were also added to the board.Higgins, Molinelli and McKee are aligned with activist investor Starboard, which is known for its big stake in HP Enterprise (HPE). Following the shake-up, only three of the nine board members are legacy members, Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler noted in a report.DepoMed's board changes also followed reports earlier in the day that U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., is seeking marketing information, sales records and studies from manufacturers of top-selling opioids in the U.S.McCaskill says sales of prescription opioids have quadrupled since 1999. DepoMed was named the fifth top seller of opioids in a CNBC report. Other leaders listed include Purdue Pharma, Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Janssen division, Insys Therapeutics (INSY) and Mylan (MYL).IBD'S TAKE: DepoMed isn't the only company facing activist investors. Analysts say Bristol-Myers Squibb could be bought if pressure mounts from investors such as Carl Icahn. Who would bid on Bristol? Head to IBD's Technology page for a deeper dive.Still, DepoMed sold only $190 million in opioids in 2015 vs. the industry leader, Purdue, which made $1.5 billion off its OxyContin drug, a well-known painkiller, according to Janney analyst Ken Trbovich.Trbovich sees the investigation posing little risk to DepoMed, which didn't begin selling opioids until acquiring Lazanda in 2013 and Nucynta in 2015, ""at which time diversion and abuse of prescription opioid medications was decreasing.""Koffler, of Mizuho, sees DepoMed being taken out.""With Starboard remaining involved, we have raised the expected probability of takeout from 30% to 50%,"" she said. ""This generates a hypothetical $16 takeout value for the stock, and may still allow Starboard to record a modest gain on its initial investment.""Alone, DepoMed is worth 10 to 13 per share in a takeout due to lower sales estimates, she said. But Koffler cut her views for this scenario to 50% from 70%. She also trimmed her price target on DepoMed stock to 13 from 16, but kept her neutral rating.Janney's Trbovich has a buy rating on DepoMed stock.RELATED:DepoMed Downgraded On Weakness In Base Business, Stock Run-Up

1287,MO,"X Under Armour (UAA) has a stronger brand than three years ago and people still love wearing activewear — those are the main take-aways from Jefferies' upgrade of the Nike (NKE) rival that are sending shares up early Friday.""The bottom has formed,"" declared the report's headline, as Jefferies analyst Randal Konik upgraded the stock to buy from hold and upped his price target to 27 from 19. He also added Under Armour to the firm's franchise picks list.Why? For one thing, athleisure is a trend that's got stamina: The research firm's survey of 2,000 consumers found that about 25% more of those polled are wearing activewear four to five times a week, almost a third are buying more athletic apparel for themselves, and a quarter more are purchasing more such apparel for their kids.Nike's mixed results Tuesday had some on the Street pointing to competition from Under Armour and, in particular, a resurgent Adidas (ADDYY). Jefferies' poll agrees that Adidas ate into Under Armour's market share, ""but gains are moderating"" as the Kevin Plank-helmed company makes inroads with children and finds more popularity.IBD'S TAKE: Under Armour got a buy rating from Jefferies, but the stock is in a long downtrend, hitting a 3 1/2-year low as recently as Wednesday. Sales growth has slowed and Wall Street expects the company to post outright losses in the first half of this year. Focus your attention on top-rated companies with strong, even accelerating growth whose stocks are setting up in bullish bases.""We were guarded on UA during '16 given Adidas, and UA EPS and stock are down 75% and 50%+, respectively, in 6 mo. predominantly due to share transfer,"" wrote Konik.But Street estimates aren't taking into account stabilization in the North America market, flattening gross margins, expansion into international markets and category extensions, he said.Konik said his research indicates that ""an inflection has formed and the buying (opportunity) is now.""Under Armour shares rose 3.6% to 19.66 on the stock market today. On Wednesday, Under Amour fell to 18.40 intraday, its lowest level since September 2013.Nike shares rose 1.8%, regaining their 50-day line after tumbling 7% Wednesday following its weak Q3 sales and margins. Adidas edged lower.Skechers (SKX), which was upgraded to outperform by Cowen & Co., climbed 5.2%.

1288,MO,"T-Mobile US (TMUS)  is in the ""driver's seat"" with a number of merger options, according to brokerage firm UBS, which also hiked its price target on the wireless carrier firm Wednesday and cut first-quarter earnings estimates for rivals AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ).UBS analyst John Hodulik raised his price target on T-Mobile to 80 from 63. Merger talks among telecom firms have been on hold pending the end of a government auction of radio spectrum owned by local TV stations. The auction is expected to end in April.""With M&A (mergers) coming into focus as the auction quiet period ends, we believe T-Mobile is in the driver's seat,"" said Hodulik in a report.The UBS analyst shaved his first-quarter earnings for Verizon to 95 cents from 99 cents amid intensified wireless competition. Hodulik reduced AT&T's first-quarter earnings estimate to 73 cents from 78 cents.""After a highly competitive end to 2016, Q1 shows no signs of relief as (promotions) are expected to weigh on service revenue and margin trends for the group,"" said Hodulik.Hodulik says the most likely scenario has T-Mobile merging with Sprint (S), although a Trump Department of Justice could oppose reducing the number of national wireless firms to three from four. Makan Delrahim, a former DOJ lawyer in the Bush administration, is reportedly the front-runner to head the agency's antitrust division.IBD'S TAKE: Which companies are hitting 52-week highs? That's easy to find at IBD's New Highs, but that list goes one big step better. That is, it ranks the companies making new highs by Composite Rating. ""We continue to believe a Sprint/T-Mo deal is likely given the benefits of moving from 4 to 3 players and the significant synergies it would create,"" added Hodulik.Verizon last month reintroduced unlimited data plans amid market share gains by T-Mobile and Sprint, which aggressively pushed unlimited promotions in late 2016.One view among analysts is that the proliferation of unlimited-data offers among wireless firms could make it harder for cable TV firms Comcast  (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR) to break into the wireless business. The cable TV firms hold rights to lease access to Verizon's network on a wholesale basis, under a so-called mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO, deal.Shares in T-Mobile climbed 1.3% to 63.27 at the close on the stock market today.RELATED:Sprint Could Sell To T-Mobile, But Dish Network LoomsVerizon, Comcast Merger Talk A 'Nonstarter,' Says JPMorgan

1290,MO,"When Brandon Schatz learned in December 2012 that Kansas City, Kan., had become the first city in the nation to get Google Fiber, a superfast internet service, he started making plans to move his nascent sports photography business there. The day after Christmas, he drove the 165 miles from his home in Springfield, Mo., to check it out. By Feb. 1, he had settled into his new house. By Feb. 4, he was connected to the network. That was exactly what officials had wanted. When the area (first Kansas City, Kan., with Kansas City, Mo., added weeks later) won a challenge to be the first to get Google Fiber, local boosters celebrated, hoping to kick-start an economic renaissance: attracting entrepreneurs, cultivating emerging business districts, and becoming known as a major startup hub.Four years later, Schatz's company Sportsphotos.com, which takes photos of amateur sporting events around the country, is growing slowly. He's taking full advantage of the speedy internet, uploading hundreds of high-resolution photos in minutes from races and other matches. But the business isn't yet where he wants it to be, and for now Schatz's main source of income is web development work and renting out rooms in his home on Airbnb. On a recent Sunday, Schatz sat in his home, where he also operates his company, pecking away at a desktop, surrounded by pizza boxes. ""I thought we would be huge already,"" he said.Schatz's disappointment is a tale of misplaced expectations, by both entrepreneurs and city leaders. In 2011 the cities' two mayors called Fiber's then-future deployment ""a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,"" and a way to ""spark economic development."" And for Google, which since significantly has pared down support for the project, it was a case of placing too much faith in the ability of its own technology to change lives.It's also been hard for the Kansas City area to become the boom town that leaders dreamed of. Some entrepreneurs, like Schatz, were drawn to the city because of the fiber, and some launched businesses. A ""startup village"" sprang up. But few of the companies really took off, and some frustrated founders ended up decamping to San Francisco, where there was a larger talent pool and greater access to capital. Even the best of intentions and superspeedy internet isn't enough to create a new Silicon Valley.Every year after the first fiber connections lit up for Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google in late 2012, greater Kansas City's GDP growth has fallen well short of the national average. In 2015, it was just 1.5%, compared to 2.6% for the nation as a whole. Metro regional numbers aren't yet available for all of 2016, although based on state numbers through the third quarter, both Kansas and Missouri seem to be beating the national average.""We're scratching our heads a little bit,"" said Jeff Pinkerton of the Mid America Regional Council, a nonprofit that conducts economic research for greater Kansas City. ""Why is Kansas City really not taking off, especially with this asset like Google Fiber?""Google came to town in 2011. At Wyandotte High School auditorium, on the Kansas side, blue, red, yellow and green spotlights shone on a parade of dignitaries who addressed the audience. Google founder Sergey Brin spoke on a prerecorded video. After the announcement about fiber going into Kansas City, a Google vice president invited the crowd to a barbecue-laden celebration.Kansas City beat out more than 1,000 other cities for the debut Google fiber project, which aimed to compete against the telecommunications and cable giants that have dominated the market for internet access. Some analysts believed the ultimate goal was to encourage those competitors to improve their own services and thus the internet experience overall, which would bolster the environment for Alphabet's most lucrative business: online search.Mayors of both cities announced a team of civic leaders to figure out how best to leverage fiber, in entrepreneurship as well as other areas such as education. The group released a plan in 2012 that made recommendations ranging from nurturing technology districts to supporting tax credits for small technology businesses to creating mentor networks.Despite budget challenges, the state of Kansas has stuck by a pre-existing income tax credit of up to $50,000 for angel backers who invest in a young company. Working with a group called Techstars, Kansas City-based Sprint (S) created an incubator for startups. The Kauffman Foundation, a think tank based in Kansas City, Mo., started a weekly gathering for entrepreneurs.An area straddling State Line Road, the border, became the first neighborhood that Google wired for fiber, and a community of founders sprang up. The district, which had zoning laws that made it easier to run a business from home, became known as Startup Village. That's where Schatz, the owner of Sportsphotos.com, moved into a rental house.It was an online video about the Kansas City experiment that drew him. He realized that Google Fiber could be the key to his nascent business: Batches of photos that took 40 to 50 hours to upload would be done in less than one. ""It's a little nerdy, to see this video and be all kinds of inspired,"" says Schatz, 34, a boyish looking former U.S. Army sergeant whose tours of duty included Bosnia. ""But I was inspired.""Yet in practice, a dazzling internet connection didn't mean much for some businesses. Mike Farmer operated his startup, Leap, a search engine, out of a Startup Village house for a while. ""What do you do with gigabit speed that makes the experience more relevant?"" he recalls asking his team. They goofed around with ideas, such as having search results take the form of several high-definition Netflix movies streaming at the same time. Given that most users wouldn't have gigabit internet, Leap never did find the right scenario. Farmer wound down the business last year.""The true power of Google fiber is exposure,"" says Matthew Marcus, executive director of the Kansas City Startup Foundation and co-leader of the Startup Village, referring to the publicity the technology brought to the city's startup community. ""The fact is, it's really difficult to consume one gigabit of speed.""Some startups have contended with the lack of access to a big talent pool. Tech companies in Silicon Valley, Waterloo, Canada, and New York City, tend to hire from nearby universities with strong software-engineering programs. The schools with the strongest engineering schools in the region are more than two hours away from Kansas City, though.Funding has also been a problem in Kansas City. Entrepreneurs lamented that local investors looked for the type of traction that would merit tens of millions of dollars from Silicon Valley venture firms. But if businesses achieve that, Midwestern venture firms invest just single-digit millions. Lack of access to capital contributed to the departure of two promising Kansas City startups, bond marketplace Neighborly and green-homebuilder Acre, which both moved most operations to Silicon Valley.""There are plenty of angels that will write $50,000 checks, but there's not that much bridge,"" says Sandy Kemper, chief executive officer of Fairway, Kansas-based C2FO, a working-capital finance company he founded in 2008. Kemper turned to big investors outside Kansas City, including San Francisco's Mithril Capital and Singapore's Temasek Holdings, for most of his backing. In his hometown, ""there is a finer filter, and maybe a little bit higher hurdle.""One advantage cited by many local entrepreneurs, low costs, can actually backfire. ""It might be a misplaced sense of comfort,"" says Ajay Royan, the general partner at Mithril Capital who invested in C2FO. He believes the best entrepreneurs work with an intensity driven by the reality of global competition — a reality too easily lost sight of in a low-pressure, low-cost environment. ""If you get comfortable with the fact that things seem to be going well in Kansas City,"" he says, and don't think beyond it, ""that's bad.""C2FO is one many other entrepreneurs hope will eventually list on a public market and raise hundreds of millions of dollars, with a valuation north of a billion. It has already raised $99 million and is used by some of the world's biggest companies, including Acer, Costco (COST), Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKA) BNSF Railway, and Pfizer (PFE). That type of public offering, more than anything, would truly foster entrepreneurship in Kansas City, entrepreneurs say. It would show existing investors the upside of investing more than a few thousand dollars in startups, along with creating a class of richly rewarded early employees who would in turn likely become investors in other startups — or founders of their own.Lance LeMay, a venture capitalist at Kansas City, Mo.-based Open Air Equity Partners who invested in Kemper's and Farmer's companies, said boosting the venture-backed startup ecosystem in Kansas City won't even take that much. ""More than a billion-dollar exit, you need lots of successful exits,"" he said. ""You don't need a home run. You need lots of doubles.""In the years that Kansas City has been trying to make the most out of Fiber, Google has been doing the same. In early days, company executives talked it up, with executive chairman Eric Schmidt telling conference goers in late 2012 that of all the company's current innovations, including self-driving cars, it was Google's ""most compelling on many levels,"" something that ""changes your life."" Shortly afterward, it started announcing more cities for the project, beginning with Austin, Texas, and Provo, Utah. In 2013, the company recruited Craig Barratt, a wireless chip industry veteran, to lead the group that included Fiber. In 2015, when Google became Alphabet, Barratt was given the title of CEO. Over time, Google Fiber announced it would expand into 21 cities.But just as Kansas City might have overestimated the asset that Google Fiber could become, Google overestimated Fiber's impact, and its expansion plans deflated. Barratt left in October 2016, surprising many employees. The same day, the unit announced it was stalling expansion plans in eight cities and cutting 9% of its staff. This month, Alphabet hired Barratt's replacement, broadband executive Gregory McCray, and further slimmed Fiber, shifting hundreds of its employees over to Google's core internet business.Fiber is now in only nine locations, including Atlanta and Orange County, Calif. Other Bets, the part of Alphabet that Google Fiber belongs to, reported losses of $3.58 billion last year on revenue of $809 million. It also contributed to Other Bets' $1.39 billion in capital expenditures.A number of factors lay behind Fiber's strategic shift. Former employees said a chief reason was the discrepancy between the desires of Google's co-founders to expand the service and make it faster and the demanding costs of providing it. Cable incumbents moved aggressively, introducing similar high-speed services at low prices. Unexpected political hurdles emerged. In Louisville, Ky., for instance, AT&T (T) and Charter Communications (CHTR) sued Google Fiber over a wonky utility-bill regulation.""Google invested in Fiber during a time when it was willing to make lots of big investments with uncertain or long-term returns, but over the last couple of years Google has become a different place,"" says Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. ""It doesn't necessarily make sense for Alphabet to continue to invest in it as heavily at this point.""Schatz recently changed his business model. Instead of getting amateur athletes to pay for the photos, they download them for free, with sponsorship fees providing his revenue. Having observed the reluctance of local investors to back companies that lack strong income, he is working to build relationships with big sports retailers and fitness companies that could sponsor the blanket photography of the events he shoots.The race-photography business alone is worth $20 million to $50 million annually a year on sponsorships, he calculates; add in other amateur sports and expanded marketing initiatives and it could be exponentially more. But for now, he's capturing just a tiny portion; revenue last year doubled but was still under $100,000, he says. This year, he hopes to keep growing and achieve profitability.He knows developing ties to potential sponsors would be much easier in a city like New York or Los Angeles, but he believes he can pull it off from the heartland.Sometimes, he thinks back to advice a venture capitalist gave him a few years ago, to drop everything else and focus only on his business. The laid-back atmosphere in Kansas City made it easier to put that advice aside, he says.""It probably would have been good to have extra pressure,"" he says now. Still, he says perks such as a community of fellow entrepreneurs make him happy he stayed put.Meanwhile, some of the original startup supporters in Startup Village have sold their real estate to non-entrepreneurs.After Google Fiber came to town, Brad Feld, a venture capitalist at Boulder, Colo.-based Foundry Group bought a bungalow in Startup Village for use, gratis, by a promising young company. For a time, Leap's Farmer housed interns there. Today, a startup engineer lives in the house. On a recent visit, a layer of dark fuzz and grime obscured floors. A vacuum cleaner stood at the far end of the main room, plugged in but apparently unused. A side room lacked furniture, but did sport a large pile of clothing flung in its center. A skittish cat bolted across the kitchen.Three doors down the street, Schatz has decided to launch an intense search for financial backers. An early port of call: Silicon Valley.MORE ABOUT REAL ESTATE:Southeast Sees Rents Rise Despite High Vacancy RatesAre These The Hottest-Selling Suburbs In U.S.?U.S. Homebuyers' Break-Even Point Just Got A Little More DistantSurvey Finds That The Most Affordable Major Housing Markets Are In America

1291,MO,"Social Security's day of reckoning is a dozen years away, according to the Congressional Budget Office. ObamaCare may be headed for crisis as early as next year. Here's how to save both, offering more affordable coverage and preserving the old-age safety net — without breaking the Treasury.ObamaCare was sick and in need of major surgery no matter who won the election, but with the Trump administration unwilling to promote enrollment or step up enforcement of the individual mandate, the exchanges could be headed for a crisis.Humana (HUM) said on Feb. 14 that it's making a complete exit. UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET) already have one foot out the door, while Anthem (ANTM) and Molina (MOH) won't commit to sticking around in 2018.Democrats may be tempted to stand aside, watch ObamaCare unravel and let the GOP reap the whirlwind, but they have an obligation to play a constructive role. Even before this year's enrollment decline, the pool of customers was too small, too old and too costly, and premiums have soared as a result.Here's ObamaCare's harsh reality: Even among working-class households earning 150% to 250% of the poverty level, supposedly the law's big beneficiaries, just 1 in 3 people who lack insurance from other sources are getting coverage that will protect them from financial disaster. Most of the other two-thirds are uninsured, either because they or a spouse work full time and don't qualify for exchange subsidies, or else they've spurned subsidized bronze plans that carry $6,000-$7,000 deductibles.Yet here's the truth about Republican repeal-and-replace plans: They all give a better deal to young, healthy and middle-class insurance shoppers by making health care unaffordable for older, higher-cost and low-income individuals. For a 64-year-old, low-income couple, the same plan that costs $1,000 under ObamaCare could cost $18,000 under new Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price's Empowering Patients First plan.So this is the key question: Can't we come up with a more uplifting approach that doesn't treat health insurance markets as a zero-sum game, creating millions of losers as well as millions of winners?Yes, definitely. If enough Democrats are willing to be honest about ObamaCare's flaws and the extent of our budget challenges, and enough Republicans are willing to acknowledge that taking away ObamaCare's protections for millions who depend on it is not a good idea, it just might be possible to change the debate and accomplish some big things.Politics aside, there are two big hurdles standing in the way. The first is a hurdle of understanding. No one on Capitol Hill seems to realize that the best step forward for public policy, within the realm of what might be possible, is to give people a choice between the comprehensive coverage that Democrats want them to have (and that many people with chronic conditions or low incomes clearly need) and the consumer-driven model that Republicans believe in, which allows people to opt for catastrophic coverage and set aside funds to cover basic medical needs.The second hurdle is one of resources. Replacing ObamaCare with something that works much better and gives people more freedom to choose options that work for their finances won't be free. Yet, realistically, any bipartisan plan put forward can't raise tax rates and must deliver big budget savings. Some of those savings can be found within the health care system, as explained below.There is also very good reason to marry Social Security reform with a health insurance fix that keeps care affordable for people under 65. RomneyCare, the model for ObamaCare, reduced work among adults age 55 to 64, the Boston College Center for Retirement Research found.Health insurance subsidies that rise as income falls encourage people to claim Social Security benefits early, replacing a bigger paycheck. Spending a bit less on early retirement — without pulling away the floor of support for those who really need it — would give people a nudge to work longer. That would lead to better personal financial outcomes, limiting penalties people will face for retiring early — a lifelong 30% hit to annual benefits for those who claim Social Security at age 62 — and averting the need to cut Social Security benefits in very old age to restore the program to solvency.The plan here would close more than half of Social Security's financing hole without raising the retirement age or cutting any benefits for the very old, while creating a stronger minimum Social Security benefit for modest-wage workers to keep them from falling into poverty late in life — something policymakers on the left and right have wanted to do forever.A central problem with ObamaCare is that the rules stacked the deck in favor of those needing comprehensive coverage and gave a bad deal to pretty much everyone else.Think of a couple, age 30, in St. Louis, Mo., with income of $40,000 (about 200% of the poverty level) and a child covered by Medicaid. For this couple, the cheapest silver plan under ObamaCare offers pretty solid coverage but costs $2,430 — likely too much for a family that's probably already struggling to save anything. The cheapest bronze plan, costing $1,068, might be doable, but the $13,300 deductible could make a hospital stay financially devastating.The chasm between silver and bronze deductibles — $700 vs. $13,300 — is by design, though clearly a poor one. ObamaCare provides extra cost-sharing subsidies that shrink deductibles for modest-income households, but only if they buy silver plans. Those cost-sharing subsidies work exactly like premium subsidies, paid directly from the government to insurers each month, even if the policyholder gets no medical care.Looking through the lens of this 30-year-old St. Louis couple, a bipartisan replacement, merging Republican principles and Democratic values, is easy to identify.First, don't get rid of the comprehensive option. If this couple is trying to have a second child or one spouse has a chronic condition, they will be desperate for a low-deductible plan with a wide range of essential benefits.IBD'S TAKE: The difficulty of Republicans in settling on a replacement for ObamaCare is threatening to sidetrack the rest of President Trump's economic agenda, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. That's been good for gold prices.Second, offer people the flexibility to choose a Republican option. A replacement for ObamaCare could give young, modest-income families the chance to set aside some savings for health expenses with two simple tweaks. Relax ObamaCare's age-rating restrictions that inflate insurance costs for the young, but only for high-deductible plans, keeping comprehensive plans affordable for older adults. (That could mean silver plans with a 3:1 age rating, bronze 4:1 and catastrophic 5:1.)Next, let people use cost-sharing subsidies to reduce premiums. Those two steps would shrink that 30-year-old St. Louis couple's bronze premium to zero, and they'd have about $900 left to put in a Health Savings Account to defray medical expenses — not nirvana, but a dramatic improvement over what ObamaCare offers.Families above 200% of the poverty level, who are more likely to be uninsured, should be able to opt for coverage with higher deductibles than bronze, roughly around the ""copper"" option proposed by the insurance industry and some moderate Democrats. These steps could make premiums essentially free for everyone up to 250% of the poverty level.Third, give people fair treatment. There are some 4.5 million uninsured full-time workers — and their spouses — who don't qualify for exchange subsidies, even if workplace coverage costs close to 10% of income. They shouldn't be denied the help given to people buying coverage on the individual market.Further, members of the middle class who earn too much for ObamaCare subsidies should be treated more equitably relative to their peers covered through the workplace. A logical solution would give a tax credit equal to 25% of the cost of a silver plan, while limiting the income-tax benefit to 25% of the cost of employer-provided coverage and capping that benefit for high-income households. People in the 25% tax bracket (up to $91,151 for singles and $151,900 for married couples) wouldn't be hurt by the tax change, while there would be minimal effect for those in the 28% bracket (up to $190,150 for singles and $231,450 for couples).Fourth, get rid of the mandates. The employer mandate is easy to dodge and ends up harming the low-wage workers it was supposed to help. As for the individual mandate, if people earning up to 250% of the poverty level can get coverage essentially for free, and most will get extra cash on top, there's probably no need to threaten them.Above 250% of the poverty level, post-ObamaCare rules should eliminate the incentive to go without coverage when one is young and healthy, then sign up when one's health starts deteriorating. A logical approach, much like Medicare's late-enrollment penalties, would very gradually shrink future tax subsidies based on how long people go without coverage. This should apply to both the individual market and employer market, or else people would have reason not to get coverage between jobs that offer insurance.Republican plans would steer people who develop costly conditions while their coverage has lapsed to separate subsidized high-risk pools. The idea is understandable, since a small number of high-cost patients can substantially raise premiums for the whole pool, particularly in relatively small markets. Yet, if these separate high-risk pools are supposed to offer good and affordable coverage (as they should), the availability of this option could provide peace of mind for the uninsured and encourage people to go without coverage. That's just one of the reasons why it makes more sense to hold down premiums in the individual market through another mechanism that accomplishes the same goal.That would entail an ongoing federal reinsurance program that recoups a portion of insurer expenses for the highest-cost patients, much like Alaska is doing to keep its individual market viable (while asking the federal government to foot the bill). Republican governors should be in favor of federal reinsurance, or else states with an older population or less-healthy pool of customers could end up bearing a disproportionate share of the cost of repairing and replacing ObamaCare. Reinsurance may have come under attack as part of overall opposition to ObamaCare, but it's hardly a partisan idea. It's a feature of Medicare's Part D prescription drug benefit that came into being under President George W. Bush.Allowing states to expand Medicaid but limit the expansion to 100% of the poverty level, as suggested by Urban Institute scholars, also could be a popular option among Republican governors.All of these features would create a broad, stable risk pool, with affordable coverage options and plenty of flexibility to let people get the coverage that suits them best.So how would Social Security change? One provision called Old-Age Risk-Sharing, introduced in the 2010 book ""A Well-Tailored Safety Net,"" reduces benefits in the first year of retirement, with progressively smaller cuts for lower earners, and the cuts steadily diminish over 20 years, falling to zero at age 82 for someone who claims benefits at 62.As longevity rises — though in a very unequal fashion across income groups — and people face growing risk of outliving their savings, it's sensible to carefully scale back support for early retirement. Yet because many people don't have a choice about when they stop working, it's critical to include a fail-safe function, and in this case there will be three:No. 3 involves another idea introduced in ""A Well-Tailored Safety Net,"" called a progressive saving offset. Everyone would be required to save an additional 1.5% of income per year, with the funds going into a personal account rather than to the Treasury. For low earners, two-thirds of this savings will go to an early-retirement account, with the other one-third deposited in an account that will eventually fund 5% of annual benefits, offsetting the amount by which benefits are reduced. For average earners, one-third of the 1.5% savings would go into an early-retirement account, with the other two-thirds eventually used to fund 10% of annual benefits.Here's why this mandated savings shouldn't be considered a tax hike. First, people are going to need more retirement income than Social Security will be able to afford. People can always choose to save less outside of Social Security or hold riskier investments outside of Social Security to compensate for the extra mandated savings that would likely be invested in Treasuries. Second, this is money people will own. If they die, the account is transferred to their estate. Lastly, the 1.5% of income will be matched by Social Security, though in a notional account (meaning it won't require government borrowing). This will give modest-income workers the chance to leave an inheritance via Social Security — now only possible if they die when their children are still minors — without undercutting income security.RELATED:

1296,MO,"Even as prices rise and inventory falls in America's housing markets, the U.S. still ranks very high in home affordability, says an annual survey of nine developed countries around the world. In fact, of the 11 major housing markets that it deemed ""affordable"" — out of 92 with populations of at least 1 million — all were in the U.S.The U.S. was also determined to have ""the most favorable major market housing affordability"" in this year's Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey, which is based on 2016 third-quarter data comparing the U.S. to Australia, Canada, China, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore and the United Kingdom.The 13th annual survey rated Rochester, N.Y., as it ""most affordable major housing market"" in all those countries, based on the ""median multiple"" — a ratio of the median home price there to the median pretax income. In Rochester in Q4, the median price for a home was 2-1/2 times the median annual household income, for a ""median multiple"" of 2.5. That was well below the 3.0 ceiling for ""affordability.""Joining Rochester at under 3.0 (see the accompanying chart) were Buffalo, N.Y.; Cincinnati; Cleveland; Pittsburgh; St. Louis; and Oklahoma City. Right at 3.0 were Indianapolis; Grand Rapids, Mich.; Detroit; and Kansas City, Mo.A median multiple of 3.1 to 4.0 pushes a market into ""moderately unaffordable"" territory, while 4.1 to 5.0 is ""seriously unaffordable"" and 5.1 and over is ""severely unaffordable.""""The 'median multiple' is not a perfect measure because it does not account for house sizes or build quality,"" admits Oliver Hartwich, executive director of the survey's sponsor, The New Zealand Initiative. But he goes on to add, in the think tank's report on its survey, that ""it is the only index that allows a quick comparison of different housing markets, and it is the best approximation of housing affordability measures we have to date.""As for surveys that purport to list the ""best"" or ""most livable"" cities, the NZI's report slights them as ""aimed at wealthy households, not middle-income households, and at corporate relocation experts advising executives who might move to different housing markets ... and it is thus not surprising that the 'Best Cities' routinely exclude evaluation of middle-income housing affordability.""But even with all its affordable cities, major U.S. housing markets on the whole are at the high end of the ""moderately unaffordable"" range of the NZI's scale, with a score of 3.9. But that still was low enough to make its major markets the most affordable among the nine countries. Japan's were next at 4.1.Those at the highest limit of the rankings, with severely unaffordable major markets, were China (i.e., Hong Kong), at a staggeringly steep 18.1, New Zealand, at a daunting 10.1, and Australia, at a comparatively modest 6.6.When the smaller housing markets are included, for a total of 406 across the nine nations, the U.S. still ranks as moderately affordable — though at 3.6 on the scale it comes in at No. 2, behind Ireland's 3.4.But the U.S. dominates the list of the 10 most affordable markets overall, with Racine, Wis., at No. 1, with a median multiple of 1.8. Next is Bay City, Mich., at 1.9.At 2.0, are Decatur, Ill., and Elmira, N.Y., while several others are tied at 2.1.Despite those positive ratings, among all the U.S. housing markets only 83 are judged affordable, while 111 are moderately unaffordable, 56 are seriously unaffordable, and 36 are severely unaffordable.The Bay Area community of Santa Cruz even tops its notoriously high-priced neighbor San Francisco and New York City as the most severely unaffordable at 11.6 — the highest score recorded in the U.S. since the survey began.While scores in the America were ""overwhelmingly below 3.0 until the 1970s and remained at that level in most housing markets until the early 2000s,"" says the NZI report, ""decades of restrictive land use regulation, including court decisions and far stronger environmental regulation"" made California's markets the exception, resulting in ""huge housing affordability losses"" for that state.Other U.S. markets adopting such restrictions, like New York, Miami and Boston, ""have also had severe losses in housing affordability"" it concludes, while ""liberally regulated Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston and Atlanta experienced little in house price increases during the housing bubble and remain the most affordable.""MORE ABOUT REAL ESTATE:U.S. Homebuyers' Break-Even Point Just Got A Little More DistantTrending Home Improvement Projects For 2017's Housing MarketHomebuying Cheaper Than Renting In Most Of U.S., But For How Long?Real Estate Agents Foresee Year Of Low Inventory, Low Expectations

1298,MO,"On the eve of a summit last month between technology executives and then-President-elect Donald Trump, IBM (IBM) Chief Executive Ginni Rometty publicly pledged to hire about 25,000 U.S. workers and spend $1 billion on training over the next four years.She didn't mention that the tech giant was also firing workers and sending many of the jobs overseas.In late November, IBM completed at least its third round of firings in 2016, according to former and current employees. They don't know how many people have lost their jobs but say it's probably in the thousands, with many of the positions shipped to Asia and Eastern Europe.""The thing I found really insulting was that the quote-unquote reason for my termination was it was a 'skills transformation,'"" says Sean Ott, a 20-year IBM veteran asked to clear out his desk a couple of months ago despite what he describes as a strong performance rating. ""But at the same time, they have my exact job out there, they have my colleague's job out there for other people to get hired into.""During the presidential campaign, Trump routinely criticized offshoring, although he didn't specifically mention IBM. The firings — known internally as ""resource actions"" — have continued into the new year. This month, IBM started notifying more U.S. workers that they would be let go, according to a current employee, who says colleagues in the services business are bracing for further rounds.Many industries and companies have been sending jobs overseas to take advantage of lower wages and to be closer to local markets. In some cases, technological advances, including automation, have made positions obsolete.In an emailed statement, IBM spokesman Doug Shelton pointed out that the company generates more than two-thirds of its services revenue overseas. He reiterated plans to hire 25,000 people in the U.S. and said IBM will end up adding a net number of jobs over the next four years.""If we are able to fill these positions,"" he said, ""we expect IBM U.S. employment to be up over that period.''Shelton declined to say how many IBM workers were fired in 2016 but said the company enjoys an attrition rate that's historically much lower than the industry average.Rometty's hiring pledge prompted current and former IBM workers to vent on message boards and Facebook groups. Some complained that the new recruiting drive wouldn't offset jobs sent overseas in recent years. Others said Rometty had neglected to mention whether and how many people would be fired in the meantime. Some urged online communities to contact the Trump transition team and educate his aides about IBM's history of layoffs and outsourcing.""Ginni Rometty is terminating thousands of IT workers and touting herself as some hero who's out to hire 25,000 workers,"" says Sara Blackwell, a Sarasota, Fla.-based lawyer and advocate for Protect U.S. Workers, who represents about 100 ex-employees of IBM who have filed discrimination and other complaints. ""To me, that's hypocritical.""When Rometty became CEO in 2012, she began pushing IBM into new businesses such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence. So far, results have been mixed. On Jan. 19, IBM reported that fourth-quarter sales fell 1% to $21.8 billion and operating margins narrowed, evidence that revenue from cloud computing and AI hasn't yet replaced sales from older businesses.However, some areas showed promise. Sales in the unit that houses analytics and AI software increased for the third quarter in a row, and the technology services and cloud platforms segment also recorded year-over-year growth.In a call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter said that the company expects to improve its margins this year, partly from ""savings we have from workforce rebalancing as we continue to remix the workforce.""IBM's reorganization inevitably meant some workers would lose their jobs. Automation wiped out some positions, and the company says some of the firings were done to make room for people with skills in IBM's new businesses. Layoffs have slowed but are continuing.In an Op-Ed published in USA Today in December to explain the creation of 25,000 new positions over the next four years, Rometty wrote: ""We are hiring because the nature of work is evolving.""At the same, time IBM has sent thousands of jobs offshore. It's not alone in doing this. In the last 15 or 20 years, Accenture (ACN), Cap Gemini (CGEMY) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) have all done the same.IBM doesn't disclose how many of its 300,000-plus employees work in the U.S. or in its various divisions. But the services businesses, which generate more than half the company's sales, have taken the brunt of the offshoring.For example, early last year, the technology services division aimed to have just 30% of permanent employees located in the U.S. by the end of 2016, according to two former managers, who received the information from superiors. Later in the year, the target had been reduced to 20%, said one of the people, who asked not to be named to discuss internal matters. Shelton said the numbers are inaccurate.As recently as three years ago, it was easier to track IBM's staff cuts. Employees losing their jobs received a list of colleagues being fired too, along with their positions, departments, ages and other information.They were able to use the information to determine whether they wanted to waive age-discrimination claims, which they needed to do to receive a severance package. Then in 2014, IBM ended the disclosures, making it much more difficult to tally job cut totals.The company hasn't entirely sidestepped criticism for firings. In 2015, local and federal officials lambasted IBM for dismissing 1,200 workers in Iowa and Missouri just five years after opening facilities there.The firings were a blow to the cities of Dubuque, Iowa, and Columbia, Mo., which spent a combined $84 million on sweeteners to lure Big Blue in the hopes of incubating a startup scene. Republican Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley wrote to the company to express concern about the firing of 700 workers.Today, Big Blue gets rid of people quietly and in smaller batches, former and current employees say. The firings have become so commonplace, they say, that many workers are resigned to losing their jobs and simply wait for their names to be called.Then, many are asked to train potential replacements overseas. In case of Ott, the former IBM employee, those people were in China, India and Argentina.""Clearly,"" he says, ""my skills are still relevant.""

1301,MO,"ObamaCare was on the way to the emergency room and in need of major surgery no matter who won the election.The pool of customers is too small, too old and too costly, and premiums are soaring as a result. The reason is simple: The law succeeded in making insurance affordable for older, higher-cost, and near-poor individuals, but has fallen far short of its promise for those who are relatively young, lower cost, working class and middle class.Those latter groups comprise some 24 million people who lack either employer or government coverage, and if TrumpCare were to give them a better deal, while preserving the protections afforded to the vulnerable, Democrats would have every reason to get on board.There is an exceedingly simple bipartisan formula for replacing ObamaCare's individual market reforms with ""something terrific,"" in Donald Trump's words, at least relative to the status quo and to the GOP plans on the table.That formula, explained in further detail below, is this: Get rid of the heavy-handed mandates and give people a choice between the comprehensive coverage that Democrats want them to have (and that many people with chronic conditions or low incomes clearly need) and the consumer-driven model that Republicans believe in, which allows people to opt for catastrophic care and set aside funds in a Health Savings Account to cover basic medical needs.There's good reason to think that this is the only possible path to a bipartisan health care fix and that the political window for seizing this opportunity may quickly shut if not seized early in 2017. Unfortunately, the GOP is contemplating a repeal-now, fix-later strategy that, at worst, could blow up the individual health insurance market or, at best, let ObamaCare's problems fester for three years or more, hurting millions and millions of working-class and middle-class individuals and families that need — and in many cases voted for — a better deal.Keeping ObamaCare on life support for years while the GOP wracks its collective brain to come up with something terrific would require insurer ""bailouts"" — the Republicans' own term for it — that could exceed anything seen under President Obama. To keep insurers from bolting the troubled markets en masse after a repeal vote, Republicans would have to essentially guarantee that they'll at least break even after administrative expenses.Republicans would be attending to the bottom line of big insurers such as Aetna (AET), Cigna (CI) and Humana (HUM) while ignoring the needs of 20-plus million people who are getting a bad deal from ObamaCare and would like to see that deal ripped up tomorrow.Before getting into the details of a replacement, let's take a moment to consider just who these 20-plus million people are who have nothing to gain and much to lose from repeal and delay.IBD'S TAKE: Despite the uncertainty over what will happen to ObamaCare and Medicaid in the Trump era, shares of UnitedHealth have surged to a record high since the election. Here's why the company is well on its way to becoming the Amazon of health care.There are about 7 million people buying ObamaCare plans off the exchange, mostly because they earn too much to qualify for exchange subsidies. That's hardly fair treatment when nearly everybody else gets government subsidies to buy health insurance, either through the tax exclusion for employer-provided coverage or through a government program. On top of that, there are another 3 million with income above ObamaCare's 400% of poverty level cut-off for subsidies who remain uninsured and more than a million buying unsubsidized coverage through the exchanges. All of these people would stand to benefit from GOP proposals to offer a tax credit for everyone buying coverage in the non-employer market, but Republicans in Congress now say that such ideas may be put on ice, even as ObamaCare premiums are soaring, making coverage harder to attain.Another 4.5 million people are uninsured despite working full time and having an offer of employer coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. These people have modest to moderate incomes that would qualify them for ObamaCare subsidies, but they — and their spouses — are ineligible as long as employer coverage doesn't cost more than about 9.7% of income. That means high-deductible bronze-level coverage can cost some full-timers five times or even upwards of 10 times what its costs someone at the same income level who is eligible for exchange subsidies (perhaps because they work two part-time jobs or at a smaller company not subject to ObamaCare's employer mandate).KFF estimates that there are another 5.3 million uninsured people who are eligible for subsidies but have spurned ObamaCare coverage, either because they see it as a bad deal — even with subsidies, if they buy coverage, and fines, if they don't — or perhaps aren't fully aware of their eligibility. The Urban Institute estimates this group is even larger, comprising 6.9 million people.Finally, there are 2.6 million low-income Americans in states like Texas and Florida who earn too little to qualify for Medicaid but can't get exchange subsidies. That's because the Supreme Court created a coverage gap when it ruled that the Medicaid expansion must be voluntary for states.That makes about 24 million Americans who have a huge stake in the GOP's coming decision, and that doesn't even include the 8 million-plus subsidized ObamaCare exchange customers who don't want to see their coverage disrupted or roughly 10 million gaining coverage via the Medicaid expansion.If Republicans stick to their repeal and delay strategy, experts warn that the individual insurance market could be thrown into crisis with far-reaching repercussions. While the GOP can conceivably avoid outright chaos in the individual market by protecting insurers' bottom lines, what will that achieve? They'll never get any Democratic votes needed to overcome a filibuster and there will likely never be a bridge to a strictly Republican vision of reform. To understand why, just consider this analysis showing that the same plan which costs a 64-year-old couple earning 150% of the poverty level (about $23,600) less than $1,000 under ObamaCare would cost the couple roughly $18,000 under the Empowering Patients First Act authored by Rep. Tom Price, Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.Making coverage affordable for older, higher-cost, low-income patients isn't the problem with ObamaCare. The problem is that ObamaCare's rules stacked the deck in favor of comprehensive coverage and gave a bad deal to pretty much everyone else, which is why the pool of customers is too small, too old and too costly.Even among households earning 150% to 250% of the poverty level, a group that was supposed to be among the big beneficiaries of the law, just 1 in 3 people who lack insurance from other sources are getting silver-level coverage that will protect them from financial disaster, an IBD analysis of ObamaCare's effect on the working class has found.Consider the example of a couple, age 30, in St. Louis, Mo., with pre-tax income of $40,000 (200% of the poverty level) and a child covered by Medicaid. For this couple, the cheapest silver plan under ObamaCare this year costs about $2,200, and carries a $1,000 deductible (and $4,500 out-of-pocket limit on top of premiums), but they're probably already struggling to save money and that may be too much of a financial stretch.Alternatively, this couple could buy the cheapest bronze plan for $1,260, but it carries a $13,700 deductible, which means that a trip to the hospital could be financially devastating.The chasm between silver and bronze deductibles — $1,000 vs. $13,700 — is by design, though clearly a poor one. The architects of ObamaCare decided to attach extra cost-sharing support only to silver plans, effectively turning silver plans to platinum for modest-income beneficiaries while making bronze plans of questionable value. Those cost-sharing subsidies work exactly like premium subsidies, paid directly from the government to insurers on a monthly basis, whether or not the policy holder gets medical care.Looking through the lens of this 30-year-old St. Louis couple, a bipartisan replacement that merges Republican principles and Democratic values is easy to identify.First, don't get rid of the comprehensive option. If this couple is trying to have a second child or one spouse has a chronic condition, they will be desperate for a comprehensive policy that limits their liability.Second, offer people the flexibility to choose a Republican option: a high-deductible plan with a Health Savings Account on top. TrumpCare, unlike ObamaCare, could give young, modest-income families the chance to set aside some savings with two simple tweaks. ObamaCare's age-rating restrictions that inflate insurance costs for the young could be eased for high-deductible plans (without putting comprehensive plans out of reach of older adults), and cost-sharing subsidies could be used against bronze plan premiums. Those two steps would shrink that 30-year-old St. Louis couple's premium to zero this year, and they'd have about $800 left in a Health Savings Account to defray medical expenses.While Democrats don't want modest-income households to opt for high-deductible plans that could sink their finances, having some coverage is better than none, as is all too common at present — despite ObamaCare's penalties for those who go uncovered. That's why families above 200% of the poverty level should be able to opt for catastrophic coverage — with higher deductibles than bronze, roughly around the ""copper"" option proposed by the insurance industry and some moderate Democratic senators. This approach, along with the tweaks noted above, could make coverage free for everyone up to about 250% of the poverty level.Third, give people fair treatment. There's no reason why members of the middle class who earn too much for ObamaCare subsidies should be denied a comparable level of help given to those who get coverage through the workplace. A logical way to do this would be giving a tax credit equal to 25% of the cost of a silver plan, while limiting the income-tax benefit to 25% of the cost of employer-provided coverage and capping that benefit for high-income households. Further, full-time low-wage workers who can't afford the coverage offered at work and their spouses shouldn't be denied the help given to people buying coverage on the individual market.Fourth, get rid of the mandates. The employer mandate is easy to dodge and ends up harming the low-wage workers it was supposed to help. As for the individual mandate, if people earning up to 250% of the poverty level can get coverage essentially for free, and those with lower incomes get Health Saving Account deposits on top, there's really no point in threatening them with penalties.Even for people above 250% of the poverty level, coverage would be a lot cheaper for the young adults who are the prime target of the individual mandate, so take-up would naturally increase. Still, to ensure a broad risk pool, TrumpCare should eliminate the incentive to go without coverage when one is young and healthy, then sign up when one's health starts deteriorating. A logical approach would very gradually and incrementally shrink tax subsidies for those above 250% of the poverty level based on how long they go without coverage. This should apply to both the individual market and employer market, or else people would have reason not to get coverage between jobs.Republican plans would steer people who develop costly conditions while their coverage has lapsed to separate subsidized high-risk pools. The idea is understandable, since a small number of high-cost patients can substantially raise premiums for the whole pool, particularly in relatively small markets. Yet, if the coverage provided by these separate high-risk pools is good and affordable (as it should be), the availability of this option could provide peace of mind for the uninsured and encourage people to go without coverage. That's one reason why it may make more sense to hold down premiums in the individual market through another mechanism that accomplishes the same goal. That would entail an ongoing federal reinsurance program that recoups insurer expenses of the highest-cost patients, much like Alaska is doing to keep its individual market viable (while asking the federal government for financial backing). Reinsurance may have come under attack as part of overall opposition to ObamaCare, but it's hardly a partisan idea. Public reinsurance is a feature of Medicare's Part D prescription drug benefit that came into being under President George W. Bush.All of these features would create a broad, stable risk pool, affordable coverage options and plenty of flexibility to let people get the coverage that suits them best, including an option for modest-income households to deposit subsidies in excess of premiums in a Health Savings Account. This approach, or something very close to it, is likely the only approach to replacing ObamaCare's individual market reforms that can win bipartisan support, but the chance for seizing it may go quickly out the window if Republicans opt for repeal and put the replacement debate on hold.The reason why should be clear: Making sure that no one currently benefiting from ObamaCare is ""worse off"" and that the 20 million-plus who get a bad deal can get a better deal — the goal for replacing the law sketched out by Paul Ryan — will require some hard choices. That includes reforming the income-tax (though not payroll-tax) exclusion for employer-provided coverage as outlined above. There are other logical offsets as well to pay for what essentially would be a tax cut for millions of people without raising tax rates. But once the debate is poisoned by the consequences of repeal and delay on the individual market, and once Republicans move forward with the rest of their tax-cutting agenda, the opportunity will almost certainly be gone. At that point, as in President Bush's failed push for Social Security reform in 2005, Democrats will have a whole list of Trump tax cuts they'll want repealed before they begin to consider reforms that require any politically difficult trade-offs.

1303,MO,"Longtime financial advisors marvel at how their business has evolved over the years. They serve more sophisticated clients, choose among an ever-expanding menu of investment products and face myriad compliance issues. But perhaps the greatest change has come from advances in technology.Today's financial advisors harness technology to enhance almost every aspect of their practice. They use customer relationship management (CRM) systems to collect client data and spur communication. They opt for financial planning software to help clients track their portfolios.And they invest in cloud-based data storage to access documents and encrypt them to ward off hackers.In addition, advisors favor simple, timesaving tech tools to boost their efficiency. These low- or no-cost apps include appointment setting software such as ScheduleOnce, online meeting programs such as TeamViewer, electronic signature tools such as DocuSign and even mileage trackers such as MileIQ to calculate miles driven for business purposes.As these tools proliferate, three challenges arise. First, advisors wind up spending more time sifting through their options. Evaluating products and services can become a full-time job in itself.Second, new technology requires education and training. Advisors' employees and clients face a learning curve as they fiddle with new systems and grow to accept and trust them.Finally, integrating wide-ranging tech platforms into a seamless system can prove frustratingly hard for advisors. Almost every tech vendor boasts about its feature-rich integrations with CRM, performance reporting software, Web-based conferencing and other online channels. But easy access to a central dashboard via a single log-in remains an elusive goal for many users.""The holy grail that everyone aims for is to streamline the data that flow back and forth from all the vendors so that they work as a team,"" said Tim Watters, a certified financial planner in Paramus, N.J.At its best, a new tech tool produces almost immediate returns on an advisor's investment. From saving time to improving client service, technology can upend traditional processes. Indeed, many advisors are establishing formal and informal partnerships with robo-advisory firms to help meet clients' needs and to help save time and costs of delivering investment advise.Watters, 57, has sought to improve his firm's use of technology in recent years. His openness to testing new products helps him discover promising breakthroughs.After using what he calls ""simplistic"" trading systems, he switched to Total Rebalance Expert auto-rebalancing software in 2011. He estimates that it saves him about five hours a week in planning and executing trades.""It has standardized my process, it's scalable and it lets me streamline our models better for the client's benefit,"" he said. ""It also helps us manage clients' tax liability more effectively to avoid wash-sale rules, sell the highest-cost trade lots first and watch out for short-term gains.""Advisors who work for large firms often rely on their information-technology support team to make wise buying decisions. But sole proprietors shop on their own.""I want tools that I can put to use right away without breaking the bank,"" said David Haas, a certified financial planner. Before becoming an advisor in 2012, Haas worked as a software engineer in the telecom industry.Haas, 56, started his own one-person firm in 2015. He's determined to harness technology to his advantage while keeping a close eye on costs.""With the advisors I've seen, they aren't tech-savvy on the whole,"" he said. ""They've been doing things a certain way and it can be difficult to change.""In establishing his own practice, Haas decided to splurge on website design. Rather than use what he calls ""a cookie-cutter approach with a little bit of customization,"" he hired an outside designer to produce a more ambitious result.""I want our website to look different and I want to control more of the content and its look and feel,"" said Haas, who runs Cereus Financial Advisors in Franklin Lakes, N.J. ""I think it's important to have a live, informative website that engages people, as opposed to a dead website that never changes.""Haas raves about an app called FullContact that provides a cloud-based address book. He uses it to store business cards.""It feeds right into my CRM,"" he said. ""I used to have stacks of business cards and I'd struggle to remember where I met people. Now it's easy to process every new business card I get.""Learning how to effectively use social media tools such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn link is also a must for a growing number of advisors.To maximize their use of technology, some advisors view their vendors as partners. Rather than simply purchasing a tech tool and then trying to make it work, these advisors strike up an ongoing relationship with their tech providers.Makers of tech wares usually welcome such dialogues with their customers. They crave feedback and strive to incorporate client input into new product releases.Timothy Brennan, an advisor in Pembroke, Mass., cites such tools as eMoney Advisor, the financial planning software he uses. He says that eMoney representatives respond to his ideas and suggestions.""Certain tech tools are continuously improving,"" he said. ""I find that the best technologies make it more convenient for you and for your client, and the vendors listen to you.""Like many advisors, Brennan has learned to look beyond the bells and whistles that accompany a new, much-hyped technology. When assessing a new product, he asks himself two questions: ""Will I use it?"" and ""Will it provide value to my clients and my practice?""""Early on, I spent money on stuff I didn't really use,"" he admitted. ""Don't get drawn into a cool technology just because it looks cool.""For example, he bought expensive office management software that included an online schedule feature that he liked. He subsequently realized that the software offered far more than he needed, so he found a basic scheduling tool at a much lower cost.Stepping into the client's shoes helps as well. Technology that impresses you may not necessarily resonate with your clients, whether they're tech-savvy millennials or from more digitally challenged generations.Ben Malick, an advisor in Grain Valley, Mo., used to send clients an elaborate financial report generated by his eMoney software. But he noticed that most clients didn't review it closely.""It looks great to me, but they don't even look at all the numbers and Monte Carlo simulations,"" he said. ""They just want to know what they need to do.""RELATED:Financial Advisor Guide: Jumping In, Gliding OutFinancial Advisor Guide: OutsourcingFinancial Advisor Guide: Niche Play

1304,MO,"The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing survey index out Tuesday showed a steady, slow pulse for the factory sector, ticking up to 51.9 in October from 51.5 the prior month, slightly ahead of expectations.Yet the U.S. factory sector remains stuck in first gear, and that's not likely to change as automakers tap the brakes and interest rates edge higher.Meanwhile, the construction sector has stalled outright, dragged down by weak public-sector outlays. Total construction spending in September fell 0.4% from August and 0.2% from a year ago. That's the first year-over-year decline since 2011.Private construction spending fell 0.2% from August as a 1.0% drop in nonresidential spending offset a 0.5% rise in residential spending. In the past year, nonresidential spending has led the way, rising 4.1% vs. 0.9% for residential. Still, growth in private spending has been swamped by a 7.8% drop in public construction spending from a year ago.The ISM survey showed a pickup in production to 54.6 from 52.8, but there was less visibility into future production as the new orders index slipped 3 points to 52.1 and the gauge of order backlogs fell to 45.5 from 49.5. Readings above 50 signal expansion, while those south of 50 suggest contraction.On a positive note, the employment index rose to 52.9 from 49.7.While the overall ISM was only modestly above the 50 neutral level, a sixth rise in seven months is somewhat encouraging after weak overseas growth and a retrenchment in the oil patch led to a manufacturing contraction in the second half of 2015 and early this year.Even as health care and housing costs push up services inflation, plodding growth in the industrial side of the economy gives the Federal Reserve more leeway to leave interest rates low for longer, because factory slack limits pricing power. The Federal Reserve began a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday.Ford Motor (F) said last week that it would idle some plants or run fewer shifts to avoid a backup in inventories if U.S. auto sales slow in 2017, as it expects. This week, it was cutting one of three shifts at its F-150 pickup truck plant in Kansas City, Mo.Ford said late Monday that it won't release October U.S. sales later this week due to a Monday fire, knocking out power for data systems at its Dearborn, Mich., plant. Ford is expected to report that its sales in October fell 10.9% from a year ago, according to Edmunds' auto-information service.Still, overall U.S. sales are expected to match the highest level of the year, coming in at a 17.8 million-unit annual rate, though that would be another year-over-year decline.General Motors (GM) reported sales slipped 1.7% from a year earlier, but that was much better than the 6.3% drop expected by Edmunds.IBD'S TAKE: While the Federal Reserve is virtually certain to hike interest rates in December, the strengthening dollar may lead policymakers to spring another kind of surprise to avoid a repeat of what happened after the hike in December 2015.Several industrial companies have lowered their earnings guidance in recent weeks. Steel maker Nucor (NUE) said on Oct. 20 that profitability will ""decrease notably"" in the fourth quarter, not entirely due to regular seasonality. Nucor said its end markets are a mixed bag, with automotive remaining strong, but energy, heavy equipment and agricultural markets are still weak.The ISM survey showed that 10 of 18 manufacturing industries reported growth. Among survey respondents, positive comments came from the chemical sector, computer and electronics, fabricated metals, plastics and rubber — along with food, beverage and tobacco. Negative comments came from primary metals, where it was noted that production was down 20%, and transportation equipment.General Electric (GE) said on Oct. 21 that its comparable industrial orders fell 6% during the third quarter, though its digital and software orders rose 11%.United Technologies (UTX), Caterpillar (CAT) and 3M (MMM) all offered earnings outlooks below analyst estimates when they reported last week.One positive in the third-quarter GDP report released on Friday was a 10% rise in exports, the biggest since the fourth quarter of 2013. But that trend is unlikely to continue after the surge in the dollar vs. other currencies in October.RELATED:GM, Fiat Chrysler U.S. Sales Fall Less Then Feared; Ford DelayedNucor, Steel Dynamics Profit From Fewer ImportsGM, Caterpillar Fall Below Buy Points As Industrial Giants Guide Low

1305,MO,"It would seem unthinkable today for one man or woman to achieve outstanding success in the fields of ethical drugs, professional baseball, and results-focused philanthropy -- all in one lifetime.Yet that's exactly what Ewing M. Kauffman did.After the Missouri native left the Navy after World War II, Kauffman excelled as a salesman at a drug company, then went on to build Marion Labs. Taken from Kauffman's middle name, Marion grew into a pharmaceutical giant with 3,400 employees and annual sales of nearly $1 billion by the time it was merged with industry peer Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals in 1989.Kauffman then founded an expansion team in Kansas City after the Athletics left town for Oakland, Calif., at the end of the 1967 season. The Royals went on to become World Series champions in 1985, edging the neighboring St. Louis Cardinals in a 4-to-3 series. Thirty year later, the Royals returned to World Series glory in 2015 with a resounding 4-to-1 thumping of the New York Mets.Finally, 100 years after Kauffman's birth on Sept. 21, 1916, the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation stands today as a national leader in promoting education and entrepreneurship, engaged in numerous projects and initiatives thanks to its asset base of nearly $2 billion, according to the tax and advisory firm Ernst & Young's publication ""Exceptional.""The foundation ""shares EY's (Ernst & Young) commitment to recognizing the contributions of entrepreneurs whose vision, leadership and achievements help to build a better working world and ignited entrepreneurial passions in generations who follow,"" Sophie Mackenzie wrote in the magazine's June 2016 edition.Among the Kauffman Foundation's achievements: opening a charter school in Kansas City in 2011 to help urban youth excel in math and science; creating the ""FastTrac"" program in which more than 350,000 people have taken courses worldwide to learn how to start and grow a business; and starting ""Teach for America,"" placing more than 500 talented teachers in district and charter schools in the urban core of Kansas City, reaching 10,600 local students in 2013 alone.""The Kauffman Foundation made a grant to LaunchCode to help individuals across the metro — including underserved populations — learn computer coding and gain pathways into jobs in technology not previously available without a four-year college degree,"" Wendy Guillies, the foundation's president and CEO, told IBD. ""LaunchCode is growing in cities across the country, and we are proud to be a supporter in Kansas City.""""He set high standards for Kauffman Foundation associates, expecting them to be devoted to learning and unafraid to tackle society's most difficult problems with bold intent and modest manner,"" Guillies added. ""In a series of recorded interviews, Kauffman offered valuable insights for how associates and trustees of the Kauffman Foundation should conduct themselves and carry out his donor intent.""Kauffman (1916-1993) himself never believed that success is a single-person venture. Perhaps this is the overarching reason why he could replicate good results beyond business and into team sports as well as social progress.""One of the things that an entrepreneur must learn is that you can't do it all yourself,"" Kauffman said. ""I think it's a people factor that will be the secret of success of business in the future.""In addition to a deep-rooted conviction in the power of teamwork, Kauffman showed an indomitable drive to succeed; listened to those with expertise and more experience in order to avoid mistakes and do things differently; searched exhaustively to find the best people possible to do the job; and engaged in clever ways to market products.Kauffman was born Sept. 21, 1916, on a farm a mile away from Garden City, Mo. His father John Kauffman lost an eye during an accident when loading cattle into a railroad car bound for Kansas City. To help the family make ends meet, young Ewing learned the art of selling while in elementary school, hawking fish and eggs sent from his aunt's farm.At age 11, Kauffman suffered from a heart condition called endocarditis and was prescribed bed rest for one year. His mother Effie Mae gave him books to read. Ewing's appetite for knowledge soared; at one point, he finished as many as 40 books a month. Kauffman further built his analytical skills by taking courses on speed-reading. By the 1960s, he clocked at 5,400 words per minute in fiction, 1,500 wpm in technical material.After getting an associate degree in business at the Junior College of Kansas City, Kauffman took on his first full-time job at a laundry, pocketing a modest $17.50 a week. From January 1942 to November 1945, he joined the Navy as a signalman. In 1947, Kauffman embarked on a successful career selling medicine for Lincoln Laboratories of Decatur, Ill.The man with the warm smile became so good at selling that at one point his annual pay topped the CEO at Lincoln. A cut in Kauffman's commission rate from 20% failed to slow him down, so management hacked off a large part of his sales territory.Bad call. Kauffman left the firm and vowed never to penalize an associate for doing a good job.That promise paid off big time after he launched his own pharmaceutical business in 1950 from the basement of his home in Kansas City, using $5,000 of his own money ($66,550 in today's dollars). He was 33.In its first year of business, Marion Labs netted $1,000 in profit on $39,000 of total sales.The initial business strategy was to buy tablets and injectables in bulk from a large pharmaceuticals supplier in St. Louis. In time Kauffman cultivated strong ties with rural doctors. Marion Labs eventually gained critical mass with its first hit product, Os-Cal, a high-calcium supplement for expectant mothers. He developed Os-Cal by talking with doctors and reading journals to get a pulse on what was in demand.Marion Labs held beer-and-oyster parties at medical conventions to pitch Os-Cal, which used oyster shells as a prime ingredient. Even the napkins at these mixers gave a sales pitch: ""You eat the oyster / We bid thee well / You need the protein / We need the shell.""To make a memorable impact while showcasing the chest-pain treatment Nitro-Bid, salesmen visited doctors' offices and clinics with a miniature stick of dynamite in hand.By the year 1959, nine years into the business, Marion Labs reached annual sales of $1 million ($5.4 million today).Marion Labs grew its personnel carefully. Kauffman held rigorous tests for applicants to the sales force, often interviewing as many as 300 for just six positions. During interviews held at a hotel, Kauffman asked applicants to sell him a picture on a wall or bedside lamp. He preferred to hire married men who came from small towns, figuring they would be highly motivated to work hard.Kauffman rewarded achievers generously. In 1963, Kauffman gave his top salesmen air-conditioned Cadillacs and created the ""M Club,"" which awarded special diamond rings that senior management were barred from receiving.""He promised us if you stay and you work hard and you build this company, then you will share in the profits,"" former Marion Labs associate Ben Blackshire said in an interview on the Kauffman Foundation website. ""There was a banding together. That's why we grew strong.""After the Athletics left, Kauffman won the bid in January 1968 to start an expansion team in Kansas City, convincing MLB team owners with a personal investment of $1 million and a letter of credit for $6 million. Kauffman decided on naming the new team the Royals -- a tip of the hat to the Kansas City Monarchs, a ballclub in the Negro Leagues.Kauffman didn't want to wait long to make the Royals champions. So he sought quickly to build a top-class organization. He created a ""sales force"" of an elite team of boosters and they sold 7,022 season tickets by November 1968 -- a record for any team in the first year, according to The Sporting News. The Royals became the first Major League Baseball team to provide hospital care, life insurance, pension and profit-sharing programs for front-office staff.Then in August 1970, one year after the team's 1969 inaugural season, Kauffman created baseball's first academy in Sarasota, Fla., to train new recruits in the elements of winning baseball. Legends such as Ted Williams were invited to give clinics.Kauffman's philosophy about baseball did not differ from business: Find the best players and managers and motivate them correctly.Slugger Frank White, a member of the World Series-winning 1985 squad, was working for a sheet metal firm when he tried out and was one of eight men selected among 300. Signed on as an amateur free agent in 1970, White notes that the academy wasn't simply about playing ball. He and others woke up at 6 a.m. for six hours of classwork at Manatee Junior College, plus 90 minutes of study hall at night. The second baseman and shortstop went on to become a Hall of Famer, achieving a lifetime batting average of .255 with 2,006 hits and earning eight Golden Glove awards.""It was visionary, it was creative,"" ex-Royals General Manager John Schuerholz said. ""The traditionalists got at the big schools, the good schools and the well-known schools. The academy mandate was to now go find deep in the woods, further into the cities, higher in the mountains, lower in the valleys, where people hadn't gone before, and that's why the Frank Whites ... were found.""Built a successful pharmaceuticals firm that grew to nearly $1 billion in sales; established a World Series-winning baseball team; created a foundation focused on education and entrepreneurshipOvercame: unfair treatment in compensation by former bosses, lack of experience in professional sportsLesson: Read, read, read. Then listen and learn from others as much as possible. Finally, never give up on the goals you set""The thing that people don't realize is, you are much further ahead if you share.""Related:Baseball's Bill Veeck Changed The Pitch Of The National PastimeVin Scully Prepared To Become Baseball's Master StorytellerJohn McGraw Played Hardball To Win Pennants And World Series

Nothing is set in stone, but Wall Street is getting…

1307,MO,"War On Cops: The number of violent crimes jumped last year by 4%, a sad indictment of eight years of President Obama's policing and prison-sentencing ""reforms"" and further bolstering the argument that the so-called ""Ferguson Effect"" is largely to blame for the upsurge in criminal violence.If you don't think this rise in violent crime, especially murder, is strange, consider this: While violent crime is soaring — murder and manslaughter in 2015 rose almost 11% from a year earlier — property crimes fell 2.6%, marking the 13th-straight year of decline, according to the latest crime report by the FBI.That divergence between violent crimes and property crimes comes after eight years of President Obama suggesting that our criminal justice system — from street-level police to our courts to our jails and prisons — are just too hard on criminals.Worse, over his two terms, Obama has joined with the left-leaning media and progressive intelligentsia to poo-pooh the notion that letting violent criminals out of prison, pulling back from aggressive, ""broken-window"" policing, and pushing a false narrative that police are engaged in a ""war"" on young black men have any impact on crime.The result of this denial, sadly and predictably, has been more crime.As the data show, the long, steady decline in violent crime rates that took place in the 1990s and into the 2000s has ended. The nation today is increasingly violent and racially divided, in large part thanks to Obama's refusal to rebuke rioters in Ferguson, Mo., Baltimore or, most recently, Charlotte, N.C.This refusal has made it much harder for police to do their jobs, turning what once were routine police contacts in minority neighborhoods into highly fraught confrontations that can turn violent in an instant — and often do. Police are pulling back from aggressive crime control in troubled areas, letting criminals, many freshly out of prison, take advantage of the lack of police presence to commit crimes — most often, with minority citizens as their victims.Meanwhile, Obama, along with liberal officials at the state level, has promulgated sentencing reforms that led to 400,000 felons being released from state and federal prisons from 2009 to 2014. This has only added fuel to the fire.Of course, these data bolster a case that has been made increasingly by criminologists and others that the soaring crime rate is a direct result of the ""Ferguson Effect,"" a phrase coined by Manhattan Institute Fellow Heather Mac Donald, ""wherein officers desist from discretionary policing and criminals thus become emboldened.""The ""Ferguson Effect"" followed the outbreak of violence and rioting that erupted in Ferguson, Mo., in August 2014 after a local man, Michael Brown, was killed by a police officer. Early reports that Brown's hands were up in the air, that he said ""don't shoot"" and was killed in cold blood proved to be entirely false. As video showed, the 300-pound man fought with police and tried to grab a weapon.Nonetheless, the lie had legs, and ""Hands Up, Don't Shoot!"" T-shirts repeating the myth became de rigueur at violent demonstrations around the country. The subsequent withdrawal of police from troubled urban areas has been accompanied by a sharp rise in murders and assaults.Tragically, the Obama administration largely supported the myth, suggesting the ""Ferguson Effect"" is baseless: ""While certainly there might be anecdotal evidence there, as all have noted, there's no data to support it,"" Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in November 2015.Lynch was followed by White House Spokesman Josh Earnest, who said last May, ""There's just no evidence to substantiate that (Ferguson Effect).""Now, despite the vitriol and accusations of racism hurled at Mac Donald and others who have pointed out that Ferguson seemed to have a negative impact on policing and crime, the FBI data concretely back Mac Donald's thesis.And it's not the only recent study to do so. A study funded by the Justice Department, released in June, sought to explain the disturbing 16% surge in murders in 56 of the largest U.S. cities in 2015. In the study, University of St. Louis criminologist Richard Rosenfeld found ""stronger support"" for the Ferguson Effect, as the prime cause of the upsurge in murders, than other explanations.""The other explanations have a difficult time ... explaining the timing and magnitude of the increase we saw in 2015 and continue to see in some cities in the current year,"" said Rosenfeld, once himself a skeptic of the Ferguson Effect.We didn't think it was possible, but in addition to trashing the economy and wrecking America's relations with its closest allies, President Obama can now take credit for one more dubious accomplishment — ending a decades-long decline in violent crime in America. Add this to the long list of things the next president will have to fix.RELATED:DEA Joins FBI In Confirming 'Ferguson Effect' Their Boss DeniesObama Defends Black Lives Matter, Calls Violent Crime Spike 'Hype'

1308,MO,"Tobacco companies are known for paying big dividends. Altria Group (MO) and Philip Morris International (PM) certainly don't disappoint. In fact, Altria Group last week announced an 8% hike in its quarterly payout to 61 cents a share, or $2.44 for the full year.

1310,MO,"For some time we've wondered if voters have considered that, if elected, Hillary Clinton could begin her first day in office as the target of an investigation. It's certainly not out of the question. Almost a year ago, Rep. Mo Brooks, an Alabama Republican, indicated that impeachment would be on the agenda when she took office. If elected, he said, ""she's subject to impeachment because she has committed high crimes and misdemeanors.""But why wait? One person with inside knowledge of the Clinton circus says impeachment can begin now, even though she's no longer in office.""One of the dirty little secrets in Washington is that Mrs. Clinton can be impeached now,"" Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, told the British Daily Mail. ""A federal official leaving office does not end congressional jurisdiction over impeachment for misconduct in that office.""If Clinton were ""convicted by the Senate, the sanction could be ineligibility for future office,"" Fitton added.Start the process now and save the country the heartache of another President Clinton being impeached while in office. It would also be wholly fitting to impeach her even after she served as president because, as the New York Post has reported, she ""continued sending classified information even after leaving the State Department"" on her personal email account.The problem, of course, is politics. Clintons' political allies, among them a cheerleading media that would never publish what the Daily Mail did, would howl as never before. The very prospect of the Democrats' schoolyard response sends Republicans into a panic.Fitton told the Daily Mail that the GOP feels burned by the first Clinton impeachment proceedings in 1998-99. This is, of course, what happens to a party that is cowed by the media.Impeaching someone who has left office is not unprecedented. Secretary of War William Belknap was impeached in 1876 after he had resigned. According to Congress itself, ""The Senate convened its trial in early April, with Belknap present, after agreeing that it retained impeachment jurisdiction over former government officials.""George W. Bush almost ended up under the same history-book asterisk as Belknap. Democratic Rep. John Conyers of Michigan wanted to impeach him after the 2008 elections. The process would have surely run past Jan. 20, 2009, Bush's last day in office, even if it started the day after the elections.Had Conyers followed up, he would have been doing nothing short of carrying out a political vendetta. But impeaching Clinton now would be a public service.

1311,MO,"When AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ), Comcast (CMCSA) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) report earnings, there's a good reason why analysts that follow Dycom Industries (DY) sit up and take notice.Dycom, an installer of fiber-optic wiring, has prospered as phone and cable TV companies hurry to deploy super-fast, one gigabit-per-second internet services to homes. Dycom digs small trenches where fiber-optic wiring is buried, breaks up and repairs sidewalks if needed, or strings the fiber wiring aerially to homes and business via utility poles.AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and Google, as well as CenturyLink (CTL), are Dycom's biggest customers. Any updates on the capital spending plans of phone and cable TV firms are key for Dycom. If new projects are signaled on earnings calls, Dycom and rivals rev up to bid on contracts in local markets.Web video is driving the need for faster internet speeds now, with virtual reality expected to push broadband speeds higher. There's plenty of talk about faster, fifth-generation wireless networks, but fiber optic broadband speeds are forecast to evolve from 1 gigabit -- or 1 billion bits of information -- per second to 10 gigabits per second.""As much as everyone thinks about wireless usage, people are realizing the need for fatter pipes in the ground, and the foundation of that plumbing is fiber,"" said Jennifer Fritzsche, analyst at Wells Fargo.Dycom's stock has climbed more than 20% in 2016, with surging revenue from telecom customers driving earnings growth.Internet companies like Google rely on fast broadband connections. Aiming to pressure telecom firms into upgrading broadband networks to higher speeds, Google has ramped up its own superfast fiber-optic services to homes and businesses.Dycom management has never named Alphabet as a customer. Analysts contend, though, that Alphabet is Dycom's ""unnamed"" customer in earnings releases and accounted for 7% of fiscal-third-quarter revenue.Where Google is heading with its broadband strategy has been a worry for Dycom shareholders. On Alphabet's second-quarter earnings call in July, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said it may use innovative wireless technologies to speed up its roll-out of gigabit internet services. In early August, Alphabet said it would put on hold plans to expand Google Fiber to new markets.Right now, Google Fiber is available only in San Antonio; Austin, Texas; Provo, Utah; Kansas City, Mo., and neighboring Kansas City, Kan.  Alphabet plans to test wireless broadband in up to 24 markets over the next 18 months.Dycom stock fell last week on the news over Google's building ""pause"". But, some analysts say there's still plenty growth coming from AT&T, Verizon, CenturyLink and Comcast. And, Fritzsche says Google will need to deploy some fiber-optic plant in neighborhoods, even if wireless links reach homes directly.IBD'S TAKE: Dycom gapped out of a cup-with-handle base after reporting earnings in late May, jumping into IBD's Leaderboard for a while.  Shares fell below its 50-day moving average last week amid speculation over Google's plans. Dycom is No. 2 on  IBD's Telecom-Infrastructure group with a 96 Composite Rating, just behind Ubiquiti Networks.AT&T has touted plans to expand its GigaPower broadband service to some 12.5 million homes and businesses by the end of 2019. In January, AT&T signaled it may target 14 million homes or more, up from its current 2.2 million.More than 26% of Dycom's first-quarter revenue came from AT&T alone. In the first quarter, AT&T revenue rose 70% to $178 million.To hit or exceed its 2019 goals for GigaPower, AT&T needs to step on the accelerator, says Adam Thalhimer, analyst at BB&T Capital Markets. AT&T plans to expand GigaPower from 20 markets to 56 markets across the country.""If you look at the math, it's suggesting some very intense construction years in 2017 and 2018, and Dycom should benefit,"" Thalhimer said.Then there's Verizon. On its first-quarter call in April, Verizon touted plans to expand its FiOS services to Boston and, perhaps, other East Coast cities. The FiOS network now reaches 18 million homes and buildings, but Verizon had stopped expanding that service in 2010.And don't forget Comcast, which was Dycom's second-biggest customer in its fiscal third quarter. Aside from its consumer-focused gigabit push, Comcast has been expanding its high-speed internet network to small and medium-sized businesses. Dycom's second-quarter revenue from Comcast rose 47% to $96 million.Charter Communications (CHTR) is another customer ramping up business services. Cable TV firms in general are pushing optical fiber deeper into networks, replacing the old ""coaxial"" lines.Analysts say there's also upside for Dycom from the Connect America Fund program -- federal government funding aimed at bringing speedier broadband services to rural areas. On Dycom's first-quarter earnings call, Nielsen described it as a $150 million to $200 million annual opportunity through 2020. Phone companies that get Connect America funding include AT&T, Frontier Communications (FTR), CenturyLink and Windstream (WIN).One issue for investors, though, is whether the potential upside from companies deploying super-fast internet services is already built into Dycom's stock. Short interest in Dycom stock is high.On Dycom's fiscal third-quarter earnings call, Chief Executive Steven Nielsen said Dycom's revenue from the gigabit gold mine hasn't peaked.""We're in the early stages,"" he said, referring to a new upgrade cycle in wireline networks. Nielsen wasn't available for an interview.Analysts look at Dycom's backlog to sift out data on new contracts. Dycom ended its fiscal third quarter with a total backlog of $5.65 billion, up 97% from a year earlier, and a 12-month backlog of $2.2 billion, up 37%.""Backlog has been inflecting very positively over the past couple of quarters, the trend is good,"" said Bobby Burleson, analyst  at Canaccord Genuity. ""Backlog is projects that have been bid and won. Eventually they come off backlog as projects go live. It might take three years to complete. It's a forward indicator of revenue.""Another issue for investors is whether Dycom's EBITDA -- earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- will shrink as the company adds labor and equipment for new projects. Working capital costs rise as it wins new business. With 12,500 employees, Dycom could add thousands more over the next three to four years, some analysts say.""What we've said, and what we've executed against, is that we think a mid-teens EBITDA business is attainable,"" CEO Nielsen said on Dycom's first-quarter call.Based in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., Dycom is slated to report fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings in late August. Dycom's profit should jump 60% to $1.55 per share, with revenue growing 33% to $771 million, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Phone companies account for nearly two-thirds of Dycom's revenue, and cable TV firms makes up about one-fourth. Dycom also performs construction, engineering and maintenance services for electric and gas utilities and other customers.Dycom competes with Mastec (MTZ), Emcor Group (EME) and many small, local specialty contractors. But Dycom is a more specialized contractor than bigger Mastec.""Dycom sticks to what they know best, which is telecom networks,"" BB&T's Thalhimer said.
"
1312,MO,"Google's decision to rethink its broadband services strategy is a plus for AT&T (T), Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR), but it's much too early for entrenched internet service providers to declare victory.Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is putting plans to expand super-fast fiber optic services on hold while it explores less-expensive wireless technologies. The Google Fiber service for now remains available in just five markets.The Federal Communications Commission plans to open up a swath of unlicensed airwaves in the 3.5 GHz frequency band. Google has been testing wireless broadband using those airwaves.Google Fiber provides internet speeds of 1 gigabit per second and above, with connections that are highly reliable. Does a Google-branded wireless broadband service now pose less of a threat to AT&T, Comcast, Charter, Verizon Communications (VZ) and other ISPs?""I think it is too early to draw that conclusion,"" Blair Levin, former chief of staff to the FCC chairman, told IBD. ""If wireless works for Google, the number of places where it could deploy a faster, better, cheaper network would expand greatly, expanding the level of threat.""""Cable is certainly in the strongest position, but whether Google's announcement represents a diminished or greater threat is still unknown and depends largely on what ... deployment costs and service quality turns out to be,"" said Levin, also former director of the FCC's National Broadband Plan.Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, has a similar view.""It's hard to say whether this is a genuine pullback or whether it is simply a pause to consider alternative technologies. At the very least, this will slow things down for a while, since testing wireless alternatives will take a fair amount of time,"" Moffett told IBD.""It's still too early to say whether wireless will pose a significant threat to wired broadband. That's certainly the intent, and it works well in controlled lab settings, but we're still in the early days,"" said Moffett. ""There are still a lot more questions than answers about how it will perform in the real world.""IBD'S TAKE: A Q2 beat propelled Alphabet stock to a new high, and it's a member of the IBD Big Cap 20. These stocks can make big gains with less volatility than smaller caps. Tech names have made the list as of late.Google in June acquired Webpass, which provides fixed wireless broadband services in San Francisco, San Diego, Miami, Chicago, Boston and Oakland, Calif.""The current delay either means the 3.5 (GHz) spectrum is ready for real testing and/or fiber is more expensive than they thought,"" added Levin, now a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""I think it is still unknown whether Google will be successful, but the last several months suggest a combination of new thinking and course corrections to achieve the goal of deploying faster, better, cheaper networks.""Google Fiber is available in parts of Austin, Texas; Provo, Utah; Kansas City, Mo., and neighboring Kansas City, Kan.; as well as San Antonio. Google announced plans early in 2015 to expand the service to Nashville, Tenn.; Atlanta; Charlotte, N.C.; Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; and Salt Lake City. Google has also touted plans to expand its fiber-based services to large cities, perhaps including Chicago or Los Angeles.Alphabet stock was down 0.6 to 801.19 at the close on the stock market today, but shares touched an all-time high of 813.88 on Thursday and were up 18% from late June.

1313,MO,"Philip Morris International (PM) stock fell early Tuesday, pulling the sector down, after the tobacco giant reported lower-than-expected second-quarter earnings and revenue amid shrinking cigarette shipments.Earnings per share minus one time items for the maker of Marlboro, Lark and other cigarette brands slid 5% to $1.15 on a 3.1% drop in revenue to $6.65 billion. Wall Street was looking for $1.20 EPS and $6.77 billion revenue. Cigarette shipment volume of 209.3 billion units was down by 4.8% vs. the same quarter a year ago.Excluding unfavorable currency translation of 8 cents a share, EPS would be up 2 cents to $1.21, the company said. It was the second earnings miss in a row for Philip Morris. But the company revised its full-year 2016 earnings outlook upward to $4.45-$4.55.New York City-based Philip Morris International, spun off from Altria (MO) in 2008, earns all its revenue outside the U.S. Philip Morris USA is the U.S. division of Altria.Philip Morris shares ended trading down 3% to 99.89, undercutting a recent 102.65 buy point and its 50-day line. Its stock formed a first-stage flat base from late May to early July and rose above that entry point on July 5.IBD's TAKE: Tobacco stocks often are top dividend payers. Read about Philip Morris, Altria and Reynolds American payouts in this Income Investor column.Among other leading tobacco companies, Altria inched up a nickel to 69.22, while Reynolds American (RAI), maker of Camel and Kool brands, lost that much to end at 52.57.

The S&P 500 is defending a 0.2% gain in what could also be its fourth straight up week and a second straight record weekly close. The Dow was effectively flat, while the S&P SmallCap 600 and the Russell 2000 entered Friday's session down 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively, and possibly looking at their first decline in four weeks.Chip stocks were all over the map. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) rumbled ahead 10% after swinging to a profit in a big second-quarter beat.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) dropped 9% at the open, despite fiscal third-quarter earnings and revenue slipping less than expected. The supplier of components to both Apple (AAPL) and Samsung also boosted its dividend and announced a $400 million share buyback initiative.Chipmaker Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO), an IBD 50 stock, fell 1.5% after reporting better-than-expected earnings and revenue in line with previously increased forecasts. The company also raised its third-quarter and full-year revenue guidance.swAmerican Airlines (AAL) jumped 3% after reporting second-quarter revenue and earnings slipped less than expected, while margins and passenger revenue per available seat mile both decreased, pressured by currencies, global economy and competition.Whirlpool (WHR) rose more than 2% after reporting results early Friday.General Electric (GE) dragged on the Dow, down 2% after second-quarter results showed strong sales and earnings growth, but orders unexpectedly slipped.Among other big movers, U.K.-based wireless telecom Vodafone (VOD) climbed 4%, while Capital One Financial (COF) dropped 3% and Skechers (SKX) tanked 19%.Further, Starbucks (SBUX) edged down 0.4% after same-store sales missed analyst expectations.

1315,MO,"This month, American Century Investments has sponsored big-name professional golf tournaments. But instead of trumpeting its mutual funds directly, the Kansas City, Mo.-based asset manager's advertisements highlight how its ownership structure benefits the nonprofit Stowers Institute for Medical Research (SIMR).Its newly launched Prosper With Purpose ad campaign is aimed at setting the fund company apart from others: Not only does it have equity funds with strong long-term performance, but it is the only one tied so directly to benefiting society through medical research funding.The SIMR is named after American Century founder Jim Stowers Jr. and his wife Virginia, who endowed the medical research organization with cash and American Century stock in 1994 -- an ownership stake of more than 40%.That followed Jim's battle with prostate cancer and Virginia's surgery for breast cancer. ""They were motivated by their experiences with cancer,"" said American Century vice president for client marketing Woody Bendle.Jim Stowers passed away in March 2014 at age 90.Stowers founded American Century -- then named Twentieth Century -- in 1958. With $102.4 billion in assets as of June 30, it is the 19th-largest mutual fund complex.The firm is one of only eight among the 25 largest mutual fund complexes that has year-to-date investor inflow of net new money this year. American Century enjoyed $242.3 million inflow through June 30, according to Morningstar.That's a turnaround, coming after three straight calendar years of net outflow.Inflow went mainly through its target date funds into underlying funds such as $679 million AC Alternatives Market Neutral Value Fund (ACVQX) and $7.9 billion Mid Cap Value (ACMVX).Industrywide, target date funds draw steady inflow from retirement-account savers, Rupp says. The alternatives and value funds offer relatively safe havens from market volatility.The firm's inflow defies an industrywide trend of investors shifting money into lower-cost, passively run investments. Yet American Century has no ETFs. And it does not run any index mutual funds.What's behind the fund family's popularity this year? Twenty-two of the complex's 33 stock mutual funds were outperforming their Morningstar category averages as of July 20.And most of the clan's top-20 U.S. holdings are household names, most of which were performing well year-to-date.Apple (AAPL) has the largest weighting at 1.73%. It was down 4%.Next was Exxon Mobil (XOM), with a 0.69% weighting. It was up 22.4%.Third was PepsiCo (PEP), with a 0.57% allocation. It was up 10.46%.Sixteen of the top-20 stocks have an SMR Rating from IBD of either A or B, the two highest possible grades.IBD'S TAKE: Strong sales growth, profit margins and return on equity are the hallmarks of many stock market winners. IBD's SMR Rating measures these traits and combines them into a rating from A to E. Read this and this to learn more about what the SMR Rating tells you about a stock you might buy.American Century portfolios are built bottom-up, one stock at a time. But growth-value style weightings reflect where managers have found stocks with the best opportunities to appreciate. Twenty-two percent of American Century's assets were in U.S. value stocks vs. only 18% in the U.S. growth camp as of June 30.One new step by the complex: It has begun to expand its lineup of funds that focus on alternatives ""to help investors manage volatility, balance market downturns and improve diversification,"" says company spokesman Chris Doyle.As an overall result, American Century stock funds averaged a 3.74% gain this year through June 30. That was fifth-best among the 25 largest fund families. The S&P 500 gained 3.84%.In a report a year ago, Morningstar said fund manager turnover at the shop has declined in recent years. Meanwhile, manager investments in their own funds have increased. That increases alignment of managers' self-interest with their shareholders'.In addition, the managers' bonus plan has been changed to reward longer-term performance more.""American Century is a solid investment outfit,"" Morningstar said. ""Most of its investment teams seem on sturdier ground, and the company's evolution has been positive for both the firm and its fundholders. New leadership and initiatives bear watching, however, and there's need for performance improvement in some areas.""

1317,MO,"It was very appropriate that on Friday, the day after the massacre of five Dallas police officers, the New York Times devoted nearly the whole top half of its front page to four enormous photos of the death of Philando Castile, a black motorist killed by a Minnesota police officer.Of course, the paper was printed before the Dallas murders; and even the New York Times might not have so prominently featured the Minnesota killing on its front page had the Dallas murders occurred a few hours earlier.Nevertheless, it was completely appropriate. The New York Times has been in the forefront of the left's hysterical, hate-filled attacks on police officers and whites.Also appropriately, on the day of the Dallas murders, the Times published two white-hating, police-hating pieces.One was by Michael Eric Dyson, a radical black professor of sociology at Georgetown University.The Dyson column is nothing more than a racist hit piece on ""white America.""An example:""At birth, (whites) are given a pair of binoculars. ... Those binoculars are privilege; they are status, regardless of your class. In fact the greatest privilege that exists is for white folk to get stopped by a cop and not end up dead when the encounter is over.""Dyson wrote these words based on the police killings of two blacks last week, about which he knows nothing except the narrative of the (left-wing) media and what he has seen on some grainy phone videos.And not once does Professor Dyson mention that the Minnesota police officer was Latino. Why would he? That would suggest that Latinos, too, are given racist binoculars at birth. But Dyson would never say so, because it is white America he loathes.Nor does he note, or perhaps even know -- because of his left-wing binoculars -- facts such as these:In 2015, of the 990 people shot dead by police, 93 were unarmed and 38 of them were black. Of the 505 people shot dead by police thus far in 2016, 37 were unarmed and of them 13 were black. Given that blacks murder and rob more than whites -- they committed 62% of robberies, 57% of murders and 45% of assaults in the 75 biggest counties in the country in 2009 (despite comprising about 15% of the population in these counties) -- an unarmed black is less likely to be killed by police than an unarmed white. (Data from the Washington Post.)Does Dyson, a professor of sociology, not know these statistics? Does he not know that, statistically, whites have more reason to fear being murdered by a black than vice versa? If he doesn't, he shouldn't be teaching sociology. If he does, students should be aware that he is a left-wing, black nationalist propagandist, not a teacher.The same day the Times published Dyson's piece, it published a second anti-white, anti-cop, hate-America piece by the mother of Michael Brown, the young black man killed in Ferguson, Mo. That black grand jurors and even Obama's Department of Justice found the policeman who killed Brown was acting in self-defense after being attacked and thus justified him in doing so means nothing to the New York Times. So it published the grieving mother's anti-cop hate.The blacks and whites of the left have led much of America, especially black America, to believe that cops are generally racist, that there is ""systemic"" racism and that whites are privileged and racist. It's all a lie that has had -- and will continue to have -- murderous consequences.America has become the least racist multiracial, multiethnic country in world history. This drives the America-hating left crazy. That's why leftists manufacture fantasies like ""microaggressions"" -- nonracist statements that the left labels racist, foolishness like ""white privilege"" and the dangerous rhetoric of ""Blacks Lives Matter.""Just yesterday the New York Times published the results of a study conducted by a black Harvard professor of economics that shows that ""when it comes to the most lethal form of force -- police shootings -- the study finds no racial bias.""""It is the most surprising result of my career,"" said Roland G. Fryer Jr., the author of the study.One assumes that this Harvard professor has never read Heather Mac Donald or any other conservatives who have been writing this for years.The New York Times -- as the flagship publication of the left -- and the rest of the left have the blood of police on their hands. And not just cops' blood -- the blood of the blacks murdered because of police reticence to vigorously patrol black areas. What is known as the ""Ferguson effect"" was created entirely by the left.
"
1318,MO,"There was never a more appropriately named book than ""The War on Cops"" by Heather Mac Donald, published a few weeks ago, on the eve of the greatest escalation of that war by the ambush murders of five policemen in Dallas.Nor is this war against the police confined to Dallas. It is occurring across the country. Who is to blame?There is a ton of blame, more than enough to go around to the wide range of people and institutions that have contributed to these disasters. In addition to the murderers who have killed people they don't even know, there are those who created the atmosphere of blind hatred in which such killers flourish.Chief among those who generate this poisonous atmosphere are career race-hustlers like Al Sharpton and racist institutions like the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement. All such demagogues need is a situation where there has been a confrontation where someone was white and someone else was black. The facts don't matter to them.The same is true of the more upscale, genteel and sophisticated race panderers, including the president of the United States. During his first year in the White House, Barack Obama chastised a white policeman over his handling of an incident with a black professor at Harvard -- after admitting that he didn't know the specific facts.Nor did he know the specifics when he publicly announced that, if he had a son, that son would look like Trayvon Martin. Are we to decide who is right and who is wrong on the basis of skin color? There was a long history of that in the days of the old Jim Crow South. Are we fighting against racism today or do we just want to put it under new management?No one should imagine that any of this is helping the black community. The surge in murder rates across the country, in the wake of the anarchy unleashed after the Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore riots, has taken a wholly disproportionate number of black lives.But, to the race-hustlers, black lives don't really matter nearly as much as their chance to get publicity, power, money, votes or whatever else serves their own interests.The mainstream media play a large, and largely irresponsible role in the creation and maintenance of a poisonous racial atmosphere that has claimed the lives of policemen around the country.That same poisoned atmosphere has claimed the lives of even more blacks, who have been victims of violence by thugs and criminals who have had fewer restrictions as the police have pulled back, or have been pulled back, under political pressure.The media provide the publicity on which career race-hustlers thrive. It is a symbiotic relationship, in which turmoil in the streets gives the media something exciting to attract viewers. In return, the media give those behind this turmoil millions of dollars' worth of free publicity to spread their poison.It is certainly news when there is turmoil in the streets. But that is very different from saying that giving one-sided presentations at length of the claims of those who promote this turmoil makes sense.The media have also actively promoted the anti-police propaganda by the way they present the news. This goes all the way back to the Rodney King riots of 1992. Television stations all across the country repeatedly played a selectively edited fraction of a videotape covering the encounter between the police and Rodney King, who had been stopped after a wild, high-speed chase.The great majority of that video never saw the light of day on the TV networks that incessantly played the selectively edited fraction.When the police were charged with excessive violence in overcoming Rodney King's resistance to arrest, the jury saw the whole video -- and refused to convict the policemen. That is when people who had seen only what the media showed them rioted after the jury verdict.Today, the media keep repeating the mantra that there was a ""peaceful demonstration,"" even when it ends in violence. How many people have to die in ""peaceful demonstrations"" before the media admit that those who promote mob disruptions have to know what is likely to happen when you put mobs in the streets at night?Mob rule is not democracy. It threatens democracy, as it threatens lives -- black or white -- and all lives should matter.This is the first of two parts.

1321,MO,"There was a time when the Fourth of July meant something more than a three-day weekend. Speeches, writings and commemorative ceremonies reminded us of the origins and greatness of America. No matter where in the world our ancestors came from, we today are almost invariably better off because they came to America.Independence Day signified much more than one country announcing its independence from another on July 4, 1776. It represented a new form of government -- freer and more accountable to its own people than the monarchies common around the world for centuries.What happened in America did not stay in America. The example of freedom inspired other peoples in other lands. As a famous poem put it, it was America's ""embattled farmers,"" fighting for their own freedom and independence, who ""fired the shot heard round the world.""There was no question then that the United States was ""exceptional,"" however much the smug elites of today -- including our president -- try to dismiss the idea. Because self-government on such a large scale was a unique experiment, the founders of the American republic were very much aware that it had its dangers. Thomas Jefferson warned that ""eternal vigilance"" was the price of liberty. Even generations later, Abraham Lincoln expressed his fervent hope that ""government of the people, by the people and for the people shall not perish from the earth."" The survival of freedom was not something he took for granted.Today, too many Americans take freedom for granted, as just another entitlement, something that does not require them to take any personal responsibility.It is painful to watch people on the streets -- or on college campuses -- being interviewed by TV reporters who ask them elementary questions about the people and institutions that run the country, and see how uninformed they are. And how unconcerned about their own gross ignorance.People like that are the natural prey of political demagogues, of which there has never been a shortage. We see the consequences in ever-expanding arbitrary powers of government. Just last week, a U.S. attorney threatened prosecution of anyone who made ""inflammatory"" statements about Muslim boys accused of raping a 5-year-old girl.Surely that Justice Department official knew that the courts were not likely to violate people's right to free speech. But the real threat was to drag people through expensive and time-consuming legal processes that could disrupt their lives completely.Such highhanded use of government powers has become increasingly common during the Obama administration. But an apathetic and uninformed public voted him a second term.That is not the ""eternal vigilance"" required to preserve freedom. It is the widespread apathy and gullibility which accepts the coming of tyranny on the installment plan.Earlier generations of Americans fought and died to preserve freedom. Today's generation cannot spare time from their selfies and tweets to think about such things. Neither the past nor the future seems to weigh on their minds.A generation that owes so much to the past acts as if they owe nothing to anybody. Their idea of freedom is exemption from laws or obligations.What many conceive of as freedom today is much more like anarchy: Who are the police to tell them what they cannot do?But anarchy does not mean freedom. It means that people ""become the slaves of ruffians."" What was said in 19th century Britain remains painfully true in too many crime-ridden neighborhoods in 21st century America.The orgy of anti-police rhetoric in the wake of riots in Ferguson, Mo., and in Baltimore has already been followed by a sudden surge in violence, including murders, as police pull back or get pulled back. Innocent people have paid with their lives for such self-indulgences by demagogues and the media.Freedom is not free. It requires, at a minimum, maturity and a sense of the realities of life. No society of human beings has ever been perfect. But we need only think of whatever person we love most and ask: Is that person perfect?Is a country that is not perfect nevertheless deserving of our respect, our gratitude or our love? The Fourth of July is a good day to ponder that question.

It rose above the 179.20 entry point of a four-month-long cup-with-handle base in heavy volume.M Science analyst Henry Guo said NetEase is likely to deliver revenue above current consensus estimates for the second quarter.The IBD 50 list stock has climbed an amazing 375% from a 38.75 low on Dec. 14, 2014, amid robust sales and earnings growth.For annotated charts of NetEase and other top-rated stocks that are at or near buy range, take a free trial of IBD LeaderboardReynolds American has been working on a flat base for about two-and-a-half months and topped its 52.64 buy point in above average volume, closing up 1.2% at 52.89.The maker of Camel, Winston, Kool and other brands of cigarettes, along with snuff and vapor release devices, was on track for its fourth straight higher close after investors fled to ""safe"" stocks, including shelf stable food makers, utilities and cigarette companies last week.Consumers need food and electricity and tend to keep buying commodities like cigarettes even during market dips.

Google Fiber, a super-fast internet service delivered via fiber-optic hookups to homes, has been slow to expand vs. Comcast (CMCSA), AT&T (T) and other large ISPs.Webpass has 20,000 customers in five cities: San Francisco, San Diego, Miami, Chicago, Boston and Oakland, Calif. It provides fixed wireless broadband and fiber hookups to residential buildings and businesses. Webpass, in a blog post, said it plans to focus on ""point-to-point wireless"" going forward.Google has been testing wireless broadband in the 3.5 GHz frequency range. Google Fiber CEO Craig Barratt has said the company plans to leverage its superfast fiber-optic network with wireless technologies.While Google has touted plans to expand its fiber-based services to large cities, perhaps including Chicago or Los Angles, its broadband service is currently available in only a handful of markets: Austin, Texas; Provo, Utah; Kansas City, Mo., and neighboring Kansas City, Kan.Google in April started installations in San Antonio.Google announced plans early in 2015 to expand the service to Nashville, Tenn.; Atlanta; Charlotte, N.C.; Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; and Salt Lake City.

1327,MO,"University of Missouri at St. Louis criminologist Richard Rosenfeld has had ""second thoughts."" Like many academic criminologists, he had pooh-poohed charges that skyrocketing murder rates in many cities in 2015 and 2016 are the result of a ""Ferguson effect"" -- a skittering back from proactive policing for fear of accusations of racism, like those that followed the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in August 2014.Now, after looking over 2015 data from 56 large cities, he's changed his mind. Homicides in those cities were up 17% from 2014. And 10 cities, all with large black populations, saw homicides up 33% on average.""These aren't flukes or blips, this is a real increase,"" Rosenfeld said. ""The only explanation that gets the timing right is a version of the Ferguson effect.""Rosenfeld thus parts company with the liberal Brennan Center, whose analysts argued that the 2015 homicide increase in large cities was not a ""national pandemic."" He parts company also with FiveThirtyEight analyst Carl Bialik, who dismissed a 16% homicide increase in 59 of the 60 largest cities in 2014 and 2015 as ""a less dire picture than the one painted by reports in several large media outlets.""But a 16% or 17% increase in homicides in major cities that account for a large share of the national murder toll is, in historical perspective, very dire indeed. The most accurate word is ""unprecedented."" The only double-digit increases in national murder statistics going back to 1960 are 13% (in 1968), 11% (in 1966, 1967 and 1971) and 10% (in 1979).As anyone familiar with the workings of compound interest might guess, such increases rapidly added up. The total number of homicides nationally more than doubled between 1966 and 1979. The number peaked in 1991.During those years, most academic criminologists argued that high rates of violent crime resulted from economic distress and -- noting that nearly half of murders were committed by blacks -- from the endemic racism in American society. Today the Brennan Center echoes this analysis: ""Economic deterioration of those cities could be a contributor to murder increases.""Political scientist James Wilson and maverick criminologist George Kelling dissented from this view. In their 1982 Atlantic article, ""Broken Windows,"" they argued that proactive policing and elimination of signs of disorder (like broken windows) could sharply reduce crime rates.In the 1990s, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton put the ""broken windows"" theory into effect. Their proactive policing tactics were continued by Mayor Michael Bloomberg and widely imitated and adapted around the country.The result was that homicides in New York were reduced from 2,445 in 1990 to 328 in 2014. Nationally, the number of murders declined 42% from 1991 to 2014.The definitive chronicler of proactive policing, the Manhattan Institute's Heather Mac Donald, spotlighted the Ferguson effect in a Wall Street Journal article in May 2015. She noted that arrests were sharply down in cities such as St. Louis and Baltimore because the ""incessant drumbeat against the police"" across the country had ""officers scale back on proactive policing under the onslaught of anti-cop rhetoric.""Those encouraging such rhetoric include President Obama and his first attorney general, Eric Holder -- even though an intensive Justice Department investigation of Brown's killing in Ferguson cleared the officer involved and made clear that charges that Brown had put up his hands and surrendered were baseless.Obama has since said that ""there's no data to support"" a Ferguson effect. That puts him at odds with his appointee, FBI Director James Comey, who says that his conversations with police officials around the country convinced him that there are ""marginal pullbacks by lots and lots of police officers."" It also put Obama at odds with Rosenfeld, who has found clear evidence of ""de-policing"" in Baltimore and Chicago, where homicides have spiked.The charge of cherry-picking data and misleading rhetoric can more justifiably be leveled against administration officials and mainstream media, who, after the Ferguson killing, created the impression of a rising epidemic of racist police officers shooting innocent blacks. The few such cases have received prompt and stern attention from local law enforcement.Black Americans were the primary victims of the huge crime increase starting in the late 1960s, and they will be the primary victims again if the Ferguson effect continues to result in more homicides. Can't we prevent this awful history from repeating itself?

Smart card ICs (intelligence chips) will simplify eGovernment services, NXP said.The Smart Cities Challenge features seven finalists vying for $40 million to become a truly ""smart city"": Austin, Texas; Columbus, Ohio; Denver; Kansas City, Mo.; Pittsburgh; Portland, Ore.; and San Francisco face a May 24 deadline for proposals.On Monday, U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx set out to visit the seven finalists. The winner will get $40 million ""to fully integrate innovative technologies -- self-driving cars, connected vehicles and smart sensors -- into their transportation network.""NXP wants to be a part of that. To that end, on Monday NXP announced its BlueBox engine to help ""drivers 'see' around corners and through traffic obstacles, thereby calming traffic and helping reduce accidents.""Canaccord analyst Matthew Ramsay expects NXP to outgrow the macroeconomically strangled chip market through 2019 on 10% long-term growth in its automotive segment. On the stock market today, NXP stock fell a fraction, to 84.75.NXP says it has a 14.5% share of the automotive chip market, following its December acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor. NXP CEO Rick Clemmer estimates 40% of the company's sales stem from the automotive segment.In 2016, NXP is targeting high-single-digit to 10% automotive growth, despite views for 3% growth in vehicle unit sales, Ramsay wrote in a research report. NXP sees sales into in-car networking, infotainment, security, powertrain and safety offsetting the small unit growth.Ramsay sees NXP hitting its target of $9 earnings per share minus items in 2019, at a 15% compound annual growth rate.

Analysts project full-year EPS of $4.47.But shares closed down 1.3% on the stock market today as Q1 results missed views. Despite the stock market's recent volatility, Philip Morris has been among its better performers, gaining nearly 13% so far this year and is extended from buy range after breaking out of a flat base in February.Among other tobacco giants, Altria (MO) stock fell 0.7%, Reynolds American (RAI) lost 0.8%, and British American Tobacco (BTI) climbed 0.9%.Philip Morris earned 98 cents a share in Q1, down 15.5% from a year earlier, and missed by 13 cents estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue fell 8.1% to $6.1 billion, missing estimates of $6.3 billion.Excluding the unfavorable currency impact of 19 cents, adjusted EPS rose a penny, or 0.9%, compared with the $1.16 earned in the year-ago quarter. Though that negative impact was up from Q4 2015's 18 cents a share, it's nearly half the EPS impact of Q3 2015's 37 cents.The dollar index is off 6.2% from late November 2015, though it's still up significantly from its mid-2014 levels around the time crude oil prices began to plummet.

1331,MO,"Covington, Ky., a city of 40,000 across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, seems like an odd place for a high-end hotel. For Mario Tricoci, that's a selling point.Last year, the Chicago developer hooked up with a local real estate investor on a $22 million retrofit of a century-old, seven-story, defunct Covington department store that locals say was the first skyscraper in Kentucky made of reinforced concrete.Tricoci, chief executive officer of Aparium Hotel Group, is in the middle of a small-market spree that started with the conversions of a Milwaukee warehouse in 2013 and a La Crosse, Wisc., chocolate factory in 2015. Aparium has hotels taking shape in a former warehouse for tractors and other farm equipment in Minneapolis, an old fire department headquarters in Detroit, and an obsolete bottling plant for Pabst Brewing in Kansas City, Mo. By the time he's done, Tricoci said, the company could be operating 20 hotels or more, with a focus on small cities that are nonetheless big enough to have a pro sports team.The idea is to grab hold of two dovetailing trends: consumers shying away from branded offerings and investors putting money into smaller U.S. cities, encouraged by local economic development types and a diverse set of national cheerleaders. They include AOL co-founder Steve Case, who has been banging the drum for technology startups in minor markets, and commercial real estate firms touting ""18-hour cities,"" on the theory that traditional markets such as New York and San Francisco have become too expensive.“Coming out of the recession, it felt like a safer environment to play in,” said Tricoci, 44, whose previous company built the Elysian Hotel in Chicago, a five-star offering that opened in 2009 and was later rebranded as a Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT)-owned Waldorf Astoria.While the room rates are cheaper -- Tricoci estimates that a $200 suite at his Charmant Hotel in La Crosse would go for $700 a night in New York -- the dearth of competition has helped keep Aparium's early properties busy.“Every one of these markets has wealthy people who eat and drink and spend money,” he said. “They have major businesses with spending accounts and stipends.”Aparium isn't the first hotel operator lured to the rehab business by the prospect of cheap buildings with good bones. The Ritz-Carlton Philadelphia sits in a domed Beaux Arts building that was put up as a bank headquarters. The Renaissance Pittsburgh Hotel, a Marriott International (MAR) property, occupies a 1906 building commissioned by Henry Phipps, a partner in Carnegie Steel. Kimpton Hotels has a line, called Hotel Monaco, dedicated to the adaptive reuse of historic buildings. Drury Hotels has put beds in an old fur-trading building in St. Louis and a former education department building in Cleveland.The list goes on. Over the last decade, the boutique chain 21c Museum Hotels has refurbished historic buildings in Louisville, Ky.; Lexington, Ky.; Cincinnati and Durham, N.C., and is currently converting an Oklahoma City building whose original purpose was as an assembly plant for the Ford Model T. The company is working on historic projects in Nashville, Tenn.; Indianapolis, and Kansas City, where it will soon be competing with adaptive reuse projects flying the flags of Holiday Inn Express, Hampton Inn and Embassy Suites.""More developers have started to leverage adaptive reuse over the past three years, and we've seen some really creative conversions across the U.S., often from vacant or underutilized office buildings to full-service, lifestyle and select-service hotels,"" said Lauro Ferroni, senior vice president at JLL’s[JLL] Hotels & Hospitality Group in the U.S. ""We expect this trend to continue, across both primary and secondary markets, as these are often the types of deals where developers make the best returns.""The trend toward adaptive reuse started in earnest when consumers began to tire of the cookie-cutter hotels popular in the 1980s and 1990s, said Jan Freitag, a senior vice president at the hotel data firm STR Global. There are more than 150,000 hotel rooms currently under construction in the U.S., up from a low of about 80,000 in 2009, just after the financial crisis. Using old buildings helps developers differentiate their products in a bustling market, and it may help hotels entice travelers increasingly lured to the more idiosyncratic experience of booking a room on Airbnb.Developers willing to meet the building standards of the National Park Service can qualify for Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credits, which cover 20% of the rehab costs. Builders won preliminary approval for $6.6 billion of those tax credits in 2015, a total that covers residential and commercial projects. States commonly offer additional tax credits for historic rehabilitation.“These days there’s a demand for differentiation, where hotels want to be unique and have personalities,” said David Schon, a Washington-based partner at the law firm Nixon Peabody who advises clients seeking tax credits for fixing up old buildings. “When hotels want to locate downtown in centers of cities, they tend to be old buildings with interesting architecture.""For the Embassy Suites project in Kansas City, another Hilton property, a developer is planning to spend $149 million spiffing up a former Federal Reserve Bank building. There, you'll be able to relax in ornate splendor amid the ghosts of central bankers.

1333,MO,"The S&P 500 index outperformed dividend stock mutual funds on average over the past 10 years, but the index and the dividend group were actually neck-and-neck for much of the decade.It wasn't until the second quarter of 2013 that the S&P 500 charged into the lead decisively. Earlier, dividend funds had outperformed in 2008 and then for much of 2010 through Q1 2013.That included the financial-crisis fueled market meltdown period, when investors sought the relative safe haven of funds holding stocks that paid dividends.Overall, over the past 10 years the S&P 500 averaged an 11.39% yearly gain. Dividend funds averaged 8.37% annually.That difference adds up. If you had invested $10,000 in the S&P 500 on March 31, 2006, by a decade later your money would have grown into $19,719.If you had invested the same amount in a cross section of dividend funds, it would have grown to $18,632.In that decade, the now $11.3 billion JPMorgan Equity Income Fund (HLIEX) was among the best performing U.S. dividend stock mutual funds. It posted a 7.96% average annual gain.Managed by Clare Hart and Jonathan Simon, the fund had 95% of its shareholders' money in U.S. stocks as of Dec. 31. The bulk of the balance was in cash.Financial services was the fund's biggest sector, with a 25% weighting. Health care was next with a 12% weighting. Industrials was the third biggest sector, at 11%.Share-price gains by medical supplies company Becton Dickinson (BDX) have helped make Equity Income the top performing dividend fund in the past decade.Shares are up 2% so far this year.Earnings per share grew 1%, 17%, 9600% and 28% the past four quarters.A little more than a year ago, the company acquired CareFusion through debt financing. The company has paid down a $1 billion term loan for the takeover. The firm continues to dish out dividends, but it has suspended share repurchases until it meets its debt reduction goals. Its dividend yield is 1.7%.The company has a 96 Composite Rating from IBD.

1338,MO,"2016 Election:  Liberals are having lots of fun pointing to the mayhem and chaos on the Republican side of the aisle with the Trump, Cruz and Kasich dog and pony show. And yes, Republicans have big problems ahead for sure. But what of the Hillary Clinton meltdown? This time was supposed to be different for Hillary. Why can’t she make the sale to voters?At least in 2008, the last time she was thought to be the chosen one, Hillary got run over  by a young, black, charismatic on-rusher with a unique star appeal named Barack Obama. Now she is running against a grumpy, frazzled, 70-something avowed socialist. It seems only yesterday we were all falling off our chairs laughing at the idea of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders running for president with his inane promise of free everything for everyone -- all paid for by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.But after Tuesday night and another 12 point victory by Sanders -- that makes 7 of the last 8 -- he has gone from a minor nuisance for the Hillary express to a real and imminent threat to derailing the Clinton machine. He has the big mo'.The Sanders surge is especially surprising because Bernie hasn’t even attacked Hillary on two of her greatest vulnerabilities: the Benghazi and national security e-mails scandals. Sanders said early on “no one cares” about these scandals.  Ah, but they do, and they will be on full display if/when Republicans get a shot at her.Hillary’s liabilities as a national general election candidate are mounting. Polls show half to two-thirds of voters don’t consider her trustworthy. How do you earn back a voter's trust once you've lost it? One in four Democrats say they are unlikely to vote for Hillary if she is the Democratic nominee.Then there is the issue of just what Hillary's campaign is all about. Hmm. That's a stumper. Four more years? She tried four more years, but voters don't want a third Obama term. Then there is the ""first woman president"" line, but it turns out that wearing a skirt -- er, pants suit -- just isn't going to be enough to win the Oval Office.Democratic ‎voters in Wisconsin said that the second-most-important issue after jobs was ""income inequality."" How does Hillary even pretend to carry that torch after giving $200,000 speeches to Goldman Sachs and other fat cat investment banks?The Sanders campaign line that she changes positions more than she changes hair styles has a ring of truth to it. She was for the Asian free trade agreement before she was against it. She was for fracking before she was against it. She waited for the checks to clear from her Wall Street friends before she turned against them.And she seems to shake her head and brush off all the inconsistencies with a dismissive wave of her hand, as if invoking her famous Benghazi defense: ""At t‎his point, what difference does it make.""Voters on the left seem to be opting for authenticity rather than qualifications or gender. Sanders has what most Americans would regard as economically crazy ideas, but at least he believes in them. ‎We'd like to think that the Sanders vote is an anti-Clinton statement, not an endorsement of his ideas. But either way, she is in big trouble, and if she loses New York, which looks more plausible every day, that thud you hear will be the Democratic establishment collectively falling on its face.Republicans figured out months ago that voters don't want another Bush. It's finally starting to dawn on Democrats, to their horror, that voters don't want another Clinton either.Marco Rubio once aptly called Hillary Clinton the candidate of yesterday -- and yesterday's come much sooner than anyone expected.

1342,MO,"What a difference a brand can make.Just ask big-tobacco company Reynolds American (RAI), now on a roll with its newly acquired Newport, the No. 2 cigarette in the U.S. behind Marlboro and the nation’s No. 1 menthol brand. Even as tobacco consumption has fallen, Newport’s market share has kept growing.The gain was especially strong under Reynolds American’s ownership in the fourth quarter, when U.S. market share for Newport among all brands grew to 13.6% from 13% a year earlier. Newport volume over that time grew 4.8%, while overall volume fell slightly.""(Newport) has a strong and very loyal menthol franchise in the U.S.,"" Reynolds’ Chief Financial Officer Andrew Gilchrist told Investor's Business Daily.Winston-Salem, N.C.-based Reynolds has been stepping up sales and merchandising for Newport since its $26 billion acquisition last June of Lorillard Tobacco, which was the maker of Newport and other cigarette brands. The deal is often called the ""Newport acquisition,"" and for good reason.Reynolds hired new sales reps to talk up Newport to consumers and provided more shelf space and signage at retail locations such as gasoline station convenience stores, where many cigarettes are sold. Newport’s strong growth comes as lower gas prices have helped stem declines in cigarette consumption.As Gilchrist says, lower gas prices along with job and wage growth means smokers have more money to spend on cigarettes and for trading up to premium brands. Enter Newport and Reynolds' other premium brands, Camel and Natural American Spirit.Noting that 2015 was a banner year for the U.S. tobacco industry, at least in an era of declining cigarette usage, Stifel Nicolaus analysts call the last 18 months the industry’s new ""Golden Age."" They noted that somewhat higher than usual price increases last year helped boost profits.While the Stifel analysts say 2016 may show less robust growth than 2015, they still see positive industry trends. Among them are light litigation and regulatory activity, modest excise tax increases, and ""a core consumer that seems to be on the mend and improving again in 2016.""Reynolds American is the holding company for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, the No. 2 U.S. tobacco company after Altria Group (MO), which makes Marlboro. Reynolds became a stronger No. 2 when it acquired No. 3 Lorillard. Its overall market share in the U.S. rose to 34% from 26%. Altria’s remained at 51%. And since its acquisition of Lorillard on June 12, Reynolds' shares are up more than 40%.Besides Newport, the Lorillard acquisition handed Reynolds the brands Kent, True and Old Gold. As part of the deal, Reynolds sold Winston, Kool, Salem and Maverick to Imperial Tobacco Group, or ITG, the American arm of UK-based Imperial Brands. ITG is now No. 3 in the U.S., with a market share of 9.5%.Besides Camel and fast-growing Natural American Spirit, which is under Reynolds’ Santa Fe natural tobacco unit, Reynolds makes the value brand Pall Mall and leading e-cigarette brand Vuse.'The (Newport) brand should continue to benefit from improved visibility across Reynolds' retail footprint as well as its inclusion in Reynolds' retail contracts,"" wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Grainger in a recent report.""Moreover,"" he added, ""Newport has been realizing broad-based share gains across both menthol and non-menthol styles, which should drive its long-term growth potential.""Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog notes that Newport is “poised for greater than expected share gains and faster growth,” which should strengthen the company’s long-term profitability.In a recent tobacco survey by Wells Fargo, retailers expected Newport to gain 95 basis points of incremental share in 2016, up from an expected 80 basis points when they were queried in early December.One retailer in the survey said, ""RJR gained major power with Newport. It’s really a two-horse race now.""In Q4, Camel’s retail market share was 8%, the same as a year earlier, while Pall Mall’s was down 0.3 percentage points to 7.8%, though the value brand had been stable over the last three quarters. Newport, Camel and Pall Mall make up about 92% of Reynolds' total market share and are considered core growth, or ""drive"" brands.Reynolds doesn’t disclose sales for its Vuse digital vapor products. But though Gilchrist says growth was significant in 2015, sales are still relatively small and aren't broken out. That segment logged only $98 million of the $3.05 billion in total revenue in Q4, up from $87 million a year earlier.Reynolds has new vapor products in the works and a vapor collaboration is underway with stakeholder British American Tobacco (BTI) to help grow the market.British American owns 42% of Reynolds’ shares. Analysts speculate that it may try to buy the remaining 58% stake, but are divided on when that may happen, if ever.Since 1999, when it sold international businesses such as its Camel and Winston franchises to Japan Tobacco, Reynolds sells essentially all of its products in the U.S. It recently sold Natural American Spirit’s business outside the U.S. for $5 billion, money it’s using to deleverage its balance sheet.Reynolds American also operates Niconovum, which distributes nicotine-replacement gum Zonnic; and American Snuff. The latter is the second-largest maker of smokeless tobacco products, selling under the Grizzly and Kodiak brands.But Newport is the company’s big star. In Q4, Reynolds’ domestic cigarette volumes jumped 33.6% over the prior year, driven by the addition of Newport. Industry cigarette volume fell 0.5% during the quarter and 0.1% for the full year, Reynolds said, lower than the usual declines seen in recent years.The firm’s adjusted earnings in Q4 grew 9.1% to 48 cents a share. Revenue was up 43% to $3.05 billion. Management expects profits this year to rise between 13.6% and 18.7%, which translates to earnings of $2.25 to $2.35 a share. Analysts see this year's revenue rising 19% and earnings going up 18%, according to a Thomson Reuters poll.In a post-earnings conference call on Feb. 11, Chief Executive Susan Cameron said the quarter’s strong performance ""was largely the result of Newport’s growth.""Newport was added to the company’s retail contracts in mid-November after a post-acquisition standstill period. The brand’s expanded presence ""is delivering additional gains,"" she said.Meanwhile, expected cost savings will come as Reynolds continues to integrate Lorillard into the fold. Some $500 million of the $800 million expected in savings was achieved on day one of the acquisition, much of it in duplicate infrastructure.The remaining $300 million in synergies by year-end ""is a bit ahead of schedule,"" said the company's Gilchrist.

1343,MO,"Like so many mass public shootings, the gunman who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Monday first tried shooting a uniformed officer.  Fortunately, the lone gunman was quickly subdued and no one other than the attacker was seriously injured. But it raises questions of what would have happened with a more coordinated terrorist attack.With terror attacks occurring regularly around the world, we can’t ignore the fact that the Capitol would provide a primary target for terrorists.  Indeed, an FBI informant foiled such an attack in January.Police are crucial – probably the single most important factor in reducing crime. But uniformed police have a tough job stopping terrorists since they are often the first targets in any attack.In late 2013, Ron Noble, who at the time was secretary-general of Interpol, Europe’s version of the FBI, noted two means of protecting people from mass shootings:“One is to say we want an armed citizenry; you can see the reason for that. Another is to say the enclaves (should be) so secure that in order to get into the soft target, you’re going to have to pass through extraordinary security.”But with terrorists planning these attacks many months or even years in advance, Noble warned that his experience taught him it was virtually impossible to stop killers from getting weapons.The federal government might learn something by looking at the states that allow some form of permitted handgun carry within their legislative public areas.  At least 16 allow permitted carry in their capitols: Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming.  Even more allow guns to be carried in legislative areas.The problem with gun-free zones that ban law-abiding civilians from carrying is that they don’t exactly scare off criminals. In fact, they have just the opposite effect. Disarming everyone, including legislators or staffers on their way to and from the buildings, leaves them easy targets for criminals and terrorists.Even some Republicans, such as Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., support keeping the Capitol gun-free, “given the risks that are associated with (guns) and that we already have security with the Capitol Police.”The U.S. has more than 13 million handgun permit holders -- 5.6% of the 21-and-over population.  In the vast majority of states, people are likely to be carrying a gun right next to you in a mall, a restaurant or a movie theater.With many state legislators working to eliminate gun-free zones throughout their states, allowing guns in legislative buildings lets legislators show they really believe in the benefits of concealed carry.Kentucky allows permitted concealed carry in legislative areas, including the capitol. If you attend a legislative meeting, you must carry your gun openly, though no permit is required.In Texas, permit holders are allowed to get through capitol security much faster.  They can skip the metal detector, since they’ve already passed a criminal background check. After a while, lobbyists and journalists figured this out and got their own handgun carry permits.The same concerns about concealed carry in state capitols were raised when states adopted right-to-carry laws. But permit holders have been extremely law-abiding. Nationwide, permits are revoked for firearms-related violations at thousandths or tens of thousandths of 1%.Indeed, it’s hard to think of any other group in the country that’s anywhere near as law-abiding. Police are very rarely convicted of firearm violations, but they’re convicted six times more often than permit holders.Those who want to keep bans on civilians carrying guns in legislative areas worry that they’ll accidentally fire their guns. Yet despite all the experience in other states with carrying guns at legislative public areas and capitols, we know of just one accidental discharge -- in Kentucky in January 2014 and in which no one was harmed.In addition, since at least 1950, all but three American public mass shootings have taken place where civilians are banned from carrying guns. In Europe, every mass shooting has occurred in a gun-free zone.Those advocating gun-free zones claim permit holders will accidentally shoot bystanders or that arriving police will shoot the permit holders. Concealed carry holders have stopped shootings in malls, churches, schools, universities and busy downtowns many times, and not once have the permit holders been shot a bystander. Nor have the police ever accidentally shot a permit holder.Gun-free zones are magnets for murderers. Even the most ardent gun-control advocate would never put ""Gun-Free Zone"" signs on his home. Let's stop putting them elsewhere, including the U.S. Capitol.Goeser and Lott are with the Crime Prevention Research Center.  Lott is also the author of “More Guns, Less Crime.”

1344,MO,"Reynolds American (RAI) may be a takeover target for British American Tobacco (BTI) as the tobacco industry continues to consolidate amid shrinking cigarette sales.British American, which makes Dunhill and other branded cigarettes, in January acquired a $5 billion stake in Reynolds. An unconfirmed report by the Telegraph over the weekend said the British company is working with bankers on a deal to acquire the rest of Reynolds.No. 2 U.S. tobacco company Reynolds American makes Newport, Camel and Pall Mall cigarette brands. Last year, it was part of a three-way deal in which it bought Lorillard for $25 billion.Reynolds and Lorillard agreed to sell a combined $7.1 billion in cigarette brands and other assets to U.K. based Imperial Tobacco Group, now called Imperial Brands, to win Federal Trade Commission Approval. The FTC gave its blessing to the merger in late May 2015.Tobacco companies have seen sales of cigarettes shrink in recent years amid health concerns. According to Statistica, the number of cigarettes sold globally fell to 5.8 trillion in 2014, the latest year for which figures were available, from 5.88 trillion the year before.But tobacco companies have diversified to other products, including food, beverages and smokeless electronic vapor devices, which are benefiting from the rising popularity of vaping. As a result, the tobacco group is a strong No. 13 on IBD's list of 197 industry groups.Shares of Reynolds American, an IBD Leaderboard stock, closed up less than 0.1% Monday. The Winston-Salem, N.C.-based company has a best-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed at least 99% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth in recent quarters.British American Tobacco has recorded spotty revenue and earnings growth the last couple of years. It reported a 1% rise in 2015 earnings per share, and last year EPS shrank by 9% year over year. Consensus is for the company to just break even this year. British American was closed down 0.7%.Among other major tobacco companies, Philip Morris (PM) -- the sector's revenue leader, with about $74 billion annual sales -- fell 0.6%. Like Reynolds, it's outperformed the market, and its stock is trading near an all-time intraday high of 96.73 set in May 2013.Altria Group (MO), which sells Marlboro, Parliament, Virginia Slims and other cigarette brands, fell 1.9%.

1349,MO,"Brace yourselves, parents: Hillary Clinton's Fed Ed jackboot squad is from the government and is here to ""help."" Clinton wants a cadre of new government educrats to undo the decades-old damage of old government educrats in America's worst public schools.She pitched her creepy proposal at the Democratic presidential debate in Michigan on Sunday for an ""education SWAT team"" to swarm down and rescue students from failing districts in decrepit cities such as Detroit (run by whom? Oh, yeah: Democrats!).""I want to set up inside the Department of Education, for want of a better term, kind of an education SWAT team, if you will,"" Clinton explained in a bizarre, semiblaccent, ""where we've got qualified people, teachers, principals, maybe folks who are retired, maybe folks who are active, but all of whom are willing to come and help.""Clinton's SWAT team solution, you should know, is like all her other authoritarian plans: a moldy, recycled oldie. In fact, the U.S. Department of Education already has a real militarylike enforcement division housed in its Office of the Inspector General -- armed with its own arsenal of Remington pump-action shotguns and Glock pistols.As usual, Big Sis' brilliant idea to fix the schools boils down to throwing yet more money down the sinkhole.According to the latest data, America spent more than $600 billion to fund K-12 education in 2011, mostly from state and local taxes. Last year, the feds allocated an estimated $154 billion on education, with a large chunk going to Elementary and Secondary Education Act Title I Grants to Local Education Agencies, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act State Grants, and the Pell Grant program for college students.Washington already spends more per student (nearly $13,000 per pupil) in both primary and secondary education than any other of the 34 wealthiest countries in the world except for Austria, Luxembourg, Norway and Switzerland, according to analysis of data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.Under the Bush administration, the No Child Left Behind behemoth authorized $23 billion a year on intrusive and ineffective federal testing and accountability mandates.Under the Obama administration, the feds threw $4 billion into the Race to the Top racket, $10 billion into an Education Jobs Fund for teacher unions and $100 billion in pork-stuffed stimulus funding for school programs and initiatives administered by the Education Department.Detroit Public Schools, plagued by massive deficits, financial mismanagement and graft, collected a whopping $530 million of that stimulus slush fund -- nearly $50 million of which went to a technology boondoggle that provided 40,000 Asus laptops to students and teachers despite little evidence nationwide that such programs do anything to raise student achievement.States are spending upward of $10 billion to implement the bipartisan Common Core racket of testing, textbooks and technology. That's on top of the pre-existing $700 million spent by schools nationwide on other standardized tests and assessments and the $24 billion in annual spending required by the NCLB successor, the bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act.Mo' money has only produced mo' problems. American test scores are still abysmal. One in 10 high schools remains a dropout factory. Highly touted improvements in graduation rates, such as those in Alabama, were achieved by abandoning requirements that students pass a high school exit exam.Detroit's schools, swimming in $3.5 billion of accumulated debt, face bankruptcy in April. The district is now under FBI investigation for a vendor kickback scheme involving the very kind of ""experts"" -- entrenched teachers, self-serving principals and profligate school officials -- whom Clinton would enlist to rescue the schools they are guilty of plundering.It's government SWAT team business as usual: Destroying the village to ""save"" it.

1350,MO,"Presidency: President Obama chose to skip the funeral of former first lady Nancy Reagan, opting instead to keynote a Texas hipster festival. Given all the other funerals of leading conservatives and U.S. allies he's missed, the optics are not good.Sure, it isn't traditional for a president to attend the funeral of a former first lady, and the president did pay verbal tribute to her, whose eight years in the White House restored the splendor, dignity and even glamour of the presidency, even as the work of her husband, President Reagan, ended the Cold War and ushered in a new era of prosperity. The first lady, who died Sunday in California, was a presence in her own right, and the dearest person to the heart of the greatest president of the 20th century.Obama himself has spoken of the mark the Reagan presidency left on America and even of seeking to achieve the same kind of influence they did. So it would be a seemly gesture for him to go to the funeral anyway, joining first lady Michelle. Not going to happen. An Austin, Texas, tech and music festival called South by Southwest Interactive, or SXSW, is beckoning, and although the event had been already scheduled, there's no such thing as an event where the U.S. president wouldn't be welcomed whenever he arrives, perhaps after the funeral.A lot of good could be done by going to this funeral to pay his last respects to the beloved former first lady. The president could remind the public that the office of presidency is more important than the partisan politics that surrounds it. He could also draw some goodwill from his political opponents among Republicans, given that he's a lame duck and still seeks to accomplish things in his last year. And he could erase the growing sense that he only goes to funerals where he can reap political hay.To date, Obama has skipped some very significant funerals, often choosing to play golf or fundraise with political fat-cats instead. He passed on the funeral of America's top Cold War ally, Lady Margaret Thatcher, in 2013, sending only a low-level delegation ranking below that of the group he sent to the funeral of Venezuela's anti-American dictator, Hugo Chavez, the same year.Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew, the greatest Asian leader of the post-colonial era, and a lion-hearted U.S. ally, got about the same after he died in 2015, as did South Korea's former president Kim Young-sam and Georgia's Eduard Shevardnadze. Even rock-solid ally Israel's Ariel Sharon, who died in 2014, got only Vice President Joe Biden.Domestically, Obama also gave the back of his hand to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a giant among his peers, skipping his funeral this year.Even more painful, he's failed to show up for the funerals of important military men who lost their lives under his command. Maj. Gen. Harold Greene, who was killed in Afghanistan in 2014, got nothing more than a representative, while American Sniper Chris Kyle got absolutely nothing, not even a mention in the 2013 State of the Union address the same day.But there were people he was willing to jet halfway around the world to honor at their funerals. One of them was South Africa's Nelson Mandela, an important figure to be sure, but not significant to U.S. interests. Instead of representing the U.S. state with dignity, President Obama chose to giggle for selfies with Denmark's leader and shake hands with Cuba's odious dictator Raul Castro.He's also sent representation to the funerals of criminals in the name of political gain, honoring the likes of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014, and Freddy Gray in Baltimore in 2015, both moves that were calculated to stoke racial unrest. Even his presence at the funeral of an honorable man, State Senator and Reverend Clementa Pinckney, who was killed in South Carolina church massacre in 2015, was a move to advance a narrative about white racism.The president is the representative of all the American people as the head of state, not just those who share a political stripe or prove politically useful. No, he didn't have to attend the funeral of Nancy Reagan. But he should have.

1351,MO,"Claude Frederic Bastiat (1801-50) -- a French classical liberal theorist, political economist and member of the French National Assembly -- wrote an influential essay titled ""That Which Is Seen and That Which Is Not Seen.""He argued that when making laws or economic decisions, it is imperative that we examine not only what is seen but also what is unseen. In other words, examine the whole picture.Americans who support tariffs on foreign goods could benefit immensely from Bastiat's admonition. A concrete example was the Bush administration's 8% to 30% tariffs in 2002 on several types of imported steel. They were levied in an effort to protect jobs in the ailing U.S. steel industry.Those tariffs caused the domestic price for some steel products, such as hot-rolled steel, to rise by as much as 40%. The clear beneficiaries of the steel tariffs were steel industry executives and stockholders and the 1,700 or so steelworkers whose jobs were saved.But there is no such thing as a free lunch or a something-for-nothing machine. Whenever there is a benefit of doing something, there is a guaranteed cost.A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics, predicted that saving those 1,700 jobs in the steel industry would cost American consumers $800,000 per job, in the form of higher prices. That's just the monetary side of the picture.According to a study commissioned by the Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition, steel-users -- such as the U.S. auto industry, its suppliers, heavy construction equipment manufacturers and others -- were harmed by higher steel prices.It is estimated that the steel tariffs caused at least 4,500 job losses in no fewer than 16 states, with more than 19,000 jobs lost in California, 16,000 in Texas and about 10,000 each in Ohio, Michigan and Illinois.In other words, industries that use steel were forced to pay higher prices, causing them to have to raise prices on what they produced. As a result, they became less competitive in both domestic and international markets and thus had to lay off workers.Tariff policy beneficiaries are always seen, but its victims are mostly unseen. Politicians love this. The reason is simple. The beneficiaries know for whom to cast their ballots and to whom to give campaign contributions. Most often, the victims do not know whom to blame for their calamity.Here's my question to those who want to use tariffs to fight cheap imports in the name of saving jobs: Seeing as back in 2002, the typical hourly wage of a steelworker ranged between $15 and $20, in addition to fringe benefits -- so we might be talking about an annual wage package averaging $50,000 to $55,000 -- how much sense did it make for American consumers to have to pay $800,000 in higher prices, not to mention lost employment in steel-using industries, to save each job?It would have been cheaper to tax ourselves and give each of those 1,700 steelworkers a $100,000 annual check. Doing so would have been far less costly to Americans than the steel tariffs, but it would have been politically impossible. Why? The cost of protecting those steel jobs would have been apparent and hence repulsive to most Americans. Tariffs conceal such costs.When Congress creates a special privilege for some Americans, it must of necessity come at the expense of other Americans. Then Americans who are harmed, such as the steel-using auto industry, descend on Congress asking for some kind of relief for themselves.It all reminds me of a passage in a Negro spiritual play written by Marcus Cook Connelly, titled ""The Green Pastures,"" wherein God laments to the angel Gabriel, ""Every time Ah passes a miracle, Ah has to pass fo' or five mo' to ketch up wid it.""I think Congress ought to get out of the miracle business and leave miracle-making up to God.

1352,MO,"Reynolds American's (RAI) fourth-quarter sales surged more than expected, aided by its recently acquired Newport brand and higher prices.Revenue jumped 43% in Q4 to $3.05 billion. Wall Street expected $3.04 billion. Earnings per share minus one time items grew 9.1% to 48 cents, 2 cents below consensus.In July 2015, Reynolds agreed to buy Lorillard for $27.4 billion.The tobacco company guided for 2016 EPS to $2.25-$2.35, with the midpoint is below analyst views for $2.34. Reynolds also raised its dividend 16.7% to an annualized rate of $1.68.Nomura analyst Owen Bennett said Reynolds is the best growth story in the tobacco space, and chances are good it will top its own guidance.""Given the company is likely to remain cautious early on in the year, then the top end of guidance can be seen as encouraging,"" Bennett said in a report.Reynolds American shares closed up 2.2%. Reynolds stock has a 99 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed at least 99% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth. It briefly rose above 50 on Feb. 1 to an all-time high before consolidating.Reynolds said Thursday that its U.S. cigarette volume rose 33.6% in Q4, driven in part by the addition of the Newport brand. Industry cigarette volume declined 0.5% during the quarter, and fell 0.1% for the full year, the company said. Reynolds expects the industry to return to its traditional 2% to 3% shrinkage in 2016.Last week, Philip Morris International (PM), which sells Chesterfield, Lark and Marlboro cigarettes outside of the U.S., reported a 21.4% drop in EPS and 11% slide in revenue. The company also forecast a third straight drop in full year 2016 earnings. Shares fell 1% Thursday.Altria (MO) on Jan. 28 reported slightly higher Q4 profit as its flagship Marlboro brand grew retail sales for a fourth year in a row, and announced layoff plans to cut costs. Altria dipped 0.1% Thursday.

1353,MO,"Google Fiber had only 53,390 TV customers as of Dec. 31, said a MoffettNathanson report, which added that parent Alphabet’s (GOOGL) public relations bounty from the service is “wildly out of all proportion” to its actual market share gains vs. AT&T (T) and other cable TV players.The Google unit sells high-speed Internet and TV services in four markets and has trumpeted expansion plans. Google Fiber bundles video and gigabit-per-second broadband service for $130 monthly and also sells stand-alone Internet for $70 monthly.Google Fiber is currently available in Austin, Texas; Provo, Utah; Kansas City, Mo., and neighboring Kansas City, Kan. Google announced plans early in 2015 to expand the service to San Antonio; Nashville, Tenn.; Atlanta; Charlotte, N.C.; Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; and Salt Lake City. It's also deep in talks with other potential markets.Telecom companies have been alarmed over Alphabet-owned Google Fiber’s recent spate of announcements. AT&T in February sued Louisville, Ky., over a new law that would make it easier for companies like Google Fiber to install gigabit Internet networks using existing utility poles. Comcast (CMCSA) in early February stepped up its marketing in Atlanta in anticipation of Google Fiber’s arrival.MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett says Google Fiber likely has more broadband customers than TV subscribers, but the firm's study didn't track broadband. Still, he says that Google Fiber’s relatively few TV customers, based on data from the U.S. Copyright Office, raises questions over the media hype the service has garnered.“The addition of less than 12,000 subscribers over the span of six months for a service that has generated this kind of fanfare isn’t terribly impressive,” wrote Moffett.Alphabet hasn't given any subscriber figures for Google Fiber, nor any financials. The business is grouped in its quarterly earnings into what Alphabet calls its ""other bets"" -- basically including all businesses other than the core Google units.Google has been in talks with local governments in Portland, Ore., San Jose, Calif., and Phoenix to expand its service to those markets. In late 2015, Google Fiber said it might enter Chicago or Los Angeles. And in late February, Google Fiber said San Francisco was also on its expansion list.“Google has made a number of splashy announcements. Taken together, they have a rather provisional feel, as if the company is still experimenting,” Moffett wrote. “Each market is different, and seemingly intentionally so. The goal doesn’t seem to be how much ground they can cover. It seems to be how many different business models they can showcase.”

1354,MO,"Philip Morris International (PM) sees 2016 earnings falling further after declines in 2015 and 2014.The maker of Chesterfield, Lark and global No. 1 seller Marlboro cigarette brands forecasts its full-year earnings per share to be $4.25-$4.35 at current exchange rates, down from $4.42 in 2015 and well below consensus of $4.52.That would follow drops of 12% in 2015 and 7% in 2014.Shares of Philip Morris closed down 0.9% on the stock market today. Among other large tobacco companies, Altria (MO) lost 0.6%, British American Tobacco (BTI) fell 1.75% and Reynolds American (RAI) dipped 1%.In Q4, Philip Morris' adjusted earnings fell 21.4% to 81 cents, in line with analysts' expectations. Unfavorable currency rates had an 18-cent impact in the quarter.Revenue dropped 11% to $6.39 billion, below consensus for $6.49 billion and the the fifth straight quarter of declines, as its cigarette shipment volume fell 2.4%, excluding acquisitions.The decline was largest in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where revenue plunged 19% to $1.72 billion. The company doesn't sell in the U.S. since it was spun off from former parent Altria, which operates Philip Morris USA, in 2008.The Philip Morris namesake brand was its top gainer, as volume grew 20.2% to 9.8 billion cigarettes. Despite new packaging and marketing, its Marlboro brand saw a weak 0.7% rise to 71.8 billion units.Chief Executive Andre Calantzopoulos said efforts to develop electronic cigarettes and other cigarette alternatives picked up steam.“We continued to make exciting progress on the development, assessment and commercialization of our Reduced-Risk Products,"" he said. ""We significantly expanded the roll-out of iQOS (smokeless cigarette) in Japan and introduced it into several new markets.""

1355,MO,"Nice guys finish last, the saying goes. But whoever said it never met bowling great Dick Weber.“He was the greatest ambassador in the history of the game,” Professional Bowlers Association Commissioner Tom Clark told IBD. “Everybody liked Dick Weber, even the guy he was beating.”And he beat plenty of them. Weber (1929-2005):Won 30 PBA tour events, including senior tournaments. Won a tournament in each of six decades, one of only two men to do that.Entered the PBA Hall of Fame in 1975.Took top honors in a 1999 Bowling Magazine poll as the Greatest Bowler of the Century.And that just scratches the lane of his honors.His feats on the boards provided a platform to promote the game, and Weber is admired almost as much for his selfless dedication to that effort. Uniformly, those who remember him recall the quality of his character, whether he was participating in bowling or promoting it.“Dick Weber was a star and carried himself with a level of class with history in mind,” Clark said. “He elevated the entire game. That’s why everyone in bowling speaks of him in such glowing terms.”Weber’s professional life paralleled the rising popularity of 10-pin bowling in America. An Indianapolis native and self-described bowling alley bum, he set pins for pennies a game as a kid. While working as a mail carrier, he built a reputation in local professional tournaments.But a bigger lane was about to open.In 1955, Weber moved to Florissant, Mo., near St. Louis, to join the legendary five-man Budweiser match bowling team, sponsored by the beer maker. Bowling with him were Don Carter, Ray Bluth, Tom Hennessey and Pat Patterson, all future PBA Hall of Famers.The St. Louis Sports Hall of Fame said that they were “considered the equivalent of the 1927 New York Yankees.” At the 1958 National Team Match Games, they bowled a combined 3,858 pins, setting a record lasting almost 36 years.Also in 1958, another lane opened. Weber put his name among the founding members of the Professional Bowlers Association. Of the tour’s first 23 events, Weber won 10 of them, including seven victories in 1961.Something was about to happen that would be much bigger than a win or even a handful of them. It would expand bowling’s popularity and make Weber a superstar: television.In 1962, ABC launched its “Pro Bowlers Tour” on Saturday afternoons. Just a year later, says Pricenomics.com, “Harry Smith, the top bowler in 1963, made more money than (baseball's National League) MVP Sandy Koufax and NFL MVP Y.A. Tittle combined.”The televised tour often led into ABC’s “Wide World of Sports,” and Clark points out that TV technology of the day -- one or two stationary cameras -- favored a sport like bowling.In the 1960s, bowling was the big league, and Weber was its superstar.“Bowling was a pioneer in the sports world on television, and Dick Weber was the face of that,” Clark said. “He was not only one of the best bowlers from a talent standpoint, but he was very charismatic. He had a face like a movie star and carried himself like a professional.”If bowling had a reputation as a pastime for a rowdy, beer-swilling crowd, Weber knocked it down like a five-seven split.Trim, fit, standing straight, always a smile for every fan, always a signature for every autograph hound, he was in bowling’s heyday the approachable star adored by fans and respected by peers.Recall that Weber was one of two men to win tournaments in six straight decades. The other, Johnny Petraglia, got into bowling because of Dick Weber.“I had fallen in love with bowling at an early age, and I was 13 years old in 1960 when they built two lanes in Madison Square Garden for a bowling exhibition with Don Carter and Dick Weber,” Petraglia, yet another PBA Hall of Famer, told IBD. “I went to watch, and I was extremely impressed by Weber, not only the bowler but the kind of person he was. At the age of 13, I said, ‘I know what I want to do now. I want to be like Dick Weber.’ ”So inspired, Petraglia set a goal to be good enough to turn pro at 18. He did and won his first tournament at 19.“He was a tremendous influence on my life,” Petraglia said. “His class, the way he had about him and everything he did for the sport.”Petraglia and others liken Weber’s role in bowling to that of Arnold Palmer in golf.“Like Palmer, he’s the one who got everyone interested in the sport,” Clark said.In the locker room, Petraglia recalled, no special place was set aside for Weber, no star treatment. He greeted everyone with a smile and treated everyone as an equal.“My second PBA event was in Denver, and I was 18 years old,” Petraglia said. “Surprisingly, I made the finals, and I’m bowling (against) Dick Weber. I blurted out, ‘Does life get any better than this?’ I knew I had a front row seat to greatness. It’s a wonderful feeling, and that’s what Dick Weber meant.”In the 1980s and 1990s, bowling felt the squeeze from other televised sports, like football and basketball, along with the overall decline in bowling league play. ABC broadcast its final Saturday tour in 1997.But for Weber, even as interest in bowling declined, he remained famous and used his star power to promote his sport. He appeared several times on “Late Night With David Letterman,” where producers improvised a bowling lane outside on West 53rd Street in New York City. Weber proceeded to knock down a set of pins, a TV set, a pyramid of champagne glasses filled with flaming brandy and a fishbowl full of gum balls.Weber was about more than professional events. He owned a bowling center in Florissant and brought the same dedication to that work.“He was all-out, no matter what,” said Pete Weber, Dick’s son and also a Hall of Fame bowler. “If he was in a bowling tournament, he bowled because he felt like he could win. At the bowling center he owned, he was there every day at 5:30 a.m. and always very gracious with his customers. No wonder he was well liked. He was gracious to everyone.”His excellence in sports and business extended to his role as husband and father, too.“He was a great dad. He was very supportive of whatever we wanted to do,” Pete Weber said. “He was a sports fanatic, and he came to all our games he could. Softball. Baseball. He would argue with the umps. He taught us if you wanted to win, then you win. No one is going to give anything to you.”Dick Weber’s lifetime tournament earnings of $930,000 don’t sound like much now, but he also enjoyed a decades-long sponsorship with AMF Bowling. He lived modestly in the home that he first bought with his wife, Juanita, when they moved near St. Louis. That's where they raised their four children, Pete, Paula, Rich and John.Even now, 11 years after Dick Weber died at age 75, emotion fills Pete Weber’s voice as he speaks of him.“It has been an honor and privilege to be his son,” he said.A particular Johnny Petraglia memory might offer the best insight into the total package of Dick Weber.Petraglia hosted a charity bowling match in the late 1990s in New Jersey. He asked Weber to participate, and the great veteran did so without hesitation.In addition to the exhibition match, Weber sold kisses for a dollar, and fans were lined up.Later, Petraglia realized that Weber had never filed an expense report to get reimbursed for travel, hotels and food.“Six months down the line,"" said Petraglia, ""I asked him about it again. ‘I can’t even find the son of bitch,’ he told me. ‘It’s for charity; just leave it alone.’ He never charged me a nickel.”Expanded professional bowling’s reach and status with world-class skill, movie-star looks and unfailing kindness to fans and competitors.Overcame: Bowling’s decline in popularity.Lesson: In whatever you do, go full tilt and be gracious to all you meet.“Mine is a straight, nothing-fancy, down-and-in delivery.”

Here are just two. A 2015 column in GQ magazine on Ben Carson, now a member of Trump's Cabinet, was literally entitled, ""F--- Ben Carson,"" using the actual four-letter expletive in the title. Howard Dean, former chair of the DNC, flat-out said, ""(Steve Bannon's) a Nazi,"" referring to the top Trump advisor.Let's remember that Bill Clinton, not Trump, tried to get Ted Kennedy to support Hillary in 2008 by saying, ""A few years ago, this guy (Obama) would have been getting us coffee."" Democratic leader Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., not Trump, said then-presidential candidate Obama could succeed because he was a ""light-skinned"" black ""with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one.""Tell us again, who are the ""racists""?

1357,MO,"Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) maintains its commitment to boost shareholders’ value through dividend payouts. Recently, management has approved a quarterly dividend hike of 2.9% to $1.07 per share from the previous payout of $1.04. The new dividend will be paid on Oct 12, to shareholders of record as on Sep 27, 2017, after the adjustment of ex-dividend date on Sep 26. This brings the company’s annualized dividend to $4.28 per share, representing an increase from the previous annualized rate of $4.16.Notably, this was the 10th straight year of dividend hike by Philip Morris since it officially became a public company in 2008, reflecting a total growth of 132.6% or a compound annual growth rate of 9.8%. The last dividend hike of 2% to $1.04 per share was announced in September 2016.Dividend hike is frequent among companies with a stable cash position and healthy cash flows. Therefore, we believe that such hikes not only enhance shareholders’ return but raise the market value of the stock as well. Basically, through these dividend increases companies persuade investors to either buy or hold the scrip instead of selling it.Apart from Philip Morris, other consumer staple companies like Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) and The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) have also raised their dividends. Altria raised its quarterly dividend by 8.2% to 66 cents per share payable on Oct 10. Pinnacle Foods has approved a quarterly dividend hike of 14% to 32.50 cents per share that is payable on Oct 9. J. M. Smucker hiked its quarterly dividend by 4% to 78 cents per share, which was paid on Sep 1.A Look at Philip Morris’ PerformanceThis tobacco leader has been witnessing declining shipment volumes mainly owing to declining demand for cigarettes because of ongoing anti-tobacco campaigns, and price rise to offset the effect of rising taxes. Moreover, consumers opting for e-cigarettes or reduced risk substitutes are denting cigarette volumes.Despite declining cigarette volumes, Philip Morris continues to benefit from its strong portfolio of tobacco brands and pricing power. Further, the company is churning its portfolio and taking steps to develop smoke-free products called reduced risk products as customers are shifting away from tobacco products.

1358,MO,"The Consumer Staples sector seems to be in good shape. A rebound in oil prices from all-time lows, an improving labor market and a resurgent housing market are raising buyers’ confidence. Also, encouraging manufacturing index readings issued by the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) also hints at a pickup in GDP, indicating that economy is on a recovery mode.Headwinds Plaguing Tobacco Industry However, tobacco industry, which is part of the consumer staples sector, is failing to draw investors’ attention due to industry-wide headwinds. We note that governments around the world have been imposing stringent restrictions on tobacco companies to lower cigarette consumption, which is severely impacting businesses of tobacco giants including Altria Group Inc. (MO  -  Free Report), British American Tobacco p.l.c. (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group Ltd. (VGR  -  Free Report).In July, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes, as tar and other substances inhaled through smoking is detrimental to health. Not only this, the FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking. The European Union and the FDA have proposed a ban on menthol in accordance with the Tobacco Control Act. Per the act, menthol has an adverse effect on health and thus should not be used in any product.Amid increasing government restrictions and declining smoking rates, the tobacco giants have introduced e-cigarettes and Reduced Risk Products to mitigate losses. However, the FDA also imposed several restrictions on e-cigarettes. The FDA made it mandatory for all tobacco makers to seek marketing authorization for any tobacco product introduced after Feb 15, 2007. The law was extended to include e-cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and hookah. The FDA has currently deferred its reviews for products like cigars and hookah tobacco until 2021 and e-cigarettes until 2022.Amid such a scenario, let us take look at Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) and see if it can be a good choice for investors. The company’s sales have declined in six out of the last seven straight quarters due to lowering cigarette shipment volumes. Also, its earnings have posted negative surprise in five out of the last seven quarters.Why Philip Morris is a Viable Investment Choice?Shares Gaining Momentum: Despite declining cigarette volumes, Philip Morris continues to benefit from its strong portfolio of tobacco brands and pricing power. Further, the company is churning its portfolio and taking steps to develop smoke-free products called reduced risk products. In fact, Philip Morris remains focused on the growing e-cigarette category and less harmful alternative tobacco products such as HeatSticks and iQOS and expects the same to deliver growth in 2017. The strong fundamentals of the company are reflected in its share price movement. Philip Morris has outperformed the Zacks Tobacco industry and the broader Consumer Staple sector on a year-to-date basis. The stock has moved up 28.9% in the said time frame, higher than the industry’s growth of 10.7% and the sector’s increase of 11.2%.Favorable VGM Score: Philip Morris, with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) flaunts a VGM Score of B, which makes it a favorable investing option. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. We note that the VGM Score is a comprehensive tool that will allow investors to filter through the standard scoring system and choose better winning stocks. In order to screen out potential winning stocks, we consider only those that have a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B.Valuation Multiples: If we look into the company’s EV/EBITDA and P/S multiples, we note that the company generally trades below its industry average.Philip Morris has a EV/EBITDA multiple of 18.4. This level actually compares pretty favorably with the industry at large, as the EV/EBITDA multiple for the industry is pegged at 32.6. This indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.Right now, Philip Morris has a P/S ratio of 2.4. This is significantly lower than the industry average of 2.8 and S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.1.Valuation MultiplePhilip MorrisIndustryP/S ratio2.42.8EV/EBITDA18.432.6 Adapting to Evolving Consumer Demand; Focusing on Reduced Risk Products: As smoking rates have started to decline in developed countries, the competition to develop alternative products is putting pressure on the tobacco industry. Serious health hazards due to smoking have pushed consumers toward low-risk, reduced risk products. After launching the much talked about iQOS, a smokeless cigarette in November 2014, Philip Morris has witnessed a steady increase in the number of iQOS purchasers. iQOS smokeless cigarette looks a lot like a second generation vaporizer that uses actual tobacco in the shape of small Marlboro cigarettes called HeatSticks that are heated at high temperatures, but not burned. The company launched iQOS in key cities in 27 markets globally during second-quarter 2017, and remains on track to expand nationally in 30 to 35 markets by the end of 2017. Also, Philip Morris further anticipates producing about 100 billion HeatSticks by 2018. The company expects both higher heated tobacco unit and iQOS device sales to drive growth in 2017.Marketing and Technology Sharing Agreement With Altria Group: The marketing and technology sharing agreement between Philip Morris and its peer Altria Group is boosting the business of both companies. Per the agreement, Philip Morris will market Altria’s MarkTen e-cigarettes internationally and Altria will distribute two of Philip Morris’ heated tobacco products in the United States. The companies have also extended their technology sharing agreement in July 2015 to work on a joint research, development and technology-sharing framework for developing unconventional cigarettes. On Mar 31, Philip Morris applied for pre-market approval of its iQOS heated tobacco product with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which will be sold by Altria in U.S. If the FDA grants Philip Morris’ request it will help the companies maintain market share amid declining volume and growing awareness against tobacco products.Strong Pricing as the Growth Driver: Philip Morris has always managed to remain afloat and generate revenues with higher cigarette pricing in the face of an unfavorable tax environment and declining cigarette volumes. Since December 2013, Philip Morris has been increasing its cigarette prices and maintained its market share. This shows its strong business model and strength of its key brands. During first-quarter 2017, Philip Morris and the other tobacco companies raised their cigarette prices in a number of markets. Though higher pricing should lead to possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers generally remain unaffected by price increases owing to the addictive nature of cigarettes. However, price hikes help Philip Morris maintain margins at the desired level. The company continues to expect pricing as the key growth driver in the near term.Philip Morris International Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Philip Morris International Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Philip Morris International Inc QuoteMore Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1359,MO,"Amid declining tobacco sales volumes and rising government restrictions, Altria Group, Inc.’s (MO  -  Free Report) shift to low risk smokeless tobacco products has been aiding the company to maintain market share and generate profit.Let’s now delve deeper into the aspects which have been helping Altria to remain in investor’s good books.Low Risk Tobacco Products Aid Maintaining Market Share Consumers have been shifting to low risk, smokeless tobacco products, considering the health hazards of smoking. Altria has been quite proactive to respond to this change and has been offering several reduced risk tobacco products to maintain market share. MarkTen e-cigarette and Green Smoke e-vapor are few examples of products belonging to this category. In fact, MarkTen is now the number two e-vapor brand nationally and had a national retail market share of approximately 13% during the second quarter of 2017.In respect to developing its low risk cigarette category, Altria’s agreement with Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) is quite noteworthy. The company has a marketing and technology agreement with Philip Morris under which the latter markets Altria’s MarkTen e-cigarettes internationally and Altria distributes two of Philip Morris’ heated tobacco products in the United States. Moreover, Altria is expected to sell Philip Morris’s iQOS heated tobacco product in the domestic market, once the product gains approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Cost Reduction Altria started a productivity initiative in January 2016 which is expected to deliver approximately $300 million in annual productivity savings by the end of 2017. The company plans to save through reduced spending on certain selling, general and administrative infrastructure and thereby develop a leaner organization. Further, in October 2016, Altria announced plans to consolidate certain sections of its manufacturing facilities to streamline operations and achieve greater efficiency. The consolidation, scheduled to be completed by first-quarter 2018 is expected to deliver approximately $50 million in cost savings by the end of 2018. Such initiatives are anticipated to aid the company gain higher profits over the long term.Industry Headwinds Weighs on Stock PricesAltria has been witnessing volume declines for cigarettes due to the ongoing anti-tobacco campaigns and price hikes. Price hikes for cigarettes were observed in New York during August and in California during April this year. In July 2017, the FDA had proposed to lower nicotine in cigarettes to non-addictive or minimally addictive levels. This has further raised concerns of accelerated sales decline for Altria and other tobacco companies including Philip Morris, British American Tobacco plc (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group Ltd. (VGR  -  Free Report), which are already plagued by ongoing government restrictions related to selling and packaging. Owing to such headwinds, shares of Altria have declined 17.7% wider than the industry’s fall of 4.4%. Bottom Line Altria has been striving hard to adapt with the changing industry conditions to better suit consumer needs, as evidenced by its progress in the smokeless cigarette category. Backed by such efforts, the company recently reaffirmed its earnings guidance for full-year 2017 and expects adjusted earnings in the range of $3.26-$3.32, up 7.5% to 9.5% compared with adjusted earnings of $3.03 in 2016. Moreover, the company expects higher adjusted earnings growth in the second half of the year in contrast with the first half. Such moves are expected to improve the company’s share price performance in the forthcoming periods. Altria currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1361,MO,"Investors in Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Sep 1st, 2017, $75.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Altria Group shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Altria Group is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Tobacco industry that ranks in the Top 32% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 89 cents per shareto 88 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Altria Group right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

1362,MO,"It seems that the leaders of New York City have been striving hard to make the city smoke-free. In fact, the Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York has reportedly issued a series of laws in April to reduce the number of smokers in the city over the next three years.Per the Aug 28 bill, the minimum price for a pack of cigarettes will now be $13 in New York. Notably, a packet of cigarettes currently costs $10.50. The latest price hike has made New York the most expensive city in the U.S. for cigarettes, as declared by some officials in the Health Department stated in sources. In the past too, the mayor has resorted to price hike as a tool to restrict smokers. Smoking rate in the city has declined from 21.5% in 2002 to about 14.3% in 2015. The rate is expected to decline to 12% by 2020 due to this price hike, as anticipated by some city health officials.The law was introduced in anticipation of making almost 900,000 smokers quit smoking as well as to reduce the number of retailers licensed to sell tobacco products in the city. Currently, about 8,300 retailers have a license to sell cigarettes.The mayor is also seeking to ban the sale of all tobacco products in pharmacies, as a result of which pharmacy chains like Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.’s (WBA  -  Free Report) Duane Reade and CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) will have to take cigarettes off their shelves. The new legislation also requires licensing of e-cigarette retailers and will force all residential buildings to have smoking policies, including banning cigarettes in common areas like hallways.We note that these measures will severely dent businesses of tobacco majors including Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report), Altria Group Inc. (MO  -  Free Report), British American Tobacco p.l.c. (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group Ltd. (VGR  -  Free Report), which are already plagued by ongoing government restrictions related to selling and packaging.If we look into the share price performance of these tobacco stocks in comparison with the industry, we note that except Philip Morris, all the other stocks have underperformed the industry that declined 5.6% in the past six months. While Philip Morris gained 5.5% and British American declined 4.3%, Vector Group and Altria declined 7.8% and 15.4%, respectively, in the same time frame.Recently, the state government in India's capital directed Philip Morris and other tobacco companies to remove all advertisements in the city, warning them of legal action if they do not comply. Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes, as it is responsible for a number of health issues.Governments around the world are imposing restrictions on tobacco companies which, in turn, are lowering cigarette consumption. The FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking. The European Union and the FDA have proposed a ban on menthol in accordance with the Tobacco Control Act. Per the act, menthol has an adverse effect on health and thus should not be used in any product.Amid increasing government restrictions and declining smoking rates, the tobacco giants have introduced e-cigarettes and Reduced Risk Products to mitigate losses. Altria is expanding presence in the e-cigarette market steadily with its MarkTen and Green Smoke brands.On the other hand, Philip Morris has been gaining from its iQOS smokeless cigarettes since its launch in November 2014. The marketing and technology sharing agreement between Philip Morris and its peer Altria Group is also boosting the business of both the companies amid declining tobacco volumes.However, the FDA also imposed several restrictions on e-cigarettes. The FDA made it mandatory for all tobacco makers to seek marketing authorization for any tobacco product introduced after Feb 15, 2007. The law was extended to include e-cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and hookah. The FDA has currently deferred its reviews for products like cigars and hookah tobacco until 2021 and e-cigarettes until 2022.Bottom LineWhile price hike and lower availability of cigarettes do help smokers to quit smoking, as seen in the past, the ban also creates a serious black market for these products, which can be detrimental to all tobacco companies.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

1363,MO,"Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report) recently announced that its board of directors has approved an increase of 8.2% in its quarterly dividend, amounting 66 cents per share as compared with the previous rate of 61 cents. The newly hiked dividend is payable on Oct 10, 2017, to shareholders of record  on Sep 15.The company’s current annualized rate of dividend is $2.64 per common share, compared with $2.44 previously. Since Philip Morris International's (PM  -  Free Report) spin off in 2009, Altria has increased its dividend every year by 8% in 2016 and 8.7% in 2015. Notably, the company has raised its dividend 51 times in the last 48 years. It maintains a dividend payout ratio target of around 80% of its adjusted earnings per share, which is among the highest in its peer group.Altria has been consistently returning value to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. In the second quarter of 2017, the company paid almost $1.2 billion in dividends and nearly $2.4 billion in the first half of 2017. During the second quarter, Altria also repurchased 14.4 million shares under its existing share repurchase program for approximately $1.05 billion. As of Jun 30, Altria had approximately $335 million remaining in the share repurchase program. In July, Altria’s board authorized a $1 billion expansion to the program. Altria expects to complete the expanded $4-billion share repurchase program by the end of the second quarter of 2018.Further, the takeover of SABMiller by Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD  -  Free Report) in October 2016 helped Altria, SABMiller’s biggest investor. Altria received a 9.6% ownership of AB InBev, and approximately $5.3 billion in pre-tax cash per the terms of the acquisition, which the company used to reinvest in its core businesses or/and return value to shareholders.Industry Headwinds Effecting Stock Price Performance Notably, the tobacco maker has been returning value to its shareholders despite industry-wide headwinds. The tobacco stocks have been primarily hurt by the declining use of tobacco since past many quarters. Strict anti-smoking regulations by governments, globally, in the form of restrictions on packaging and high excise duties are also affecting the stock. Additionally, consumers’ preference for e-cigarettes or substitutes for cigarettes are largely affecting the cigarette volume. The recent FDA proposal to lower nicotine in cigarettes to non-addictive or minimally addictive levels has also added to the company’s woes.Most recently on Jul 28, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has proposed to lower nicotine in cigarettes to non-addictive or minimally addictive levels.A look into Altria’s price performance over the past six months, projects that the company’s shares have decreased 14.7%, wider than the industry’s decline of 5.2%. The broader Consumer Staples sector depicted a growth of 3.6% in the said time frame.Proactive Measures to Remain Afloat Despite unfavorable tax environment and declining cigarette volumes, Altria has been able to remain afloat and generate revenues with higher cigarette pricing. Though higher pricing might lead to possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases owing to the addictive quality of cigarettes.Additionally, Altria has promptly responded to the general shift among consumers toward low-risk, smokeless tobacco products due to serious health hazards of smoking cigarettes. Altria offers several reduced risk tobacco products that helped it to maintain its market share. Altria collaborated with Okono A/S and developed innovative, non-combustible nicotine-containing products for adult smokers. Further, Altria’s marketing and technology agreement with Philip Morris, under which the latter markets its MarkTen e-cigarettes internationally, is boosting the company’s business prospects. Altria also distributes two of Philip Morris’ heated tobacco products in the United States, which is also positive factor in terms of business growth.Such dedicated efforts are expected to improve the company’s stock performance, going ahead. Altria currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has a long-term growth rate of 7.1%.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Interest You?

1364,MO,"On Jul 28, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes, as it is responsible for a number of health issues. Following the proposal, stocks of cigarette makers including Altria Group Inc. (MO  -  Free Report), British American Tobacco p.l.c. (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group Ltd. (VGR  -  Free Report) plunged 9.5%, 7.0% and 4.7%, respectively. Shares of Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) declined initially but then rebounded to eventually close 0.27% higher.If we look into the share price performance of these tobacco stocks in comparison with the industry, we note that except Philip Morris, all the other stocks have underperformed the industry that gained 8.9% in the past six months. While Philip Morris gained 22.2% and British American increased 1.5%, Vector Group and Altria declined 9.5% and 8.4%, respectively, in the same time frame.Tobacco causes cancer and heart disease and is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths annually in U.S. Tar and other substances inhaled through smoking make cigarettes deadly, but the nicotine in tobacco is what makes them addictive.Also, governments around the world are imposing restrictions on tobacco companies which, in turn, are lowering cigarette consumption. FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking.In May 2016, the FDA also imposed several restrictions on e-cigarettes. The FDA made it mandatory for all tobacco makers to seek marketing authorization for any tobacco product introduced after Feb 15, 2007. The law was extended to include e-cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and hookahs.Recently, the state government in India's capital directed Philip Morris and other tobacco companies to remove all advertisements in the city, warning them of legal action if they do not comply.Moreover, the European Union and the FDA have proposed a ban on menthol in accordance with the Tobacco Control Act. Per the act, menthol have an adverse effect on health and thus should not be used in any product. Moreover, this ban will create a serious black market for these products, which would be detrimental to all tobacco companies.While the news of cutting nicotine to non-addictive or minimally addictive levels have raised concerns of rapid declines in sales for traditional cigarettes, it has also proved a boon for e-cigarettes, which turn liquid nicotine into an inhalable vapor. Though the regulatory authorities have imposed marketing and product regulations on e-cigarettes as well, but there is still not much scientific evidence to back their ability to help smokers quit or reduce the habit of smoking. We also note that FDA has pushed back its reviews for products like cigars and hookah tobacco until 2021 and e-cigarettes until 2022.Focus on Tobacco AlternativesAmid declining smoking rates, the tobacco giants have resorted to innovation in the form of e-cigarettes and Reduced Risk Products to mitigate losses from an increasing number of quitters. This is particularly encouraging as according to Euromonitor International, the global e-cigarette market is expected to grow to $51 billion, or hold 4% share of the worldwide tobacco market, by 2030.Altria is steadily expanding presence in the e-cigarette market with its MarkTen and Green Smoke brands. Moreover, in an attempt to boost unconventional tobacco products, Altria acquired privately-held Sherman Group Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries (Nat Sherman). The move is likely to expand its premium smokeable category. The takeover benefits Altria’s smokeable segment and complements Altria’s Marlboro brand which also falls under the premium category.Similarly, to cater to the new consumer preferences, Philip Morris launched the much talked about iQOS, a smokeless cigarette in Nov 2014 leading the tobacco industry’s push into reduced-risk products that may eventually replace traditional smokes. Philip Morris’ iQOS smokeless cigarette looks like a second generation vaporizer that uses actual tobacco in the shape of small Marlboro cigarettes called HeatSticks that are heated at high temperatures, but not burned.Since its launch, there has been a steady increase in the number of iQOS purchasers. iQOS are anticipated to boost market share and offset declining volumes in traditional cigarette business in 2017. The company has launched iQOS in key cities in 27 markets globally during second-quarter 2017 and remains on track to expand nationally in 30 to 35 markets by the end of the year.The marketing and technology sharing agreement between Philip Morris and its peer Altria Group is also boosting the business of both the companies. Per the agreement, Philip Morris will market Altria’s MarkTen e-cigarettes internationally and Altria will distribute two of Philip Morris’ heated tobacco products in the U.S. The companies have also extended their technology-sharing agreement in Jul 2015 to work on a joint research, development and technology-sharing framework for developing unconventional cigarettes.On Mar 31, Philip Morris has applied for pre-market approval of its iQOS heated tobacco product with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which will be sold by Altria in the U.S., provided the FDA grants Philip Morris’ request. Such a collaboration is encouraging as it will help the participating companies maintain market share amid declining volumes and growing awareness against tobacco products.The recent merger of Reynolds American, Inc. with British American Tobacco has brought strengthen its global portfolio including next generation products and strong cigar brands including Newport, Kent from British American Tobacco and Camel and Pall Mall from Reynolds. Moreover, the combined company will benefit from Reynolds’ strong position in the alternative tobacco and next-generation product development, and R&D capabilities.More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

Amazon’s disappointing second quarter results weighed on both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.The FDA’s decision to cut nicotine content in cigarettes weighed on the shares of tobacco maker Altria Group, which in turn dragged the S&P 500 lower Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s failure to repeal Obamacare also weighed down broader markets, following concerns about its ability to push through crucial policy changes. Meanwhile, second quarter GDP came in below expectations.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) touched all-time intraday high and rose 0.2% or 33.76 points, closing at 21,830.31. The S&P 500 Index (INX) declined 0.1%, dwindling 3.32 points to close at 2,472.10. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,374.68, declining 45 points or 0.2%.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.16-to-1 ratio .On the Nasdaq, a 1.17-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Dow Breaches Record, Recovers from 40-Point DeclineThe Dow matched an all-time intraday high on Friday, closing at a record level of 21,830.31. The blue-chip index was boosted by splendid earnings from Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) . This enabled the Dow to recover from the 40 point decline it suffered earlier in the session. U.S. energy giant Chevron Corp. reported strong second-quarter results amid the recovery in commodity prices, production gains and the success of its cost savings initiatives. The company reported earnings per share (excluding special items) of 91 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 89 cents and the year-ago profit of 48 cents.

(Read More: Chevron Q2 Earnings Beat on Oil Rally, Output Rise).On the other hand, Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report) posted a dismal performance, losing1.5%. Energy giant Exxon Mobil Corporation posted an earnings miss in second-quarter 2017 owing to a decline in liquid volumes and lower margin from chemical businesses. This was partially offset by increased price realizations from liquids and gas and improved refinery volumes. The company reported earnings of 78 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents. However, the bottom line improved from the year-ago quarter level of 41 cents. (Read More: Exxon Mobil Q2 Earnings Miss on Lower Volumes). However, Exxon’s losses were negated by Chevron’s excellent earnings performance and the blue-chip index posted a weekly gain.Amazon Posts Disappointing Earnings Amidst Speculations On OvervaluationAmazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) posted dismal earnings in the second quarter. Its second-quarter 2017 earnings per share (EPS) of 40 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.40. (Read More: Amazon Q2 Earnings Hurt by Higher Spending, AWS Solid). Amazon’s dismal performance led to losses for both the Dow and the S&P 500.Investors have been worried regarding the now familiar overvaluation of tech stocks as they fear a potential market crash and cautious investors have started taking profits off the table. This has affected the broader market and has pulled down the Nasdaq composite which closed at 6,374.68, declining 0.1%. The earnings season continues as Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) is expected to report this week.FDA Announces a Cut In Nicotine Content, S&P 500 Slips The S&P 500 finished 3.32 points lower, closing at 2,472.10. Although, the index recovered from its early 10- point deficit, it still closed the day 0.1% lower. Apart from Amazon’s dismal earnings, the Food and Drug Administration’s call to reduce the nicotine content in cigarettes hurt investor sentiment. The Select Consumer Staples SPDR (XLP) declined 0.8%, emerging as the worst performer out of eleven sectors of the S&P. Eight of the eleven sectors of the S&P ended in negative territory. The FDA’s decision also had negative ramifications for tobacco maker Altria Group Inc. MO as its shares slid 9.5%.On a broader scale, disappointing earnings from Amazon, Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) and Exxon Mobil also dented investor sentiment. Starbucks met analysts’ expectations on earnings, but failed to meet the same on revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.74 billion by 1.4%. (Read More: Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) Q3 Earnings in Line, Signals Soft US Market)Trump’s Failure to Repeal Obamacare Dampens Investor SentimentThe Trump –led Republican Government has failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act yet again. This has dampened investor sentiment with market watchers losing their faith in the promises made by President Trump in the run up to the presidential elections. Trump's failure to keep his campaign trail promises has made investors doubtful of his ability to bring about tax reforms and increasing spending on infrastructural growth among other items on his pro-growth agenda. These concerns also contributed toward losses for the broader markets.Economic DataThe gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annual rate of 2.6% in the second quarter which came in lower than the expected rate of 2.8%. This was 1.2% higher than the first quarter. Consumer spending remained the major engine of growth. Personal consumption rose 2.8%, up from 1.1% in the first quarter. This was buoyed by a vibrant labor market which also meant increased spending in new homes.Weekly ResultsFor the week, the Dow gained 1.2% whereas the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 fell 0.2% and 0.1% respectively. The Dow’s great run has been supported by excellent earnings for the week. The companies which reported better-than-expected earnings were AT&T (T  -  Free Report), McDonalds MCD, Boeing (B  -  Free Report), Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report), Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report).The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 turned in mixed performances over the week. Despite splendid earnings from Facebook and the tech rally, disappointing performance from Amazon and the swoon in the shares of Apple, led the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq to close in the red. Moreover, a slump in healthcare sector also weighed on the S&P 500.Stocks That Made HeadlinesTelefonica Q2 Earnings Up Y/Y, Revenues Lag EstimatesSpanish telecom giant, Telefonica S.A.

1366,MO,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced a plan on Friday to reduce tobacco-related disease and death by increasing regulations on tobacco and nicotine products. The FDA is seeking to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes to non-addictive levels.In reaction to this news, Tobacco stocks plunged in morning trading. Shares of Altria Group (MO  -  Free Report), which makes Marlboro and Parliament brand cigarettes, fell 11% after the announcement. Shares of Gillia  tumbled 7% while British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report) stock plunged 9%. Meanwhile, Vector Group (VGR  -  Free Report) shares fell 5% and Philip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) stock was down 1% in the same time frame. The FDA’s regulation targets the addictive nature of cigarettes, which could hurt the profitability of tobacco companies. However, the FDA views these regulations as a way to encourage development of innovative tobacco products that may be less dangerous than cigarettes.“The overwhelming amount of death and disease attributable to tobacco is caused by addiction to cigarettes—the only legal consumer product that, when used as intended, will kill half of all long-term users,” FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement.“Envisioning a world where cigarettes would no longer create or sustain addiction, and where adults who still need or want nicotine could get it from alternative and less harmful sources, needs to be the cornerstone of our efforts—and we believe it’s vital that we pursue this common ground.”The agency also announced plans to delay a policy that requires makers of e-cigarettes, or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), to get agency approval for their products. To help spur industry innovation, products that were on the market as of August 8th, 2016, do not need to submit applications until 2022.The agency said it will issue guidance to describe a new enforcement policy “shortly” as it begins a public discussion around lowering nicotine levels. The FDA has not said what level of nicotine it is aiming for.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1367,MO,"Altria Group Inc. (MO  -  Free Report) reported mixed results in the second quarter of 2017, wherein while earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues beat the same. The company however kept earnings guidance intact for 2017.Quarter in detailAdjusted earnings of 85 cents per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. However, earnings increased 4.9% year over year driven by higher operating income in the smokeable and smokeless segments and lower outstanding shares. This was offset by lower equity earnings from Altria’s beer investment.Net revenue increased 2.2% to $6.7 billion in the second quarter primarily driven by higher net revenues in the smokeable and smokeless products segments, offsetting the decline in Wine segment. Revenues net of excise taxes increased 3.8% year over year to $5.1 billion and also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.9 billion by 1.6%.In e-vapor, Altria’s subsidiary Nu Mark LLC continues to boost MarkTen volume and retail share. Encouragingly, MarkTen has become the second most preferred e-vapor brand nationally, with a second-quarter national retail market share of approximately 13% in mainstream retail channels.However, if we look into Altria’s stock performance over the last six months, we note that the stock has moved up just 0.6%, in comparison to the industry’s growth of 19.8% and broader Consumer Staples sector’s growth of 8.1% in the same time frame.We believe declining demand for cigarettes due tothe ongoing anti-tobacco campaigns, government restrictions and higher cigarette prices in response to rising taxes have been weighing on the stock. Strict Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations on cigarette packaging dissuade customers from smoking. Additionally, consumers’ preference for e-cigarettes or substitutes for cigarettes are largely affecting the cigarette volume. Evidently, Altria’s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in six of the last eight quarters, including this quarter.Segment DetailsSmokeable Products Segment: Despite a large cigarette excise tax increase in California, which negatively impacted volume and retail share in the second quarter, revenues net of excise taxes increased 1.6% year over year to $5.9 billion. The increase was primarily driven by strong pricing, partially offset by lower volume and higher promotional investments. Total shipment volume decreased 2.9% year over year to 30.6 billion units. Cigarettes retail market share declined 0.4 share point to 50.8% in the quarter.Adjusted operating companies income (OCI) increased 6.4%, while adjusted OCI margins expanded 1.6 percentage points to 51.7%.Smokeless Products: Revenues net of excise taxes increased 7.8% to $564 million in the second quarter, as it rebounded from the preceding quarter’s decline of 2.5% which was impacted by the recall of some of its smokeless tobacco products. The second quarter was driven by higher pricing and volume, partially offset by unfavorable mix. Volumes grew 1.4% to 221 million units, where Copenhagen and Skoal shipment volumes grew 1.3% and others increased 2.3% in the quarter. Total smokeless products retail share decreased 0.8 share points to 54.1% in the second quarter.Adjusted OCI surged 9.8% and margins increased 0.7 percentage points to 70.0%.Wine: The segment’s revenues went down 12.3% year over year to $150 million due to trade inventory reductions and increased competitive activity. Wine shipment volume declined 14.5% to 1.8 million units.Ste. Michelle’s adjusted OCI declined 32.4%, primarily due to lower volume. OCI margins decreased 5.2 percentage points to 17.2%.Altria Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Altria Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Altria Group QuoteFinancial UpdatesAltria ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $5.23 billion, long-term debt of $13.89 billion, and total shareholders’ equity of $12.26 billion.In May 2017, Altria’s board declared a regular quarterly dividend of 61 cents per share, which means that Altria had paid almost $1.2 billion in dividends in the second quarter and nearly $2.4 billion for the first half of 2017. During the second quarter, Altria repurchased 14.4 million shares under its existing share repurchase program for approximately $1.05 billion. As of June 30, 2017, Altria had approximately $335 million remaining in the share repurchase program. In July, Altria’s board authorized a $1 billion expansion to the program. Altria expects to complete the expanded $4 billion share repurchase program by the end of the second quarter of 2018.Altria expects to continue to return a large amount of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends by maintaining a dividend payout ratio target of approximately 80% of its adjusted earnings.Consolidation of Manufacturing FacilitiesIn Oct 2016, Altria announced the consolidation of several of its manufacturing facilities to streamline operations and achieve greater efficiencies. The consolidation, scheduled to be completed by the first quarter of 2018 is expected to deliver approximately $50 million in cost.OutlookAltria reaffirmed earnings guidance for full-year 2017 and expects adjusted earnings in a range of $3.26–$3.32, up 7.5% to 9.5% compared with adjusted earnings of $3.03 in 2016. Further, it anticipates higher adjusted diluted EPS growth in the second half of the year compared with the first half. Altria continues to expect 2017 full-year effective tax rate on operations to be approximately 36%.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAltria currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the consumer staple sector are Nomad Foods Limited (NOMD  -  Free Report), Post Holdings, Inc.

1369,MO,"The second-quarter reporting cycle seems to have started off on a solid note, with a slew of positive surprises coming in on both the earnings and revenue fronts. Also, earnings and revenue growth have bettered expectations.As of Jul 25, 128 companies on the S&P 500 index reported their quarterly numbers, per the Earnings Outlook. Of these, 77.3% delivered positive earnings surprises, while 70.3% surpassed the top-line expectations. In fact, total earnings for these companies were up 7% from the year-ago quarter, while revenues increased 4.2%.Total second-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 companies are projected to rise 7.2% from the year-ago period, with total revenue increase of 4.5%, according to the Earnings Trends of Jul 19. While this looks encouraging, we note that the earnings and revenue growth pace is still tracking below the first quarter 2017 level. Thus, with this initial growth picture we cannot conclude that the second-quarter earnings cycle is going to be outstanding.The performance of the index is not restricted to a single sector, and of the 16 Zacks sectors, six are expected to witness an earnings decline in the second quarter. Of these, Autos and Conglomerates are likely to be the major drags.Tobacco Stocks form part of the Consumer Staples sector. The second-quarter earnings’ numbers for the sector looks decent, with year-over-year earnings growth of 3.9% and revenues increase of 1.5%. In fact, the sector is currently placed at top 13% of the Zacks Classified sectors (2 out of 16).Conversely, we observed that the Consumer Staples sector has lagged the broader market in the last one year. While the sector gained 2.4%, the S&P 500 index advanced 14.3%.Let’s see what awaits the following Tobacco stocks that are queued up for second-quarter earnings releases on Jul 27.Leading tobacco maker, Altria Group, Inc.

Furthermore, the restrictions imposed on tobacco companies are lowering cigarette consumption. Also, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking. These regulations adversely impact the company’s top line and, in turn, its overall profitability.Recently, tobacco giant, Philip Morris International Inc.

1371,MO,"Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the market opens.The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this tobacco maker will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s earnings have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.4% in the first quarter. However, it has pulled off average positive earnings surprise of 0.7% in the trailing four quarters.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Altria this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Altria Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Altria Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Altria Group QuoteAltria has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 86 cents. Moreover, the company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which further makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter has declined by a penny in the last 30 days, while the same has remained stable at $3.28 for 2017.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $4.97 billion and $19.70 billion for the second quarter and 2017, respectively.Factors Influencing the QuarterWe note that Altria has been witnessing declining demand for cigarettes due to the ongoing anti-tobacco campaigns, government restrictions and higher cigarette prices in response to rising taxes on it. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking. These regulations adversely impact the company’s performance and, in turn, its overall profitability. Additionally, consumers’ preference for e-cigarettes or substitutes for cigarettes are largely affecting the cigarette volume.Evidently, Altria’s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in six of the last seven quarters, including the last reported quarter. We expect the company to continue to feel the pinch of declining cigarette volumes in the upcoming quarter.As smoking rates are declining in developed countries, the race to replace traditional cigarettes is putting pressure on the tobacco industry. Particularly, serious health hazards due to cigarette smoking have pushed consumers toward low-risk or reduced-risk products.To match up this trend, the company is also shifting toward low-risk, smokeless tobacco products. Its flagship MarkTen e-cigarette brand (launched in 2014) and Green Smoke e-vapor products are expected to boost Altria’s results in the near term.A glimpse of Altria’s stock performance shows that its shares have gained 3.5% in the last six months, underperforming the industry’s rally of 13.2%. In fact, the industry is currently placed at the bottom 25% (191 out of 256). Meanwhile, the broader Consumer Staples sector, of which they are part of, advanced 7.7%. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the earnings growth for the sector looks decent. While total earnings for the Consumer Staples sector are estimated to rise 3.1%, revenues are projected to improve 1.2%.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1372,MO,"Reynolds American Inc.  has finally got the shareholders’ approval for its acquisition by British American Tobacco p.l.c. (BTI  -  Free Report). The transaction, which is expected to complete on or about July 25, comprise $29.44 cash and a number of BAT American Depositary Shares representing 0.5260 of British American Tobacco’s ordinary share. British American is expected take over the remaining 57.8% of Reynolds American for $49 billion.Notably, Reynolds American shareholders’ have approved three proposals, which are the Agreement and Plan of Merger, the compensation payments on a non-binding basis and the adjournment of the special meeting, if it is required.Post-acquisition, the merged company will become the world’s largest publicly traded tobacco entity. It will own a global portfolio including next generation products and strong cigar brands including Newport, Kent from BAT, and Camel and Pall Mall from Reynolds.Furthermore, British American is likely to generate a minimum of $400 million of savings via cost-cutting efforts, higher purchasing power as well as other efficiencies. Also, it plans to add roughly $38 billion of debt with the acquisition in addition to approximately $22 billion debt at the end of the previous year.Earlier in Oct 2016, British American Tobacco offered to buy the remaining part of Reynolds American in order to expand in the U.S. In fact, Reynolds American’s board of directors formed a transaction committee to negotiate with BAT, given the latter’s existing ownership stake and representation on the board of directors.In 2004, U.S.'s RJ Reynolds Tobacco Holdings and British American Tobacco’s Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. merged to create Reynolds American Inc., in which the latter held 42% share.Notably, Reynolds American has been going through a rough phase as evident from its dismal earnings and sales surprise history, along with increasing competition in the vapor category, higher excise tax, declining tobacco volumes and strict anti-smoking regulations.In addition, the company might face margin pressure owing to the pricing power of other major tobacco players in the industry such as Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) and Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report).In fact, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has gained 3.3% in the last three months, compared with the Zacks categorized Tobacco industry’s advance of 6.2%. Currently, the industry is placed at bottom 32% of the Zacks Classified industries (175 out of 256).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Coming back to the Reynolds American-BAT merger, we believe the combined entity is likely to further strengthen the tobacco industry. It will also benefit from Reynolds American’s strong position in the alternative tobacco and next-generation product development as well as R&D capabilities. Additionally, the new merged entity can develop an innovative pipeline of vapor and tobacco-heating products, going forward.3 Top Picks to Ride the Hottest Tech Trend Zacks just released a Special Report to guide you through a space that has already begun to transform our entire economy...Last year, it was generating $8 billion in global revenues.

1373,MO,"Can Consumer Staples Stocks Fight Global Worries in 2016?The traditionally defensive consumer staples sector had a strong start to 2016 and was one of the best performing sectors in the S&P 500 in the first quarter amid a moderate economic recovery and improving job market, rising wages, cheaper fuel, improved business and renewed optimism as a result of the housing recovery. If we analyze the trend on a year-to-date basis, consumer staples stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 as a whole.An interesting fact in the first-quarter earnings season was that despite global worries, a bigger proportion of companies came out with positive surprises, for both earnings and revenues. The likely explanation for this development is that either investors were prepared for even weaker results or the guidance for most companies was already lowered to easy-to-beat levels.A number of industry players including The Coca-Cola Companies, Inc. (KO  -  Free Report), McCormick & Company, Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report), PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report), Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report), Sysco Corp. (SYY  -  Free Report), Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report) and TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (THS  -  Free Report) posted positive earnings surprises in the March quarter, while a few others like Philip Morris International, Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) and Boston Beer, Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) missed on earnings.We also note that consumer confidence - a key determinant of the economy's health – has slightly declined in April from a modest gain in March. According to the recent Conference Board data, the Consumer Confidence Index was down to 94.2 in April from the March reading of 96.1. However, the Employment Trend Index increased in April, after decreasing in March. It now stands at 128.28, up from 126.42 in March.We should keep in mind that the consumer staples sector continues to face headwinds from uncertainty related to the Fed, global market turmoil and continued volatility in the equity market. Partly offsetting these headwinds is the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar, which should help the group’s margins in the quarters ahead. Also benefiting the sector is the continued lower commodity and energy costs, which should help boost their profit margins.Zacks Industry Rank – Positive Consumer Staples is one the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. We rank all the 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.As a guideline, the outlook for industries in the top 1/3rd of all Industry Ranks or a Zacks Industry Rank of #88 and lower is 'Positive,' the middle 1/3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between #89 and #176 is 'Neutral' and the bottom 1/3rd or Zacks Industry Rank of #177 and higher is 'Negative.'The consumer staples sector is further sub-divided into the following industries at the expanded level (260 industry groups): Agricultural Operations, Beverages – Alcohol, Beverages – Soft, Consumer Products – Miscellaneous Staples, Cosmetics & Toiletries, Food – Miscellaneous/Diversified, Publishing – Newspapers, Soaps & Cleaning Preparations, Textile – Apparel and Tobacco.Quite a few industries are placed in the top 1/3rd of the 260+ industry groups. While Consumer Products – Miscellaneous Staples holds a Zacks Industry Rank #12, Agricultural Operations carries a Zacks Industry Rank #33 and Soaps & Cleaning Preparations holds a Zacks Industry Rank #37. Food – Miscellaneous/Diversified and Tobacco also falls in this category with Zacks Industry Rank of #51 and #75, respectively.A number of them fall in the middle portion of the pack, with Beverages – Alcohol and Beverages – Soft holding the same Zacks Industry Rank #90. It is followed by Cosmetics & Toiletries and Textile – Apparel, holding ranks of #114 and #165, respectively.Only one industry i.e. Publishing – Newspapers, with a Zacks Industry Rank #189, comes in the bottom one-third.Looking at the exact position of these industries, one could say that the general outlook for the consumer staples space is positive. This is because results of most companies were better-than-expected in the first quarter of 2016, owing to a gradual recovery in the economic environment and cheaper gasoline prices, despite continued concerns over macro-economic issues.Earnings TrendsWith the Q1 earnings season now effectively behind us, total earnings for the sector in the S&P 500 were up +2.6% on -4.1% lower revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 63.3% coming ahead of top-line estimates. This compares to earnings declines of -6.3% on -7.9% lower revenues in the preceding quarter.For the second quarter, earnings are expected to decline 4%, while revenues are expected to decline 0.9%.The sector is expected to contribute 6.8% of the total S&P 500 income for 2016 and it holds 8.5% market cap weight in the index at present.For more details about earnings for this sector and others, please read our ‘Earnings Trends’ report.Bottom LineGiven the performance of the consumer staples sector in the first quarter, things are looking up at the moment. The positive growth trend is expected to continue going forward. Easing currency pressure will also benefit margins of these stocks in the second half of 2016.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

1374,MO,"Consumer staples stocks have done reasonably well in the year-to-date period, with a combination of stable operating backdrop and the inherent defensiveness of the sector adding to the space’s allure.
"
1375,MO,"On the operating front, the moderate economic recovery and improving employment scenario have been helpful. Also, lower fuel prices and rising wages have eased consumers’ disposable income. A number of major retailers and fast food chains like Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), McDonald's Corp. (MCD), and others have announced minimum-wage hikes lately, which should help the buying power at the low end of the consumer spectrum.
"
1376,MO,"Commodity costs have in many cases stabilized, which have improved profit margins for certain staples companies. The favorable margins should help offset some of the negative effect that unfavorable currency typically has on earnings.
"
1377,MO,"Here are some of the key factors that have been driving consumer staple stocks since the past few quarters and also have potential to boost earnings in the near term.1. Innovations Drive Differentiation
"
1378,MO,"In a crowded and competitive space, consumer product companies need to regularly innovate and upgrade their brands to differentiate their offerings.
"
1379,MO,"Innovation has been a driving force for consumer product giants like The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) and cereal maker General Mills Inc. (GIS). P&G believes that consistent product innovation, supported by strong marketing and commercialization, will help deliver stronger results over the long term. The company spends around $14 billion on marketing annually.
"
1380,MO,"Global brewer Molson Coors Brewing Co. (TAP  -  Free Report) also has been launching new products to boost revenues and market share, which help it to offset the impact of declining volumes. Molson Coors also invests in brand marketing and advertising to create brand awareness.
"
1381,MO,"Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. (GMCR) has particularly notable with its innovative and exclusive offerings in its single-serve coffee category in order to remain competitive. The company has also entered several strategic agreements with other coffee and beverage companies like Starbucks Corp. (SBUX  -  Free Report), Unilever plc (UL  -  Free Report), Eight O'Clock Bean and Dunkin Donuts (DNKN) to offer the signature drinks of these companies in Keurig Green Mountain’s K-Cups and Vue packs.
"
1382,MO,"Keurig is now partnering with The Coca-Cola Company (KO) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (DPS) to make Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper branded single-serve pods for use on its Keurig Cold at-home beverage system.
"
1383,MO," 2. Shifting Focus on Health and Wellness and ‘Good-for-You’ Products
"
1384,MO,"The companies are also shifting focus to make healthier and nutritious products in view of increasing health consciousness, rising obesity concerns and growing regulatory pressure.
"
1385,MO,"In order to combat declining sales of the company’s carbonated beverages, three of America’s largest soft drink makers -- The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple -- pledged to reduce calories in their beverages by 20% by 2025. Accordingly, the companies agreed to promote bottled water, no-or-lower-calorie beverages and smaller portion sizes to its consumers. Coca-Cola’s bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE) also committed recently to lower calories in its soft drinks by 10% per liter by 2020.
"
1386,MO,"Food companies B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS) and General Mills also rolled out a variety of nutritious products in 2014 and in the first half of 2015. Natural and organic food/beverages maker The WhiteWave Foods Company (WWAV) and United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) have been benefiting from strong demand for natural/organic food products and expect the trend to continue.
"
1387,MO,"Food and beverage companies are not the only ones trying to shift to healthier options. Tobacco companies like Lorillard Inc (LO), Altria Group Inc. (MO  -  Free Report) and Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have resorted to less harmful alternatives like electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). To cater to this, Philip Morris International, Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) plans to launch a set of Next Generation Products (NGPs) this year which will reduce the risks related to tobacco products and attract adult consumers.3. Acquisitions and Strategic Partnerships
"
1388,MO,"Consumer staple companies are regularly carrying out acquisitions both domestically and internationally to expand their existing customer base and product lines into new markets. Some of them are also forming partnerships to take a lead in this challenging environment.
"

"
1392,MO," 4. Divestitures
"
1393,MO,"Companies have also been focusing on improving their product portfolio through divestitures which enable them to concentrate on their core portfolio.
"
1394,MO,"The Procter & Gamble Company is in the process of eliminating 60% of the brands (roughly 100 brands) by 2016 whose sales and profits have been declining over the past three years in order to be a more focused company. Consumer giant Unilever NV (UN  -  Free Report) has also divested many businesses in 2014 to concentrate on its core products portfolio.
"
1395,MO,"Similarly, in Oct 2014, Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB) spun-off its health care business, which is now called Halyard Health, Inc. (HYH). Snacking giant Mondelez International, Inc. (TM) proposed to spin-off its coffee business to Netherlands-based coffee company, D.E Master Blenders 1753 in order to concentrate on its core snacks business.

1399,MO,"The stock market has begun to discount a recovery from the global recession. Prior rallies after major declines of similar magnitude (such as after the recession in the mid-1970Õs and the Great Depression in the 1930Õs) were sharp and unrelenting.It is expected that stocks in the Consumer Staples sector will underperform as cyclical stocks begin to discount the recovery out of the current global economic recession.OPPORTUNITIESStocks in the Consumer Staples sector have traditionally performed better than the stock market, and especially cyclical companies, during market declines. The fundamental explanation is that food, beverage, household products and cosmetics companies manufacture and market brand name consumable products, most of which are considered essential to daily life, such as food, drink, toothpaste, deodorants, toilet paper, etc.Since product demand is relatively stable, the companies should report earnings in line with expectations and, hence, the stocks have outperformed. Generally speaking, food companies generate earnings growth at a mid-to-high single-digit rate.Beverage companies, however, are structurally able to grow faster at the high single-digit to low double-digit rate. But, cosmetics companies can grow earnings a percentage point or two above beverage companies.At year-end of 2008, Consumer Staples sector has outperformed the market on a total return basis for five consecutive years; therefore, the positive performance disparity is long-in-the-tooth. In addition, the relative performance has seasonal attributes with almost all the relative gain coming in the fourth quarter as investors flee more cyclical investments, which tend to disappoint near the end of the year.In 2009, it is highly probable that Consumer Staples will underperform as stocks begin to discount the recovery out of the current economic abyss. During the second quarter of 2009, Consumer Staples stocks were only up 11.7% versus the 15% gain for the S&P 500.WEAKNESSESThe outlook for the tobacco industry is negative due to the impact of a 150%+ increase in the federal excise tax, the high probability of additional federal regulation, and the recent losses in product liability lawsuits. In February, President Obama signed the congressional SCHIP (State Children's Health Insurance Program) bill that included a $0.6166 per pack increase in the federal tobacco tax. Hence, the federal excise tax per pack of 20 cigarettes was increased from $0.39 to $1.01 per pack.When federal excise taxes are increased, it is estimated that industry volume will decline by at least 8%, but the magnitude of the decline could be much greater, especially considering the backdrop of the weak economy. During the first quarter, industry cigarette volume declined 10.4% due to wholesale inventory reductions associated with the federal tax increase. A tobacco tax increase of this magnitude is unprecedented.Additional regulation of tobacco products by the U.S. Federal Government is now expected. On June 8, 2009, the U.S. Senate again passed legislation, empowering the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate cigarettes and other tobacco products. Over the last several years, the House had not passed a similar bill, but in April, the House finally passed a comparable measure, indicating a more stringent regulatory framework for all domestic tobacco companies in the future.The tobacco companies are losing product liability law suits. In late March 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal in the Boeken case; therefore, Altria (MO  -  Free Report) paid the $50 million judgment, despite claiming the judgment was excessive. Altria also lost the Bullock case; however, a new trial is scheduled to revise the amount of initial punitive damages of $28 million.Lastly, in March 2009, Altria lost the Williams case when the U.S Supreme Court dismissed the AltriaÕs appeal of a 1999 punitive damages award of $79.5 million. However, the company is delaying payment by disputing an Oregon state law that requires 60% of any punitive damages should be paid to the state.As a result of these negative developments, the ratings on both domestic tobacco companies, Altria and Reynolds American (RAI), are rated Sells.

"
1412,MO,"Another week, another rate cut. The futures markets are predicting the Federal Open Market Committee (a.k.a ""the Fed"") will cut rates for the second time this month when it meets on Wednesday and Thursday. As of yesterday, Jan 24, expectations were highest for an additional 50-basis point cut, though the possibility of just a quarter-point cut is gaining steam.
"
1413,MO,"The problems for the economy stem from a lack of available credit, and anything that can be done to encourage lending is a step in the right direction. Therefore, erring on the side of cutting rates too much is better than maintaining the fight against inflation. The stimulus can always be pulled back later in the year. If the economy does regain its footing, it would not surprise me to see rate hikes occur in the fourth quarter of this year.

"
1421,MO,"More companies continue to beat expectations than miss, though the number of misses remains proportionately higher than we have seen in past quarters. A total of 97 companies have beat and 42 have missed, a surprise ratio of 2.3:1.

1422,MO,"The sample size remains relatively small with only 159 total reports (20 companies met expectations) and therefore the numbers should continue to change as more companies release their earnings results.

Following the announcement, two of the 10 covering brokerage analysts adjusted their fourth-quarter forecasts. The revisions caused a one-cent increase in the consensus earnings estimate to 29 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at 32 cents per share. CELG has topped expectations for five consecutive quarters. Celgene is scheduled to report on Thursday, Jan 31, before the start of trading.
"
1426,MO,"Crude's ability to stay near $90 per barrel, and its upward march towards $100 in late December, has caused brokerage analysts to adjust their profit projections on many oil companies, including  Occidental Petroleum (OXY  -  Free Report). During the past 30 days, four of the covering analysts raised their forecasts, causing a seven-cent increase in the fourth-quarter consensus estimate to $1.67 per share. The most accurate forecast is slightly more bullish at $1.68 per share. OXY has topped expectations for four consecutive quarters. Occidental Petroleum is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Jan 29, before the start of trading.
"
1427,MO,"Petro-Canada (PCZ) has topped expectations over the past three quarters by an average margin of 18 cents per share. For many of the same reasons as OXY, brokerage analysts have been raising their fourth-quarter profit projections on PCZ. Positive revisions by two of the four covering analysts have caused the fourth-quarter consensus estimate to rise 10 cents to $1.39 per share. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at $1.41 per share. Petro-Canada is scheduled to report on Thursday, Jan 31.
"
1428,MO,"VMware (VMW  -  Free Report) beat expectations by eight cents when it reported its first quarter as a publicly-traded company last October. A recent upward revision to the fourth-quarter consensus estimate suggests a second positive surprise could be forthcoming. Within the past 30 days, one brokerage analyst raised his profit forecast, pushing the consensus estimate up one cent to 17 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at 19 cents per share. VMware is scheduled to report on Monday, Jan 28, after the close of trading.
"
1429,MO,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Jan 28 - Feb 1
"
1430,MO,"The slowing economy is just the latest headwind for YRC Worldwide (YRCW). The trucking company is also contending with high energy prices and competition from other trucking companies and rail. Therefore, it is little wonder that roughly half of the covering brokerage analysts have cut their fourth-quarter earnings estimates within the past 30 days. The consensus estimate of 55 cents is four cents below the average forecast of a month ago. The most accurate estimate is a penny lower at 54 cents per share.

"
1436,MO,"Calling for new record highs seems rather trivial these days with the Dow holding above 14,000, but it is very possible that the blue-chip average's ascent could continue.
"
1437,MO,"The third full week of October will be highlighted by reports from 12 Dow members: 3M  (MMM  -  Free Report), Altria Group  (MO  -  Free Report), Caterpillar  (CAT  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C), Coca-Cola  (KO  -  Free Report), Honeywell (HON  -  Free Report), IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson  (JNJ  -  Free Report), J.P. Morgan Chase  (JPM  -  Free Report), Pfizer  (PFE  -  Free Report) and United Technologies  (UTX  -  Free Report). At least one brokerage analyst has raised his quarterly profit forecast within the past week on five of these of companies. In addition, nine out of these 12 companies topped second-quarter expectations. Finally, expectations have been worsening for Citigroup and it is possible that the market could withstand a weak report and downbeat conference call from the financial conglomerate.
"
1438,MO,"Of course, there will be more than just these 12 Dow members reporting. In total, we have confirmed  earnings reports from 268 companies, 83 of which are S&P 500 members. Large-cap stocks will dominate the earnings calendar for the next 14 days, followed by multiple reports from mid- and small-cap companies.
"
1439,MO,"Friday is an options expiration day. It is also the anniversary of the 1987 crash.
"
1440,MO,"The New York Fed's manufacturing index, published on Monday, will be the week's first economic report. Tuesday features September industrial production and capacity utilization and the National Association of Homebuilders' October housing index. September CPI and housing starts will be released on Wednesday. Thursday will bring the Conference Board's September Leading Indicators index and the October Phili Fed survey. No economic reports are scheduled for Friday.
"
1441,MO,"Third-Quarter Earnings Performance
"
1442,MO,"As of Thursday evening, 75 companies within the S&P 1500 (S&P 500, S&P Midcap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600) had reported earnings. This is hardly a large enough sample to draw any conclusions from, but for those of who are curious, positive surprises are leading negative surprises by a margin of 1.6:1. Median company growth is running at 9.5%. The growth rate is within the range I would expect for the entire earnings season, though I do expect a higher proportion of positive surprises as earnings season goes on. (The ratio could temporarily worsen over the next week given that multiple banks are scheduled to report.)
"
1443,MO,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of Oct 15 - 19
"
1444,MO,"As I discussed in last Wednesday's Industry Rank Analysis column, brokerage analysts have been raising forecasts on multiple property and casualty insurers recently, including Allstate (ALL). The lack of a major hurricane striking the U.S. this year, the rebound in the financial markets and higher premiums are all likely behind the bullishness. In the specific case of ALL, roughly one-third of the covering analysts have raised their third-quarter profit projections during the past two weeks. The revisions have resulted in a 11-cent increase in the consensus estimate to $1.65 per share. The most accurate estimate is even more bullish at $1.75 per share. Investors should be aware, however, that over the past four quarters, this insurer has missed expectations two times and topped expectations two times. Allstate is scheduled to report on Thursday, Oct 18, before the start of trading.
"
1445,MO,"Despite the adverse affect of high fuel prices, Continental Airlines (CAL) is expected to report good third-quarter earnings. The airline achieved record load factors in September and estimates that it achieved an increase in consolidated revenue per available seat mile of between 4.5% and 5.5%. (Load factor measures how full a plane is; the higher the load factor is, the more likely the plane is going to feel cramped.) The bullish September numbers caused three of the 10 covering brokerage analysts to raise their third-quarter forecasts. The consensus earnings estimate of $2.12 per share is 10 cents above the average forecast of a month ago. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at $2.16 per share. CAL has topped expectations for four consecutive quarters. Continental Airlines is scheduled to report on Thursday, Oct 18, before the start of trading.
"
1446,MO,"Cubist Pharmaceuticals (CBST) has topped expectations three times during the past four quarters. Ahead of the company's third-quarter report, one of the covering brokerage analysts raised his profit forecast. Although the revision was not significant enough to move the consensus estimate from 25 cents per share, it did result in a most accurate estimate of 29 cents per share. Cubist Pharmaceutical is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Oct 17, after the close of trading.
"
1447,MO,"Although the aggregate outlook for semiconductor earnings is not too bright this quarter, Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) is likely to be a notable standout. The company is projected to have earned 31 cents per share versus 21 cents a year ago. The third-quarter consensus estimate has risen by a penny during the past four weeks, reflecting positive revisions by five brokerage analysts. The leading chipmaker has topped expectations twice during the past four quarters and matched expectations twice. Intel is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Oct 16, after the close of trading.
"
1448,MO,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Oct 15 - 19
"
1449,MO,"Packaging company Sonoco (SON  -  Free Report) recently cut its third-quarter profit guidance to a range of 55 to 58 cents per share from 62 to 65 cents per share. CEO Harris DeLoach explained that orders were weak at a time when raw material costs were rising. The majority of the covering brokerage analysts adjusted their forecasts in response, sending the consensus estimate down six cents to 57 cents per share. The most accurate estimate is slightly more bearish at 56 cents per share. SON missed second-quarter expectations by three cents. Sonoco is scheduled to report on Friday, Oct 19, before the start of trading.

"
1455,MO,"The consumer staple sector has been bearing the brunt of the 3 C’s – China, crude oil and currency. While earnings growth has been somewhat sluggish in 2015; the outlook for 2016 doesn’t look any better due to global growth worries, primarily stemming from uncertainty in China and other emerging economies. The currency headwind adds to these growth woes.
"
1456,MO,"The U.S. economy has been able to sustain a moderate growth pace despite the global growth worries. But with the Fed set on its tightening course even as central banks in Europe and Japan double down on their easing measures, the U.S. economy remains at risk of losing ground. Big parts of the U.S. economy centered on the manufacturing and energy sectors are already in recessionary territory, and the rot could spread to the consumer economy as well.
"
1457,MO,"This growth uncertainty likely explains why consumer spending hasn’t increased to the same extent as would have been expected as a result of labor market gains and fuel savings. Many consumers appear to be using the fuel dividend to boost their savings.
"
1458,MO,"There are many consumer staple stocks that are suffering from continued pressures in the face of limited consumer spending, foreign exchange headwinds and declining unit volumes. Other global issues including potential price wars, a competitive environment, political turmoil in Russia, sluggishness in Japan, and struggle in Europe continue to hinder the financial health of these companies.
"
1459,MO,"Hence, investors should be careful while investing in consumers staple stocks in the near term. Given below are certain headwinds that are likely to prevail in the coming months.WEAKNESSESSlowdown in Emerging Markets
"
1460,MO,"The majority of the global population lives in emerging economies. Due to a slowdown in income and consumption growth, affordability goes down.
"
1461,MO,"Though there remain huge opportunities for sales growth in these markets in the long run, the near-term state of affairs remains uncertain. Besides China, which is struggling since the past few quarters, developing countries like China, Brazil and Mexico are facing economic slowdown. The Middle East, Russia and Ukraine are witnessing continued political and civil unrest resulting in challenging operating conditions. Some developed markets are also facing weakness due to sluggish consumer demand.

1462,MO,"For example, consumer product company Unilever plc (UL  -  Free Report) witnessed some improvement in India and more stable conditions in China in 2015, but is still struggling with declining volumes in Brazil and a soft economy in Russia. The company is also witnessing weakness in the developed markets with little sign of recovery in North America or Europe. Moreover, it remains cautious as consumer demand continues to be weak.
"
1463,MO,"Beverage giant The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) also remains apprehensive of broader economic challenges in future quarters. While the macro-environment is improving in the U.S., Coca-Cola expects challenges in many key emerging/developing markets like Brazil, Russia and China.
"
1464,MO,"Companies like Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) and Kellogg Co. (K  -  Free Report) are also struggling with decelerating growth in the developing markets and currency headwinds. U.K.-based brewer Diageo Plc (DEO) also faces macroeconomic headwinds and tough retail conditions in emerging markets.Unfavorable Foreign Currency Impact
"
1465,MO,"Most staples companies have significant foreign currency sales, which end up looking weaker than they actually are when converted into dollar sales. The issue is present all around, but is particularly notable for companies like Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (EL), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), General Mills, Inc. (GIS), Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB  -  Free Report), Unilever, PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report), which have significant business outside the U.S. Venezuelan currency issues are also hurting Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.’s (NUS  -  Free Report) earnings significantly.Declining Volumes
"
1466,MO,"Many consumer staple companies are struggling with declining volume or soft volume growth, which is hurting their top line.
"
1467,MO,"For example, tobacco companies like Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report), Philip Morris International, Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) and Reynolds American, Inc. (RAI) are facing declining shipment volumes mainly due to higher prices of cigarettes. The government has imposed higher excise taxes on cigarettes, as a result of which tobacco companies are increasing their cigarette prices. Higher prices of cigarettes are leading to lower cigarette volumes. Further, rising competition from fake versions of branded cigarettes by local retailers is also hurting cigarette volumes.
"
1468,MO,"Global brewer Molson Coors Brewing Co. (TAP  -  Free Report) has been witnessing negative beer volumes in the U.S. and Canada for quite some time. In the U.S., the volume declines can be partially attributed to relatively weak economic conditions. In Canada, the premium beer segment has been losing volume since 2001 to the above premium and value segments, mainly due to an aging population and sluggish economy.
"
1469,MO,"The loss of the Modelo brands in Canada due to the termination of the joint venture in 2014 will also lead to volume declines in the near term.Volumes of food company Mondelez International have been dismal in 2014 and in 2015 due to significant pricing actions in response to commodity cost increases, intense competitive pressure, slow response by competitors to higher input costs and the impact of pricing related disputes with retailer customers.
"
1470,MO,"Beverage companies like Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. (DPS), Coca-Cola and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) have also been seeing declining volume trends in their domestic beverage businesses due to category weakness. A muted volume trend will remain a continuing concern going forward.Bottom Line

"
1474,MO,"The Fed’s decision to leave the door open for another rate hike in March has added to market uncertainty. But the reality is that hardly anyone in the market believes the Fed will follow through with its December dot-plot that indicated four rate hikes in 2016. With Europe and Japan clearly doubling-down on their easing measures, the Fed would effectively be causing the dollar to gain further ground and add to the export sector’s existing woes.
"
1475,MO,"The weak Q4 GDP showing notwithstanding, the overall outlook for the U.S. economy remains favorable, with steady labor market gains and oil savings helping household spending. While wage gains haven’t kept pace with broader favorable momentum in labor market, a number of retailers and fast food chains including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), McDonald's Corp. (MCD), Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) and The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report) have hiked wages.
"
1476,MO,"The growth outlook for the global economy is no doubt uncertain, but the stable fundamentals of the U.S. economy mean that we can sustain a moderate growth pace despite the challenges. This is a favorable backdrop for the consumer staples industry, with lower commodity prices helping margins for a number of sector operators, offsetting part of the negative impact of unfavorable currency movements.
"
1477,MO,"Here are some of the key factors that have been driving consumer staple stocks since the past few quarters and also have the potential to boost earnings in the near term.OPPORTUNITIES
"
1478,MO,"Innovations
"
1479,MO,"In a crowded and competitive space, consumer product companies need to regularly innovate and upgrade their brands to create differentiated value propositions and to remain successful. In fact, companies with innovative products in their pipeline will be in a position to benefit.
"
1480,MO,"Innovation has been a driving force for consumer product giants like The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) and cereal maker General Mills Inc. (GIS). P&G believes that consistent product innovation, supported by strong marketing and commercialization, will help deliver stronger results over the long term.
"
1481,MO,"Global brewer Molson Coors Brewing Co. (TAP  -  Free Report) has also been launching new products to boost revenues and market share, which help it to offset the impact of declining volumes. Molson Coors also invests in marketing and advertising to create brand awareness.
"
1482,MO,"Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. (GMCR) has stirred up a revolution with its innovative and exclusive offerings in its single-serve coffee category in order to remain competitive. In September, with the launch of its much-hyped product – Keurig KOLD brewer, it entered the cold beverage space, which is five times the size of the hot beverage market. Keurig has also partnered with The Coca-Cola Company (KO) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (DPS) to make Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper branded single-serve pods for use on its Keurig Cold at-home beverage system.
"
1483,MO,"For the hot brewer, the company already has strategic agreements with several other coffee and beverage companies like Starbucks Corp. (SBUX  -  Free Report), Unilever plc (UL  -  Free Report), Eight O Clock, and Dunkin Donuts (DNKN) to offer signature drinks of these companies in Keurig Green Mountain’s K-Cups and Vue packs.Transition to Health and Wellness and ‘Good-for-You’ Products
"
1484,MO,"Consumer staples companies are also shifting focus to make healthier and nutritious products in view of increasing health consciousness, rising obesity concerns and growing regulatory pressure.
"
1485,MO,"America’s largest soft drinks makers -- The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple -- have pledged to reduce calories in their beverages by 20% by 2025 due to a significant customer shift toward healthier and more nutritious products. Accordingly, the companies agreed to promote bottled water, no-or-lower-calorie beverages and smaller portion sizes to its consumers. Coca-Cola’s bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE) also committed recently to lower calories in its soft drinks by 10% per liter by 2020.
"
1486,MO,"Food companies B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS) and General Mills also have been rolling out a variety of nutritious products. Natural and organic food/beverages maker The WhiteWave Foods Company (WWAV) and United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) have been benefiting from strong demand for natural/organic food products and expect the trend to continue.
"
1487,MO,"Food and beverage companies are not the only ones trying to shift to healthier options. Tobacco companies like Altria Group Inc. (MO) and Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have resorted to less harmful alternatives like electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes).
"
1488,MO,"To cater to this, Philip Morris International, Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) is also working on its portfolio of e-cigarette products called Next Generation Products. These products generate nicotine-containing aerosols by heating a liquid. These will reduce the risks related to tobacco products and attract adult consumers.Acquisitions and Strategic Partnerships
"
1489,MO,"Consumer staples companies are regularly carrying out acquisitions both domestically and internationally to expand their existing customer base and product lines into new markets. Some of them are also forming partnerships, mostly with larger and better known companies, to take a lead in this challenging environment.
"
1490,MO,"Another big merger happened in Jul 2015 that of food giants -- Kraft Foods Group, Inc. and H.J. Heinz Company -- per a deal announced in March. The newly formed The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC) is now the third-largest food and beverage company in North America and the fifth-largest food and beverage company in the world.
"
1491,MO,"In mid-January 2016, Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) completed the acquisition of Boulder Brands, Inc. for $975 million, including debt. The transaction expands Pinnacle's presence in the natural and organic retail channel and provides Pinnacle with a new growth platform in refrigerated foods.
"
1492,MO,"Tyson Foods’ merger deal with packaged meat producer, The Hillshire Brands Company in Aug 2014 was the most talked about and the biggest deal in the meat industry. Similar was the merger of Reynolds American – Lorillard in the tobacco industry.
"
1493,MO,"Further, Belgium-based beer giant Anheuser Busch InBev (BUD) is considering taking over its London-based rival, SABMiller plc (SBMRY). The proposed merger, expected to close in the second half of 2016, would combine the two largest beer companies in the U.S. and could have wide implications on the worldwide beer market.
"
1494,MO,"Another major buyout announcement was that of Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. in December 2015, where Keurig agreed to sell itself to an investor group led by JAB Holding Company (‘JAB’), a Luxembourg based private company, for $13.9 billion. The deal, expected to close in the first quarter of 2016, will provide significant cash value for its shareholders, who have seen share prices fall since the beginning of 2015.Divestitures
"
1495,MO,"The companies are also focusing on rationalizing their product portfolios through divestitures, which enables them to concentrate on their core portfolio.
"
1496,MO,"Procter & Gamble plans to divest roughly 100 brands that were witnessing a decline in sales and profits in order to focus on more profitable brands.
"
1497,MO,"Similarly, in Oct 2014, Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB) spun-off its health care business, which is now called Halyard Health, Inc. (HYH). Snacking giant Mondelez International also spun-off its coffee business to Netherlands-based coffee company, D.E Master Blenders 1753 in Jul 2015 in order to concentrate on its core snacks business.
"
1498,MO,"In Nov 2015, General Mills also divested its Green Giant and Le Sueur brands of frozen and shelf-stable vegetables to food manufacturer, B&G Foods. The Green Giant buyout will help B&G Foods enter the frozen food business, which according to the company, has tremendous growth potential.Cost Cutting and Restructuring Initiatives
"
1499,MO,"Most consumer staples companies are implementing cost-reduction initiatives to boost profits. Companies like McCormick & Co., Inc. (MKC), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ), Kimberly-Clark, Kellogg Co. (K), Sysco Corp. (SYY  -  Free Report) and many others have been benefiting from significant cost savings and restructuring initiatives to boost earnings.Bottom Line

"
1503,MO,"Global growth worries have been haunting the markets lately, primarily stemming from the uncertainty in China and other emerging economies. The Chinese central bank’s move to cut interest rate and devalue its currency in August to prop up growth also failed to calm investors. In fact, investors’ fears were heightened after the continual stock market losses in the last week of August. Moreover, the growing concern over the health of the Chinese economy started impacting global markets, be it in the Asian, European or the U.S. markets.
"
1504,MO,"The recent soft September non-farm payroll report and negative revisions to the prior two months indicates that the U.S. economy may not be as immune from global cross currents as many have been hoping. Other measures of economic activity, particularly the two ISM surveys, in addition to trade data and inventory build out suggest that GDP growth in Q3 decelerated markedly from the preceding quarter’s fast pace.
"
1505,MO,"Amid a derailed Chinese economy and global issues, the U.S. Federal Reserve also decided to delay its first rate hike. Though the Fed’s decision brought a sense of relief, it also cast a shadow over the timing of the first interest rate increase. While, a number of Fed officials have indicated that it might arrive at the one of the two remaining FOMC meetings this year, but other experts feel that weak job figures along with low inflation in U.S. are likely to delay the hike in Fed interest rates into 2016.
"
1506,MO,"This uncertainty over interest rate hike and global concerns will thus continue to put pressure on consumer staple stocks in the third quarter and full year results.
"
1507,MO,"We also note that consumer spending pattern is changing and consumers are not willing to spend despite benefiting from lower fuel prices and higher wages. While some are busy boosting their savings, some are burdened with higher health care costs and still-tightened credit availability.
"
1508,MO,"In fact, there are many consumer staple stocks, which are still suffering from continued pressure in the face of limited consumer spending, foreign exchange headwinds and declining unit volumes. Other global issues including potential price wars, a competitive environment, political turmoil in Russia, sluggishness in Japan, and struggle in Europe continue to hinder the financial health of these companies.
"
1509,MO,"Hence, investors should be careful while investing in consumers staple stocks in the near term. Given below are certain headwinds that are likely to prevail in the coming months.WEAKNESSES
"
1510,MO,"Slowdown in Emerging Markets
"
1511,MO,"The majority of the global population lives in emerging economies. Due to a slowdown in income and consumption growth, affordability goes down. Though there remains huge opportunity for sales growth in these markets, currently the state of affairs remains volatile. Developing countries like China, Brazil and Mexico are facing economic slowdown. The Middle East, Russia and Ukraine are witnessing continued political and civil unrest resulting in challenging operating conditions. Some developed markets are also facing weakness due to sluggish consumer demand.
"
1512,MO,"For example, consumer product company, Unilever plc (UL  -  Free Report) witnessed some improvement in India and more stable conditions in China in the first half of 2015, but is still struggling with declining volumes in Brazil and a soft economy in Russia.

While the macro-environment is improving in the U.S., Coca-Cola expects challenges in many key emerging/developing markets like Brazil, Russia and China.
"
1514,MO,"Ongoing economic softness and operating challenges in Europe, evolving consumer landscape and an increasingly competitive environment have also been hurting Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc.’s (CCE) top line. Management expects these challenges to persist in future quarters, which, coupled with increasingly strong currency headwinds, will limit revenue growth.
"
1515,MO,"Companies like Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) and Kellogg Co. (K  -  Free Report) are also struggling with decelerating growth in the developing markets and currency headwinds. U.K.-based brewer, Diageo Plc (DEO) also faces macroeconomic headwinds and tough retail conditions in emerging markets.Unfavorable Foreign Currency Impact
"
1516,MO,"Companies which have a significant presence in the emerging markets are being affected by currency headwinds, given the recent weakening of many emerging market currencies against the U.S. dollar. In particular, the recent currency fluctuations in Venezuela, Argentina and Turkey are a major concern.
"
1517,MO,"Foreign exchange is a major headwind for companies like Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (EL), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), General Mills, Inc. (GIS), Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB  -  Free Report), Unilever, PepsiCo Inc.

"
1527,MO,"Stocks have bounced back strongly in recent sessions following the soft September jobs report on hopes of delayed Fed action. These fresh questions about the near-term U.S. economic picture add to existing uncertainty about China and the broader global economy.
"
1528,MO,"These doubts notwithstanding, key areas of the U.S. economy appear to be doing just fine. The housing recovery is still in place and while the factory sector seems to be struggling, the picture on the services side is fairly stable. Cheaper gasoline prices and a rise in wages have increased household wealth, which eventually boosted consumer spending. A number of retailers and fast food chains including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), McDonald's Corp. (TM), Target Corp. (MCD) and The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report) have hiked wages. Consumers are also expecting lower inflation, primarily due to lower gas prices.
"
1529,MO,"While gradual improvement in the macro-economic scenario would act as a growth driver, stabilized commodity costs will also help improve profit margins for certain staples companies. The favorable margins should help offset some of the negative effects that unfavorable currency typically has on earnings. Even if these improvements are modest in absolute terms, they add to the Consumer Staples sector’s existing attractiveness given its defensive attributes.

"
1554,MO,"Income, or yield, is a critical part of any well-balanced portfolio. For the last several years, while rates were falling, that yield could comfortably be found in bonds, which were undergoing a serious bull market. Dividends represent a guaranteed cash payment from a company based on ownership of shares of stock. Earnings can hit speed bumps as business moves in cycles; sector rotation can compress valuations; new competitors can emerge. Through all of that, though, dividends remain, for the most part, guaranteed. Many Experts believe they are crucial to determining the true value of a stock and are currently re-focusing on adding dividends to their investment strategies.Dividends vs. Fixed Income
"
1555,MO,"While the Fed was cutting interest rates, bonds were appreciating in value. The prices of bonds, and other fixed income securities, move inversely with the yield. Bonds are valued as a string of cash payments. As interest rates rise, the premium that your bond offers shrinks compared with other securities. In other words, if you own a bond that guarantees annual payments of $60 on an initial investment of $1000, and interest rates jump to 8%, your bond is no longer paying the coupons that could be received if you were to buy the bond now at 8%. Thus, to sell the bond now, you would have to lower the price. 
"
1556,MO,"Ive mentioned here before that interest rates have likely hit their lows. The Federal Reserve is no longer in a position to lower interest rates further. The bias for future interest rate movement is to the upside. When the Federal Reserve Board met recently, they promised to keep interest rates low for the foreseeable future. Strong economic growth, as demonstrated in the GDP report and all of the most recent manufacturing numbers, put upward pressure on interest rates. The Feds mandate, though, is to target price stability. As such, the temperate inflation numbers allow the Fed to maintain its bias toward low interest rates. Nevertheless, the bond market is moving interest rates up on its own, and dividends are the best way to get yield into your portfolio right now, according to Richard Moroney, editor of Dow Theory Forecasts.
"
1557,MO,"Beyond the return advantage that dividends have due to their insulation from interest rate movement, Moroney is also a fan of them because of the tax cut. Previously, dividends were taxable at the Capital Gains tax rate, but now they will only be taxable at 15%. Further, Moroney says, dividend growth on stocks in the Dow Jones Industrials have grown more consistently and at higher rates than earnings over the last 30 years. Dividends have grown for nine consecutive years, and 26 of the last 30 years, while EPS fell in 10 of those same 30 years.Attractive Dividend Yielders
"
1558,MO,"Altria Group (NYSE: (MO  -  Free Report) ) is both a Buy and a Long Term Buy on Richard Moroneys Focus List. The company has increased its dividend rate at an annualized rate of 14% over the last ten years, and has increased the payout 36 times in the last 34 years. Most recently, the company increased its dividend by 6% in August, and expects discretionary cash flow of $50 billion between now and 2007. Moroney feels the company will follow through on its intentions to use a good bit of that money for share buybacks and dividend increases. Altria does have some legal concerns, but has also achieved several victories in the legal arena. Altria trades at just 10x 2004 earnings, which represents a slight discount to its largest peers.

1559,MO,"Wells Fargo (NYSE: (WFC  -  Free Report) ) is also both a Buy and a Long Term Buy on Richard Moroneys Focus List. The company increased its dividend by half in July and pledged to pay 40%-50% of its earnings in dividends in the future. The company has increased its dividends at a 21% annualized rate over the last ten years, and expects to grow profits in the low double digits for the next 5 years. Wells Fargo has excellent customer relationships, and 80% of its revenue growth over the last three years has been through cross-selling products to its existing customers. This decreases marketing expenses for new customer acquisition. Moroney is confident in the companys ability to continue to execute.DRIP, DRIP Goes the Dividend

1560,MO,"Dividend Reinvestment Plans (DRIPs) are by no means the sexiest investment on Wall Street. They are direct investment plans in which investors can buy shares directly from the company rather than going through a broker or owning shares in mutual funds. The dividends are then used as further investment in shares commission free. Paul Tracy, editor of StreetAuthority Market Advisor , is a huge advocate of diversification and believes that DRIPs are compelling investments as a portion of your invested funds. 
"
1561,MO,"Tracy feels that DRIPs offer certain advantages, including not the least of which that they require very small initial investments. In many cases, you merely need to purchase one share of stock to get going. Some companies allow you purchase DRIP shares at a discount to what the stock trades at on the open market.Recommended DRIP

1562,MO,"Charles Carlson, editor of the DRIP Investor currently recommends Equifax (NYSE: (EFX  -  Free Report) ), which has had a hard time over the last couple of years. The company was above $45 in 1998, but has been trending downward ever since due to a sluggish economy. Recently Carlson says that Equifax has been turning their earnings situation around, and believes that the improving economy will increase demand for Equifaxs credit information and direct marketing services. Equifax recently reported 7% revenue growth and 8% earnings growth on 26% volume growth in its credit reporting business. Carlson feels that the company should continue to improve its profitability and cash flow and has plenty of support very near the present levels. The DRIP has a $500 minimum investment and Carlson rates it a 5 out of 5 star DRIP. Information may be found by calling 888.887.2971.Get Paid to Invest

1563,MO,"One thing that investors have learned over the last several years is that compelling growth stocks can collapse and provide zero returns. Certainly, this can happen to dividend-yielding companies as well, but one thing is for certain. It is virtually impossible to be increasing ones dividend and engaging in accounting scandals to hide earnings shortfalls. Dividends are cash payments from the company and require the commitment of free cash flow. For investors, they offer a virtually guaranteed payment and provide a strong base level return to your portfolio.

1567,MO,"Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) has inked a deal with Parallax, in an attempt to move ahead with its strategy of expanding in the smoke-free products space. Canada-based Parallax, owned by leading pioneers in pulmonary research and medicine, provides low risk alternatives of tobacco.Both the companies will work towards reduction of harmful tobacco products by developing an effective nicotine-delivery system including e- cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and hookah that leverages the most advanced technologies in pulmonary medicine. Prior to this, the company has invested more than $4.5 million since 2008 to develop, substantiate and build manufacturing capacity for a wide range of smoke-free products.Phillip Morris has long been focused on strengthening its reduced risk products (RRPs) category owing to consumers’ rising health consciousness, along with government’s strict regulations on tobacco products.Markedly, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to encourage customers quit smoking. Also, the FDA is bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels. Apart from these, the FDA had earlier announced that tobacco makers must seek  marketing authorization for any tobacco product introduced after Feb 15, 2007. In fact, these hurdles also remain threats to other tobacco players like Altria Group (MO  -  Free Report), Vector Group (VGR  -  Free Report) and British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report) ,Serious health hazards due to cigarette smoking have pushed consumers toward low-risk, RRP’s. In this regard, Phillip Morris has been undertaking plant conversions and transforming them from cigarette to RRPs manufacturing facilities. This was witnessed in the company’s Papastratos factory in Greece, for the production of HEETS, a unit used with IQOS. IQOS, a smokeless cigarette, is counted as one of the leading RRPs in the industry.Also, Phillip Morris’ revenues from RRPs doubled (on a constant-currency basis) to $1,127 million, largely driven by increased sales of IQOS devices in the first quarter of 2018. Notably, RRP revenues during the first quarter represented 16.3% of the company’s overall net revenues.We believe these upsides can help this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company counter the challenges it is facing in the tobacco space and revive the stock that has plunged 30.5% as compared to the industry’s decline of 27.9%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1568,MO,"Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) continues to be whipped by regulatory hurdles surrounding the tobacco industry, which along with rising health consciousness have been denting Phillip Morris’ cigarette volumes. This has caused a 19.3% decline in the company’s shares in the past three months, wider than the industry’s decline of 13%. Nevertheless, the company’s reduced risk products (RRPs) category has been gaining traction, which should help it cushion the stock.What’s Plaguing Phillip Morris Stock?The tobacco space faces challenges as governments around the world are imposing restrictions on tobacco companies, which, in turn, are lowering cigarette consumption. Incidentally, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking. In fact, per court orders, Reynolds American along with Altria Group (MO  -  Free Report) and other cigarette makers have been directed to put up self-critical advertisements on television and newspapers to dissuade customers from smoking.Apart from this, the court wants tobacco companies to admit that cigarettes have been made addictive through the issuance of corrective ads. To add to the woes, the FDA is bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels. Apart from these, FDA had earlier announced that tobacco makers must seek marketing authorization for any tobacco product introduced after Feb 15, 2007. The law was extended by the FDA to include e-cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and hookah, in May 2016. Also, the European Union and the FDA have proposed a ban on menthol in accordance with the Tobacco Control Act.These hurdles, which remain threats to companies like Altria, Vector Group (VGR  -  Free Report) and British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report), caused total cigarette shipment volumes to decline by 5.3% in the first quarter of 2018.Any Scope for Respite?To counter these hurdles, Phillip Morris is pioneering the radical shift from harmful tobacco products to scientific and low-risk alternatives, with investments in research and development in the RRPs category.  In fact, the company’s iQOS, a smokeless cigarette, is counted as one of the leading RRPs in the industry.  During first-quarter 2018, revenues from RRPs doubled (on a constant-currency basis) to $1,127 million, largely driven by increased sales of iQOS devices. Notably, RRP revenues during the first quarter represented 16.3% of the company’s overall net revenues.Further, to cater to the rising demand for products in the RRPs category, Phillip Morris has been undertaking plant conversions, transforming them from cigarette to RRPs manufacturing facilities. This was witnessed in the company’s Papastratos factory in Greece, for the production of HEETS, a unit used with iQOS. Moreover, the marketing and technology sharing agreement between Philip Morris and its peer Altria Group, which is currently under FDA review, is also expected to boost the business of both the companies.Apart from this, strong pricing should also help Phillip Morris fight the hurdles related to soft volumes. The company makes solid attempts to remain afloat and generate revenues with higher cigarette pricing even in the face of unfavorable tax environment and declining cigarette volumes. Though higher pricing might lead to possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases, owing to the addictive nature of cigarettes. Evidently, higher pricing at the combustible tobacco portfolio drove year-over-year net revenue growth during first-quarter 2018. The company continues to expect pricing as the key growth driver in the near term.That said, let’s see if strong pricing and gains from RRPs can actually help the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock witness a turnaround.

1569,MO,"Shares of Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) surged over 5% on Tuesday to hit a new 52-week high of $40.16 per share after it was announced that the social media company is set to join the benchmark S&P 500 index. This might put some added pressure on Twitter stock, but it still looks like a strong buy at the moment. Here’s why.Twitter stock hit its highest point in almost three years on Tuesday on the back of news that the company is set to be added to the S&P 500 index before trading opens on Thursday. Twitter will replace Monsanto MON now that the company’s Bayer (BAYRY  -  Free Report) buyout looks more assured. Therefore, Twitter will soon be a part of many passive funds that track the S&P 500 index (also read: A Quick Overview of the Bayer-Monsanto Merger After DOJ Approval).The company’s volume had climbed to nearly 59 million through late afternoon trading, far above its average of roughly 27 million. Twitter ended Monday with a market value of $28.5 billion, which topped more than 60% percent of companies in the S&P 500. The social media firm also joined tech giants Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), which all hit new 52-week highs on Tuesday.Price Movement Now that we have looked at Twitter’s most recent gains and explained the reasoning behind the surge, let’s take a look at more of the social media company’s current fundamentals that make it look like an attractive stock.Before Tuesday’s gains, shares of Twitter had soared over 118% during the last year, crushing the S&P 500’s roughly 13% climb. Twitter’s year-long surge also tops its industry’s 27% gain—this industry includes the likes of Snap (SNAP  -  Free Report), PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report), and others.Maybe more impressively, shares of Twitter have skyrocketed 160% over the last two years, which outpaces social media behemoth Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) roughly 63% climb. Investors will also note Twitter’s great year to date performance.Growth InitiativesMoving on, Twitter grew its daily active user base by 10% in Q1, while its monthly active user base climbed by 3% to reach 336 million. Twitter’s MAU growth might not seem that significant, adding only 10 million new users over the last year, but every user counts when it comes to growing its top line.The company’s advertising sales—which accounted for roughly 86% of Twitter’s $665 million total Q1 revenues—climbed 21% from $474 million in the year-ago period to $575 million. Meanwhile, the social media company’s international ad revenue surged 52%.Going forward, investors should expect to see Twitter’s adverting business become even more lucrative as it expands its live video reach. Twitter streamed more than 1,300 live broadcasts in Q1 and also announced that it signed more than 30 new partnerships in the first quarter, which includes deals with the likes of Fox Sports FOXA, NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report), Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report), Disney (DIS  -  Free Report)—which includes a ton of ESPN programming—and many more.Outlook Twitter is expected to see its Q2 revenues pop by nearly 22% to hit $698.93 million, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. For the current fiscal year, Twitter revenues are projected to hit $2.93 billion, which would mark a roughly 20% surge.Meanwhile, the company, which reported GAAP profits for the first time in Q4, is expected to see its adjusted quarterly earnings skyrocket 112.5% to $0.17 per share. The company’s fiscal 2018 earnings are also projected to soar by 68% to reach $0.74 per share.Investors should also note that Twitter has received 10 earnings estimate revisions for Q2, with 100% agreement to the upside, all within the last 60 days. Meanwhile, during this same time frame, Twitter earned 13 upward revisions against zero downgrades for fiscal 2018.Bottom LineTwitter has been a great platform to share news instantly for years, but it had struggled to monetize its importance. Now, the company looks ready to profit from its live video push.Twitter is also currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1570,MO,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Altria has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.4, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.1. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Altria’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 20.7. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Altria has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 13.9, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Altria stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Altria has a P/S ratio of about 4.1. This is a bit higher than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Nevertheless, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, MO is toward the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Altria currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Altria a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Altria is 1.6, a level that is marginally lower than the industry average of 1.8. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate.What About the Stock Overall?Though Altria might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of D. This gives MO a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mostly trending lower. The current quarter has seen no estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to five lower, while the full year estimate has seen one upward and five downward revisions in the same time period.As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 2.9% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Altria Group, Inc. Price and Consensus  Altria Group, Inc. Price and Consensus | Altria Group, Inc. QuoteThis somewhat negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineAltria is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among the bottom 21%) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1572,MO,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 2% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is MO due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Altria Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates, Revenues Rise Y/YAltria came out with first-quarter 2018 results that showed consistent strength in the bottom line. The quarterly performance also reflected improved revenues in the smokeless category. Nevertheless, lower cigarette volumes remained a drag.Quarter in DetailsAdjusted earnings of 95 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents. Earnings also surged 30.1% year over year on the back of greater equity earnings from the company’s beer investments related to AB InBev, higher adjusted operating companies income (“OCI”) in the smokeless segments, lower outstanding shares and reduced adjusted tax rate. These positives were partially offset by reduced adjusted OCI in the smokeable unit.Net revenues of the company inched up 0.4% year over year to $6.1 billion, driven by higher revenues in the smokeless segment, largely offset by a drop in the smokeable category. Revenues net of excise taxes improved 1.8% to $4.7 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $4.6 million.Also, in the said period, gross profit improved 5.8% from the prior-year quarter to $2,936 million.Segment DetailsSmokeable: Products Segment: Net revenues in the category dropped 0.8% year over year to $5,414 million, thanks to lower volumes and increased promotional spending. These were mostly offset by higher pricing. Revenues net of excise taxes gained 0.4% year over year to $4,013 million.Total shipment volume in the category fell 4.1% from the prior-year quarter. Also, domestic cigarette shipment volumes dropped 4.2% year over year owing to lower cigarette industry volumes and decline in retail share. This was partially compensated by favorable trade inventory movements.The company has been witnessing declining cigarette volumes for a while now due to stringent government regulations and increased consumer awareness regarding the negative impact of tobacco.Total cigarette retail share declined to 50.3%, representing a 0.7 percentage point slip. This was primarily due to a 0.5 share point drop in Marlboro’s retail share owing to an increase in cigarette excise tax in California.Adjusted OCI for the segment declined 2% to $1,995 million due to lower cigarette volumes, strategic investments and higher resolution expenses. These were partially made up for by higher pricing. Additionally, adjusted OCI margins declined 1.2 percentage points to 49.7%.Smokeless Products: Net revenues in the segment rose 12.7% from the year-ago figure to $525 million owing to voluntary recalls made in 2017 and improved pricing. Also, revenues net of excise taxes advanced 13.1% to $493 million in the quarter.Domestic shipment volumes in the category dipped 0.1% to 195.7 million units, mainly accountable to a decline in Skoal volumes, partly compensated by improved Copenhagen volumes. However, total smokeless products retail share gained 0.1 percentage points to 53.8% in the quarter.Adjusted OCI surged 27.3% to $340 million due to voluntary recalls and higher pricing.  Further, adjusted OCI margin expanded 7.8 percentage points to 69%.Wine: Net revenues in the wine category increased 1.4% year over year to $142 million, driven by greater shipment volumes, partially countered by unfavorable mix. The segment’s revenues, net of excise taxes, inched up 0.7% to $137 million. Wine shipment volume improved 6.1% to 1.8 million cases.However, adjusted OCI dropped 19% to $17 million as a result of employee bonuses, partially countered by higher revenues. Adjusted OCI margin also contracted 3 percentage point to 12.4%.Financial UpdatesAltria ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2,191 million, long-term debt of $13,033 million and total stockholders’ equity of $15,397 million as of Mar 31, 2018.With respect to dividends, during March 2018, Altria’s board hiked its quarterly dividend rate by 6.1% to 70 cents per share. As a result, the company’s annualized dividend rate is currently pegged at $2.80 per share. Further, management is on track to maintain a payout ratio of 80% of its bottom line.During the first quarter, Altria paid dividends worth $1.3 billion. Further, the company repurchased 8 million shares for approximately $513 million in the quarter. As of Mar 31, 2018, Altria had around $505 million remaining under its share repurchase program of $1 billion which is expected to be completed by 2018-end.Consolidation of Manufacturing FacilitiesIn October 2016, Altria announced the consolidation of several of its manufacturing facilities to streamline operations and achieve greater efficiencies. During the first quarter of 2018, the company completed these plans. Such consolidation is expected to provide annualized cost savings of $50 million by 2018-end.OutlookFor 2018, management reiterated its earnings view and continues to expect adjusted earnings in the range of $3.90-$4.03, up 15% to 19% year over year. This view excludes an expected charge of about 7 cents related to tax adjustments and certain special items. Further, the company continues to expect full-year 2018 adjusted effective tax rate of 23-24%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been five revisions lower for the current quarter.Altria Group, Inc. Price and Consensus  Altria Group, Inc. Price and Consensus | Altria Group, Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, MO has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a D. The stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for value and growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise MO has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.

1573,MO,"As consumers look beyond traditional cigarettes, thanks to rising health concerns, Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report) witnesses declining cigarette volumes amid a changing industry landscape. Moreover, FDA has been brandishing a whip on tobacco players through strict marketing and manufacturing regulations. Well, authorities can’t be blamed for undertaking rigorous measures, as smoking has become one of the primary causes of heart diseases and cancer.Such deterrents have caused shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company to fall 22% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 26.8%.Nevertheless, reduced-risk tobacco products (RRPs) are a ray of hope, as consumers are gradually switching to less-fatal alternatives. In fact, this has been a fundamental factor helping Altria to combat industry hurdles. We hope that these factors combined with the company’s frequent shareholder friendly moves will raise investors’ optimism in the stock.  On that note, let’s delve into few of the aspects that Altria has kept its eyes on.Cigarette Volumes Continue to PlungeApart from consumers’ avoidance of harmful tobacco products, strict FDA regulations have been a major deterrent in marring cigarette sales. Per such regulations, it is mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on packets. Also, companies are being directed to put self-critical advertisements to dissuade customers from smoking and acknowledge that cigarettes are addictive in nature. To make matters worse, FDA is bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels.Needless to say, such factors have dampened Altria’s cigarette business for a while. Evidently, in first-quarter 2018, domestic cigarette shipment volumes fell 4.2% year over year, stemming from lower cigarette industry volumes and decline in retail share. As a result, net shipment volumes in the smokeable category fell 4.1%. Also, total cigarette retail share declined to 50.3%, representing a 0.7 percentage point slip from the year-ago quarter’s figures.Apart from Altria, the impacts of tobacco industry headwinds have also been denting the performance of companies like Philip Morris (PM  -  Free Report), British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group (VGR  -  Free Report).  Going Smokeless is the Latest MantraIn an attempt to navigate through troubled waters, Altria has been expanding its presence in the RRPs category. Notably, Altria’s flagship MarkTen and Green Smoke e-vapor products are performing strongly in the smokeless category. In fact, MarkTen is now a leading e-vapor brand in the United States. Backed by its efforts to strengthen RRPs portfolio, revenues from the Smokeless product category advanced 12.7% year over year to $525 million in the first quarter of 2018. This was further buoyed by better pricing and voluntary recalls made in 2017.Additionally, the marketing and technology sharing agreement between Altria and Philip Morris, which is currently under FDA review, is also expected to boost the business of the companies. Further, Altria has been working on receiving FDA approval for the marketing of smokeless products with lower risk claims. In this respect, the company recently submitted a modified risk tobacco product application to FDA for Copenhagen Snuff.Shareholders ValueDespite the hurdles, Altria has not turned away from raising shareholders’ value. To this end, management recently announced an expansion to the existing $1-billion share repurchase program by an additional sum of $1 billion. The company expects the revised $2- billion share repurchase program to be concluded by the end of the second quarter of 2019. Apart from this, during March 2018, Altria’s board hiked quarterly dividend rate by 6.1% to 70 cents per share. As a result, the company’s annualized dividend rate is currently at $2.80. Also, management is on track to maintain a payout ratio of 80% of its bottom line.That said, let’s wait and watch what is ahead for the company and if such efforts can help it stay afloat in the industry.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1574,MO,"Even though the picture appears rosy for the U.S. economy, this favorable economic landscape can divert investors’ focus from the defensive consumer staples zone to other seemingly attractive spaces.This is likely one of the explanations for the sector’s recent underperformance, a trend that can remain in place for quite some time. Stocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are down -4% over the last 12 months, lagging the S&P 500 index’s +14.2% gain over the same time period.Continued Fed tightening and higher interest rates also remain an issue for these stocks. This is so for two reasons. First, Consumer Staples stocks, like Utility stocks, are typically dividend payers which tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. Second, Consumer Staples companies have global operations and remain vulnerable to strength in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar. The dollar has started gaining ground lately on account of the Fed and interest rate backdrop.Also, possibility of a trade war with China continues to raise fears for companies whose business operations are likely to be hit by tariffs.Other than this, the consumer staples space is grappling with rising input costs as well as intense competition, with the latter stemming from consumers’ changing preferences and Amazon’s AMZN ever-growing dominance. This, in turn has created significant pricing pressure, alongside compelling companies to undertake aggressive promotional activities. These factors pose major threats to margins, which have been plateaued for quite some time now.That said, we believe that investors must take stock of the possible obstacles in the consumer staples sector before making any investment decision within it.Input Cost Volatility, Escalated Freight CostsInput costs play a major role in determining the performance of a company. An increase in input cost directly hits the company’s margins and profits. Moreover, any price increase to offset the same may drive consumers away. We note that many Consumer Staples companies are bearing the brunt of high input costs, which remains a concern for the future. Also, the food industry in general is battling a tough transportation landscape due to lower driver availability.This, in turn, has raised freight costs for many players like Smucker’s (SJM  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods (PF  -  Free Report), United Natural UNPI and Sysco SYS, among others. In fact, most of these companies expect higher freight costs to remain a threat to their margins.Moving to higher commodity costs, consumer goods behemoth Colgate has been bearing the brunt of increased commodity and packaging costs, which have been hurting its gross margin. Input cost inflation also remains a cause of concern for players like Campbell Soup CPB, Dean Foods DF, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report), Pinnacle Foods, Church & Dwight CHD and Kimberly-Clark KMB. In fact, Kimberly expects commodity costs to shoot up mainly due to higher prices for several raw materials, including pulp. As for Church & Dwight, it expects both higher commodity and transportation expenses to weigh on gross margin in 2018. Sysco and Pinnacle Foods are other examples that remain troubled by both these headwinds.Intense CompetitionConsumer staples companies face stiff competition with respect to innovation, pricing, brand strength, promotions and responsiveness to evolving consumer trends. This results in lower pricing power and a decline in market share, which in turn compresses margins and earnings. For example, Kimberly-Clark’s diaper segment faces significant competitive activity, which puts the company’s market share at risk.Dean Foods also battles stiff competition, not only with various dairy processors for shelf space, but also with various beverages and nutritional products. Further, the beauty and beauty-related products industry is highly competitive, which remains a challenge for players like Avon Products AVP and Coty COTY. Results of alcohol giants like Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report) and Brown-Forman BF.B may also be somewhat stifled in a cut-throat competitive environment.Strained Margins Many companies in the consumer staples sector have been plagued by strained margins, stemming from various factors. These include tough grocery market conditions, rising input costs, costs associated with meeting consumers’ changing demands and stiff competition that leads to aggressive promotions and price wars. From grocery chains like SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), food companies like Campbell Soup, cosmetic biggies like Estee Lauder to consumer products companies like Church & Dwight, Colgate CL, Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Kimberly-Clark, all remain troubled by squeezed margins.The grocery industry has been grappling with challenges like stiff competition and aggressive promotions, which became more pronounced after Amazon’s takeover of Whole Foods Market. Traditional grocery companies are facing competition from rivals, which are strengthening their franchises and offering alternative outlets for food and other staples. Also, customers are more inclined toward private label products, which are low-cost alternatives to national brands. This, in turn, is hurting food companies.Higher Operating Expenses to Limit ProfitsAs demand for staples is usually consistent, companies strive to increase sales and market share through innovations, promotions and efficient marketing and advertising. Thus, consumer staple companies tend to spend heavily on marketing and advertising. Though advertising strengthens brand appeal and helps to counter competition, it severely hits the profit margins of these companies. Also, efforts to keep up with consumers’ changing needs entail significant costs. In this regard, costs related to e-commerce development and marketing are likely to impact profitability.Companies like Kimberly-Clark, PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) have significantly stepped up their investments in marketing, innovation, R&D, supply chain and capacity additions, which may hinder profits. Pinnacle Foods has also been witnessing escalated marketing costs, and expects these barriers to linger.Emerging Market VolatilityThe majority of the global population is clustered in emerging economies. Thus, food/beverage companies are increasingly investing in developing and emerging markets like India, China and Brazil which boast significant growth potential due to relatively low per-capita consumption. Another reason is the burgeoning middle-class population with rising income levels, which in turn is increasing the demand for convenience food and beverages. Though emerging markets offer strong growth prospects, they are generally volatile due to fluctuating currencies and other structural and political issues. Moreover, any unprecedented event that may impact economic conditions in countries like China, Brazil and Russia remains a threat.Soft VolumesMany consumer staples companies are struggling with declining volumes or soft volume growth, which is hurting their top line. Mondelez’s (MDLZ  -  Free Report) volumes have been weak since 2014 due to volume erosion from higher pricing and category weakness because of lower demand. Another company that has long been battling soft volumes is dairy products player, Dean Foods.Apart from this, growing health and wellness consciousness has resulted in volume declines of carbonated drinks of Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr. Pepper DPS, while it has also been hurting cigarette volumes of bigwigs like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report). Molson Coors has also been posting soft beer volumes in the United States for quite some time now, on account of difficult industry conditions.Government RestrictionsTobacco companies like Altria Group, Philip Morris and British American Tobacco are facing constant government regulations to make consumers aware of the health hazards associated with tobacco products. Well, government authorities have been brandishing the whip on tobacco players as smoking has become one of the primary causes of heart diseases and cancer. Apart from seeking authorization for any new tobacco product, the FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets.Additionally, these companies have been directed to put self-critical advertisements on television and newspapers, particularly emphasizing the addictive nature of cigarettes. To add to the woes, the FDA is bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels. The initiative was proposed in 2017 but was delayed due to ongoing research. If enacted, low nicotine levels will prove to be disastrous for cigarette manufacturing companies.Moreover, increasing regulatory moves have raised awareness amongst consumers regarding the detrimental effects of tobacco consumption, motivating them to quit smoking. These restrictions have lowered cigarette consumption and significantly dented volumes.While this was for tobacco companies, alcohol stocks also remain vulnerable to government regulations. Distilled spirits are subject to excise tax in various countries. Thus, rising fiscal pressure in the United States, European and emerging markets may lead to increasing risk of a potential excise tax on spirits by governments of the respective countries.Bottom LineThough the consumer staples industry is faced with a number of problems, does the sector have anything to offer to short-term investors?Check out our latest Consumer Staples Outlook for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective and the trend in this important sector of the economy.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1575,MO,"Demand for everyday-use products created by operators in the Consumer Staples space doesn’t tend to fluctuate a lot, but it is nevertheless exposed to macroeconomic forces at the margins. As such, the outlook for this space perks up as the outlook for the U.S. and global economy improves.The outlook for the U.S. economy has been favorable for the last several years, with the recent tax legislation expected to add to the longevity of the current U.S. expansion cycle. In addition to the indirect benefits to Consumer Staples companies from the tax cuts, these companies also stand to benefit directly from the legislation, as reflected in the improving earnings outlook for many companies. That said, Consumer Staples operators tend to be global in their operations and as such don’t benefit to the same extent from U.S. tax law changes as the more domestic companies. With growth hard to come by for companies in this mature space, Consumer Staples players have to remain focused on squeezing more out of their operations and coming out with revenue-boosting initiatives, which mainly include efforts to keep pace with the changing consumer patterns.On that note, let’s delve deeper in some of the major growth-driving strategies of the space.Strengthening Product Portfolio via Strategic Alliances, Buyouts Consumer staples companies are regularly undertaking both domestic and international acquisitions to expand their product lines and gain access to new markets. Some of these are also forming partnerships, mostly with larger and better-known companies, to strengthen their distribution networks, diversify portfolios, expand their reach and enhance market positioning. Notably, leveraging each other’s efficiencies creates significant synergies for companies that go for M&A activities.Mergers of Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report) with packaged meat producer The Hillshire Brands (in August 2014); tobacco giants Reynolds American and Lorillard (in June 2015); food giants Kraft Foods Group, Inc. KHC and H.J. Heinz Company (in July 2015) and consumer goods companies Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Jarden (in 2016) were the most talked about deals. Belgium-based brewer Anheuser Busch InBev’s BUD buyout of SABMiller in October 2016 also created a buzz in the beverage industry. Apart from this, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report) acquired SABMiller plc’s 58% stake in MillerCoors, which made the former the third-largest brewer in the world, after Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken.Cost Cutting and Restructuring InitiativesMost consumer staples companies are implementing cost-reduction initiatives to boost profits. In the latter half of 2017, Tyson Foods announced a Financial Fitness Program, with the objectives of enhancing operating efficiency, reducing overheads and fuelling bottom-line performance. Colgate CL has also been benefiting from its Global Growth and Efficiency Program, which focuses on reducing structural costs in order to improve gross and operating profit, standardizing processes to improve the decision-making procedure and enhance its market share worldwide.Additionally, Sysco’s (SYY  -  Free Report) core strategies for 2020 include plans to optimize business and achieving operational efficacy. We also commend Kimberly Clark’s KMB 2018 Global Restructuring & Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere (FORCE) programs, which are expected to generate cost savings of more than $2 billion over the next four years. Companies like McCormick MKC, Coca-Cola KO, Molson Coors, Mondelez International MDLZ, Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report), Kellogg K and many others have also been benefiting from significant cost savings and restructuring initiatives to boost earnings.Focus on InnovationInnovation remains the guiding principle of consumer staples companies as it enables them to enhance brand appeal through product differentiation and capture market share across all regions and categories. Thus, companies put a lot of thrust on innovation to upgrade their brands and create differentiated value propositions. Notably, constant innovations supported by efficient marketing are essential for consumer staples companies to stay ahead of competition.As evidence, novelty has been a driving force for consumer product giants like The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) and Colgate-Palmolive, and cosmetic majors like Estee Lauder EL. These companies constantly come up with new products that suit changing consumer trends, to tap demand and boost revenues. Also, major food companies like Smucker and Campbell Soup CPB, alcohol stocks like Brown-Forman BF.B and Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report), and even tobacco players like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) have been adding new products to gain competitive edge and augment market share.Exiting Underperforming Units to Enhance OperationsApart from growing their businesses through buyouts, companies also remain focused on improving their product portfolios through divestitures. Offloading underperforming operations enables the companies to concentrate on the core and profitable areas.For example, as part of its strategic business review following its merger with Jarden, Newell Brands announced plans to sell nearly 10% of its current portfolio, including a major chunk of its Tools segment. This highlights the company’s focus on simplifying its operating structure, alongside highlighting its commitment toward making prudent investments in areas with higher growth potential. Similarly, Unilever (UL  -  Free Report) announced plans to sell its shrinking Spreads business to KKR (in December 2017) to shift concentration on fast-growing products.Adopting E-Commerce Mantra: The Need of the HourWith technology having advanced by leaps and bounds, online shopping has become the order of the day. Thanks to various mobile apps and dot.com business lines, shopping for anything is literally on consumers’ finger-tips. Consumers’ rapid shift to e-marketplace has compelled companies to adopt the e-commerce mantra. Companies like United Naturals (UNFI  -  Free Report), SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), Campbell Soup and Estee Lauder among others, are striving to enhance e-commerce space, through investments in technology and infrastructure.Driven by these efforts, United Natural Foods’ e-commerce sales jumped almost 28.9% in the second quarter. As for SUPERVALU, the company’s contract with Instacart, along with endeavors to upgrade website and mobile applications underscore its knack to enhance consumer shopping experiences.Transition to Health and Wellness ProductsAs consumer preference is the life blood of Consumer Staples, companies have to adapt to evolving trends to stay strong in the industry. A key trend over the last few years has been the desire for natural and organic products, prompting many players in the space to come out with health and wellness offerings. This is the case with almost all industries in the sector.Apart from this, tobacco companies like Altria and Reynolds American are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have resorted to less harmful alternatives like electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). To cater to changing consumer preference, Philip Morris launched the much talked about IQOS, a smokeless cigarette in November 2014, aiming to lead the tobacco industry’s push into reduced-risk products. IQOS is anticipated to boost market share and offset declining volumes in traditional cigarette business over the long term.Additionally, rising consumer awareness regarding the harmful impact of toxic chemicals has been driving the market share for organic personal care products too. Consequently, players like Unilever are making solid progress in the natural and organic products category. This is evident from its deal to buy Schmidt’s Naturals that specializes in personal care products such as deodorants, toothpaste and bar soaps. Clearly, these robust efforts are expected to boost the companies’ top line in the future.Clearly, the consumer staples space offers plenty of reasons to be optimistic about it over the long term. So how about investing in the space right now?Check out our latest Consumer Staples Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1576,MO,"Altria Group Inc.’s (MO  -  Free Report) recently-reported first-quarter 2018 results showed continued strength in the bottom line. The quarterly performance also reflected improved revenues in the smokeless category. Nevertheless, lower cigarette volumes remained a drag.  Quarter in DetailsAdjusted earnings of 95 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents. Earnings also surged 30.1% year over year on the back of greater equity earnings from the company’s beer investments related to AB InBev (BUD  -  Free Report), higher adjusted operating companies income (“OCI”) in the smokeless segments, lower outstanding shares and reduced adjusted tax rate. These positives were partially offset by reduced adjusted OCI in the smokeable unit.Net revenues of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company inched up 0.4% year over year to $6.1 billion, driven by higher revenues in the smokeless segment, largely offset by a drop in the smokeable category. Revenues net of excise taxes improved 1.8% to $4.7 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $4.6 million.Also, in the said period, gross profit improved 5.8% from the prior-year quarter to $2,936 million.Altria Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Altria Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Altria Group, Inc. QuoteSegment DetailsSmokeable Products Segment: Net revenues in the category dropped 0.8% year over year to $5,414 million, thanks to lower volumes and increased promotional spending. These were mostly offset by higher pricing. Revenues net of excise taxes gained 0.4% year over year to $4,013 million.Total shipment volume in the category fell 4.1% from the prior-year quarter. Also, domestic cigarette shipment volumes dropped 4.2% year over year owing to lower cigarette industry volumes and decline in retail share. This was partially compensated by favorable trade inventory movements.  The company has been witnessing declining cigarette volumes for a while now due to stringent government regulations and increased consumer awareness regarding the negative impact of tobacco. Such factors have been weighing on investors’ confidence in the stock. Evidently, shares of the company have plunged 22% in a year, compared to the industry’s decline of 23.4%.Total cigarette retail share declined to 50.3%, representing a 0.7 percentage point slip. This was largely due to a 0.5 share point drop in Marlboro’s retail share owing to an increase in cigarette excise tax in California.Adjusted OCI for the segment declined 2% to $1,995 million due to lower cigarette volumes, strategic investments and higher resolution expenses. These were partially made up for by higher pricing. Additionally, adjusted OCI margins went down 1.2 percentage points to 49.7%.Smokeless Products: Net revenues in the segment rose 12.7% from the year-ago figure to $525 million owing to voluntary recalls made in 2017 and improved pricing. Also, revenues net of excise taxes advanced 13.1% to $493 million in the quarter.Domestic shipment volumes in the category dipped 0.1% to 195.7 million units, mainly accountable to a decline in Skoal volumes, partly compensated by improved Copenhagen volumes. However, total smokeless products retail share gained 0.1 percentage points to 53.8% in the quarter.Adjusted OCI surged 27.3% to $340 million due to voluntary recalls and higher pricing.  Further, adjusted OCI margin expanded 7.8 percentage points to 69%.Wine: Net revenues in the wine category increased 1.4% year over year to $142 million, driven by greater shipment volumes, partially countered by unfavorable mix. The segment’s revenues, net of excise taxes, inched up 0.7% to $137 million. Wine shipment volume improved 6.1% to 1.8 million cases.However, adjusted OCI dropped 19% to $17 million as a result of employee bonuses, partially countered by higher revenues. Adjusted OCI margin also contracted 3 percentage point to 12.4%.Financial UpdatesAltria ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2,191 million, long-term debt of $13,033 million and total stockholders’ equity of $15,397 million, as of Mar 31, 2018.With respect to dividends, during March 2018, Altria’s board hiked its quarterly dividend rate by 6.1% to 70 cents per share. As a result, the company’s annualized dividend rate currently stands at $2.80 per share. Further, management is on track to maintain a payout ratio of 80% of its bottom line.During the first quarter, Altria paid dividends worth $1.3 billion. Further, the company repurchased 8 million shares for approximately $513 million in the quarter. As of Mar 31, 2018, Altria had around $505 million remaining under its share repurchase program of $1 billion which is expected to be completed by end-2018.Consolidation of Manufacturing FacilitiesIn October 2016, Altria had announced the consolidation of several of its manufacturing facilities to streamline operations and achieve greater efficiencies. During the first quarter of 2018, the company completed these plans. Such consolidation is expected to provide annualized cost savings of $50 million by 2018-end.OutlookFor 2018, management has reiterated its earnings view and continues to expect adjusted earnings in the range of $3.90-$4.03, up 15% to 19% year over year.

1578,MO,"The multi-million Zacks Tobacco industry has been treading on shaky ground, thanks to stringent FDA regulations to curb cigarette consumption. Well, authorities can’t be blamed for brandishing the whip on tobacco players as smoking has become one of the primary causes of heart diseases and cancer. However, in an attempt to navigate rough waters, a few tobacco players have resorted to reduced-risk tobacco products (RRPs), a less fatal alternative to cigarettes.Headwinds Plaguing Tobacco MajorsCigarette sales have been deteriorating, due to several marketing regulations imposed by the FDA. Apart from seeking authorization for any new tobacco product, companies are also required to mandatorily use precautionary labels on cigarette packets. Additionally, these companies have been directed to put self-critical advertisements on television and newspapers, particularly emphasizing the addictive nature of cigarettes.To add to the woes, the FDA is now bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels. The initiative was proposed in 2017 but was delayed, thanks to ongoing research and opposition from several interest groups. If acted upon, lowering nicotine levels will undoubtedly be disastrous for cigarette manufacturing companies. Moreover, increasing regulatory moves have raised awareness amongst consumers regarding the detrimental effects of smoking.The impacts of such initiatives are clearly visible on receding cigarette sales volumes of tobacco industry majors such as Altria (MO  -  Free Report), Philip Morris (PM  -  Free Report), British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group (VGR  -  Free Report). Also, owing to these hurdles, the tobacco industry (ranked among the bottom 12% out of more than 250 Zacks industries) has dropped 6.3% in the past six months, as against the S&P 500 that gained 3.2%.On the flip side, tobacco companies have been exploring opportunities provided by RRPs. Incidentally, Philip Morris, one of the companies leading this revolutionary shift to RRPs along with Altria, has been investing to strengthen their smoke-free products portfolio.Let’s take a closer look at the performance of these companies and how they are placed amid the ongoing chaos as well as the efforts they have been undertaking to survive.A Look Into Major Tobacco Players PerformancePhilip Morris International Inc.’s cigarette shipment volumes declined 2.1% during the fourth quarter of 2017. This marked the company’s fourth-consecutive period of earnings and sales miss. Moreover, the company’s shares declined 9.1% over the past six months, wider than the industry’s fall.In an effort to boost performance, Philip Morris has been radically expanding its RRPs portfolio. The company seems to stand firm on its ambitions to develop a smoke free future, evident from its recent move to completely transform one of its cigarette production facilities in Greece for the manufacture of HEETS — a unit used with iQOS. In fact, with investments close to $4.5 billion since 2008 for undertaking research and product development in the RRPs category, the company is pioneering the radical shift from harmful tobacco products to scientific and low-risk product alternatives.Buoyed by such efforts, management expects earnings for 2018 in the range of $5.20-$5.35, depicting a growth of 34-38% over the prior-year figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earning for 2018 also falls within management’s guidance and is pegged at $5.27. Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company carries a VGM Score of B and has a long-term growth rate of 10.1%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Altria Group, Inc. saw its domestic cigarette volumes decline almost 8.9% year over year during the fourth-quarter 2017. Moreover, due to consistent declines in the cigarette category, Altria’s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in eight out of the last 10 quarters. The company carries a VGM Score of D.Additionally, dismal cigarette sales performance led to Altria’s shares to decline 0.7% in the past six months, which compares favorably with the industry’s fall. Well, this Zacks Rank #3 company has been managing to stay afloat on the back of its Smokeless product category. In fact, revenues in this category advanced 11.1% in the fourth quarter. Moreover, in e-vapor, Altria’s subsidiary Nu Mark LLC continues to boost MarkTen volume, which expanded 60% in 2017. Altria’s marketing and technology agreement with Philip Morris is also expected to boost the businesses of the companies. Per the agreement, Phillip Morris will market Altria’s MarkTen e-cigarettes internationally. Also, Altria will distribute two of Phillip Morris’ heated tobacco products in the United States.Buoyed by the prospects in the smokeless category, management expects 2018 earnings to surge 5-19% year over year to $3.90-$4.03. The Zacks Consensus for 2018 earnings trended upward over the past 30 days and is pegged at $4.01. The company also has a long-term growth rate of 8.6%.Another tobacco industry major, British American Tobacco plc, saw its shares decline almost 8.2% over the past six months. Moreover, the company’s preliminary results for 2017 depict a decline of 2.6% in organic cigarette volumes. The company carries a VGM Score of D.Nevertheless, this Zacks Rank # 3 company has been gaining significantly from the acquisition of Reynolds American Inc. British American has also been striving to expand in the RRPs realm with its Next Generation Products lineup.Vector Group Ltd., a Florida-based tobacco company, witnessed a decline 2.8% in tobacco unit sales volumes during the fourth quarter of 2017. The company, which has seen its shares dip 1% in the past six months, carries a VGM score of F. Although Vector Group has not ventured out into RRPs, the company relies upon the real estate segment to offset tobacco sales related hurdles.Wrapping UpWhile RRPs seem to be one of the most viable options for tobacco players to offset declining cigarette volumes, there are other factors that need to be taken care of. Advancements in the reduced risk category are yet to completely offset cigarette sales decline for most of the aforementioned companies. That said, let’s wait and watch what lies ahead for companies operating in the tobacco space and what additional efforts they can undertake to sustain in the industry.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

1579,MO,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Altria Group (MO  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 10.5% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is MO due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Altria Q4 Earnings Improve Y/Y, Makes Management ChangesAltria came out with fourth-quarter 2017 results, wherein adjusted earnings of 91 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents. Also, earnings surged 33.8% year over year, on the back of greater equity earnings from the company’s beer investments related to AB InBev, higher adjusted OCI in the smokeable and smokeless segments, lower outstanding shares and reduced adjusted tax rate.However, net revenues fell more than 2% to $6,083 million in the quarter, owing to soft net revenues in the smokeable products segments. Revenues net of excise taxes remained almost flat at $4,696 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $4,793 million.Management stated that Altria remains focused on enhancing its non-combustible product portfolio for authorization by the FDA.In e-vapor, Altria’s subsidiary Nu Mark LLC continues to boost MarkTen volume, which expanded 60% in full-year 2017, courtesy of greater distribution and category growth. MarkTen’s full-year 2017 national retail market share was approximately 12.5% in mainstream retail channels. Further, it forms nearly 70% of e-vapor volumes in those channels.The company also made considerable progress in smokeless and other oral nicotine-containing products. Also, in heated tobacco, Phillip Morris remains committed toward making plans to commercialize IQOS, which it will exclusively sell in the U.S. upon FDA’s approval.Segment DetailsSmokeable Products Segment: Revenues net of excise taxes dipped 1% year over year to $3,935 million, due to soft volumes that was somewhat compensated by better pricing and lower promotions. Domestic cigarette shipment volumes fell 8.9% year over year, stemming from lower cigarette industry volumes, unfavorable trade inventory movements and decline in retail share. On the other hand, shipment volumes for cigars rose 7.9% in the quarter.Total cigarette retail share declined to 50.3%, representing a 0.8 percentage point slip. This was largely due to a 0.7 share point drop in Marlboro’s retail share stemming from intense competition and increase in cigarette excise tax in California.Adjusted OCI increased 5.7% to $1,964 million, while margins jumped 3.2 percentage points to 49.9%. This could be attributable to lower SG&A, better pricing and reduced promotions.Smokeless Products: Revenues net of excise taxes advanced 11.1% to $542 million in the quarter. This was driven by better pricing and reduced promotions, partly countered by soft volumes. Domestic shipment volumes dipped 0.6% to 211.9 million units, mainly accountable to a decline in Skoal volumes, partly compensated by improved Copenhagen volumes. Total smokeless products retail share contracted 1.1 percentage points to 53.6% in the quarter, due to lower share of Skoal.Adjusted OCI surged 27.2% to $369 million and margins expanded 8.7 percentage points to 68.1%. This was backed by the same factors that drove OCI at the smokeable unit.Wine: The segment’s revenues, net of excise taxes, tumbled 8.8% year over year at $219 million. Results were impacted by trade inventory reductions, heightened competition and sluggish growth of premium wine. Wine shipment volume also decreased 9.75 to 2.8 million cases.Ste. Michelle’s adjusted OCI improved 1.6% to $65 million, mainly accountable to better pricing, reduced expenses and favorable mix partly countered by lower volumes. Adjusted OCI margin expanded 3 percentage point to 29.7%.Financial UpdatesIn December 2017, Altria declared a quarterly cash dividend of 66 cents per share. During the fourth quarter and 2017, Altria paid dividends worth $1.3 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively. Further, management remains on track to maintain a payout ratio of 80% of its bottom line. Further, the company repurchased 8.4 million shares for approximately $558 million during the fourth quarter. As of Dec 31, 2017, Altria had approximately $18 million remaining under its share repurchase program of $4 billion, which was, however, concluded in January 2018.Consequently, management announced a new buyback authorization of about $1 billion, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2018.Consolidation of Manufacturing Facilities & Management ChangeIn October 2016, Altria announced the consolidation of several of its manufacturing facilities to streamline operations and achieve greater efficiencies. The consolidation, scheduled to be completed by first-quarter 2018 is expected to deliver approximately $50 million in cost savings.Concurrently, Altria announced the retirement of Chairman and CEO — Marty Barrington, which is expected to take place later this year. Management also announced Howard Willard as the new Chairman and CEO, who will assume the role on May 17, 2018.OutlookManagement expects adjusted earnings for 2018 in a range of $3.90-$4.03, up 15% to 19% year over year. This excludes an expected charge of about 9 cents related to tax adjustments.Altria expects full-year 2018 adjusted effective tax rate to range 23-24%.Further, capital expenditures in 2018 are estimated in a band of $200 million to $250 million, while depreciation and amortization costs are anticipated to be roughly $210 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision lower for the current quarter.Altria Group Price and Consensus Altria Group Price and Consensus | Altria Group QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, MO has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with an A.  The stock was  allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the fifth quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F.

1580,MO,"Philip Morris International Inc.’s (PM  -  Free Report) not-so-impressive first-quarter 2018 results gave investors cold feet, yesterday.  Well, Philip Morris’ results were mainly dampened by declining shipment volumes across some of the key market regions, thanks to lower cigarette sales.The hurdles and their persistence were evident from investors’ bearish stance on the stock that fell 15.6% yesterday, slipping to a 52-week low of $83.50 and closing at $85.64. Per sources, this single day plunge counts amongst its biggest in almost 10 years. Apart from giving a jolt to Phillip Morris’ investors, softness in the cigarettes category also sent ripples of fear in the industry, dragging shares of other major players as well.We note that the Zacks Tobacco industry has been sailing on rough seas, due to regulatory hurdles in the form of limitations on marketing, anti-smoking campaigns and higher excise duties. These factors have taken a serious toll on cigarette sales volumes, globally. Apart from this, rising health consciousness among consumers around the world lowered cigarette consumption. Indeed, such limitations have hindered the growth of the Tobacco industry that lost close to 17% in the past six months, versus the S&P 500 Index’s gain of 5.3%. Coming back to yesterday’s debacle, let’s delve into the factors that led to such a nightmare for the company.What Hit Philip Morris?Disappointingly, during the first quarter of 2018, Philip Morris’ total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume fell 2.3% to 173.8 billion units, caused by declines across most regions other than South & Southeast Asia Region (S&SA) and the East Asia & Australia Region. In fact, all regions other than S&SA witnessed substantial decline in cigarette shipment volumes. So much so that even doubled-up increase in heated tobacco unit wasn’t enough to pare the declines witnessed in cigarettes, on an overall basis.Further, the company’s operating income slipped 2.7% on a constant-currency (cc) basis, due to adverse volume/mix, especially in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), as well as escalated marketing, research and administration expenses incurred in respect of reduced risk products (RRPs). These hurdles couldn’t be fully offset by favorable pricing. Also, adjusted operating margin, at cc, fell 4.0 points to 35.8%. Further, the company’s currency-neutral bottom line dipped 1% in the first quarter, from 98 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Meanwhile, Philip Morris’ net revenues surged year on year. Expected gains from tax reforms also encouraged management to raise bottom-line view for 2018. However, these factors were not enough to placate investors who were gravely concerned with poor shipment volumes that led to the company’s fifth consecutive top-line miss.Apart from this, management’s comments regarding the ongoing performance of certain regions  are likely to make them jittery. Incidentally, management continues to stay apprehensive regarding soft volumes in GCC, difficult pricing in Russia and sluggish sales in Japan.Will Other Tobacco Players Follow Suit?Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report), slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, could not escape the domino effect of Philip Morris’s weak volumes. Evidently, Altria’s shares tumbled close to 6.1% yesterday. Like Philip Morris, Altria too has been grappling with receding shipment volumes in the smokeable segment. Notably, volumes in the segment declined 2.6%, 2.7%, 6.1% and 8.7%, respectively, in the preceding four quarters. Moreover, due to persistent declines in the cigarette category, Altria’s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in eight out of the last 10 quarters. The company carries a VGM Score of F.Moreover, British American Tobacco plc. (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group Ltd. (VGR  -  Free Report) saw their shares decline 4.7% and 1.1%, respectively, during yesterday’s trading session. British American Tobacco’s organic cigarette volumes declined 2.6%, which was reflected in its preliminary results in February 2018. Vector Group, carrying a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) also witnessed a decline of 2.8% in tobacco unit sales volumes in the fourth quarter of 2017 results. The company carries a VGM Score of D. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Any Hopes of a Revival Ahead?Philip Morris, Altria and British American Tobacco, all carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have been sternly focusing on the growth of RRPs. In fact, RRPs are rapidly gaining traction, considering their less detrimental impacts on health. With prolonged focus in this category, Philip Morris is pioneering the radical shift from harmful tobacco products to scientific and low-risk product alternatives. The company carries a VGM Score of B and has a long-term growth rate of 10.1%.Altria has been radically expanding its RRPs portfolio. Furthermore, Altria’s marketing and technology agreement with Philip Morris is expected to boost the businesses of the companies. British American Tobacco has also been striving to expand in the RRPs realm with its Next Generation Products lineup. Although Vector Group has not ventured out into RRPs, the company relies upon the real estate segment to offset tobacco sales related hurdles.Wrapping it up, RRPs seem to be one of the most viable options for companies to stay afloat in the tobacco industry (ranked among the top 38% out of more than 256 Zacks industries). However, such advancements are yet to completely offset cigarette sales declines, as the smokeable category accounts for a considerable chunk of revenues for most of these players. That said, let’s wait and watch what lies ahead for the players in the tobacco space and whether their efforts will revive the lost sheen in the stock market.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

1581,MO,"Wall Street should be rejoicing right now, with investors getting the much-wished-for corporate and income tax cuts. Moreover, the economy has been growing at a healthy annual pace of 3% for three straight quarters now. On the contrary, there is widespread panic in Wall Street, with all the major indices officially entering the correction territory that has extinguished the nearly nine-year bull run.Rising treasury yields has diminished the appeal of stocks, especially with valuations hovering at historically high levels. Bond yields moved north on expectations of an interest rate hike, courtesy of a possible uptick in inflation on stronger wage growth.Investors also pointed that stocks suffered a bloodbath from the unwinding of trades linked to bets on volatility staying low. Add to this the political worries emanating from issues related to a second government shutdown, and stocks are likely to continue their free fall.Given the turbulence, investing in low beta defensive companies seems prudent. Such stocks provide risk-adjusted returns, consistent dividend and steady earnings regardless of the state of the equity market.Bears Rip Stocks As the Market Enters CorrectionBears dominated the market on Feb 8, as it showed more signs of institutional selling. The broader S&P 500 slumped 100.66 points, or 3.8%, to 2,581, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1,032.89 points, or 4.2%, to close at 23,860.46, its second worst point decline in history. Both the indices are now officially into the correction territory, down more than 10% from the recent all-time high reached in January.In fact, the equity market is witnessing its first genuine bout of gyration in years, with the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge registering its largest percentage jump in history. VIX rose 14.4% to close the day at 31.72. Any reading above the 20 mark indicates bearish outlook in the equity market, but a reading of greater than 30 shows a high level of investor fear.Here’s What Usually Happens After a CorrectionThe equity market was on a confirmed uptrend until this week. Stocks were in such a free fall that on Feb 5, major indices undercut important support areas. All of them fell through their 50-day moving averages, including many leading stocks, Apple APPL for instance, undercutting its 200-day line.The key indices are now “officially” into correction territory, with things getting worse. According to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report), if this is a bull market correction then volatility is expected to persist for another four months. But, if the loss deepens into a bear market, or a drop of 20% from the recent all-time high, it could be 22 months of pain for investors.Why Did the Stock Market Crash?Continuous rise in bond yields rattled the equity market, resulting in a downturn. Investors pulled money out of stocks as an uptick in bond yields made equities less attractive by increasing their opportunity cost.Record rise in wage growth sparked fears of inflation and led investors to believe that the Fed will hike rates more times than anticipated. Wages grew at the fastest pace in January in more than eight-and-a-half years. Average hourly wages increased 9 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.74. This helped the average year-on-year hourly earnings to rise to 2.9%, the highest since June 2009.Wages grew at the fastest pace since the end of the last decade on a tighter labor market, tax cut policy and a rise in the minimum wage threshold in several states. Minimum wage has been raised in 18 states in January, which had a positive impact on 4.5 million workers, per the Economic Policy Institute.How to Prepare for the PullbackAs the markets seem to be plagued with widespread uncertainty, including stretched valuations, defensive stocks seem to be the safest investment option. Such stocks are generally non-cyclical, or companies whose business performance and sales are not highly correlated with the activities in the larger market. Their products are in constant demand irrespective of market volatility and such names include companies from the utilities and consumer staples sectors.Utilities are deemed defensive stocks as electricity, gas and water are essentials. Food, beverage and tobacco companies are true defensive plays as demand for such staple stocks remains unaltered during market gyrations.5 Solid ChoicesWe have, thus, selected five solid stocks from the aforementioned defensive sectors that boast a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Further, only low-beta stocks from such defensive companies have been selected. After all, low-beta stocks are the ones that are less correlated to the index and tend to be less volatile. In this case, a low beta ranges from 0 to 1.UtilitiesBT Group (BT  -  Free Report) provides communications services worldwide, including the United States. It has a beta of 0.97. The company has a dividend yield of 5.9%, while its five-year average dividend yield is 7.2%. The stock, which is part of the Diversified Communication Services industry, is expected to give a solid return of 11.5% and 3.2% in the current quarter and year, respectively.National Fuel Gas Company (NFG  -  Free Report) operates as a diversified energy company. It has a beta of 0.88. The company has a dividend yield of 3.3%, while its five-year average dividend yield is 2.6%. The company, which is part of the Utility - Gas Distribution industry, is expected to give a steady return of 3.9% and 7.3% in the current and next quarter, respectively.Consumer StaplesKimberly-Clark (KMB  -  Free Report), together with its subsidiaries, manufactures and markets personal care, consumer tissue, and professional products worldwide. It has a beta of 0.66. The company has a dividend yield of 3.5%, while its five-year average dividend yield is 4.4%. The company, which is part of the Consumer Products - Staples industry, is expected to give a steady return of 8.3% and 12% in the current quarter and year, respectively. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Altria Group (MO  -  Free Report) manufactures and sells cigarettes, smokeless products, and wine in the United States. It has a beta of 0.53. The company has a dividend yield of 2%, while its five-year average dividend yield is 11.3%. The company, which is part of the Tobacco industry, is expected to give a solid return of 28.8% and 16.9% in the current quarter and year, respectively.The Estée Lauder Companies (EL  -  Free Report) manufactures and markets skin care, makeup, fragrance, and hair care products worldwide. It has a beta of 0.74. The company has a dividend yield of 1.1%, while its five-year average dividend yield is 46.2%. The stock, which is part of the Cosmetics industry, is expected to yield a solid return of 15.4% and 25.7% in the current quarter and year, respectively.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1582,MO,"Benchmarks closed in the green on Wednesday after two straight days of declines. Boeing reached an all-time high after releasing upbeat fourth-quarter earnings results and a strong full-year projection, which in turn boosted key indexes. However, markets lost some of their gains after the Fed’s stated that inflation was likely to reach its desired level in the medium term and projected gradual increase in key rates. Although, key indexes finished marginally higher on the last trading day of January, all of them registered record gains for the month. While, the Dow and the S&P 500 registered their best monthly performance since March 2016, the tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its highest monthly increase since October 2015.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.3%, to close at 26,149.39. The S&P 500 rose 0.1% to close at 2,823.81. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,411.48, gaining 0.1%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 12% to close at 13.01. A total of around 8.05 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 7.18 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.14 -to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.61-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.What Moved the Benchmarks?Shares of The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) rose 4.9% settling at its best levels ever, after the aircraft manufacturer posted fourth-quarter earnings per share and revenues that beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. (Read More)For the full year, Boeing’s operating profit jumped 76% year-over-year to $10.3 billion. Net earnings for the company climbed 67% from 2016 to $8.2 billion in 2017. Also, the company’s commercial airplanes' 2018 delivery expectations are reiterated at a record level of 810 to 815 airplanes, which was higher than 2017’s total deliveries of 763 aircrafts.Upbeat fourth quarter earnings results and strong 2018 earnings and airplanes delivery outlook contributed to Boeing’s incredible performance. On Wednesday, Boeing contributed 114 points to the blue-chip index, Dow and was one of the best performers among all the S&P 500 companies.Additionally, Electronic Arts Inc.’s (EA  -  Free Report) shares advanced 7% after the gaming company reported fiscal third-quarter non-GAAP earnings of $2.22 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.18. (Read More)Advanced Micro Devices, Inc’s (AMD  -  Free Report) increased 6.8% after it posted fourth-quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.08 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.05 per share. Both the tech companies were biggest contributor to S&P 500’s gains during the day. (Read More)Fed’s Policy Statement in FocusOn Wednesday, the Federal Reserve opted to leave benchmark rates unchanged within the 1.25%-1.5% range. In its two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) policy statement following the meeting ended Jan 31, the Fed indicated that economic activity has increased at a “solid rate” and will continue to grow at a “moderate pace.”Additionally, per the statement, labor market remains strong, while inflation will likely “move up” in 2018 and will reach the desired 2% rate in the “medium term.” The FOMC also said federal funds rate is likely to increase at a “gradual” pace in coming months.Rising rate hike prospects as early as Fed’s next policy meeting in March weighed on investor sentiment and limited some of Wednesday’s gains. Higher rate environment and optimism of steady economic growth and higher inflation weighed on bond prices.Lower bond prices supported the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which was at 2.722% on Wednesday, hovering near its highest settlement in almost four years. Also, 2-year yield was at around 2.15%. High treasury yields also weighed on broader equity markets to a certain extent.According to ADP’s (ADP  -  Free Report) private sector payrolls report for January, 234,000 new jobs were created during the month, Further, December’s results were revised downward by 8000 jobs, but still tallied at 242,000. Separately, according to the National Association of Realtors, pending home sales for the month of December increased 0.5%, better than November’s reading of a rise of 0.3%.Monthly RoundupFor the month, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq increased 5.8%, 5.6% and 7.4%, respectively. The passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which permanently slashes corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%, last December contributed to January’s gains. Additionally, in its Beige Book, the Fed provided an encouraging outlook about the U.S. economy, which in turn also boosted investor sentimentMoreover during the month, the Senate gave its consent to pass a short-term spending Bill that ends the recent government shutdown. Additionally, upbeat fourth-quarter earnings season, which include a very strong revenue momentum, an above-average proportion of positive surprises and an unusually positive revisions trend for the current and coming quarters, also contributed to strong market performance.Stocks That Made HeadlinesQualcomm Beats Q1 Earnings and Revenue EstimatesQualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) reported strong financial results for first-quarter fiscal 2018, with the top and the bottom lines beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

1583,MO,"After missing earnings estimates five straight times, Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) delivered a beat in first-quarter 2017. Moreover, top and bottom lines grew year over year and management also raised its bottom-line view for 2018, courtesy of the tax reforms. However, these factors were not enough to placate investors, who were let down by the fifth consecutive sales miss and drop in constant currency (cc) earnings. This could be largely accountable to soft volumes.Evidently, shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company are down about 5% in the pre-market trading session. In fact, Philip Morris’ shares have gone down 6.2% in the past six months, wider than the industry’s decline of 4.8%. This can primarily be attributable to the company’s dismal past record.  Coming back to the earnings announcement, management stated that from Jan 1, 2018, it started operating through the following six reporting segments: the European Union Region (EU); the Eastern Europe Region (EE); the Middle East & Africa Region (ME&A); the South & Southeast Asia Region (S&SA); the East Asia & Australia Region (EA&A); and the Latin America & Canada Region (LA&C). Notably, the ME&A region also include PMI Duty Free.Quarter in DetailAdjusted earnings of $1.00 per share rose 2% year over year and itcame ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents. Excluding the positive impact from currency fluctuations, the bottom line dipped 1% from 98 cents reported in the year-ago period.Net revenues were $6,896 million, which increased 13.7% (up 8.3% on a constant currency basis) in the quarter. However, net revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,024 million. Favorable pricing of combustible products and greater volumes of heated tobacco units and IQOS devices drove currency-neutral revenues.During the quarter, revenues from combustible products inched up 2.5% (down 2.5% in cc) to $5,769 million. Revenues from Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) doubled (also on a cc basis) to $1,127 million, largely driven by increased sales of IQOS devices.Total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume fell2.3% to 173.8 billion units, owing to declines across most regions other than S&SA and EA&A. While cigarette shipment volume declined 5.3% to 164.3 billion units in the quarter, heated tobacco unit shipment volume of 9.6 billion units, increased 5.1 billion units year over year.Adjusted operating income inched higher by 0.4% year over year to $2,426 million, while it slipped 2.7% (on a cc basis)due to adverse volume/mix (especially in GCC) and escalated marketing, research and administration expenses. These hurdles couldn’t be fully compensated by favorable pricing. Adjusted operating margin (on a cc basis) fell 4.0 points to 35.8%.Also, during the quarter, Phillip Morris announced a quarterly dividend of $1.07.Region-Wise PerformanceNet revenues in EU climbed 0.2% (on a cc basis) to $1,988 million, courtesy of favorable pricing, somewhat offset by adverse volume/mix. Total shipment volume fell 5% to 40,599 million units.In EE, net revenues jumped 4.3% to $567 million, stemming from the same factors that drove EU revenues. Total shipment volumes tumbled 8.3% to 22,603 million units.Net revenues slipped 1.5% to $961 million in ME&A region as adverse volume/mix more than offset gains from pricing. Total shipment volumes dropped 6.5% to 29,957 million units.Moving to S&SA, a 5.6% rise in revenues to $1,081 millionwas witnessed, which was backed by improved pricing, though it was also somewhat countered by unfavorable volume/mix. Shipment volumes grew 6.1% to 40,218 million units.EA&A saw its revenues surge 27.5% to $1,591 million, owing to solid pricing. Total shipment volumes climbed 0.2% to 21,433 million units.Finally, revenues at LA&C advanced 17% to $708 million, on the back of favorable pricing. However, total shipment volumes were down 1.4% at 19,036 million units.GuidanceManagement remains confident about delivering solid results in 2018, alongside remaining committed toward making shareholder-friendly moves. The company remains encouraged about strength of its IQOS devices and favorable pricing of combustible products. While soft volumes in GCC, difficult pricing in Russia and sluggish sales in Japan pose hurdles, the company remains well placed to double its worldwide in-market heated tobacco unit sales from 2017.That said, management projects revenues in 2018 to grow about 8% (on a cc basis). Also, it expects the recent tax reforms to boost bottom-line growth. Incidentally, management now expects effective tax rate for 2018 to be roughly 26%, down from 28% projected in February.Consequently, earnings are envisioned in the range of $5.25-$5.40, in comparison to $5.20-$5.35 forecasted earlier. The updated guidance reflects year-over-year growth of 35-39%, up from 34-38% expected earlier. Excluding a favorable currency impact, the company anticipates adjusted earnings growth of nearly 8-11%, better than the previous forecast of 7-10%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is currently pegged at $5.28.Additionally, management expects capital expenditures of roughly $1.7 billion in 2018, while operating cash flow is envisioned to be more than $9 billion.Looking for Consumer Staple Stocks?

1584,MO,"Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the opening bell. While Altria’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last quarter, it has a mixed record of earnings surprises over the trailing four quarters.We expect the company to gain from sturdy advancements in the smokeless products category, which will be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results. However, softness in its smokable unit has long been a challenge to the company’s top line. That said, let’s see how things are shaping up for this tobacco giant, prior to the quarterly release.Smokeless SegmentSmokeless products, also popularly known as reduced risk tobacco products (RRPs), are rapidly gaining traction, considering their less detrimental impacts on health. Altria has been promptly responding to this trend and offers several RRPs which helped it maintain market share. The company’s flagship MarkTen and Green Smoke e-vapor products are some of the products performing strongly in the smokeless category. In fact, MarkTen is now a leading e-vapor brand in the United States. Also, Altria’s marketing and technology agreement with Philip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) to market MarkTen e-cigarettes internationally and the distribution of heated tobacco products in the United States is expected to boost businesses of the companies.Buoyed by efforts to strengthen RRPs, revenues (net of excise taxes) from the Smokeless product category advanced 11.1% to $542 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Given Altria’s impressive strides in this regard, we expect such trends to continue. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect net revenues (net of excise taxes) of approximately $471 million from this unit during the first quarter, indicating an improvement of 8% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.Pricing Also a Growth DriverAltria’s strong pricing has helped it stay afloat in the industry amid declining cigarette volumes. Though higher pricing might lead to possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases owing to the addictive quality of cigarettes. In fourth-quarter 2017, higher pricing led to a rise in adjusted operating company’s income (OCI) and margins in its segments. The company continues to expect pricing as a key growth driver in the near term.Industry Headwinds Mar Cigarette VolumesAlthough Altria has been strongly progressing with its smokeless products, things look gloomy when it comes to the company’s cigarettes category and smokeable products as a whole. Well, unfortunately, persistent decline in cigarette volumes has been a hindrance for Altria’s smokeable segment for a while. This in turn, can be attributed to regulatory hurdles in the form of limitations on marketing, anti-smoking campaigns and higher excise duties. Apart from this, rising health consciousness among consumers has lowered cigarette consumption globally. Together, these factors have been weighing on cigarette sales volumes. As a result, shipment volumes in the smokeable segment declined 2.6%, 2.7%, 6.1% and 8.7% respectively in the preceding four quarters. In fact, during fourth-quarter 2017, total cigarette retail share declined to 50.3%, representing a 0.8 percentage point slip. This was largely due to a 0.7 share point drop in Marlboro’s retail share, which stemmed from intense competition and increase in cigarette excise tax in California. On account of such headwinds, the consensus estimate for smokeable segment revenues is currently pegged at $5,349 million for the first quarter — reflecting a drop of nearly 2% from reported smokeable revenues in the year-ago period.Apart from Altria, declining cigarette sales volumes have been hurting other tobacco players like Philip Morris, British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group (VGR  -  Free Report). Nevertheless, we believe that favorable pricing and rising demand for smokeless products will help Altria overcome the aforementioned hurdles. Additionally, the company’s consistent focus on making investments in core growth areas, improving retail fixtures and making enhancements to brands like Marlboro will lift its market share and aid the firm to maintain its leading position in the tobacco space.All, said lets now take a look at the picture unveiled by the consensus marks for earnings and sales as well as the Zacks Model for the upcoming quarterly announcement. Altria Group, Inc.

1585,MO,"Philip Morris International (PM  -  Free Report) shares are in free-fall this morning after announcing Q1 earnings that were actually slightly higher than analyst estimates.  Revenues were lower than expected however, and the future of the industry looks grim. The stock is currently trading down over 17% on the day at $84.49 after closing yesterday at $101.20.The international producer of Marlboro cigarettes and other tobacco-based products - which was spun-off from U.S. producer Altria almost exactly ten years ago - reported earnings of $1.00/share in Q1 versus a Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.88.  Revenues came in lower than estimates with the company posting $6.89B in sales, while analysts were expecting $7.02B.  Most of the increase in earnings was due to currency fluctuations and favorable tax rates rather than improved operations.  Sales in regions Eastern-Europe, Africa and the Middle East, East-Asia and Australia, and Latin America and Canada all saw a decrease in sales by unit volume.  Only Southeast Asia saw mild sales growth.Guidance for 2018 remained basically the same, though the range was adjusted slightly from $5.25 - $5.35/share to $5.25 - $5.40/share.Industry-wide carnageOther industry players are falling today as well on the news as investors ruminate on an uncertain future for tobacco. U.S. Marlboro producer Altria (MO  -  Free Report) is down over 7% and British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report) – owner of R.J Reynolds – is down almost 6%.Philip Morris has missed the Zacks Composite Earnings estimate in each of the last 4 quarters due to regulation, increased taxation and an overall decline in demand for tobacco products.The 2008 spinoff of Philip Morris from Altria was intended to take advantage of international demand for tobacco products outside the purview of onerous U.S. regulation and it worked…for a while.  Now however, facing the same pressures worldwide as they once did in the U.S., Philip Morris is scrambling to replace traditional cigarette sales with alternative tobacco products.“Reduced Risk”, Really?In the face of declining market, tobacco companies have embraced “Reduced Risk Products” (RRPs) to attract customers.  They are betting on heated tobacco products like vaporizers and smokeless tobacco as less-unhealthy choices for those who choose to continue to use tobacco.Unfortunately for Philip Morris, sales of its iQOS vaporizer device were disappointing in Asia (the device’s primary market), as were sales of the “Heatstick” cartridges used in the iQOS.Heated tobacco devices were seen as a potential savior for Phllip Morris and the industry as a whole, but demand seems to have leveled of globally faster than expected.Investing in an industry whose potential savior is a group of products that still have the word “risk” in their name seems potentially unwise.Income PlayThe real “savior” of Phllip Morris and the whole industry – at least from investors’ point of view - has been a healthy dividend.  Philip Morris and Altria both pay a dividend of just over 4% and British American pays 3.7%.With interest rates on the rise, however, dividend paying stocks look relatively less attractive, and with the future of tobacco so significantly uncertain, the ability of these companies to continue paying juicy dividends long-term is in doubt.Philip Morris does have over $8B on the balance sheet, so the dividend looks safe for the time being.With so many true growth stocks available to investors in truly innovative industries that are making our daily existence better, it’s difficult to justify investing in a dying sector like tobacco.

1586,MO,"Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19, before the opening bell. The company’s earnings have lagged estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average miss of 6.1%. Lately, Philip Morris has been treading on shaky grounds, thanks to the jolts from receding cigarette consumption stemming from strict government regulations and rising consumer awareness regarding the harmful impacts of tobacco. However, the company has been combating such challenges with strength in Reduced Risk Products (RRPs). That said, let’s see what this earnings season has in store for this tobacco giant.Cigarette Segment to Stay a WorryGovernment authorities have been brandishing the whip on tobacco players as smoking has become one of the primary causes of heart diseases and cancer. Apart from seeking authorization for any new tobacco product, the FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets. Additionally, these companies have been directed to put self-critical advertisements on television and newspapers, particularly emphasizing on the addictive nature of cigarettes. To add to the woes, the FDA is bent on drastically reducing nicotine in cigarettes to minimally addictive levels. The initiative was proposed in 2017 but was delayed due to ongoing research. If enacted, low nicotine levels will prove to be disastrous for cigarette manufacturing companies. Moreover, increasing regulatory moves have raised awareness amongst consumers regarding the detrimental effects of tobacco consumption, motivating them to quit smoking.The impacts of such initiatives are clearly visible on Philip Morris’s receding cigarette shipment volumes. Shipment volume in this category declined 2.1%, 4,1%, 7.5% and 11.5% during the fourth, third, second and the first quarters of 2017, respectively. The decline is expected to continue in the forthcoming quarters as well. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate total cigarette shipment volumes to dip 0.16% in first-quarter 2018.Further, the effect of such headwinds is visible on Philip Morris’s shares that have declined 10.3% in the past six months, compared with the industry’s fall of 7%. Well, apart from Philip Morris, performances of other industry majors such as Altria Group (MO  -  Free Report), British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group (VGR  -  Free Report) have been negatively impacted by such factors as well.  Hopes on Reduced Risk ProductsKeeping the headwinds aside, Philip Morris has been exploring opportunities through RRPs to stay afloat. The company stands firm on its ambitions to develop a smoke free future, evident from its recent move to completely transform one of its cigarette production facilities in Greece for the manufacture of HEETS — a unit used with iQOS. In fact, with investments close to $4.5 billion since 2008 for undertaking research and development in the RRPs category, the company is pioneering the radical shift from harmful tobacco products to scientific and low-risk alternatives.Buoyed by such efforts, the company generated revenues of $1,643 million from RRPs during fourth-quarter 2017, significantly higher than $343 million in the year-ago quarter. Notably, RRP revenues for 2017 represented 12.7% of the company’s overall net revenues, with major contributions from iQOS and accessories.The company expects consistent growth in this category in the forthcoming periods, which encourages it to undertake constant investments. In fact, management expects strength in RRPs (especially iQOS) to drive the company’s currency-neutral revenue growth of more than 8% in 2018.Cigarette Pricing to Aid RevenuesApart from RRPs, higher cigarette pricing has also been an upside in Philip Morris’s performance for a while. Though higher pricing might lead to possible decline in cigarette consumption, it has been noted that smokers tend to absorb price increases owing to the addictive quality of cigarettes. Evidently, favorable pricing in the combustible tobacco portfolio drove year-over-year net revenue growth in 2017. Moreover, the price hikes enable the company to maintain margins at targeted levels. The company continues to expect pricing as a key growth driver in the near term.All, said lets now take a look at the picture unveiled by the consensus marks for earnings and sales as well as the Zacks Model for the upcoming quarterly announcement. Philip Morris International Inc.

1588,MO,"Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) seems to stand firm on its ambitions of developing a smoke free future, evident from its recent move to completely transform one of its cigarette production facilities in Greece for the manufacture of HEETS —  a unit used with iQOS. At a time when Philip Morris, like other major tobacco players, is witnessing receding cigarette sales, the company has been tactfully keeping its ducks in a row with reduced risk products (RRPs).Expanding in the Smoke-Free ZoneFor the transformation of Papastratos factory in Greece for the production of HEETS, the company plans an investment outlay of approximately EUR 300 million. This includes construction of new buildings and replacement of cigarette manufacturing lines with advanced facilities that can produce almost 10,000 smoke-free units per minute. The transformation work is expected to be completed by the end of 2018 and is likely to create 400 new employment opportunities. Along with Papastratos, Philip Morris has a plant near Bologna in Italy, which is fully engaged in the manufacturing of smoke-free products. Further, the company plans to undertake either partial or complete transformation of its cigarette producing facilities in Russia, Korea and Romania.  Philip Morris’ endeavors in the RRPs category are praiseworthy. With investments close to $4.5 billion since 2008 for undertaking research and product development in this category, the company is leading the revolutionary move from harmful tobacco products to scientific and low risk product alternatives. While the company has been stringently working toward motivating smokers to switch to RRPs, government regulations across the globe have also been playing a major role to substantiate the change. Additionally, the marketing and technology sharing agreement between Philip Morris and Altria Group (MO  -  Free Report) for selling iQOS heated tobacco products in the United States is expected to aid volume and sales growth. The agreement is currently submitted for review to the FDA.The company’s strategic efforts in the RRPs space have also been favorably impacting its overall performance. Evidently, during fourth-quarter 2017, the company generated revenues of $1,643 million from RRPs, significantly higher than $343 million in 2017. Notably, RRP revenues in 2017 represented 12.7% of the company’s overall net revenues, with major contributions from iQOS and accessories. The company expects continued growth in this category in the forthcoming periods, which encourages it to undertake constant investments to support RRP expansion. In fact, management expects strength in RRPs to drive the company’s currency-neutral revenue growth of more than 8% in 2018.   Challenges to OvercomeOn the flip side, Philip Morris has been witnessing deteriorating shipment volumes mainly due to receding demand for cigarettes. Moreover, due to such headwinds, Philip Morris’ shares have lost 13.7% in the past six months, wider than the industry’s decline of 10.5%. In fact, rising consumer awareness regarding the harmful impacts of cigarette and stern government regulations have been hampering the growth of a number of firms in the multi-billion tobacco industry such as British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group (VGR  -  Free Report).Nevertheless, as a trendsetter in the low risk tobacco products arena and its effective strategies to augment the category, Philip Morris is expected to continue as one of prominent names in the industry. Such dedicated efforts not only aid in countering stringent regulations and headwinds plaguing the cigarette space, but also seem to be in the favor of society’s health and well being. Marching with such radical objectives, we expect this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) to continue growing and also gain a place in investors’ good books.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Can Hackers Put Money into Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

1589,MO,"Cigarette consumption rates have been charring down, which in turn has been choking the performance of major tobacco players like Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report). Evidently, these hurdles have caused shares of this Virginia-based company to plunge close to 15% in the past year, wider than the industry’s decline of 10.5%. Nevertheless, Altria is trying all means to find a breather in reduced risk tobacco products (RRPs) – which have been gaining traction.Receding Cigarette Volumes Raise ConcernsAltria and other tobacco industry majors received quite a jolt last year when the FDA came up with the proposal to drastically lower nicotine content in cigarettes. This along with the FDA’s norms to display self-critical advertisements on television and newspapers to dissuade customers from smoking and using precautionary labels on cigarette packets, have been weighing on the tobacco segment. Moreover, in the process of adhering to previous regulatory policies, tobacco manufacturers are required to seek marketing authorization for the introduction of any tobacco product. Additionally, the European Union and the FDA have proposed a ban on menthol in accordance with the Tobacco Control Act. Per the Act, menthol cigarettes have an adverse impact on public health. That said, Altria and other companies in the multi-billion tobacco industry such as British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group (VGR  -  Free Report) have quite a lot to worry about when it comes to cigarette products.Thanks to the aforementioned challenges, Altria’s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in eight out of the last 10 quarters. In fact, Altria’s domestic cigarette shipment volume fell 8.9% year over year during the fourth quarter of 2017, due to lower cigarette industry volumes, unfavorable trade inventory movements and decline in retail share. Total cigarette retail share declined to 50.3% during the period, representing a 0.8 percentage point slip. Moreover, declines of 6.2%, 2.7% and 2.6% in Altria’s cigarette shipment volumes were incurred during the third, second and first quarters of 2017, respectively.With little or no hopes of attaining growth in cigarettes, Altria is focusing on its smokeless or reduced risk products. Let’s take a look at the efforts undertaken in this segment and other factors that have been aiding this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Reduced Risk Products: The New Growth MantraThe future for tobacco companies seems to be smoke-free, given the growing popularity of RRPs. Altria has been promptly responding to this changing market scenario. To this end, it has offered several reduced risk tobacco products which helped it maintain market share. In e-vapor, Altria’s subsidiary Nu Mark LLC continues to boost MarkTen volume, which expanded 60% in 2017, courtesy of greater distribution and category growth. MarkTen’s full-year 2017 national retail market share was approximately 12.5% in mainstream retail channels. Further, it forms nearly 70% of e-vapor volumes in those channels. Notably, Altria’s flagship MarkTen and Green Smoke e-vapor products are performing strongly in the smokeless category. In fact, MarkTen is now a leading e-vapor brand in the United States.Backed by efforts to strengthen RRP portfolio, revenues (net of excise taxes) from the Smokeless product category advanced 11.1% to $542 million in the fourth quarter. This was mainly buoyed by better pricing and improved Copenhagen volumes. We expect such trends to continue fueling Altria in the forthcoming periods. Also, Altria’s marketing and technology agreement with Philip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) to market MarkTen e-cigarettes internationally and the distribution of heated tobacco products in the United States is expected to boost the businesses of the companies.Positive on the Journey AheadDespite the headwinds plaguing the cigarette category, Altria has managed to stay afloat in this segment on the back of strong pricing. It has been witnessed that smokers tend to absorb price increases owing to the addictive quality of cigarettes. We expect the company to continue reaping benefits from such effective pricing strategies in the forthcoming periods.  Additionally, the recent tax reforms favorably impacted Altria’s 2017 earnings, and are expected to benefit the company going ahead. Evidently, management expects lower corporate tax rate and lower taxes on AB InBev dividends to augment the company’s bottom line in 2018.Apart from this, management is focused on making investments in core growth areas like undertaking innovations, coming up with launches like iQOS, improving retail fixtures and enhancing brands like Marlboro to boost market share. Moreover, on the back of these efforts and expected gains from tax reforms, management provided a positive earnings outlook for 2018. That said, we hope such well-chalked endeavors to aid the company to offset the hurdles and continue as one of the prominent names in the tobacco industry.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1591,MO,"Philip Morris International Inc (PM  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 19, before the opening bell. The company’s earnings have lagged estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 2.9%.Strict regulations surrounding the promotion and marketing of tobacco products and initiatives undertaken by the government to curb cigarette consumption remain as concerns for the company. However, increased focus on reduced risk tobacco products and hiked prices are expected to keep the company afloat.Let’s delve into some of the factors that are likely to impact third-quarter results of this renowned tobacco company.Government Regulations Pulling Down Cigarette Volumes Cancer and heart diseases have become rampant due to cigarette smoking. As a result, consumers have become health conscious, which has negatively impacted cigarette consumption volumes. Stringent government regulations surrounding tobacco products have also been denting the businesses of major tobacco companies such as Altria Group Inc (MO  -  Free Report) British American Tobacco p.l.c. (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group Ltd (VGR  -  Free Report).Recently, Reynolds American, which is being acquired by British American, along with Altria and other cigarette makers announced the introduction of self-critical advertisements to dissuade customers from smoking per court orders. In July, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) urged tobacco makers to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes, as tar and other substances inhaled through smoking is detrimental to health. Additionally, the FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking.Such industry-wide headwinds have been plaguing Philip Morris’s cigarette volumes. The decline is expected to continue in the forthcoming quarters. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, total cigarette sales volumes for the third quarter are expected to decline 1.4%. According to estimates, total cigarette shipment volumes are expected to decline 0.02% in the third quarter, depicting an improvement from the decline of 7.5% in the preceding quarter and a decline of 2.7% in the prior-year period.Low Risk Tobacco Products Expected to Grow The company expects to gain from increased volumes in reduced risk tobacco products, such as e-cigarettes, HeatSticks and iQOS products. The company expects these products to continue to witness growth for the remaining two quarters of 2017. Philip Morris has also been making several investments to expand the capacity of its heated tobacco products.Further, the marketing and technology sharing agreement between Philip Morris and Altria Group for selling the former’s iQOS heated tobacco products, is also expected to aid volume and sales growth for both companies. The agreement is currently submitted for review to the FDA. Also, Philip Morris is expected to continue gaining from increasing cigarette pricing trend.Driven by adequate growth and strong performance of Philip Morris’s low risk tobacco products, shares of the company have surged 19.3% over the past 12 months, compared with the industry’s rise of 10.3%.Philip Morris International Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Philip Morris International Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Philip Morris International Inc QuoteWhich Way are Estimates Trending A look into estimate revisions give us an idea of what analysts are thinking about the company right before the earnings release. The Consensus Estimate for the third quarter as well as for 2017 has increased by a cent, over the last seven days. Estimated earnings of $1.39 depict a year-over year growth of 10.8%. Estimated earnings of $4.86 also depict a year-over-year rise of 8.6%. Adjusted operating income is expected to surge 8.9% year over year to 3.3 billion, owing to lower cigarette volumes.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $7.7 billion for the third quarter, depicting a growth of 10.3% from the prior-year period. The same for 2017 are expected to be 28.9 billion, up 8.2% from the previous year. Revenues are anticipated to rise on the back of higher pricing as well as increased volumes of heated tobacco products.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Philip Morris is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

1592,MO,"President Trump wants to slap tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum to protect domestic producers. But it hasn’t gone down well with the investing community. The tariffs will increase the cost of companies that rely heavily on steel and aluminum, affecting their bottom lines. Further, these have raised anxieties that other countries will retaliate, increasing the odds of a trade war and harm to the global economy.  The tariff declaration incited a steep stock market selloff and a rebuke from world leaders. The Dow plunged for four straight trading sessions on Mar 2, while the industrials sector of the S&P 500 was hit the hardest. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge came in at 19.59, way higher than a reading near 11 for most of 2017.With the markets receiving a drubbing on Trump tariffs, investing in stocks that provide excellent risk-adjusted returns won’t be a bad proposition.Trump Tariffs to Hurt U.S. IndustrialsTrump surprised the global market by announcing steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. The President said that the United States will impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum.But, tariffs on steel and aluminum have stoked concerns among manufacturers of cars, planes and machinery that rely heavily on such products. After all, steel and aluminum are major expenses for these industries, so an uptick in cost will hurt their profits. Needless to say, the tariff announcement has propelled steel prices to a six-year high of $840 per ton, while aluminum prices exploded to a two-year high at 17 cents per pound.Higher prices on steel and aluminum, furthermore, will compel these companies that rely on such products to pass on some of the costs to consumers. Increased consumer prices may in the long run hamper sales growth and affect companies, leading to job losses. Trump’s tariffs are estimated to hurt nearly 6.5 million U.S. workers at steel and aluminum consuming manufacturers.Retaliation Heats UpThe affected companies further cautioned that they may face retaliatory tariffs from foreign players against the goods they export, eventually denting their profit margins. Trump’s tariff announcement has already evoked anger among global leaders, with the European Union saying that it will impose tariffs on $3.5 billion worth of U.S. imports, as per Reuters.China cautioned America to abide by multilateral trade rules and not to harm the delicate global economy. We shouldn’t forget that China is the world’s dominant steel producer and Trump’s tariff moves could easily start a trade war between them.Tariffs also raise threats of a trade war with America’s closest ally, Canada. After all, Canada is the top exporter of both steel and aluminum from the United States. Canada is solely responsible for manufacturing 17% of all the U.S. steel imports and 43% of all aluminum imports. Other major suppliers to the United States, including Brazil, South Korea, Mexico and Russia will also be negatively impacted.Tariffs news hit not only heavy users of steel and aluminum, but also cyclical-sensitive sectors like technology and consumer cyclicals to name a few. Investors remained worried that threats of retaliation by trade partners could harm global economic growth that was widely seen as the major driving force of the stock market’s rally last year.Dow Companies Strongly Disagree With Trump TariffsHere is how some of the blue-chip companies responded to Trump tariffs:The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) agreed with Can Manufacturers Institute (CMI) President Robert Budway, who said that tariff restrictions will have a severe impact on the can manufacturing industry, its employees and consumers of such aluminum cans. Tariffs will increase price, lead to supply inefficiency and affect product availability.Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) supported American Petroleum Institute (API) stance that they “support free trade” largely in the oil and natural gas industries, but in other industries as well.JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) shares its view with Joshua Bolten, chief executive of the Business Roundtable, who said that the industry group urges Trump to persuade “other approaches” to address issues related to overcapacity of steel and aluminum that won’t place the economy at high risk.Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) stood by Retail Industry Leaders Association that said “Trump administration’s intention to unilaterally impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports could have severely negative consequences for the American economy. If broadly applied, these tariffs will have a downstream impact on every sector.”The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) responded by saying that Trump’s tariff plan “is likely to escalate trade tensions, particularly as it looks likely to apply to a broad group of countries including to some allies of the U.S.”5 Ultra-Safe BetsGiven such heightened tariff concerns, investors should build a strategy around low-risk assets and a combination of parameters that lead to better returns.

1593,MO,"As smoking rate continues to decline globally along with stringent government regulations and increasing consumer health awareness, Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) has been facing receding volumes in its combustible products category. Amid such conditions, the company has been striving to achieve growth and stay afloat in the industry by focusing on reduced-risk tobacco products.Declining Cigarette Consumption Poses ConcernsPhilip Morris has been witnessing deteriorating shipment volumes mainly due to receding demand for cigarettes. Moreover, consumers are opting for e-cigarettes or substitutes for cigarettes, which is affecting cigarette volume. During fourth-quarter 2017, total cigarette shipment volume fell 2.1%. We note that anti-tobacco campaigns and rigid government policies have been plaguing cigarette consumption. Government initiatives to curb tobacco consumption mainly include self-critical advertisements, use of precautionary labels on cigarette packets and lowering of nicotine levels in cigarettes.Moreover, due to such industry headwinds, Philip Morris’ shares have lost 7.7% in the past six months, wider than the industry’s decline of 1.6%. Such actions have also been a curse for a number of firms in the multi-billion tobacco industry such as British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group (VGR  -  Free Report).  As the cigarette category offers less hopes of revival, Philip Morris has been diverting its attention toward low risk tobacco products.Let’s take a look into the company’s strategies to expand in this space and other factors impacting its performance.Reduced Risk Products: A Vital Growth PlatformSerious health hazards due to cigarette smoking along with the influences of anti-tobacco campaigns have pushed consumers toward low-risk tobacco products. To meet consumers’ changing preference, Philip Morris launched the iQOS (in 2014). The launch was aimed to lead the tobacco industry’s push into RRPs that may eventually replace traditional smokes. During fourth-quarter 2017, the company generated revenues of $1,643 million from RRPs, higher than $343 million in the year-ago quarter. Notably, RRP revenues for 2017 represented 12.7% of the company’s overall net revenues, with major contributions from iQOS and accessories.Philip Morris expects continued growth in this category in the forthcoming periods, which encourages it to make investments to support RRP expansion. In fact, management expects strength in RRPs (especially iQOS) to drive the company’s currency-neutral revenue growth of more than 8% in 2018. Moreover, the marketing and technology sharing agreement between Philip Morris and Altria Group (MO  -  Free Report) for selling  iQOS heated tobacco products in the United States is also expected to aid volume and sales growth. The agreement is currently submitted for review to the FDA.All said, we expect that this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s efforts to grow in the low-risk tobacco products realm combined with a strong brand image in the industry will help it tide over teh ongoing challenges and sustain in investors' good books.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

1594,MO,"Philip Morris International Inc (PM  -  Free Report) has been struggling with lower cigarette volumes, due to reduced consumption rates.  To worsen matters, the court recently issued an order which guides cigarette companies to endorse anti-smoking campaigns. Nevertheless, Philip Morris has been diverting its attention toward Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) to stay afloat in the tobacco industry.Thanks to the challenges stemming from lower cigarette volumes, Philip Morris’ top- and bottom-lines missed the Zacks Consensus Estimates in the third quarter of 2017. Notably, this marked the company’s third consecutive period of earnings and sales miss.Consequently, the company’s shares have dipped approximately 8% since it posted third-quarter results on Oct 19. Philip Morris’s shares have lost 9.8% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 0.6%. Let’s delve into the factors which have been impacting Philip Morris’s performance lately and the efforts undertaken to uplift the company’s performance.Anti-Smoking Advertisements Reduce Smoking RatesDespite a formidable decline in cigarette consumption in the past decade, smoking is still considered as one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Further, federal authorities claim that tobacco companies have not informed consumers about the dangers and addictive nature associated with smoking. As per the new court order, companies will be forced to acknowledge the perils of smoking through corrective advertisements circulated through television channels, newspapers, websites, store displays and cigarette packs. Further, the court directed Altria Group (MO  -  Free Report) and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. to bear the expenses of the campaign.Stringent regulations imposed by government authorities surrounding tobacco consumption have always posed challenges for major players such as British American Tobacco (BTI  -  Free Report), Altria and Vector Group (VGR  -  Free Report). Cigarette consumption rates have declined globally due to precautionary labels and higher tax rates. The recent order to roll out anti-smoking advertisements is a major step to restrict tobacco consumption. This is expected to lower revenue prospects for almost all the companies operating in the industry.Industry Hurdles Hurt Q3 Results & View: Estimates DeclineDuring third-quarter 2017, Philip Morris’s net revenues were hurt by a 3.6% decline in combustible products. Total shipment volumes in this category also declined 4.1%. The downside stemmed from lower volumes in the EU, EEMA regions and in Latin America & Canada. As a result, total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume declined by 0.5% in the quarter.Management lowered earnings guidance for 2017, due to the headwinds surrounding the industry. Earnings are now expected in the range of $4.75-$4.80, lower than the previous range of $4.78 to $4.93. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 revised two cents downward in the past 30 days to $4.75.  Reduced Risk Products Expected to Uplift Performance  Nonetheless, Philip Morris’s RRPs performance has been impressive lately. Consumers have been showing increased preference for such products, which have a lower negative impact on health. During the third quarter, the company generated revenues of $947 million from RRPs, significantly higher than $212 million reported in the prior-year quarter. This has driven the company’s overall top-line results. Additionally, heated tobacco unit shipment volume of 9.7 billion units, reflected a radical improvement from 2.1 billion units recorded in third-quarter 2016.Considering such upsides associated with RRPs, Philip Morris has been making aggressive investments to expand heated tobacco units or IQOS devices along with e-vapor products. Additionally, the marketing and technology sharing agreement between Philip Morris and Altria Group, which is currently under FDA’s review, is expected to boost the companies’ business in the forthcoming periods.Philip Morris has been striving to adapt with the changing industry conditions to meet consumer needs as evident from the smokeless cigarette category’s performance. We hope that such efforts will help this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to stay afloat amid tough industry conditions.

1595,MO,"Picking bargain stocks with a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a common practice. The idea is that the lower the P/E, the higher will be the value of the stock. Investors believe that a stock’s current market price is not equivalent to its higher earnings and therefore has room to run.But some of you may get surprised to know that stocks with a rising P/E can also be worth buying. We’ll tell you why this often-overlooked approach may go a long way in finding solid stocks. Why Rising P/E a Valuable Tool?Investors should note that stock price moves in tandem with earnings performance. If earnings come in stronger, the price of a stock shoots up. Solid quarterly earnings and the forward guidance boost earnings forecasts, leading to stronger demand for the stock and an uptrend in its price.So, if the price is rising steadily, it means that investors are assured of the stock’s fundamental strength and expect some strong positives out of it. Suppose an investor wants to buy a stock with a P/E ratio of 30, it means that he is willing to shell out $30 for only $1 worth of earnings. This is because the investor expects earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future on the back of strong fundamentals.Also, studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P/E ratios jump over 100% from their breakout point in the cycle. So, if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle, you can end up seeing considerable gains.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P/E, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year’s actual growthPercentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal to zero(These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years.)Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeksPercentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks(These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes.)Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S&P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S&P 500Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S&P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S&P 500(Here, the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S&P 500.)Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20% higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks, but it should not exceed 100%(A 20% increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend. But a jump of over 100% indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal.)In addition, we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) can get through.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 11.Here are five out of the 11 stocks:Avon Products Inc.

1596,MO,"After posting back-to-back misses in the last two quarters, Altria Group Inc. (MO  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise in third-quarter 2017, which also marked its third straight quarter of year-over-year bottom-line growth. However, top line fell year over year and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Nonetheless, the company kept its 2017 earnings guidance intact.Quarter in detailAdjusted earnings of 90 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents. Also, earnings increased 9.8% year over year, on the back of higher operating income in the smokeable and smokeless segments and lower outstanding shares. This was somewhat offset by reduced equity earnings from the company’s investment in beer.Altria Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Altria Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Altria Group QuoteHowever, net revenues fell 2.5% to $6,729 million in the quarter, owing to soft net revenues in the smokeable products segments. Revenues net of excise taxes slipped 1.3% year over year to $5,123 million. This also came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,196 million.In e-vapor, Altria’s subsidiary Nu Mark LLC continues to boost MarkTen volume and retail share. MarkTen’s third-quarter national retail market share was approximately 13.5% in mainstream retail channels. Further, it forms nearly 65% of e-vapor volumes in those channels.However, if we look into Altria’s stock performance over a year, we note that the stock has moved up just 3.9%, in comparison to the industry’s growth of 11.4%.We believe declining demand for cigarettes due to the ongoing anti-tobacco campaigns, government restrictions and higher cigarette prices in response to rising taxes have been weighing on the stock. Strict Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations on cigarette packaging dissuade customers from smoking. Additionally, consumers’ preference for e-cigarettes or substitutes for cigarettes are largely affecting the cigarette volume. Evidently, Altria’s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in seven of the last nine quarters, including this quarter.Segment DetailsSmokeable Products Segment: Revenues net of excise taxes dipped 1.5% year over year to $4,410 million, due to soft volumes that was somewhat compensated by better pricing. Cigarette shipment volumes fell 6.2% year over year, stemming from lower cigarette industry volumes, unfavorable trade inventory movements and decline in retail share. On the other hand, shipment volumes for cigars rose 6.6% in the quarter. Total cigarette retail share declined to 50.5%, representing a 0.6 percentage point slip.Adjusted operating companies income (OCI) increased 7.7% to $2,300 million, while adjusted OCI margins jumped 4.5 percentage points to 52.2%.Smokeless Products: Revenues net of excise taxes advanced 4.5% to $515 million in the quarter. This was driven by better pricing and reduced promotions, partly countered by unfavorable mix and soft volumes. Shipment volumes fell 1.8% to 212.6 million units, where Copenhagen and Skoal shipment volumes dropped 2% and others increased 1.2% in the quarter. Total smokeless products retail share grew 1.1 percentage points to 53.8% in the quarter.Adjusted OCI surged 15.7% to $362 million and margins expanded 6.8 percentage points to 70.3%.Wine: The segment’s revenues, net of excise taxes, remained nearly flat year over year at $175 million. Results here were impacted by trade inventory reductions, heightened competition and sluggish growth of premium wine. Wine shipment volume was also almost flat at 2.2 million units.Adjusted OCI declined 5.3% to $36 million, mainly accountable to soft volumes and escalated expenses. OCI margin decreased 1 percentage point to 20.6%.Financial UpdatesIn August 2017, Altria announced an 8.2% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 66 cents per share. During the third quarter, Altria paid dividends worth $1.2 billion and intends to maintain a payout ratio of 80% of its bottom line. Further, the company repurchased 11.1 million shares under its existing share repurchase program for approximately $759 million. As of Sep 30, 2017, Altria had approximately $576 million remaining under its share repurchase program of $4 billion. Altria expects to complete the program by the end of second-quarter 2018.Consolidation of Manufacturing FacilitiesIn October 2016, Altria announced the consolidation of several of its manufacturing facilities to streamline operations and achieve greater efficiencies. The consolidation, scheduled to be completed by first-quarter 2018 is expected to deliver approximately $50 million in cost.OutlookThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company reaffirmed earnings guidance for full-year 2017 and expects adjusted earnings in a range of $3.26-$3.32, up 7.5% to 9.5% compared with adjusted earnings of $3.03 in 2016. Altria expects 2017 full-year effective tax rate on operations to be roughly 35.5%.Don’t Miss These Consumer Staples StocksOllie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc.

1597,MO,"The Tobacco industry has evolved dramatically over the last two decades. It is closely regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as rising cases of cancer and heart diseases due to cigarette smoking is a serious concern. Smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths annually in the United States.Amid this scenario, governments around the world have been imposing stringent restrictions on tobacco companies to lower cigarette consumption. Such restrictions have severely dented businesses of tobacco majors including Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report), Altria Group Inc. (MO  -  Free Report), British American Tobacco p.l.c. (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group Ltd. (VGR  -  Free Report).In a recent move, Winston-Salem-based Reynolds American, which is being acquired by British American, along with Richmond, Va-based Altria and other cigarette makers is set to put up self-critical advertisements on television and newspapers to dissuade customers from smoking per court orders.Apart from this, the court wants tobacco companies to admit that cigarettes have been intentionally made addictive through the issuance of corrective ads starting Nov 26. Per the Wall Street Journal, the move comes in the wake of settling a 1999 lawsuit which accused the industry for several health hazards.Notably since 2009, the FDA has been imposing restrictions on cigarette companies over selling and packaging. In July, the FDA urged tobacco makers to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes, as tar and other substances inhaled through smoking is detrimental to health.Not only this, the FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking. The European Union and the FDA have proposed a ban on menthol in accordance with the Tobacco Control Act. Per the act, menthol has an adverse effect on health and thus should not be used in any product.Recently, the state government in India's capital directed Philip Morris and other tobacco companies to remove all advertisements in the city, warning them of legal action if they do not comply.Switch to Cigarette AlternativesAmid increasing government restrictions and declining smoking rates, tobacco giants have introduced e-cigarettes and switched to less harmful ‘Reduced Risk Products’ to boost their business and mitigate loss. However, the FDA has imposed several restrictions on e-cigarettes as well.The FDA made it mandatory for all tobacco makers to seek marketing authorization for any tobacco product introduced after Feb 15, 2007. The law was extended to include e-cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and hookah. The FDA has currently deferred its reviews for products like cigars and hookah tobacco until 2021 and e-cigarettes until 2022.Share Price Performance: Industry Versus S&P 500Given the aforementioned turmoil, it is not at all surprising that the Zacks Tobacco industry is currently placed at the bottom 28% out of the 265 Zacks Classified Industries. The industry has slumped 7.5% in the last six months, against the S&P 500 market’s 8.4% growth.Bottom LineStricter regulations have adversely impacted tobacco makers’ revenues. However, the FDA’s role to lower cigarette consumption is worth praising, keeping in view the rising deaths due to smoking. The latest initiative to provide statements against smoking is a significant step and is expected to have a great impact on consumers. Companies’ reduced focus on cigarettes and shift toward e-cigarettes is expected to reduce the rate of cigarette consumption in the long run.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>

1599,MO,"Altria Group, Inc (MO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26. The company’s results for the quarter are expected to gain from increased volumes in the smokeless or low-risk tobacco products category. However, challenges in the smokeable category remain concerns.Revenues to Gain From Smokeless Category GrowthThe smokeless category has long been favoring Altria’s overall performance, enabling it to respond to consumer shift towards low-risk, smokeless tobacco products. Altria commands a number of strong brands in this category such as MarkTen e-cigarette and Copenhagen amongst others.Owing to such trends, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for smokeless products net revenue is currently pegged at $562 million, which marks 6.4% increase from the prior-year quarter’s figure. Also, the consensus estimate in shipment volumes for the smokeless category is expected to grow 0.03% in the third quarter. We note that the Smokeless category’s shipment volumes increased 5.6% in the prior-year quarter, and increased 1.4% during second-quarter 2017.Underlying Weakness in the Smokeable Category Rising health consciousness and stringent government regulations surrounding the marketing and pricing of cigarette have been denting the businesses of major tobacco companies such as Phillip Morris International Inc (PM  -  Free Report), British American Tobacco plc (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group Ltd (VGR  -  Free Report).  Moreover, the recent FDA regulation regarding lowering Nicotine content in cigarettes to non-addictive or minimally addictive levels has further declined traditional cigarettes sales.These headwinds are expected to impact Altria’s total shipment volumes in the smokeable segment during the third quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect volumes for this segment to decline approximately 0.05%. We note that shipment volumes in the smokeable category decreased 0.9% in the prior-year quarter, while it slipped 2.7% during second-quarter 2017. Declining demand and volume for tobacco products have also been pulling down Altria’s shares. Consequently, the company’s shares have lost 11.4% over the past six months, while the industry declined 7.5%.Nevertheless, the smokeable category is expected to benefit from the rising price trend that has been aiding Altria to keep the cigarette category afloat. We expect this to provide some cushion from the negative impacts of volume declines. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for smokeable products net revenue is currently pegged at $6,067 million, which represents a 1.3% dip from the prior-year reported figure..Nonetheless, benefits from the smokeless category should help boost Altria’s total revenues for the quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues to be roughly 5.2 billion, which falls almost in line with the year-ago period figure. .Earnings ExpectationsAltria’s performance reveals that it has missed bottom-line estimates in the past two quarters. Nevertheless, earnings have been growing year over year for quite some time. Also, earnings for the third quarter are expected to gain from higher smokeless products volumes and revenues as well as strong pricing. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is currently pegged at 87 cents, depicting year-on-year growth of over 6%.Altria Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Altria Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Altria Group QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Altria is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.
