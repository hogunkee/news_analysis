1,EXC,"As the nation's largest nuclear power producer, Exelon (EXC) is a utility company of a different stripe.Because nuclear power emissions are cleaner than coal and other types of generation, Exelon boasts a low-pollution advantage. Exelon's role also makes it a player in energy politics. The company is contributing funds to a campaign for a tax on carbon dioxide emissions, Bloomberg reported.Nuclear plants do require more safety measures. After the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan that severely damaged the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear plant, Exelon hardened its U.S. plants. Nuclear waste is a pesky problem, too.Exelon said this month it is shutting down in October the 50-year-old Oyster Creek nuclear power plant outside Philadelphia. It's just one of many coal and nuclear plants scheduled for shutdown across the industry.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseExelon serves 10 million customers through its subsidiaries in Illinois, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Washington, D.C. and Maryland. Besides nuclear power, it also has gas, wind, solar and hydroelectric generating plants.The stock is trying to clear resistance around 41.50 to 42 on its chart. Although Exelon has formed many bases in the past several years, the stock normally makes small gains from its breakouts. That's fairly typical of utility stocks, which are prized more for their dividends than their share appreciation.Exelon pays a quarterly dividend of 34.5 cents a share, which computes to an annualized dividend yield of 3.3%.Since the company slashed its dividend from 52.5 cents to 31 cents in 2013, the payout has been raised each year starting in 2016, according to Exelon's website. The utility's goal is to raise dividends 5% each year through 2020.The corporate tax cut is expected to increase EPS by 10 cents a share in 2019, and to result in savings to customers of more than $500 million a year.RELATED:This Dividend Stock Won't Put You To SleepHigh-Yielding Oil Stocks Mixed Amid Recent Crude Oil VolatilityThe Latest Inside Investor's Corner

4,EXC,"For those looking for the best dividend stocks in 2018, the Utility Leaders screen may prove disappointing right now. The list remains scant, with just six stocks as of the end of Friday's trading. They include Exelon (EXC), featured in this column on May 12 and in IBD Weekly.FirstEnergy (FE) doesn't make the current screen. One possible reason why: It could be the decline in cash payouts in recent years, as calculated by William O'Neil + Co. But the Akron, Ohio-based company makes up for that negative factor with plenty of positive ones.Consider FirstEnergy's 3-year Earnings Stability Factor, a very respectable 7 on a scale of zero (highly stable) to 99 (highly volatile). Income investors want to focus on companies that do not see big fluctuations in profits. Stable profits boost the odds that a company will sustain or even increase its dividend paid out per share.Second, the stock's annualized dividend yield of 4.2% nearly makes an embarrassment of the S&P 500's 1.8% yield.FirstEnergy is set to pay 36 cents a share Friday to shareholders of record May 7. The company has delivered that quarterly cash dividend for more than four years in a row. But it marks a decline from the 55 cents per share that First Energy paid for many years through December 2013.On April 23, FirstEnergy reported non-GAAP earnings of 67 cents a share, up 29% vs. a year ago, as revenue increased 4% to $2.98 billion""Eighteen months ago, we announced our plan to move away from commodity-exposed generation, so our company could fully focus on the tremendous opportunities in our regulated businesses,"" Charles E. Jones, FirstEnergy president and chief executive officer, said in a news release. ""Today, we are pleased to report strong earnings that represent FirstEnergy as a fully regulated company, and to reaffirm our guidance and growth projections.""FirstEnergy also raised its full-year non-GAAP profit forecast to a range of $2.25-$2.55 a share. The midpoint of that range would mark a 15% decline vs. the $2.82 it earned in 2017.The stock on Tuesday halted a five-day winning streak and closed a hair beneath its rising 50-day moving average. FirstEnergy shares are up 11.4% since Jan. 1.Watch to see if the stock musters the strength to not only retake the medium-term support and resistance line but also overcome overhead selling near 35 to 36.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary and analysis on stocks, charts, and financial markets.)RELATED:The Current Utility Stock LeadersIPO Leaders

5,EXC,"In a discussion of the best utility stocks, Exelon (EXC) deserves serious consideration.The best utility stocks are often known for solid dividend yields. Exelon has one at around 3.4% annualized. The company announced a dividend of 34.5 cents a share on May 1, payable June 8 to shareholders of record May 15.Exelon is one of two names in IBD's diversified utilities group included in Friday's Utility Leaders screen. The other is Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG). Diversified utilities provide customers with a wide range of utilities, including electricity, natural gas and water.Exelon's six utilities provide electricity and natural gas to about 10 million customers in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. The company also serves about 4 million customers in northern Illinois. That's about 70% of the state's population.Exelon is also a big power generator. It boasts more than 32,700 megawatts of nuclear, gas, wind, solar and hydroelectric generating capacity.Due to a constantly evolving energy industry, the company continues to innovate. That's resulted in one of the cleanest and low-cost power generation fleets in the U.S. Exelon is also developing fuel cell projects, zero-emission natural gas plants and microgrids.After three straight quarters of earnings declines, profit growth has ramped up in the past two quarters. When the company reported Q1 results on May 2, quarterly profit jumped 50% from the year-ago quarter. Sales increased 11% to $9.69 billion, nice acceleration from 6% growth in Q4.As part of its Q1 press release, the company cited more than $500 million in ongoing annual savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Chart-wise, Exelon looks pretty darn good. The weekly charts shows a shallow, cup-with-handle base with a 41.66 entry.RELATED:Best Utility Stocks To Buy And WatchThis Utility's Stock Chart Is Unimpressive, But Its Dividend Is RichHow 875 Miles Of Steel Pipe Will Turn To Plastic

11,EXC,"The Trump tax cuts were met with bleak poll numbers and high skepticism among Americans about their tilt in favor of corporations and the highest-income groups. Yet barely two weeks after passage, roughly 1 million workers have been awarded bonuses that companies attribute to the GOP tax legislation, according to a running list by Americans for Tax Reform, and a few million more are in line to get small cuts in their utility bills.X Still others will benefit from bigger corporate matches for 401(k) accounts, as well as a new $15 minimum wage adopted by at least 20 banks, including Wells Fargo (WFC), U.S. Bancorp (USB) and PNC Financial Services (PNC), in the wake of tax cuts.Among the biggest announcements have been $1,000 bonus awards by American Airlines (AAL) (127,000 employees); AT&T (T) (200,000); Bank of America (BAC) (145,000); Comcast (CMCSA) (100,000); Southwest Airlines (LUV) (55,000); and U.S. Bancorp (60,000). The generosity of those announcements was undercut somewhat by reports that AT&T and Comcast were in the midst of layoffs.Meanwhile, a number of electric utilities have announced plans to cut power bills, sharing their tax-cut windfall. Customers of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) subsidiary Pacificorp and Exelon (EXC) subsidiaries Pepco, Baltimore Gas & Electric, and Commonwealth Edison stand to benefit.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Even before the tax cuts begin to show up in paychecks in February, take-home pay has been surging at a rate that's almost unmatched since recession hit in 2007, the exception being a spurt that coincided with 2017's bonus season that runs through the end of March.Over the past 10 weeks, federal withheld employment and income taxes have surged 7.4% from the same period a year ago, an IBD analysis of Daily Treasury Statements finds. That's far faster than the roughly 5% growth in tax receipts implied by 2.5% average wage gains and the roughly 2% growth trend in aggregate hours worked in the economy, so bonuses and other incentive pay likely explain the surge to a large extent.The big political question is whether such displays of corporate generosity begin to shift sentiment about the Republicans' legislative achievement and improve GOP prospects in the midterm elections. From an economic standpoint, the question is how fast will the economy grow in 2018 and how much growth will result from this instant gratification from tax cuts.Most economists have fairly moderate expectations for growth this year, with JPMorgan Chase's economics team seeing 2.5% GDP growth in 2018, thanks to a 0.3-percentage-point lift from tax cuts. But JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said on Tuesday that he thinks ""4% economic growth this year is possible.""YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Congress OKs Trump Tax Cuts; These Companies Are Celebrating The MostFederal Reserve Gives Trump Tax Cuts A Green LightHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

15,EXC,"Electric utility stocks reacted with cautious optimism this week, while coal stocks showed only a spotty enthusiasm after Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt announced Monday plans to repeal the agency's Clean Power Plan.

"
16,EXC,"America is blessed with a diverse portfolio of energy resources. We rank first in the world in oil and natural gas production, No. 1 in nuclear power generation, No. 1 in renewable energy, and No. 2 in coal output.Indeed, abundant and relatively cheap energy provides much of the basis for our global competitive advantages. What's more, competition between fuels helps to hold down energy prices for households and businesses.In an ideal world, all energy resources would compete on a level playing field; but in the real world, energy markets are rife with subsidies. Perhaps the most egregious are those afforded wind and solar installations, currently receiving direct federal subsidies of about $12 billion per year in addition to a wide range of state and local tax breaks.Yet after more than 20 years of such largesse, wind and solar currently provide a mere 6% of the nation's electric power generation.Apologists for the renewable industry continue to claim that the oil and gas industry receives subsidies dwarfing those going to wind and solar. But they conflate ""tax deductions"" with ""direct subsidies."" Tax deductions for oil and gas aren't special favors but rather the standard relief afforded all manufacturers and mining companies to help recognize the costs of operations.By contrast, subsidies are a direct cash transfer from the government — i.e., taxpayers — to businesses.In any case, the roughly $3 billion per year in tax deductions taken by the oil and gas industry is a tiny price to pay for the huge benefits this sector produces for the economy and the $86 million in taxes the industry pays daily to the U.S. Treasury.Now the nuclear power industry, facing strong competition from less expensive natural-gas-fired generation, is begging for subsidies. For example, last year New York offered a huge subsidy to Exelon (EXC) to keep open two nuclear plants located upstate. The state Public Service Commission estimates that the subsidies will cost ratepayers at least $6 billion over the next 12 years. Ironically, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is pushing ahead with his plan to shut down the Indian Point nuclear plant north of New York City by 2021.(Meanwhile, Exelon announced this week that it would close its Pennsylvania-based Three-Mile Island nuclear plant in 2019 because the state is refusing to make alternative-energy subsidies available. Pennsylvania has shown little political interest in subsidizing the Three-Mile Island facility, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown in 1979 that gained world media attention and set off a wide-ranging debate over nuclear safety).Illinois has also jumped into the nuclear subsidy game. Last summer, Exelon announced that, absent a rescue bill, it would close two nuclear plants by 2018. In response, the state legislature passed, and the governor signed, a bill in December that provides Exelon and Commonwealth Edison with a $235 million annual credit in each of the next 13 years.Not surprisingly, in February a group of Exelon's competitors filed a lawsuit against Illinois regulators claiming that the new state subsidy intrudes on federal authority over wholesale energy prices.Other states are joining the bandwagon. Nuclear subsidy legislation is currently being considered in Connecticut, a bill will soon be introduced in Ohio, and a subsidy scheme is being considered in New Jersey.Though advocates of nuclear subsidies claim that they'll only boost household electric bills by a few dollars per month, while ensuring that the state retains some of its ""zero emissions"" power generation, they neglect the long-term impact of higher utility costs on the state's businesses.For example, one recent study using a sophisticated input-output model found that higher power costs associated with Illinois' nuclear subsidy program would cost the state 43,000 jobs by 2030 and reduce state revenue by $420 million.Similarly, New York, already one of the most expensive states for operating a business, is likely to lose even more jobs in the years ahead as a result of its nuclear subsidies.Over time, consumers and businesses are best served by competitive power markets. This is why nearly two-thirds of the states have deregulated electricity and/or natural gas in recent years.Giving preference to one form of power generation over another through direct subsidies smacks of re-regulation and will invariably bring about higher costs for all electricity users.

17,EXC,"President-elect Donald Trump's advisors are looking at ways in which the U.S. government could help nuclear power generators being forced out of the electricity market by cheaper natural gas and renewable resources.In a document obtained by Bloomberg, Trump's transition team asked the Energy Department how it can help keep nuclear reactors ""operating as part of the nation's infrastructure"" and what it could do to prevent the shutdown of plants. Advisors also asked the agency whether there were any statutory restrictions in resuming work on Yucca Mountain, a proposed federal depository for nuclear waste in Nevada that was abandoned by the Obama administration.The list of questions to the Energy Department offers one of the clearest indications yet of Trump's potential plans for aiding America's battered nuclear power generators. Five of the country's nuclear plants have closed in the past five years, based on Energy Department data, and more are set to shut as cheaper supplies from gas-fired plants, wind and solar squeeze their profits.Media representatives for the Trump transition and Energy Department didn't immediately respond to calls and emails seeking comment.Some environmentalists have warned the closures could undermine efforts to combat climate change as nuclear reactors are the biggest source of zero-emissions power in the U.S. Plant owners including the nation's largest — Exelon (EXC) — have sought relief from state policymakers, with New York and Illinois among those that have approved millions in annual payments to keep reactors running.Among a list of questions the Trump team sent to the Energy Department was whether the agency has plans to resume the license proceedings for Yucca Mountain and how it can continue supporting the permitting of small modular reactors, seen as the next generation of nuclear technology.On Thursday, Entergy (ETR) announced that it'll shut the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan in 2018, adding to the growing list of reactors planning to retire early.Trump's administration could help the nuclear industry by offering new incentives or subsidies, but Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Rob Barnett called the prospect ""highly unlikely.""Barnett added: ""Another way to help nuclear, at least indirectly, would be a carbon tax. That's also likely a nonstarter.""Trump has voiced his support for nuclear power in the past. In a television interview with Fox News in 2011, he said he was ""very strongly in favor of nuclear energy,"" while stressing the need for safeguards at plants.Last month, the Washington trade group Nuclear Energy Institute congratulated Trump on the election and encouraged him to advance his support for the industry and maintain ""its indispensable role in our critical energy infrastructure and environmental interests.""

18,EXC,"Two heads can be better than one. Or, if not better, at least less volatile. For proof, look no further than $25.6 billion Fidelity Advisor New Insights Fund (FNIAX).The $25.6 billion portfolio, which is sold through financial advisors, is up 4.75% this year going into Monday. Its stablemate is $108.5 billion Contrafund (FCNTX). Both funds have marquee manager Will Danoff at the helm. New Insights — once a clone of Contrafund — has behaved differently since John Roth became co-manager three years ago.Contrafund's 9.27% average annual gain ranks in the top 1% of large-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the past 15 years. New Insight's 7.95% ranks in the top 38% over the past 10 years. But so far this year New Insights 4.75% gain is in the top 14% of the same peer group vs. top 38% for Contrafund's 2.62% gain.Roth's portfolio picks go a long way to explaining why two top-notch funds, sharing a lead manager, have performed differently in the short term. Roth and Danoff talk together a lot and powwow formally once a week. But they run separate sleeves of Insights' securities.Differences in their picks add diversification. ""That gives us more ability to weather volatility,"" Roth said.On Friday, New Insights had a trio of 2%-plus gainers, as Netflix (NFLX), Tesla Motors (TSLA) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) each tacked on more than two percentage points.Netflix announced a deal last week with Liberty Global (LBTYA) to expand its global footprint. That's a key goal as the company nears saturation in the U.S. Customers of the jumbo global cable operator will be able to access Netflix content via Liberty set top boxes, but Netflix will retain a billing relationship with viewers. Netflix has recently announced other deals with other cable operators, including Comcast (CMCSA). And this month it is slated to become the exclusive viewing platform for certain films made by Walt Disney (DIS).Tesla rose amid an intensifying friction with former BFF (best friends forever, as the kids say) Mobileye (MBLY). Tesla accused Mobileye of trying to throw a monkey wrench into its efforts to develop vision chips on its own. Mobileye said it ended its relationship with Tesla in July because the electric car maker was ""pushing the envelope in terms of safety.""Tesla said Mobileye bailed because Tesla was planning to rely more on radar systems and less on camera-based driver-assistance systems such as those developed by Mobileye.IBD'S TAKE: Our Ed Carson digs into details of the spiraling cat fight between Tesla and Mobileye in this report.Tesla's 6% share price surge Friday -- lifting it 6% for the entire week -- and Mobileye's pullback show which side investors favor in this feud.New Insights owns both stocks.As for UnitedHealth, its Friday rise was on good volume. The stock is shaping a flat base with a 144.58 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: To learn more about UnitedHealth's prognosis, see how it stacks up against other stocks in its industry at IBD's Stock Checkup.Roth says some stocks he likes today reflect his past experiences at the helms of Fidelity's sector funds focused on multimedia, chemicals and utilities. ""I'm opportunistic, with a growth bias and a valuation sensibility,"" he said.Roth, who also runs $3 billion New Millennium (FMILX), says he prefers fewer stocks in his sleeve of New Insights than Danoff. He also tilts more to midcaps. His eye on valuation recently has led Roth to beaten-down names in energy and financials.Among the names in New Insights that are not in Contrafund, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence: American International Group (AIG), Anadarko Petroleum (APC), Antero Resources (AR), Cabot Oil & Gas (COG), Chevron (CVX), Energy Transfer Equity (ETE), Exelon (EXC) and Morgan Stanley (MS).""I'm more of the energy guy,"" Roth said. ""I do think there are points in time when you want different cyclical groups.""Share prices of most of the energy names, for example, have yet to perk up a lot. But Roth says the conditions for a rebound are falling into place. U.S. production is sliding, he says, adding, ""Share prices are down, demand (for energy) is relatively good and we've seen a massive amount of capital come out of the space over the past 12 to 18 months. Rig count is down 40% to 60%. Hundreds of billions of dollars in exploration-and-production cap ex has come out.""Roth describes his thesis as of his latest disclosure for Diamondback Energy (FANG): ""We have bigger diversified companies, some service companies and smaller U.S.-focused E&Ps,"" he said. ""Diamondback is a classic one of those. It is an independent E&P with a good spot in the Permian Basin. It has great acreage that it will exploit at attractive costs.""Energy accounted for about 8% of New Insights' assets, its fifth-largest sector by weight, as of July 31. Contra has about 2% in the sector and New Millennium 16%.Technology, with a 26% weighting, is tops. The fund's top-three holdings are Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN).The fund has been trimming Facebook, but only to take profits and prevent the stake from getting too big. It was about 5% as of July 31. ""It's still our largest relative bet. It is our most important stock,"" said Roth.One leg of Facebook's appeal has been its success in shifting from a web focus to a mobile one. Another has been its success at remaining relevant to users through platforms like WhatsApp and Instagram. A third has been its ability to show advertisers the link between an ad and a sale. ""That's the ability to optimize ad campaigns and (let advertisers) see the return on investment,"" he said.Google is a similar story, Roth adds.Amazon's retail and music businesses do well, Roth says. But Amazon's key improvement is its AWS web services business. It wasn't until mid-2015 that Amazon broke out AWS' financial results. ""Investors were surprised by how profitable the business is,"" Roth said. ""It is a complete game-changer.""AWS has proved more attractive than rival services from Google, IBM (IBM) and Microsoft (MSFT), he adds.The cloud-services platform lets customers rent all the capacity they need at peak times, even if most of the time they need far less. Thus they avoid hefty capital expenditures.In summarizing their teamwork, Roth says that Danoff uses more small starting positions in individual stocks. Roth makes bigger initial buys. ""Our process keeps evolving,"" Roth said. ""I'm excited about it.""RELATED:Diamondback Dominates Shale-Rich Permian Basin With Conservative DealsHow Fidelity Contrafund Manager Will Danoff Played The DownturnP-s-s-st!

20,EXC,"Among investors in the largest U.S. companies, no pay package is less popular than the one given to Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) Chief Executive Officer Steven Temares.Only 23% of the shares of the housewares retailer were voted in support of its compensation plan at an annual meeting on July 1, the lowest level in the S&P 500 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Shareholders told the board that the CEO's $19.4 million pay for 2015 was too high, and that his performance goals weren't challenging enough, the Union, N.J.-based company said in its May proxy statement.New York Comptroller Scott Stringer, representing city pension funds, weighed in on the matter with a letter to Bed, Bath & Beyond investors. There's a ""gaping and persistent disconnect between CEO pay and company performance,"" he wrote. The retirement funds, with $160 billion in assets, are among the company's 60 largest shareholders.Bed, Bath & Beyond, which sells everything from coffee to accent rugs, is reducing Temares' target compensation by 14% for 2016 and is making his performance goals more rigorous, according to its proxy statement. Janet Barth, a spokeswoman, declined to comment beyond the regulatory filing.Shareholder disapproval of Bed, Bath & Beyond's pay practices contrasts with a falling number of businesses that fail in so-called say-on-pay votes. About 1% of S&P 500 companies have lost in their most recent nonbinding votes, and the average support level is 93%, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Temares' 2015 package was his largest ever, even as shares fell by more than a third. His pay tops that awarded to Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) CEO John Stumpf and approaches that given to IBM's (IBM) Virginia Rometty. The awards include a $4 million salary and $15.7 million in stock and options. That was an increase of about $1.1 million from his 2014 package. The exact amount of stock that 57-year-old Temares will receive may change depending on how Bed, Bath & Beyond performs against a group of 47 other companies on earnings and return-on-capital measures.A University of Pennsylvania law graduate who primarily worked in real estate, Temares joined Bed, Bath & Beyond in 1992 before its debut on public exchanges to oversee property transactions as it expanded. Its footprint has grown to more than 1,500 stores from 62 two decades ago. He was promoted to CEO in 2003, earning a $931,000 salary during his first year in the top job.Bed, Bath & Beyond's pay plan also failed with investors last year. The company determined it would make some changes after contacting 25 investors representing 68% of shares, the chain said in the May 31 proxy.Temares' target compensation was reduced to $16.9 million for 2016 in a plan that will be voted on next year. His $4 million salary, the third-largest in the S&P index, will stay the same. He receives the large salary in lieu of a smaller one and a potential bonus, because ""cash bonuses promote short-term thinking,"" according to the filing.Still, Institutional Shareholder Services describes the CEO's salary as ""excessive"" and notes that it could bloat his golden parachute to $46 million if the company gets bought. The proxy adviser gave Bed, Bath & Beyond a rating of 10, its worst governance score, meaning its structure may have a greater probability of risks to its reputation, long-term value or fiduciary obligations.Bed, Bath & Beyond is joined by car-parts maker BorgWarner (BWA), chemical producer FMC Corp. (FMC), mall operator General Growth Properties (GGP), and utilities owner Exelon (EXC) in receiving less than 50% support in its most recent vote. Representatives of Exelon and BorgWarner said the companies take the votes seriously and are seeking investor feedback. The other companies didn't return requests for comment.In addition to Bed, Bath & Beyond, only Oracle (ORCL) has received less than 50% support in two consecutive years. The Redwood City, Calif.-based software maker is on its fourth failed year. Deborah Hellinger, an Oracle spokeswoman, declined to comment.Stringer noted Bed, Bath & Beyond's compensation committee members Dean Adler, Stanley Barshay and Victoria Morrison have each served on the board for more than 13 years, which ""highlights the need for new directors that are able to exercise strong, independent oversight of management."" Each received about 65% support after calls by Stringer and ISS to oust them. The committee doesn't have a chair, which is rare.

21,EXC,"Propelled by the overall market, U.S. diversified stock mutual funds notched a 0.78% gain on average in April. The month's modest gain was far better than the losses of January and February.But it lagged the 1.7% gain by the average U.S. taxable bond fund tracked by Lipper Inc.Going forward, mutual fund managers expect more volatility, and many are looking for stocks with stable earnings growth that can thrive without a tailwind from a robust economy.In the just-completed month, multicap value funds did best among the mutual fund market capitalization and style categories.The key impetus was the Federal Reserve's dovish stance on interest rate hikes.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month Leaders In a late March speech, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the central bank would ""proceed cautiously in adjusting policy"" in 2016. In its April meeting, the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee stuck by Yellen's March outlook and declined again to raise rates.""Economic activity appears to have slowed,"" the FOMC said, adding that household spending had ""moderated.""Those statements told investors that the Fed thinks U.S. economic growth is slower than previously believed. Slower growth and slower rate hikes mean a weaker U.S. dollar.""That helps U.S. exporters, which is good news for many U.S. large-cap stocks,"" said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer of Charles Schwab Investment Management.And a weaker dollar lowers the cost of paying off debt for most emerging markets, making it easier for them buy goods and services from the U.S. and others.Putting it bluntly, the Fed did not want to break a fragile U.S. economy by raising the price of money. ""The more dovish tone by the Fed brought down market volatility and helped support all of the assets that have been hurt in anticipation of Fed rate hikes,"" said Mark Hamilton, chief investment officer for asset allocation at OppenheimerFunds.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance Jittery investors lifted precious metals funds 28.76% in April, best among sectors. Energy funds and natural resources funds, which had lost 41.45% and 20.54% respectively in the two years that ended March 31, were the next-best-performing April sectors, jumping 11.62% and 10.46% last month.World equity funds gained 1.33% in April, led by Latin American funds' 6.59% leap up.Taxable bond funds were paced by high-yield funds' 2.89% advance. With investors willing to take on risk, safe-haven general U.S. Treasury funds slipped 0.33%.""I expect mediocre returns and a fair amount of volatility going forward,"" Hamilton said. When the Fed finally does get around to its next rate hike, volatility is likely to rise, he said.Broadly, he expects the U.S. economy to outperform for several quarters. That should benefit U.S. large caps.James Abate, chief investment officer of Centre Funds and manager of $158 million Centre American Select Equity (DHAMX), expects a reversal of the recent months' rotation into value away from growth.""Materials, energy, industrials and other cyclical sectors are likely to reverse,"" Abate said. ""So we've taken the opportunity to amplify our positions in stable-growth-type companies, Nifty 50 type names. Key stocks for us are names like Amazon (AMZN), PepsiCo (PEP), Exelon (EXC) and Carnival Cruise (CCL). We sold the one energy stock that we held.""Amazon is the epitome of what he's looking for. ""It is strong and has a unique business model that can grow regardless of the economic backdrop,"" he said.Exelon is a utility with low cyclicality, he said. Its current return on equity is about 9%. ""This is roughly half its 15 year median return on equity,"" he said. ""We see incremental ROE moving higher with plenty of room to expand. With the Pepco (acquisition) closing, we see an increased focus on cost-cutting and rate relief in the regulated utility units contributing to profit margin expansion, with a strong balance sheet to allow future dividend hikes and buybacks.""Equally good, the stock is virtually unaffected by economic developments in Japan or Europe, he said.He also likes the idea that Carnival has almost nowhere to go but up from its depressed profit margins and returns on capital.And he adds Merck (MRK), which he calls another low-cyclicality, defensive name. ""It's got a strong drug pipeline,"" he said. ""It's seeing improvements in return on assets. It can be another Nifty 50 name.""Abate has stayed underweight in energy, industrials and financials. ""In materials, our exposure is to companies that are capable of growing and are not dependent on an acceleration in the global economy,"" he said. In that area, his names include Vulcan Materials (VMC) and International Flavors & Fragrances (IFF).Abate says value stocks are unlikely to add a lot to gains they've scored already this year. ""So I'm embracing companies that are more stable and less sensitive to the ups and downs of the economic cycle,"" he said.He also does not rule out a correction of 20% to 25% some time during 2016, and his fund has hedged that possibility with put options.""Profits are disappointing,"" he said. ""Profit margins are decelerating. And there's a poor top-line revenue outlook. It's hard to see price-earnings multiples expand further.""Like Aguilar, Abate expects volatility the rest of this year. The best gains should be confined to a narrow band of stocks, he says. ""With bond yields low and other asset classes disappointing, we'll see a new Nifty 50 do well,"" he said. ""Diversification is good, but over-diversification can be bad. We're down to 52, down from the mid-60s in 2013.""Polaris Capital Management's Bernard Horn, lead or co-manager of five funds totaling $3.4 billion in assets, is concerned about the impact of sluggish economic growth. He used volatility in recent months to buy shares in larger U.S. and foreign banks at depressed prices, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM). ""The valuation became compelling,"" he said.He also added to asset manager Franklin Resources (BEN). ""They have great long-term performance, but have slumped in the last three to five years. We saw an opportunity to buy into a good long-term franchise with a lot of cash on its balance sheet. They have a relatively low tax rate because they have managers who sit offshore, like Mark Mobius,"" who's based in Hong Kong as executive chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets Group.Horn also added to Web.com Group (WEB), which creates and maintains websites for small businesses. ""They help small businesses get onto social media sites,"" he said. ""A business they just bought does sophisticated marketing and lead-generation for customers.""Another he added to was electronics and technology distributor Avnet (AVT), a company which also assembles products for customers. ""They've got a good management team that squeezes out free cash flow and value-added services for customers,"" Horn said.In Q1, he added to Thailand-based Siam Commercial Bank. The investment may not ripen quickly, he says. ""The Thai economy is a little soft now, so this may take time to play out,"" he said.

22,EXC,"For a few exchange traded funds at crucial points on their charts, some major earnings announcements this week hold the potential for pivotal moves.Funds in health care, utilities, consumer and solar energy are poised to climb past ceilings. With major pieces of those ETFs releasing quarterly reports, significant moves could loom.To be sure, because ETFs are pools of stocks, the performance of a single component has a limited impact on the whole fund. Yet a blowout report or big disappointment can change the course of a sector ETF. For example, Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) gapped down 2% on April 22 -- the fund’s largest percentage move since March 1 -- after Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL), two of the fund’s top five holdings, slid on weak quarterly results.The Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) ETF finds itself in a critical spot as it tries to regain its footing after dropping below its 50-day moving average. Its success in rising from that key level rests partly on how three companies will fare with their latest reports.Duke Energy (DUK), the ETF’s second-largest holding at more than 8% of the whole fund, is reporting Q1 results Tuesday before the open. Analysts expect a profit of $1.14 a share as the Charlotte, N.C.-based utility continues an uneven profit performance.On Wednesday, Dominion Resources (D) releases its earnings at 10 a.m. ET. The consensus estimate is 94 cents a share. Exelon (EXC) comes out with results Friday at 11 a.m. ET, and Wall Street is expecting a profit of 68 cents a share. Dominion and Exelon account for 7% and 5.4% of the fund, respectively.A lot of the top companies in the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) ETF have already reported, but two big ones are on deck this week.Pfizer (PFE) reports Tuesday and Merck (MRK) on Thursday before the open. The drugmakers are the second- and third-largest components of the ETF, which is nearing a key level. Shares are approaching the December peak at 73.16. A move above that level would be bullish.Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR’s (XLY) second-largest component, Home Depot (HD), will announce May 17. Disney (DIS) releases its results after the close on May 10. Both heavyweights account for about 7% of the ETF and are among its top three holdings. The ETF is climbing toward new highs as it makes a steady advance.Guggenheim Solar’s (TAN) largest component, SolarCity (SCTY), releases first-quarter earnings after the market’s close May 9. The solar panel installer accounts for more than 7% of the ETF. The fund’s chart is testing resistance around 25, a level that it must conquer if it’s to continue a recovery from a deep decline.

23,EXC,"Based on performance, foreign and global stock funds are worth trolling for individual stock investment ideas and as someplace you can invest part of the diversified portion of your overall portfolio.World stock mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. are outperforming U.S. diversified stock mutual funds so far this year, going into Thursday. World stock funds averaged a 0.31% gain year-to-date. U.S. diversified stock funds were down 0.36% on average.Anticipating investor appetite in this space, Loomis Sayles just launched its Global Growth Fund (LSGGX), run by marquee manager Aziz Hamzaogullari.One key tactic for outperformance has been investing in companies that are dominant in their space or niches.The $1.3 billion Russell Global Infrastructure (RGIAX) -- whose 8.62% gain so far this year puts it among the best performing funds in the world stock fund category -- holds several names doing that.OHL Mexico manages toll roads and is involved in running Toluca International Airport. Shares are up 50% so far this year.Earnings per share rose 3% in the latest quarter, after having fallen in three of the prior four stanzas.Companhia de Saneamento Basico do Estado de Sao Paulo (SBS) is a Brazilian company supplying water and sanitation to 364 municipalities in Sao Paulo, covering residential, commercial, industrial, public and wholesale customers.Its ADRs are up 44% so far this year, but trading below 10. EPS growth soared 750% in the fourth quarter after declining for eight frames.With its global focus, this fund also gives investors exposure to U.S. stocks. Utility Exelon (EXC), which operates nuclear and conventional power-generation facilities in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Illinois, is up 29% so far this year.To keep up long-term outperformance, some funds focus on minimizing losses during down markets.Brown Capital Management's Martin Steinik, a manager of $34.2 million International Equity (BCIIX) and $2.8 million International Small Company (BCSFX), says he has aimed to do that by focusing on high-margin companies in consumer categories, technology and health care. ""And we've shied away from capital intensive commodity stocks, raw materials and banks -- money is a commodity,"" he said. ""And we look for quality on a balance sheet. We don't like companies with a lot of leverage.""In any environment, Steinik and his teammates look for companies that are dominant in their space.That's led the fund to such names as Checkpoint Software (CHKP). The Israeli provider of Internet security software, hardware and services is up 6% so far this year. Demand for its products and services has helped keep EPS growth at 11% to 13% for four quarters.Kone Oyj is a Finland-based provider of elevators, escalators and other machinery and services. Shares are up 7% this year. EPS grew 0%, 22% and 79% the past three quarters.Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk is a dominant provider of insulin for treatment of diabetes. Shares are down 10% so far this year.Many world stock funds are small. The average asset size of funds in Morningstar's world-stock category is $1.2 billion. But 45% of the 335 funds in this category have less than $100 million in assets.

24,EXC,"Mark Finn never saw a market sell-off he didn't like. As portfolio manager of the $21.2 billion T. Rowe Price Value Fund (TRVLX), Finn often uses the dips to set up long-term positions in his mutual fund.The recent December-to-January stock market pullback presented its own set of opportunities for Finn. ""It has been a GDP-scare sell-off,"" he said ""People are worried the economy might tip back into a recession, so cyclicality is on sale right now. What I am looking for in particular are companies where I can get a really attractive dividend yield and (which) generate a lot of free cash flow and (which have) been cheapened because they're perceived to be cyclical business.""Finn is ready to pick his spots should more pullbacks occur in the months ahead. ""I am not overly optimistic about the market overall,"" he said. ""If we end the year flat to where we began, I think that would be as expected. In the interim, I'm getting chances to buy some really good companies with dividend yields of close to 5% that are trading at P/E multiples of 9 or 10 times.""T. Rowe Price Value was down 5.79% year to date going into Thursday vs. declines of 5.61% for its large-cap value peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and 5.25% for the S&P 500. Over the past five years, the mutual fund has returned an annual average of 9.90%, beating its peers' 7.58% but trailing the S&P 500's 10.46%.The fund carries an IBD 36-Month Performance Rating of A-, meaning it's among the top 10% of all mutual funds in three-year performance.Finn relies upon a robust team of research analysts to help with fundamental stock picking. “We are opportunistically trying to identify and invest in quality companies that are facing some controversy or perceived controversy that we have determined are trading below intrinsic value,” he said. “When we have a good idea, we make it a big position to accrue to the benefit of our shareholders.”As of the end of 2015, General Electric (GE) was T. Rowe Price Value's top holding. Finn is optimistic that GE’s renewed focus on its industrial businesses will help increase margins over time. ""It has been one of the best-performing industrial companies over the last one, three and five years,"" he said. ""I think GE is going to continue to relatively outperform in industrials. They have really figured out what their mission is.""GE has seen its stock price climb 15.9% over the past year. The shares were up almost 1% in the stock market today.Pfizer (PFE), another top holding, has sunk 16% below its 52-week high. ""It has fallen back because of its Allergan (AGN) acquisition, but Pfizer is a phenomenal company with a really nice pipeline of products, and it now has a really good yield,"" Finn said.Pfizer is down 13% from a year ago, but sports a 4.0% dividend yield.In the energy sector, Finn has a favorable outlook for Exelon (EXC). ""It has a great dividend yield, and it looks like there may be a cyclical bottom coming in energy,"" he said.Shares of Exelon yield 4.0% and have gained 12% so far this year.Holdings that Finn sees as undervalued also include International Paper (IP) and AES (AES). “These are companies trading at around a 5% dividend yield, and the market perceives them as being cyclical and risky, but I really don't,” he said.

54,EXC,"Mergers and acquisitions of U.S. companies this year have exceeded their pre-crisis peak, according to a report Thursday from Mergermarket.U.S. deals announced through the third quarter were valued at $1.1 trillion, up 13.6% from the same period in the peak year of 2006, the M&A researcher said.Activity in energy, mining and utilities topped all sectors, with $216.5 billion of the $1.1 trillion in U.S.-targeted deals. That was up from $94.4 billion in 2013's same period.Activity in the sector was led by three separate transactions from Kinder Morgan entities, valued at $79.4 billion, including Kinder Morgan's (KMI) $58.8 billion pending buyout of master limited partnership Kinder Morgan Energy Partners (KMP).The buyout will eliminate incentive distributions and lower Kinder's cost of capital, according to a separate report from Morningstar, which called energy pipeline and terminal giant Kinder the ""granddaddy"" of MLPs.Another large U.S. deal in that sector: Exelon's (EXC) pending takeover of Pepco Holdings (POM), valued at $12.2 billion.

65,EXC,"Exelon Corporation (EXC  -  Free Report) announced that its subsidiary, Constellation, along with United Renewable Energy LLC have completed a 1.8 megawatt (MW) solar generation project located at Hunter Farms, in Jakin, GA.This solar project will consist of 5,305 photovoltaic panels fitted in a tracking solar array and operate under a 30-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), with Constellation selling all energy and environmental attributes to Georgia Power.Constellation is focused on expanding its renewable energy generation in Georgia. It presently owns and operates nearly 17.8 MW solar projects in Georgia. Last year, the company along with United Renewable Energy completed a 1 MW solar project in Georgia, and its entire production had been sold to Georgia Power under a 30-year PPA.Rising Importance of RenewablesDespite efforts from the new administration to safeguard interest of the coal-fired unit, it is quite clear that demand for coal as an energy source is on the decline, and the void will be filled up by natural gas and renewable sources.The latest report from U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) indicates that energy consumption from renewable sources will increase 3.8% to 11.431 quadrillion Btu in 2018 and 2.9% to 11.766 quadrillion Btu in 2019. Per the EIA report, production from solar power will also increase 19.9% to 0.928 quadrillion Btu in 2018 and 18% to 1.095 quadrillion Btu in 2019.Focus on Storage FacilitiesUtility space in the United States is evolving and its emphasis on renewable generation is quite evident. Since the renewable sources like solar and wind were not able to produce electricity 24x7 like the conventional fossil or nuclear power plants, it has become essential to develop battery storage facilities.Battery storage facilities store power produced from renewable sources and supply them to the grid when there is high demand. Battery storage will increase reliability of the entire power distribution operation and lower dependence on fossil-fuel generation.Exelon has also invested in the new energy storage technology through Volta Energy Technologies. In addition, other large utilities like American Electric Power (AEP  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy (DUK  -  Free Report) have also invested to develop energy storage facilities.Per an EIA release, the United States had 742 MWh of energy in operational large-scale battery capacity at the end of 2017.  Given the increasing production from renewables and decreasing cost to install storage facilities, we expect more such facilities to come up in the United States.  Price MovementIn a year’s time, Exelon has returned 10.8% against its industry’s decline of 9.6%.Zacks Rank & Key PickExelon currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

71,EXC,"The Q1 earnings season is past the halfway mark, with 267 S&P 500 members having already reported their quarterly results as of Apr 27. Going by the positive trends, the first quarter is poised to record the strongest earnings and revenue growth in seven years. Earnings for the S&P 500 members that have already reported are up 25.1% from the same period last year on 10.0% higher revenues, with 76.8% beating EPS estimates and 73.8% surpassing revenues.Per our latest Earnings Preview report, overall earnings in the first quarter for all the S&P 500 members are expected to be up 22.6% on 8.4% growth in revenues.Amid the positive earnings outlook for the first quarter, let’s concentrate on the domestic-focused matured Zacks Utility sector. This sector, along with 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors, is likely to come up with improved year-over-year earnings. Currently, only the Autos sector is likely to register an earnings decline.The Utility sector’s earnings are expected to increase 13.9% year over year on 1.4% growth in revenues, thanks to stable performance by most of the utilities. The need for heating, stemming from cold weather conditions, and increased demand for electricity aided the utilities. Additionally, tax reforms also helped the utilities in lowering their tax burden substantially.Utilities, apart from investing in generating plants that produce electricity with low and negligible amount of emissions, are also focused on improving and upgrading transmission and distribution networks. Utilities are also investing in power storage facilities and guiding investors for efficient usage of electricity.  However, the rate-sensitive capital-intensive utility stocks are also accommodating the rate hikes. Notably, the Fed rate has now been raised for the sixth time (latest in March 2018) since the first hike in December 2015.Let’s take a look at the Utility stocks, scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on May 2and see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (PNW  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 90% in the last reported quarter.

72,EXC,"Exelon Corporation (EXC  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 earnings before the opening bell on May 2. The utility reported a negative earnings surprise of 11.29% in the previous quarter.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.Factors to ConsiderExelon expects first-quarter earnings in the range of 90 cents-$1.00 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 93 cents, reflecting a 43.1% increase from the year-ago quarter. We believe that the rate hikes received from Commonwealth Edison Company, effective Jan 1, 2018, will have a positive impact on Exelon’s performance.  This rate hike will result in an increase in annual revenues by $95.6 million.Exelon is expected to benefit from its cost management initiatives and its strong free cash flow generation capacity will allow it to lower debt levels and increase its dividend by 5% annually over 2017- 2020 time frame.Exelon Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Exelon Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Exelon Corporation QuoteEarnings WhisperA stock needs to have both a positive  Earnings ESP   and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates and at present, Exelon does not have the right combination.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is -0.47%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 92 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is 93 cents.Zacks Rank: Exelon carries a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of a favorable Zacks Rank and a negative ESP makes a positive surprise unlikely this season.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks in the Zacks Utility Power industry that are expected to report a positive earnings surprise. Investors can consider the following stocks from the same space this season.WEC Energy Group Inc. (WEC  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter earnings on May 1.

74,EXC,"The lull in the markets with sporadic price swings is over. This year, the U.S. stock market has seen three of the Dow's major daily point drop in its 122-year history, including the 1,175-point record fall on Feb 5. Last Friday’s 572-point collapse has been another nail in the coffin. The U.S. stocks are witnessing massive volatility as investors apprehend a trade war from the bitter exchanges between the Unites States and China over tariffs.Hedge Against UncertaintyIn an attempt to calm investors' frayed nerves, selecting stocks from the defensive utility space seems prudent. Rising urbanization and an ever-expanding global population show how indispensable electricity and utility services are with basically no viable substitute. This lends revenues and cash flow of such companies a high level of stability and visibility.Utilities have long been a staple for low-risk income investors. This is specifically true for those that live off dividends during retirement as most utilities have long track records of highly secure and gradually growing dividends, courtesy of their stable cash flows.In fact, in the recent tumultuous times, the Dow Jones Utility Average index has gained 2.9% in the past month against 5.5% decline of the Dow and 6.5% fall of the S&P 500.Should a Rate Hike Vex Investors?In the past decade, record low interest rates have acted as a tailwind, helping electric, water, and gas companies borrow at reduced interest rates.On Mar 21, the Federal Reserve or Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point to the range of 1.5% to 1.75% in its first policy meeting under the new chief Jerome Powell. This is the sixth time since the first hike was announced in December 2015 when the U.S. economy had pulled itself out of the Great Recession. The central bank also indicated that there will be at least two more hikes in 2018, highlighting its rising confidence that tax cuts and government spending will boost the economy.Interest rates are now rising and as the pace of increases will potentially accelerate in the coming years, many investors are worried about how utilities will do in the days ahead. Rising rates could drive financing costs and reduce their appeal as dividend investments.Although it is true that utilities are likely to face the above-mentioned headwinds, it doesn’t mean that there is a dearth of long-term opportunities in this sector. Here, investors need to understand the underlying quality of the utility stocks they own. The best utility companies in a higher interest rate environment are those that are able to gain regulatory approval to bump up the rates they charge from customers.Per the latest report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the annual average U.S. residential electricity price is expected to increase 2.1% in 2018 and 3% in 2019. Electricity prices are also projected to increase in the commercial and industrial sectors. This will surely give a boost to electric utility operators as such a price surge will drive profits for utilities and enhance dividend payouts.Again, President Trump’s repeal of the regulations (as imposed by President Obama) on economic growth grounds are expected to give a new lease of life to utilities that produce a major part of their electricity from coal. After all, Coal still accounts for nearly 30% of the electricity produced in the United States.Meanwhile, the utility sector is undergoing a massive transition with more focus on clean energy generation. The relaxed emission regulations under the Trump administration are likely to act as a driving factor for the sector. Stable operations, highly visible revenues and cash flows, combined with the sector’s income/yield attributes are some of its key features.There has been increasing focus on electricity storage facilities that will provide more support to the grid during peak demand period. Utilities are also regularly investing in infrastructure to better serve customers.Investing in Utilities: Our ChoicesUtility stocks with a low beta make for a judicious investment approach at this time. Beta, also known as the beta coefficient, measures the volatility of a stock in comparison to broader markets. It measures the extent to which a stock’s return may be affected or how much the price can fluctuate owing to market conditions. Stocks having a beta ranging from 0 to 1 mainly show less volatility than the broader markets.So, risk-averse investors would prefer to neutralize losses with low correlation beta as they are less prone to day-to-day fluctuations. For these investors, we have handpicked five low-beta stocks that also carry a favorable rank, making them potential investment options. These stocks carry either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) as we expect them to outperform peers in the near future.

75,EXC,"Entergy Corp.’s (ETR  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Entergy New Orleans, has recently received the New Orleans City Council’s approval to construct a natural-gas fired power plant in the city. Notably, this latest development is in sync with the company’s efforts to include renewable energy in its generation resource portfolio for diversification.About the Plant The New Orleans power station, composed of seven natural gas-fired reciprocating engines, comes with an electricity generation capacity worth 128 megawatt (MW). Entergy expects the plant to commence its services by January 2020.Entergy will invest $210 million in this project, which includes transmission and other project-related costs and contingency. Moreover, it expects to issue a full notice to proceed to the engineering, procurement and construction contractor by end of March 2018.Impressively, the reciprocating engines installed in this plant have self-start capability, thus enabling the company to start the unit even when there is no power on the electric grid. These engines will also help in grid stability and storm restoration by providing a local source of power generation. Markedly, the New Orleans Power Station will use minimal groundwater.Economic Benefits of the PlantApart from generating clean energy, the power plant will help in boosting New Orleans’ economic development. According to Louisiana economist, Dr. Loren Scott, the plant's construction phase will generate new business sales worth $206 million in Orleans Parish and new household earnings worth more than $28 million in for parish residents.Moreover, during the construction, an average of 92 people will get employment per year while the Orleans Parish treasury will gain approximately $1 million in the form of new sales taxes into. On completion, the plant will employ approximately 20 people.Our ViewAfter realizing the fact that alternative energy sources like solar, wind and natural gas are important for future, many electric utilities have started restructuring their generation resource portfolio to include renewable energy. In this context, Entergy is no exception. In fact, we believe the New Orleans power plant is part of the company’s commitment toward pursuing up to 100 MW of renewable resources to serve its New Orleans customers, which account for more than 20,000 individuals.Notably, retail sales of electricity in Louisiana, the state in which New Orleans resides, are among the highest in the United States.  Per a U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) report,  total renewables used in the electric power sector are projected to increase 41% in 2018.  Naturally, electricity providers will try to make most of this opportunity and enhance their renewable resource portfolio in this state. Therefore, in line with this, the construction of the natural-gas fired power plant seems to be a strategically efficient decision by Entergy.Furthermore, with Louisiana being one of the top five natural gas-producing states in the country, the New Orleans plant is expected to never run out of natural-gas reserve. This will allow Entergy to cater to the growing demand for electricity in the city and in turn boost its profit margin.Price MovementIn a year’s time, Entergy’s shares have gained 4.2% against the broader industry’s decline of 3.7%. The outperformance can be attributed to the company’s disciplined investment in growth projects for the modernization of grid along with evolving customer demand and regulatory support to recover investments. Zacks Rank & Key PicksEntergy has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the same industry are CenterPoint Energy (CNP  -  Free Report), Exelon (EXC  -  Free Report) and NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report).

78,EXC,"Power supplier Southern Company’s (SO  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Georgia Power’s customers are expected to gain from the federal Tax Reform Legislation passed in December 2017. The cutback in the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35% is likely to result in a savings of $1.2 billion for the Georgia Power customers. The savings would take place over the next two years. Georgia Public Service Commission (""PSC"") has also confirmed the benefits as part of the agreement with Georgia Power.The legislative reform will lower the taxes by $130 million on financing costs of the company’s controversial Vogtle Plant.  It would also result in $330 million of direct credits to customers over the next two years. Additionally, it will include $700 million in future benefits to be incorporated in Georgia Power's next rate case.The lower tax rate is likely to result in a residential customer (consuming an average of 1,000 kilowatt-hours per month) to receive around $70 per month in refunds over the two-year period.Early this year, Georgia Power announced a cost reduction of $139 million for its consumers in 2018 related to the Vogtle expansion.  Effective from April, the customers will pay $2.70 less than expected per month in financing costs for the Vogtle project.Zacks Rank and Key PicksSouthern Company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

79,EXC,"   Interest rates are on the move all across the yield curve. Whether you look at the 2 Year or the 30 Year the direction is the same. The yield on the 10-Year Treasury Note topped 2.94% during yesterday’s session. Also, with our Federal Reserve beginning to inch the overnight rate higher, many feel rates have nowhere to go but up. That’s not good news for industries with interest rate sensitivity. One of the most sensitive industries in the market is utilities. As rates rise, their yields don’t catch up quick enough to save them from downside risk. Today’s Bear of the Day is one of those utility stocks. I’m talking about Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) El Paso Energy (EE  -  Free Report). El Paso Electric Company, a public utility company, engages in the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity in west Texas and southern New Mexico. It generates electricity through nuclear fuel, natural gas, and coal facilities, as well as solar photovoltaic panels and wind turbines. The company owns or has ownership interests in various electrical generating facilities with a net dependable generating capability of approximately 2,080 megawatts; four 345 kilovolt (kV) transmission lines in New Mexico and Arizona; and three 500 kV lines in Arizona. It distributes electricity to retail customers principally in El Paso, Texas; and Las Cruces, New Mexico. The company serves approximately 411,100 residential, commercial, industrial, public authority, and wholesale customers. The reason for the unfavorable Zacks Rank is an analyst drop next year’s estimate from $2.73 down to $2.66. This was in the wake of El Paso’s last earnings report where the company reported EPS of $1.47 versus expectations calling for $1.58. The company is set to report earnings again on February 27th before the bell, with analysts looking for 22 cents for the quarter. Investors looking for other stocks in the same industry should check out CenterPoint Energy (CNP  -  Free Report) or Exelon (EXC  -  Free Report). Both are Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks right now.

87,EXC,"Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (BIP  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 9, before the market opens. In the last quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 1.22%.Let’s see how things are holding up for the fourth quarter.Factors to ConsiderOne of the objectives of this partnership is to earn attractive return on its rate base. In 2017, Brookfield Infrastructure expanded its rate base through the acquisition of regulated gas transmission business in Brazil, new connection in the U.K. regulated distribution business and addition of 11 projects in Chilean transmission system. We expect the benefits from these developments to get reflected in the company’s upcoming quarterly results.Moreover, improving economic conditions led to higher traffic volumes and tariff increases, which in turn are likely to drive the partnership’s performance in fourth-quarter 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Brookfield Infrastructure is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter .Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Brookfield Infrastructure has a Zacks Rank #3, which combined with 0.00% ESP makes earnings beat uncertain.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP Price and EPS Surprise  Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP Price and EPS Surprise | Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP Quote Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies from the industry that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Exelon (EXC  -  Free Report) is expected to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 7.

88,EXC,"Investors’ woes continued on Thursday after U.S. markets officially entered correction territory. Fears emanating from the increase in interest rates and new-found volatility continued to weigh on market sentiment. These concerns, which caused Monday’s losses, continued to haunt the markets on a day when both the Dow and the S&P 500 went into correction mode for the first time in two years.At this point, opinion is divided over whether this is only a healthy correction or the beginning of what could become a full-fledged bear market. What is certain is that fear has made a comeback to the markets and a few weeks of volatile trading are more than likely. In such an environment, investors would do well to invest in defensive stocks that have the ability to protect past gains during the rocky trading sessions ahead.Rising Yields Spike Markets’ RallyDuring this week, the 10-year Treasury yield has moved above 2.85% twice. Both these instances have been followed by wide-spread losses for stocks. On Wednesday, the 10-year U.S. Treasury note increased from 2.843% to 2.851%, marginally lower than the highest level witnessed in early 2014. Meanwhile, average year-on-year hourly earnings for January increased to 2.9%, the highest since June 2009.The record increase in wages led to concerns that retail prices would increase. Such fears, taken together with soaring yields, led to speculation that the pace of rate hikes would likely quicken over the year.This is the phenomenon which is believed to be responsible for stocks entering correction mode. The collapse in volatility-related investments, attributable primarily to algorithmic trading, was no less responsible for the plight.Massive Loss in Market ValueThe scale of recent losses can be gauged from the amount of market value erased since the S&P 500 hit a record high on Jan 26. A total of $2.49 trillion in market value has been erased since then, mostly during this week’s sharp declines. The situation for global markets is even grimmer. Nearly $5.2 trillion has been erased worldwide since most of these bourses were mimicking the gains of U.S. markets.  The question haunting investors at this point is whether the current situation has the makings of a bear market. With markets already in correction mode, we are possibly looking at another four months of losses and uncertainty, per historical data. However, if a bear market ensues, during which markets will lose another 10%, then 22 months would pass until the market scales January’s highs once again. Such a possibility, though unlikely at this time, does continue to exist.  Our ChoicesMarkets have just entered correction mode and investors are continuing to grapple with surging bond yields and the specter of a faster-than-expected increase in interest rates. Meanwhile, the market’s fear gauge continues to creep up, leading to losses for volatility-related bets, which in turn are triggering greater uncertainty.Against this backdrop, investors would do well to invest in defensive stocks. Such stocks provide steady earnings and dividends irrespective of prevailing market conditions. Typically, utilities and consumer staples, whose demand remains undiminished even during tough times, are considered to be defensive stocks.

91,EXC,"The fourth-quarter earnings season has crossed the half way mark. So far, the results reflect a favorable trend, with an above-average proportion of companies beating top- and bottom-line expectations.Total earnings for the 251 S&P members that have released results as of Feb 2, improved 16% year over year on 10.5% higher revenues. The beat ratio for the bottom line was 80.5%, while that for the top line was 78.1%.Notably, we expect total Q4 earnings to rise 13% from the year-ago period on 7.7% higher revenues. At present, 14 out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an improvement in earnings.Amid this backdrop, let us focus on Zacks Utilities sector this earnings season. Earnings from the utility space are expected to improve 5.5% in the fourth quarter.  Read more details in our weekly Earnings Preview.A Quick Glance at the Utility SectorUtility business is known for stability and visibility of earnings and cash flow, with the primary growth driver being consistent demand for electricity and utility services. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) predicted that annual average U.S. residential electricity price will increase 2.6% in 2018.Therefore, staying invested in fundamentally strong and domestic-focused utility stocks assure investors a steady performance and regular dividends.However, utility stocks remain subject to heavy regulation, both at the federal and state levels. Moreover, being capital intensive in nature, higher interest rate environments tend to deter growth of these stocks. Notably, in 2017 Federal Reserve increased interest rates thrice, in March, June and December. This is likely to have a negative impact on the sector.Nevertheless, to maintain their performance level, utilities are resorting to cost-savings initiatives, modernizing transmission and distribution lines, upgrading infrastructure and focusing on renewable energy to generate electricity with lower emission. Further, new electric rates and customer growth will help the sector to witness growth in earnings in the fourth quarter.Projections for the Zacks Utilities sector (one of the 16 Zacks sector), hint at an impressive quarter, when compared to its Q3 performance.The sector’s earnings are likely to improve 5.5% on 1.3% higher revenues. In the third quarter, earnings for this sector declined 3.6% on 2.1% sales slump.EXC or XEL: Which One is Poised for Better Q4 Earnings?This is going to be another busy week with 482 companies expected to release earnings including 92 members of the S&P 500. Let’s take a look at the Utility stocks, Exelon and Xcel Energy that are scheduled to announce their Q4 results on Feb 7.Exelon Corporation (EXC  -  Free Report) reported a negative earnings surprise of 1.16% in the last quarter. The company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.76%.We believe that the rate hikes at Atlanta City Electric effective September 2017 will have a positive impact on Exelon’s performance. Also, the company is expected to benefit from its cost-management initiatives.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $7.60 billion, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 3.6%. The same for quarterly earnings is pegged at 62 cents per share, which represents 40.9% annual improvement.Per our proven model, a stock is likely to beat earnings estimates if it has a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Exelon currently constitutes that right combination.The Zacks Rank #3 company has an Earnings ESP of +0.88%.

(XEL  -  Free Report) reported a negative earnings surprise of 5.43% in the prior quarter. The company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 1.59%.The company continues to focus on controlling Operating and Maintenance (O&M) expenses.  In the first nine months of 2017, operating expenses of $58 million was lower than the year-ago period. The company expects O&M expenses to remain flat in 2017 owing to these savings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $2.94 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 5.2%. The same for the quarterly earnings is pegged at 43 cents per share, which represents 4.4% annual decline.Xcel Energy is unlikely to beat on earnings this quarter as the Zacks Rank #3 company has an Earnings ESP of -1.43%.

94,EXC,"DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report) unveils plans to double its electricity generation capacity from renewable resources of energy in the State of Michigan by 2022. The proposal is part of the company’s 2018 Renewable Energy Plan, which was submitted to the Michigan Public Service Commission on Mar 30.  The plan is in sync with DTE Energy’s earlier announced initiative to lower carbon emissions. Notably, the company projects to achieve this goal by reducing carbon emissions from its power plants up to 30%, 45%, 75% and more than 80% by early 2020s, 2030, 2040, and 2050, respectively.If approved, these projects will enable DTE Energy to produce 2,000 megawatts (MW) of renewable electricity along with boosting investments of more than $1.7 billion in Michigan. The entire work is scheduled to be completed by 2022, post regulatory nod.2018 Renewable Energy PlanPer the recently submitted Renewable Energy Plan, DTE Energy intends to generate additional 1,000 MW of electricity from new wind and solar projects in Michigan. These projects include the company’s Pine River and Polaris wind parks, which have the combined capacity to generate 330 MW. While Pine River is expected to commence commercial operations later in 2018, Polaris will be operational in 2019.The company plans to build two wind parks by 2022 that will produce around 375 MW of electricity and begin operations in 2021 and 2022. This includes a wind project with a capacity to generate 300 MW for large commercial customers.The plan has provisions for the installation of approximately 15 MW of new Michigan-based solar capacity over the next three years, which will enhance DTE Energy’s solar capacity by almost 25%. This includes the launch of a pilot program for battery storage technology to improve the overall reliability of energy resources.Our ViewThe recent filing outlines DTE Energy’s efforts to meet Michigan's Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) that requires the state’s electricity providers to generate 15% of their retail electricity sales from renewable energy resources by 2021. Notably, the company successfully lowered its carbon emissions in the last decade up to 25%, courtesy of investments worth $2.5 billion in Michigan and the addition of 1,000 megawatts of wind and solar capacity.In fact, DTE Energy is investing steadily to enhance its renewable generation assets. Over the next 15 years, DTE Electric plans to lower coal-fired generation and boost natural gas-fired generation and renewables mix. In this context, DTE Electric retired four coal-fired generation units at its Trenton Channel, River Rouge and St. Clair facilities and announced plans to retire by 2023. The units at the Belle River and Monroe facilities are expected to be retired by 2040. These facilities will be replaced with natural gas-fired generation and renewables.Moreover, the recent tax reform has compelled the company to reduce electricity and gas rates. On Jan 23, 2018, DTE Energy announced that it has reduced its electricity and gas rates by 3% to pass on the tax savings to its customers. This is expected to widen the company’s customer base. The gains from lower tax rate will enable it to upgrade its infrastructure and invest in clean energy generation.We expect the recent developments to enable DTE Energy to achieve its target of reducing, carbon emissions by 80% in 2050 by incorporating new renewable energy projects and eventually transitioning its power sources from coal to natural gas as well as renewable.Price PerformanceDTE Energy’s shares have gained 2% in the last 12 months, against the broader industry’s decline of 2.9%. The outperformance can be attributed to the company’s disciplined capital spending program and investments to enhance renewable generation assets.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    DTE Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are CenterPoint Energy (CNP  -  Free Report) and Dynegy  and Exelon Corporation (EXC  -  Free Report).

95,EXC,"Investors typically have a fixation for the price-to-earnings (P/E) strategy in their quest for stocks that are trading at bargain prices. A widely favored approach by value investors is to chase stocks that have a low P/E ratio. But even this straightforward, broadly used valuation metric suffers a few downsides.EV/EBITDA is a Better Approach, Here’s WhyWhile P/E is preferred by many investors while uncovering bargain stocks, another valuation metric called EV/EBITDA does a better job. The ratio is often viewed as a better option as it offers a clearer picture of a company’s valuation and earnings potential. Unlike P/E that solely considers a company’s equity portion, EV/EBITDA determines its total value.EV/EBITDA is the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company’s market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents. In a nutshell, it is the entire value of a company.EBITDA, the other element, gives a true reflection of a company’s profitability as it removes the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dilute net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.Typically, the lower the EV/EBITDA ratio, the better it is. A low EV/EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued.EV/EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company’s balance sheet which the P/E ratio does not. For this reason, EV/EBITDA is generally used to value potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume. Stocks with a low EV/EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates.Another limitation of P/E is that it can’t be used to value a loss-making entity. A firm’s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. On the other hand, EV/EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and also can be used to value entities that have negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA front.EV/EBITDA is also a useful tool in assessing the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. It also can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt.But EV/EBITDA has its downsides too. It varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements.Thus, a strategy only based on EV/EBITDA might not fetch the desired outcome. But you can combine it with other major ratios such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to screen value stocks. Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks:EV/EBITDA 12 Months-Most Recent less than X-Industry Median: A lower EV/EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation.P/E using (F1) less than X-Industry Median: This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers.P/B less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued.P/S less than X-Industry Median: The lower the P/S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median. This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank, which has proven its worth since inception. It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 15 stocks that passed the screen:Verso Corporation (VRS  -  Free Report) produces coated freesheet, coated ground wood and uncoated super calendared papers and pulp.

96,EXC,"In the fourth quarter of 2017, U.S. GDP growth fell to 2.6% from the 3.2% growth that was achieved in the third quarter. Also, the unemployment rate remained static at 4.1%, the lowest in the last decade. The low unemployment level resulted in increased spending power and a rise in imports, which is partly responsible for the lower GDP growth.The trend of growing stock indexes continued in the fourth quarter, but the utility sector failed to see similar growth levels; the S&P 500 gained 23.7% over the past year while the utility sector only rose by 4.5%.Growth in the utility sector is presently lower than the GDP growth rate. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration, reasons behind this trend include slowing population growth, market saturation of major electricity-using appliances, improving efficiency of equipment and a shift in the economy toward a less energy intensive industry.The harsh winter weather that started during the Christmas Eve last year should show a positive impact on performance of the utilities. Utility companies need large amounts of capital to set up generation facilities, transmission and distribution infrastructure to perform during harsh climatic conditions and to combat hurricanes that affect their service territories. Upgrading and maintaining the existing infrastructure of natural gas and water service providers also involve a huge capital investment.These capital-intensive utilities therefore routinely take recourse to capital markets to meet the requirements as internally generated funds are not sufficient. The Fed’s interest rate hikes in four of the last five quarters will certainly hurt utilities.Having said that, investing in utilities is a safe bet due to the regulated nature of their business that gives their revenues a high level of certainty. Moreover, domestic orientation shields them from foreign currency translation headwinds. Utilities are also a preferred choice for income oriented investors as these increase shareholder value with regular dividend payments and share buybacks.How Utility Sector is PoisedThe Zacks Utility sector is currently placed at the bottom of the 16 Zacks sectors.According to the latest Earnings Trends report, the sector is expected to record top and bottom-line growth of 1.3% and 5.5%, respectively, compared with of 7.6% and 11.9% for the S&P 500 in the fourth quarter.Selecting the Right Utilities for the SeasonThe entire utility sector includes companies from electric power, natural gas, water, wireline and electric construction industries. So it could become a daunting task for investors to select the right stocks from so many options.But our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple. One can narrow down the list with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP,  which is the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.This method helps in selecting stocks that have high chances of delivering earnings surprises in their upcoming earnings announcements. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Also, the stocks mentioned below have a current ratio greater than one, which means that these stocks have ample liquidity to meet its short-term obligation even with rising rates.Our SelectionApplying the above strategy, we have selected four utility stocks that have a greater possibility of posting an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.Exelon Corporation (EXC  -  Free Report) has presence in every stage of the energy business — power generation, competitive energy sales, and transmission and delivery.

In the third quarter, the utility company reported a positive earnings surprise of 0.97%.Why Likely a Positive SurpriseA stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Our model conclusively shows that Dominion Energy is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses both the components.Zacks ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is +0.19%.

More than 90% of the company’s earnings come from regulated operations.  The company is likely to benefit from the agreement with Home Serve USA. Improvement in economic condition in Virginia is also a contributor. Dominion Energy’s expansion of electric transmission and continuous investments toward maintenance are positive factors.However, earnings are expected to be affected by lower import revenues Cove Point import contract, planned refueling outage at Millstone Power Station, solar projects having lower investment tax credits and higher PJM electric capacity expenses.

98,EXC,"ALLETE Inc. (ALE  -  Free Report) announced that its board of directors has approved a 4.7% increase in its quarterly dividend to 56 cents from 53.5 cents paid in the previous quarter. The new dividend will be distributed on Mar 1, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on Feb 15.The new annualized dividend of $2.24 per share reflects a dividend yield of 3.09%, which is better than the S&P 500’s yield of 1.63%. The company aims to maintain a dividend payout ratio in the range of 60% to 65%.Revision in Earnings OutlookThe company also raised its long-term earnings growth forecast from minimum of 5% to a range between 5% and 7%. The performance of this utility is driven by organic growth as well as by addition of customers and expansion of operation in new geographies. In addition, strategic acquisitions with the price range of $10 million to $50 million are also helping the company to expand operation and expand its revenue base.As nearly 85% to 90% of ALLETE’s income is generated from regulated operation, the company is going to gain from new rates expected to be applicable during third quarter of 2018. In addition, the company expects contribution from its non-regulated businesses to increase after 2018.What Lies Ahead?ALLETE’s earnings growth potential, improving cash flow from operations and solid balance sheet support its consistent performance and regular dividend payment.  The company has been paying dividends for 68 consecutive years and is expected to continue doing so in the coming years.ALLETE generates a substantial amount of its earnings from large industrial customers under long-term agreement, which provide stability to its performance.Price MovementALLETE’s stock has returned 15.1% last year, outperforming the 2.8% gain of the industry.Zacks Rank & Key PicksALLETE has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

99,EXC,"Exelon Corporation (EXC  -  Free Report) announced that its subsidiary Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd) has received necessary approval from The Illinois Commerce Commission (“ICC”) to pass on the tax savings resulting from the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).The new act became effective Jan 1, 2018 and has lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. This led to reduction in the amount of federal income tax ComEd will pay to the government. ComEd sought approval from ICC to pass its tax savings of nearly $200 million to its residential customers in Illinois which will result in average savings of $2-$3 per month from February. Without ICC’s approval customers would not realize savings from the tax cut until 2020.Tax Cuts – A Boon for UtilitiesUtilities in some states are trying to use the tax cut to lower the bill of their customers.  Utilities are passing on the benefits to their customer base either through reduction in existing electric rates or by adjusting the planned rate increases.Passing on tax savings does not look significant when we consider a single user or a single utility, however, it is significant when we consider the nation as a whole. Already decisions have been taken to pass on more than billions of dollars in tax savings to customers and we expect this amount to increase.Utilities like AVANGRID, Inc. (AGR  -  Free Report) and Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (PNW  -  Free Report) among others, have also expressed intention to pass on the tax savings benefits to customers. NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report), on the other hand, has decided to use the tax savings of nearly $1.3 billion to recoup the storm recovery expenses, without increasing the bills of its users in Florida.Quality Service at Low PricesThe savings due to tax cuts will allow the residential customers of ComEd to enjoy safe and reliable services at a very competitive price.Since 2001, ComEd has invested in excess of $5 billion to strengthen its electrical transmission and distributions system and has also nearly completed the installation of nearly 4 million smart meters. ComEd rates are low compared with the average electric rates in 10 largest American cities.Thanks to the tax cuts, the user will enjoy the benefits from strengthening infrastructure of its service provider, at lower rates.Price MovementExelon’s shares have returned 7.9% last year, outperforming the rally of 2.3% from the industry it belongs to. Zacks Rank Exelon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

100,EXC,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Exelon Corporation (EXC  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Exelon Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.4, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 21.9. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Exelon’s current PE ratio tad above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having trended upwards, over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Exelon has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 13.4, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Exelon has a P/S ratio of about 1.1, which is lower than its industry’s average of 7.5 right now.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Exelon currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Exelon a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the P/CF ratio of Exelon (another great indicator of value) comes in at 4.2, which is lower than the industry average of 8.6. Clearly, EXC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Exelon might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of C. This gives EXC a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been discouraging. The current quarter has seen no estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower, while the full year estimate has seen no upward and three downward revisions in the same time period.As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped 3.2% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has decreased 0.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Exelon Corporation Price and Consensus Exelon Corporation Price and Consensus | Exelon Corporation QuoteThis somewhat dismal trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineExelon is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among bottom 27%) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, its industry has underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

101,EXC,"Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Feb 7. In the third quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 5.43%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this earnings season.Factors to ConsiderXcel Energy continues to invest in its utility assets to provide reliable services to its customers and effectively meet rising electricity demand.  Its aim to produce more electricity from renewable sources will also yield positive results.The company continues to focus on controlling its Operating and Maintenance (O&M) expenses.  In the first nine months of 2017, operating expenses were $58 million lower than the year-ago period. However, the company expects most of the year-to-date savings to reverse in the fourth quarter, resulting in flat O&M expenses in 2017.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Xcel Energy’s revenues is pegged at $2,940 million, indicating 2.6% sequential decline. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is 43 cents, reflecting year-over-year decline of 4.4%.Xcel Energy Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Xcel Energy Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Xcel Energy Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Xcel Energy is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components.

The difference between GAAP and Operating earnings in the reported quarter was due to some one-time gains and losses.Total RevenuesExelon's operating revenues of $8,381 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,596 million by 10.3%.Quarterly revenues also improved 6.4% from $7,895 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Quarterly HighlightsExelon's total operating expenses increased 3.7% year over year to $7,336 million. The rise was primarily due to higher purchasing power and fuel expenses, and operating and maintenance expenses.Interest expenses were $365 million compared with $356 million in the year-ago quarter.HedgesExelon's hedging program involves hedging of commodity risks for expected generation, typically on a ratable basis, over a three-year period. The proportion of expected generation hedged as of Dec 31, 2017, was 85-88% for 2018, 55-58% for 2019, and 26-29% for 2020.GuidanceExelon provided 2018 earnings guidance per share in the range of $2.90-$3.20.

108,EXC,"Shares of Exelon Corporation (EXC  -  Free Report) have outperformed the Zacks Electric Power industry in the last 12 months. While the company’s shares rallied 27.4%, the industry gained 14.4%.Exelon invests substantially in infrastructure projects besides expanding its renewable and fossil fuel generating capacity. Exelon plans to invest nearly $20 billion over the 2017-2020 time period, in a bid to improve reliability of operations. Such systematic investments in regulated assets will drive earnings growth in the range of 6-8% and rate base growth of 6.5% during this time frame.Exelon expects to generate free cash flow of nearly $6.8 billion in the 2017-2020 period and intends to utilize the same to increase shareholders’ value. The company will use nearly $2.8-$3.2 billion to strengthen balance sheet and the rest to fortify existing operations. The move will help the company to serve increasing customer base more efficiently.Exelon’s Generation segment is working on its cost-reduction initiatives and expects to generate cost savings of $250 million annually by 2020 from 2017 levels.  This initiative will likely have a positive impact on margins from 2018.However, Exelon’s financial performance is guided by price fluctuations in the wholesale power markets. Wholesale power prices are dependent on supply and demand, which in turn are determined by factors such as fuel prices, especially those of coal and natural gas. In addition, unfavorable weather during the third quarter adversely impacted demand and performance of the company.  The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings per share inched up 0.7% over the last 60 days.

This charge is the result of revaluation of deferred taxes owing to an increase in the Illinois corporate income tax rate, effective Jul 1, 2017.The company also stated that due to the change in timing of interim period revenue recognition in Ameren Illinois, its earnings will decrease by approximately 23 cents per share in the quarter under review. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ameren’s earnings reflects 9.9% decline, for the soon-to-be reported quarter.However, the unemployment rate in Ameren’s service territories is less compared with the national average. An improving economy is also likely to boost future utility demand in the state, thereby improving the company’s performance.Moreover, the company’s service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal temperatures during the quarter. This, in turn, will result in higher household expenditures on cooling, consequently leading to improvement on the revenue front.Ameren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Ameren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Ameren Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Ameren is likely to beat estimates in this quarter.

119,EXC,"Electric utility firm The Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report) finally reached a settlement with the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff regarding the rate issue concerning the controversial Kemper Project. Mississippi Power, subsidiary of Southern Company and in charge of the Kemper Project, has agreed to lower the price tag of the Kemper Project by $85 million. This will help to lower the amount the company needs to recover from customers by $13.4 million.Looking BackThe Kemper plant had been central to ex-President Obama’s Climate Plan and was designed to reduce up to 65% of carbon dioxide emissions. Notably, the project also received the support of President Trump.However, the project has been facing continuous criticism owing to its poor execution, cost overruns and multiple delays. The plant is already three years behind schedule and is over $4 billion beyond the stipulated budget. The overall cost of the plant was estimated to be around $3 billion in 2010. However, with several delays adding to the project’s cost, the current price tag of the plant has ballooned over $7.5 billion. In the past 18 months, the company has announced 10 delays due to project management problems. The project found it difficult to get its two gasifiers to operate consistently. Mississippi Power has been unable to make the project economically viable in the face of volatile natural gas prices.In June, Mississippi Public Service Commission (MPSC) issued an ultimatum ordering Southern Company to redesign plans and run the Kemper Project solely on natural gas. Thereafter, the company suspended all coal gasification operations at its Kemper plant.Mississippi regulators, who do not wish ratepayers to incur additional costs, ordered the company not to increase the rates for Mississippi Power customers. In fact, they want the company to lower the rates, if feasible.Recent UpdatesMississippi Power’s settlement deal has resulted in the rate reduction for the customers from $126 million to $112.6 million. The move entitles customers to pay $1 less every month than what they are currently paying.The company believes that it has complied with all the requirements of Public Service Commission including the rate reductions and the operation of the plant solely as a natural gas facility. The company now thus wants the MPSC to re-evaluate the settlement agreement.

125,EXC,"Electric utility firm The Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report) is set to offload two natural gas distribution units to Folsom-based energy services company South Jersey Industries (SJI  -  Free Report) for $1.7 billion in an all-cash transaction.The units to be divested include Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas. These units are owned by Pivotal Utility Holdings, Inc. which is a subsidiary of Southern Company Gas. Southern Company Gas which was formerly called AGL Resources is a subsidiary of the Southern Company and is headquartered in Atlanta. Elizabethtown Gas, set up in 1855, serves more than 277,000 residential, business and industrial natural gas customers in New Jersey. Founded in 1863, Elkton Gas serve 6,000 residential and commercial customers in the greater Elkton area.The deal needs to be approved by the state regulators in New Jersey and Maryland. It also requires limited approvals from Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Federal Communications Commission. Additionally, the deal is also conditioned upon the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. Subject to these regulatory approvals and satisfactory closing conditions, the deal is expected to get completed by the third quarter of 2018.The deal is in sync with Southern Company’s strategy to drive growth and streamline its asset portfolio. The transaction will enable the company to shore up its weak financials. The utility's long-term debt at the end of the second quarter totaled to around $44 billion, which represents a debt-to-capitalization ratio of more than 60%. The company’s high leverage along with the cost overrun issues related to the construction of two key projects — Vogtle and Kemper — weighed on its balance sheet and earnings. The proceeds from the sale are likely to provide the company some financial flexibility and tap growth opportunities, thereby adding to shareholders value.The deal will enable South Jersey Industries to become the second largest natural gas provider in the state, catering to over 675,000 customers. The company expects the deal to be accretive to earnings by 2020.Zacks Rank Southern Company is one of the largest generators of electricity in the nation along with the likes of Exelon Corporation (EXC  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) among others.

Such systematic investments in regulated assets will drive earnings growth in the range of 6-8% and rate base growth of 6.5% during this time frame.Exelon closed its merger with Pepco Holdings Inc. forming one of the largest power distributor in the United States.

127,EXC,"The Q2 earnings season has crossed the halfway mark. As of Jul 28, 286 S&P 500 members came up with quarterly earnings. Total earnings are up 11.3% from the same period last year on 6.1% higher revenues. 74.5% of the companies beat EPS estimates while 69.2% topped revenue estimates.Nearly 1000 companies – including 130 S&P 500 members – are expected to come up with results this week. Combining the results of the reported index members (286 members till Jul 28) with the remaining 214 members of S&P 500, earnings are estimated to improve 9.2% on 5.0% higher revenues.Let us now focus on the utility sector, which is characterized by its defensive nature and domestic orientation. Initially, when the season started, we expected earnings to drop 2.9%. However, as the season gradually unfolds, we expect utility earnings to drop 1.8%.The utility sector is capital-intensive. These companies need huge capital to set up generation facilities, and transmission and distribution infrastructure. They also require considerable funds to maintain and upgrade the existing systems in order to meet emission-control standards. Utilities have been benefiting from the rock-bottom interest rate environment. However, the Federal Reserve has raised the rates twice in 2017 – in March and June. This will definitely hurt the utilities. The Fed has maintained its forecast for one more rate hike in 2017.The U.S. coal-based utilities got a respite with President Trump’s decision to repeal the Climate Power Plan. Moreover, Trump has walked out of the Paris Climate Agreement.    Four out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline this season.

128,EXC,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report) will release third-quarter 2017 financial results before the market opens on Nov 3.In the last quarter, the company pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 38.10%. Moreover, it outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 10.34%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayDuring the third quarter, one of the most devastating tropical storms in 50 years – Hurricane Harvey hit the city of Houston, TX – which is the primary service region of CenterPoint .Harvey’s impact on the state’s properties hampered the smooth flow of electricity through the transmission lines, leading to widespread outages. Though the company didn’t announce any significant damage caused to its power plants, it is expected that the effect of the storm might weigh down on its profitability in the third quarter.On the brighter note, CenterPoint had witnessed increased customer count and throughput during second-quarter 2017, primarily due to acquisitions of Atmos Energy Marketing (AEM) and the Energy Services business. Going ahead, similar solid performance from Energy Services is expected in third quarter and beyond, buoyed by increased operating income.Moreover, the unemployment rate in Ameren’s service territories is better than the national average. An improving economy is likely to boost future utility demand in the state, thereby improving the company’s performance.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents for third-quarter earnings projects a decline of 1%. Meanwhile, the same for revenues of $2.02 billion hints at an improvement of almost 6.7% on a year-over-year basis.CenterPoint Energy, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise CenterPoint Energy, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | CenterPoint Energy, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that CenterPoint is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

129,EXC,"Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) an electric and natural gas utility based in Charlotte, NC, is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 3, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 0.98%. However, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one of the past four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 1.21%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayAt the onset of the third quarter, Duke Energy announced a 4.1% hike in its quarterly cash dividend on common stock to 89 cents per share. The dividend payment was scheduled for Sep 18, 2017, to stockholders on record as of Aug 18, 2017.This indicates that the company has been generating robust cash flow from various operations and the soon-to-be-reported quarter is poised to reflect that.On the flip side, Hurricane Irma led to catastrophic losses in Florida last month. The storm damaged the grid system of electricity providers like Duke Energy, which has extensive service territories in the region. This in turn led to disruption in distribution network and widespread outages.Duke Energy reported that its electrical system suffered significant damages in Hardee and Highlands County. The company took several initiatives to address these issues and initiated repair work which included rebuilding this system.Moreover, Duke Energy in September waived off late payment charges and estimated bills for 1.8 million Florida customers to restore power in the state.These must have increased the third-quarter expenses of Duke Energy, which we believe will weigh down on its bottom line.For the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects a decline of 7.8% year over year, whereas sales are anticipated to drop 1.1% to $6.75 billion.Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not show that Duke Energy will beat earnings this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Duke Energy lacks these attributes, as mentioned below:Zacks ESP: Duke Energy has an Earnings ESP of -0.91%.

130,EXC,"The fate of electric utility firm The Southern Company’s (SO  -  Free Report) Kemper Project continues to remain uncertain as the company and the Public Utilities Staff failed to reach a settlement regarding the rate issue. Concurrently, Mississippi Public Service Commission (MPSC) scheduled the hearings for the project to commence from Dec 4.Notably, few days back Southern Company requested the Public Service Commission to reassess the service agreement of the Kemper plant as the company managed to reach an accord with all other parties but the Public Utilities Staff. Looking BackMississippi Power, subsidiary of Southern Company and in charge of the Kemper Project, has spent years in the construction of the project based on clean coal gasification technology. The Kemper plant had been central to ex-President Obama’s Climate Plan and was designed to reduce up to 65% of carbon dioxide emissions. Notably, the project also received the support of President Trump.However, the project has been facing continuous criticism owing to its poor execution, cost overruns and multiple delays. The plant is already three years behind schedule and is over $4 billion beyond the stipulated budget. The overall cost of the plant was estimated to be around $3 billion in 2010. However, with several delays adding to the project’s cost, the current price tag of the plant has ballooned over $7.3 billion. In the past 18 months, the company has announced 10 delays due to project management problems. The project found it difficult to get its two gasifiers to operate consistently. Mississippi Power has been unable to make the project economically viable in the face of volatile natural gas prices.Mississippi regulators, who do not wish ratepayers to incur additional costs, ordered the company not to increase the rates for Mississippi Power customers. In fact, they want the company to lower the rates, if feasible. MPSC have been encouraging rate reductions to eliminate ratepayers risk for gasifiers’ assets. In June, MPSC issued an ultimatum ordering Southern Company to redesign plans and run the Kemper Project solely on natural gas.  This left the management in a dilemma in regard to its investment costs retrievement.Thereafter, the company suspended all coal gasification operations at its Kemper plant. Since the company could no longer retrieve the project’s massive costs from ratepayers, management was of the opinion that the move would enable it to lower additional costs required for the further development and improvement of gasification units.What Lies Ahead? The company believes that it has complied with all the requirements of Public Service Commission including the operation of the plant solely as a natural gas facility. Southern Company has also decided against rate increase for customers.  The company now thus wants the MPSC to re-evaluate the settlement agreement.Mississippi Power announced plans to keep the rates unchanged; however the Public Utilities Staff are demanding a reduction in rates. If the agreement doesn’t get reconsidered, both the parties are set to explain their positions on the rate case in the hearing that starts from Dec 4. The final decision on which is expected by January. If Mississippi Power fails to get a favorable judgment, the company which is already grappling with weak financials, is likely to suffer additional losses.Zacks RankSouthern Company is one of the largest generators of electricity in the nation along with the likes of Exelon Corporation (EXC  -  Free Report), RWE AG (RWEOY  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report).
