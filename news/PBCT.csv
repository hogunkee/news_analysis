0,PBCT,"On Monday, People's United Financial (PBCT) earned a positive adjustment to its Relative Strength (RS) Rating, from 63 to 71. X IBD's unique rating tracks share price action with a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score. The grade shows how a stock's price behavior over the last 52 weeks stacks up against all the other stocks in our database. Decades of market research shows that the top-performing stocks tend to have an RS Rating of at least 80 in the early stages of their moves. See if People's United Financial can continue to rebound and clear that threshold. See How IBD Helps You Make More Money In StocksPeople's United Financial broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 19.60 entry from a flat base. If a stock you're watching climbs above a buy point then declines 7% or more below the original entry price, it's considered a failed base. It's best to wait for the stock to form a new pattern and breakout. Also understand that the latest consolidation is a later-stage base, which makes it riskier to establish a new position or add shares to an existing one. Top and bottom line growth moved higher last quarter. Earnings were up 29%, compared to 4% in the prior report. Revenue increased from 14% to 18%. People's United Financial holds the No. 20 rank among its peers in the Finance-Savings & Loans industry group. First Savings Financial (FSFG),  (SBT) and BOFI Holdings (BOFI) are among the top 5 highly rated stocks within the group.RELATED:Stocks With Rising Relative Strength RatingsWhy Should You Use IBD's Relative Strength Rating?How Relative Strength Line Can Help You Judge A Stock

1,PBCT,"Congress is set to give a bunch of banks more of what they want — which is to say, fewer regulators in their lives — with legislation making its way through the Senate this week.X The Senate on Tuesday voted to begin debate on a bill that would free some banks from taking stress tests, drafting plans to show how they'd wind down in a crisis, and being ""too big to fail.""The legislation has the backing of the GOP and some Democrats, and could pass the chamber this week. But how will it actually affect the biggest banks, like Dow Jones industrial average components JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) as well as Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and others?""In a very limited way,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Gardner said. ""The bill is geared toward smaller banks — banks under $250 billion in assets.""He later added: ""You'll see this rhetoric that this going back to the bad old days, and this is, say, a giveaway to the big banks. Not to the biggest banks it's not.""Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

2,PBCT,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowAs the bill stands now — and its language could change if the big banks' lobbying efforts are successful — the largest banks would still be subject to the Federal Reserve's stress tests. The dividend and buyback bonanza that comes after the banks typically pass those tests is unlikely to be affected. The rules would make it easier for big banks to buy municipal bonds, the Wall Street Journal noted. But Gardner said that's ""not a needle mover.""However, analysts say that smaller banks — who may have been reluctant to expand out of fear of regulatory costs — could be encouraged to get bigger through mergers and acquisitions if the bill were passed.The Fed's annual evaluation of the financial system would no longer apply to banks with less than $100 billion in assets. After 18 months, those requirements would no longer apply to banks with assets ranging from $100 billion to $250 billion.The bill would also raise to $250 billion the amount of assets a bank has to have to be deemed systemically important to the financial system — a huge hike from the current $50 billion.""Let's say you and I are a regional bank, and we have a $100-$125 billion of assets,"" CFRA analyst Ken Leon said. ""Now all of a sudden I can look tactically at acquisitions of banks for $10 to $50 billion.""He added: ""There's been a five-year delay on M&A in the banking industry.""Smaller banks like BB&T (BBT), SunTrust (STI), People's United (PBCT), Signature Bank (SBNY) and East-West Bank (EWBC) are among those could benefit, Gardner said.The Senate debate comes as Wall Street awaits the next big boost for bank stocks, following the tax legislation President Trump signed into law in December. Those stocks have been trying to find support at their 50-day lines.Republicans have argued that the capital restraints on banks are unnecessary. Democrats have raised concerns that any easing of those restraints would encourage the behavior that landed the country in the financial crisis that occurred a decade ago.And JPMorgan and Citigroup have sought to squeeze other benefits from the bill that could meet resistance in Washington.In its current form, the bill appears to relax what is known as the supplementary leverage ratio for custodian banks — or a financial institution that protects assets like stocks and bonds for another financial firm and doesn't do retail banking. The supplementary leverage ratio gauges how big a bank's capital cushion needs to be in relation to its assets.Under the bill being debated by the Senate, banks would not have to factor in the deposits they hold at a central bank when calculating that ratio. Custodian banks, like Bank of New York Mellon (BNY), State Street (STT) and Northern Trust (NTRS) would be the likeliest to benefit.But JPMorgan and Citi, which also handle similar deposits, argue that provision should apply to them as well. Lobbyists for those banks have pressed legislators to modify the law accordingly. The Congressional Budget Office on Monday said the odds the banks would get their way stood at 50%, according to reports.The rule would also relieve many banks of the responsibility of putting together so-called ""living wills,"" or the plans that detail how a bank would dissolve, if it needed to, without dragging the economy down with it.Shares of JPMorgan closed up 0.1% in the stock market today. Bank of America dipped 0.1%, Citigroup lost 0.5%, Goldman Sachs rose 1.5%, Morgan Stanley gained 1.9%, while Wells Fargo (WFC) fell 0.9%%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Banks And Financial Stocks: Latest News And AnalysisAmazon Looking At Ways To Offer Branded Checking AccountJPMorgan Forecasts Q1 Trading Rebound After Sluggish 2017

3,PBCT,"Wall Street's latest darlings, financial ETFs, fared poorly in March, despite their home-run returns of over 22% in 2016 and a postelection rally that has yielded nearly 19%.What happened? And is this a buy-the-dip opportunity many investors have been waiting for?Financial ETFs fell harder than any other sector in March. The flagship $23.5 billion Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) was down nearly 4% for the month through March 29, trimming its year-to-date return to 2%. Furthermore, financial ETFs saw an outflow of $1.36 billion between March 13-27, according to a BlackRock (BLK) report.""It was a reversal of the Trump trade,"" said Neena Mishra, director of ETF Research at Zacks Investment Research. She points out that banks took a beating recently because of the failed health care bill and rising doubts that President Trump will be able to get his agenda through.Despite the recent pullback in financials, Matt Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors, thinks they provide an attractive opportunity for investors as a result of several key elements.From a valuation perspective, Bartolini points out that financial stocks have been trading more than 25% below their 20-year average based on price-to-book value. ""So, in an environment where a lot of equity valuations across the board are stretched, financial stocks represent some form of valuation play in this current market.""In addition, when looking at the price-earnings ratio, ""financial stocks are trading at significant discounts to the broader market. In fact, it's the most attractive sector of the S&P,"" said Heidi Richardson, head of investment strategy for U.S. iShares at BlackRock (BLK). The S&P 500's P/E ratio is about 21, while the financial sector's is 15.9.""So, despite the run-up that we've seen, they're still trading at really attractive valuations,"" she said. The $1.8 billion iShares U.S. Financials (IYF) retreated 3% in March, but is still up about 2% this year through March 29. The fund yields 1.6% and has an expense ratio of 0.44%.From a fundamental perspective, their earnings growth also looks attractive. ""Earnings growth for financial stocks last quarter was 6.7% (and) sales growth was 5.7%. So these firms are actually growing both their top and bottom line. And within that space, regional banks posted 15% EPS growth last quarter,"" said Bartolini.As its name indicates, the $3.6 billion SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) invests in regional banks, with its top three holdings CIT Group (CIT), People's United Financial (PBCT) and First Republic Bank (FRC). The fund fell 7% in March and 3% year to date. It carries a 1.35% yield and charges 0.35% of assets as a fee.""So, these relatively low valuations with relatively high growth numbers essentially set up an area for the market where investors are looking for growth at a reasonable price,"" Bartolini said.On the macro side, a steeper yield curve due to the postelection rally may benefit banks' lending margins, and the Trump administration's potential bank-friendly tax and regulatory reforms could further support the sector.Nevertheless, financial analytics firm S3 Partners reported that short interest in U.S. financial services ETFs grew 53% to $4.5 billion since the beginning of the year through March 22. In addition, for the 10 largest bank stocks, ""short interest was up $2.9 billion, or 25%, since the election to the end of 2016, as traders anticipated an eventual stock-price reversal from the 23.07% run-up, which occurred by year-end,"" an S3 Partners report says.""There is no flight of short sellers closing out their positions over the past week or even in March,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners. That said, he did notice some short-covering in regionals and a shift toward more diversified banks.""If I look at a short period of short exposure, I don't think it would tell the whole picture because I think we're seeing traders being much more tactical based on what's happening with Trump's policies on infrastructure, on health care and on tax policy,"" said BlackRock's Richardson.RELATED: Find And Track The Best ETFsBlackRock Will Let Machines, Not People, Pick Your Stocks

4,PBCT,"While exchange traded funds are ideal for producing short- and long-term investment gains, many ETFs can be deployed to generate steady income from stock dividends and bond interest.ETF investment strategies for generating income fall into five main categories:The highest yielding U.S. bond ETF tracked by Morningstar Inc. right now is SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond (JNK). Its 12- month yield sits near 6%. It's followed by First Trust Tactical High Yield (HYLS) yielding 5.6% and SPDR Short-Term High Yield Bond ETF (SJNK) yielding 5.5%.But seeing a fat yield on an ETF can be misleading. A big payout doesn't mean as much if the fund's total return is slipping. JNK has returned 11.31% year to date and an average annual 2.53% the past three years. That compares with 7.16% and 4.13% for HYLS and 10.8% and 1.64% for SJNK.Ranked by three-year returns, the top performer is Pimco 25+ Year Zero Coupon U.S. Treasury (ZROZ), up an average annual 18.39% the past three years and 20.44% year to date, and yielding just over 2%. It is followed by Vanguard Extended Duration Treasury (EDV), up 17.1% and 18.6% over the respective periods, and yielding 2.4%. Next is iShares 20 Year Treasury Bond, at 11.8% and 13.1%, and yielding 2.2%.Junk bonds and long-duration Treasury bonds are subject to bouts of heightened volatility, which investors looking for income often seek to avoid. So they're better off using ETFs that track these kinds of bonds as part of a diversified portfolio that contains steadier bonds.The benchmark for diversified bond portfolios is the Barclays Aggregate Bond index, which is made up of a broad array of investment-grade bonds. The index is tracked by iShares Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Fund (AGG), which has $190 billion in assets. It's up 5% year to date and an average annual 3.96% the past three years. It yields 2.3%.Those who prefer bonds need to be aware that anticipated interest-rate hikes could affect potential returns.In general, bond ETFs with higher durations will be more negatively impacted than those with shorter durations as expectations increase for higher rates. Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of bond price to changes in interest rates. Duration is tied to a bond's maturity, or the date at which the bond's principal is repaid to lenders. Investors can check an ETF's website for the average duration.For example, if rates rise, a long-term ETF such as iShares 20 Year Treasury (TLT) incurs more interest rate risk than iShares 3-7 Year Treasury (IEI), notes Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF Research at S&P Global Market Intelligence.""In short, if rates trend higher over time, returns for bond ETFs will be negatively impacted, but not equally,"" he said. ""However, one rate hike by the Fed should not be that impactful.""The highest yielding ETFs can bring big payouts, but if the quality of their holdings declines, the total return could be sapped by declining prices in unfavorable markets. The top yielding dividend stock ETF is Global X SuperDividend Alternatives (ALTY), paying out 8.2% of its stock price annually. It's a small, young ETF with just $3 million in assets and without a three-year record. It's up almost 19% this year.Its older and bigger sibling, $807.4 million Global X SuperDividend (SDIV), yields 6.7% and has gained 12% this year and an average annual 11.27% the past three years.High-yield stock investors tend to prefer stocks whose declines are about over. In that way investors can reap big payouts for each dollar invested with the hopes of capital appreciation as the business turns around. Not all ETFs screens for stocks in this way. One that does is Global X SuperDividend U.S. ETF (DIV). Its index methodology screens for stocks that have exhibited low betas relative to the S&P 500 in an effort to produce low-volatility of returns. It's up 9% this year and has risen an average annual 6.8% the past three years. Top holdings include Cone Midstream Partners (CNNX) and Invesco Mortgage Capital (IVR).At the other end of the spectrum, lower yielding ETFs invest in companies that have a long history of increasing dividends. Only top quality companies can increase payouts year after year, and they tend to be in big demand by investors looking for steady capital appreciation. Their stock prices rarely get whacked to the point where they have big yields.Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG) tracks the Nasdaq U.S. Dividend Achievers Select Index. It holds 185 stocks, each of which has grown dividends annually for 10 years or more. It yields 2.1% vs. SPDR S&P 500's (SPY) 2%. Top holdings include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Microsoft (MSFT) and Pepsi (PEP)ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (NOBL) holds 50 stocks, a smaller list that reflects a higher barrier to entry -- each holding has raised dividends every year for 25 years or more. It yields 1.8%. Top holdings include Cintas (CTAS), W.W. Grainger (GWW) and S&P Global (SPGI).SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY), which invests in dividend aristocrats from the S&P Composite 1500, has jumped 15% year to date. It yields 2.4%. Top holdings include property REIT HCP (HCP), People's United Financial (PBCT) and Caterpillar (CAT).Safe to say, MLPs are best left to the pros who know when to get in or out, or how to use them as portfolio diversifiers.Morningstar tracks 20 REIT ETFs. The top-performing one year to date is Global X SuperDividend REIT (SRET). It's up 27.4% this year and yields about 8%, the third-highest. The index it tracks, the Solactive Global SuperDividend REIT index, invests in 30 of the highest dividend-yielding REITs in the world with the least amount of volatility.Nearly all of the $33 million ETF's assets are invested in North America. Top holdings include mortgage REITs Annaly Capital Management (NLY), which yields 10.1%, and Chimera Investment (CIM), yielding nearly 12%, as well as property REIT Senior Housing Properties Trust (SNH) yielding 6.6%. The REIT was launched in March 2015.The biggest REIT ETF is $35.59 billion Vanguard REIT (VNQ). It's up 14% year to date and yields 3.3%. Its top holdings along with their year-to-date price performance include Simon Property (SPG), up 12%, Public Storage[ticker symb=PSA] down 7%, and Prologis (PLD) up 30%. They all yield about 3%.Convertible bonds are bonds that can be exchanged for a set number of the issuing company's common stock. They tend to carry lower interest than normal corporate bonds but have the potential for greater price appreciation.The top performing ETF in this area year to date is $471 million VanEck Vectors Preferred Securities ex Financials (PFXF). It's up 12% and yields 5.6%. The largest is $17.86 billion iShares U.S. Preferred Stock (PFF). It's up 3.8% this year and yields 5.74%.RELATED:The Latest ETF News

6,PBCT,"Early in his career, Charles Drucker fell into a trap that befalls many managers: He rushed to hire employees who ultimately proved a poor fit.Now he's learned the value of patience. As president and chief executive of Vantiv (VNTV), Drucker ensures that the company doesn't fill open positions in a hurry.""I've learned the hard way that sometimes if someone isn't the right fit, it can put back your progress,"" said Drucker, 51, who became Vantiv's CEO in 2009 after it spun off from regional bank Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB). ""I've succumbed to the pressure to get that body in right away, to rush to judgment and get an average person. Three or six or 12 months later, when things didn't work out, I've looked back and thought, 'I really saw that early.'""At Vantiv, Drucker requires that the company consider multiple candidates before making a hiring decision.Mistakes can occur if you have only one candidate when you fill a job opening, he says.With roughly 3,300 employees, Vantiv provides payment processing services and related technology solutions for merchants and financial institutions. The company is based near Cincinnati, Ohio.For Drucker, talent management means more than taking the time to recruit superior candidates. He also believes in rotating promising employees through different roles within the company.""If we're working on a strategic plan, we'll take a key person maybe one or two levels down who can help us drive the plan and present it to the board (of directors),"" Drucker said. ""So it's not just the ability to attract strong talent but also offering talent rotation development opportunities.""The Right LeaderIn 2013, he reassigned a strong performer in Vantiv's finance group to lead the push to further develop business with merchant banks. Even though she lacked experience in sales and marketing, she hit the ground running and rallied the sales force to educate merchant bankers on Vantiv's products.""She looked at it in a different way,"" Drucker said.As a result, the expansion into working with merchant banks accelerated. The company recently signed two big banks, People's United Bank (PBCT) and Comerica (CMA), which now refer business.Vantiv doesn't have a significant R&D budget. Instead, the company prides itself on observing market trends and pouncing on them at the right time.""We're agile and nimble,"" Drucker said. ""We like to place a couple of bets and be ready when we see trends emerging.""For example, Drucker and his team have noticed a shift away from traditional business sales — whether via phone or by door-to-door prospecting — in favor of integrated payments. That's a big reason for Vantiv's May 2014 acquisition of Mercury Payment Systems for $1.65 billion.""By 2017, 30% of all payments will be through integrated software,"" Drucker said. ""The Mercury acquisition helps us grow in that space.""

It did not specify if cutbacks in tech spending are part of its efforts, but that's likely.""A key factor that drives tech spending is revenue growth and with the financial services group under pressure their ability to boost sales is under pressure,"" said Andrew Bartels, an economist and analyst at Forrester Research.Forrester plans to issue a new report on the outlook for IT spending within the next few days.""My preliminary expectation is that IT spending by financial services firms will be slowing in the second half of this year and into 2012 as banks adjust to new capital and regulatory constraints as well as to a slowing economy,"" Bartels said.U.S. spending on technology in the financial sector totaled $138 billion in 2010 and grew faster than overall IT spending, Forrester says. In the second half of this year, Bartels expects IT spending in the financial sector to fall below average.Hardware vendors will be hurt more than software companies, he says.""Software is likely to hold up better because of initiatives to improve data analytics that provide greater insights into their business,"" Bartels said.Bartels isn't expecting an actual decline in IT spending, just slowing growth. But he says he might have to downgrade his outlook further if Europe's debt woes aren't resolved.""If the debt crisis spreads from Europe to U.S. banks, the potential for actual cuts in IT spending by banks (from the prior year) becomes much more likely,"" Bartels said.Gov't Spending Also A WorryTech firms are already under pressure from cutbacks in government spending worldwide. In recent earnings reports, Dell, IBM and Cisco Systems (CSCO) all spoke of ""weakness"" in government spending. Warnings about the possible impact of financial sector cutbacks have not been quite as prevalent.Cisco CEO John Chambers, in an earnings conference call last month with analysts, did have a note of caution.""We do not underestimate the transitions in front of us or the importance to rapidly simplify our organization to deal with the many challenges facing us, especially in switching (network gear), public-sector and now the global financial concerns,"" he said.Chambers mentioned the subject briefly again at Cisco's analyst day conference Tuesday.In a report on that event, analyst Brian White of Ticonderoga Securities wrote: ""Cisco remains concerned regarding public spending, trends in Europe and the overall macro economic environment.""

38,PBCT,"Navient Corporation’s (NAVI  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 adjusted core earnings per share (EPS) of 40 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The reported figure came in higher than the year-ago quarter tally of 36 cents.Core earnings excluded the impact of derivative accounting treatment. It also excluded the impact of certain other one-time items, including goodwill and acquired intangible asset amortization.First-quarter results of Navient reflect lower revenues aided by decrease in net interest income and non-interest income. Moreover, expenses escalated. However, lower provisions were a tailwind.The company reported core net income of $107 million in the quarter, in line with the year-ago quarter.GAAP net income for the quarter was $126 million or 47 cents per share against income of $88 million or 30 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Fall in NII and Fee Income Recorded, Expenses Escalate (on core earnings basis)Net interest income (NII) dipped 1.2% year over year to $330 million.Non-interest income edged down 1.1% year over year to $179 million.

It might also issue term asset-backed securities (ABS).During the reported quarter, Navient issued $2 billion in FFELP Loan ABS, $507 million in private education loan ABS and $1.2 billion in unsecured debt. Also, the company repurchased $167 million of senior unsecured debt during the quarter.Our TakeNavient’s disappointing fee income base impacted revenues. Nevertheless, its efforts to enforce digitization are encouraging. Further, the company’s involvement in improper lending practices is likely to hurt its reputation and keep legal expenses elevated. Navient Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Navient Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Navient Corporation QuoteCurrently, Navient carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

39,PBCT,"Shares of TCF Financial Corporation (TCF  -  Free Report) climbed 7.27% in single-day trading following the first-quarter 2018 earnings release on Apr 23, before the market opened. The company reported earnings per share of 39 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents.Further, the figure compared favorably with the prior-year quarter figure of 25 cents. Notably, results include non-recurring items of 2 cents per share associated with the redemption of perpetual preferred stock.Also, top-line strength was experienced in the reported quarter. Furthermore, margin pressure seems to be easing. The quarter also witnessed continued rise in loans and deposits, while maintaining a solid capital position and lower provisions. However, elevated expenses were on the downside.The company reported net income of $73.8 million or 39 cents compared with $46.3 million or 25 cents recorded in the year-ago quarter.Revenues Escalate, Cost Pressure PersistsTotal revenues came in at $355.4 million in the quarter, up 9.1% year over year. Moreover, the top line comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $349.4 million.Net interest income (NIM) was up nearly 9.5% year over year to $243.2 million. The rise was mainly attributable to increased interest income on loans and leases held for investment, partially mitigated by decreased interest income on loans held for sale and rise in total interest expense.NIM of 4.59% expanded 13 basis points (bps) year over year due to elevated average yields on the variable and adjustable-rate loan portfolios on rising rates, partly offset by escalated average rates on increased average balances of certificates of deposit, along with higher average rates on long-term borrowings and savings accounts.Non-interest income came in at $112.2 million, up 8.4% on a year-over-year basis. Higher fees and other revenues, along with elevated card revenues, mainly led to the rise.TCF Financial reported non-interest expenses of $246 million, up 0.8% from the year-earlier quarter. The rise mainly reflected significant increase in operating lease depreciation, and higher occupancy and equipment expenses.As of Mar 31, 2018, average deposits improved 7% year over year to $18.3 billion. Average loans and leases climbed 6.7% year over year to $19.3 billion in the reported quarter.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagCredit quality for TCF Financial reflected mixed credit metrics. Non-accrual loans and leases, and other real estate owned slipped 16% year over year to $143.6 million.Further, provisions for credit losses were $11.4 million, down 6.8% year over year, primarily due to the auto finance portfolio run-off and lower net charge-offs in the commercial portfolio. These benefits were partly mitigated by rise in net charge-offs in the consumer real estate portfolio.However, net charge-offs, as a percentage of average loans and leases, expanded 18 bps year over year to 0.29%. The upsurge chiefly stemmed from the recovery recorded in the prior-year quarter, partly mitigated by lower net charge-offs in the commercial portfolio.Robust Capital PositionTCF Financial’s capital ratios remained strong. As of Mar 31, 2018, Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.57% compared with 10.79% as of Dec 31, 2017. Total risk-based capital ratio was 13.26% compared with 13.90% as of Dec 31, 2017. Tier 1 leverage capital ratio was 10.52%, down from 11.12% as of Dec 31, 2017.During the reported quarter, the company repurchased 2.57 million shares of its common stock for a total cost of $57.6 million and at an average price of $22.45 per share.Our ViewpointTCF Financial delivered an impressive performance in the first quarter. Continued top-line improvement underscores the company’s sturdy standing in the market. At the same time, a strengthening capital position and improving credit quality are anticipated to favor the company’s near-term growth. In addition to this, we believe its efforts to reduce balance-sheet risks and diversify the loan portfolio will augur well for earnings in the subsequent quarters. Also, steady improvement in the economy will be conducive for the company’s growth.Nevertheless, we remain apprehensive owing to several issues, including an expanding cost base. TCF Financial Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise TCF Financial Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | TCF Financial Corporation QuoteTCF Financial currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

40,PBCT,"People's United Financial, Inc. (PBCT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 19. While revenues and earnings are anticipated to grow year over year, we can’t conclusively predict a likely earnings beat.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might not be in store and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.   Driven by higher revenues and lower provisions, People's United reported a positive earnings surprise of 4.4% in second-quarter 2017. Further, elevated loans and deposits balances were tailwinds. However, escalating expenses and decline in profitability ratios were the undermining factors.Notably, People's United delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 3.26%.People's United Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise People's United Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | People's United Financial, Inc. QuoteRegarding the stock’s performance, shares of the company gained around 2.7% for the three-month period ended Sep 30, 2017, underperforming growth of 4.7% recorded by the industry.Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to People's United’s stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the third quarter. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively point toward a likely earnings beat this time. Here’s why:People's United doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) — for increasing its chances of an earnings beat. It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for People's United is -0.28%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: People's United’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsLoan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans grew on a sequential basis during the third quarter. Particularly, growth in commercial and consumer loans, with slowdown in commercial real estate loans is expected. Therefore, interest income for banks is projected to improve marginally.In addition, management’s expectations of loan and deposit growth in 2017 will likely be reflected in this quarter. Management projects loan portfolio to grow in the range of 11-13%.Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Given the influence of rise in interest rates, People's United should have recorded an increase in NII. Notably, management’s projections of 2017 NII to grow in the range of 12-14% is likely to show impact in the third quarter as well.Fee Income to Escalate: On strong retail banking, fee income might escalate for the bank. In addition, the company projects non-interest income to rise in the range of 5-7% in 2017, the impact of which is likely to be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter.Increase in Expenses: Despite undertaking a number of expense-saving initiatives, People’s United’s operating expenses have witnessed an elevated level. Though the company is focused on optimizing its branch network and has initiated installation of technology to improve efficiencies and reduce costs, escalating expense levels are likely to limit bottom-line expansion.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.27% and carries a Zacks Rank of 2.

41,PBCT,"With the focus on opportunistic acquisitions, and growing deposit and loan balances, People's United Financial, Inc. (PBCT  -  Free Report) appears a promising buying opportunity now. In addition, the recent interest-rate hikes are anticipated to further stabilize the top line.Though increasing risks and compliance requirements remain a concern for People's United, management is taking steps to keep a check on expense growth. This, in turn, is anticipated to make the growth path smoother.Therefore, it’s a good idea to add stocks with robust fundamentals and long-term growth opportunities to your portfolio, at the current level.Additionally, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 4.5% in a year’s time compared with 13.4% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.Why is People's United an Attractive PickBenefit from Rate Hike: With a rise in rates, banks are likely to engage in more investment activities. This rate hike will also allow banks to lend at higher rates. As People's United currently derives around 74% of its revenues from net interest income, the company is set to benefit from recent rate hikes.Strategic Moves: People’s United continues to benefit from a healthy business portfolio which has grown inorganically over time. In April 2017, the company completed the $391-million all-stock deal to acquire Riverhead-based Suffolk Bancorp, which is set to fortify its footprint in the New York Metro region. Recently, it acquired LEAF Commercial Capital — an independent commercial equipment finance provider.

The company remains focused on opportunistic acquisitions that support its long-term growth profile.Earnings Strength: People's United recorded earnings growth rate of 6.1% over the last three to five years. Retaining the earnings momentum, the earnings growth rate is anticipated to be around 1% for the current year and 15.6% for 2018.

Based on these ratios, the stock seems undervalued.Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the same space are FB Financial Corporation (FBK  -  Free Report), LPL Financial Holdings Inc.

43,PBCT,"People's United Bank, N.A., a subsidiary of People's United Financial, Inc. (PBCT  -  Free Report), announced the completion of the acquisition of LEAF Commercial Capital, Inc. The transaction is likely to be immediately accretive to the company’s earnings.The acquisition was announced in Jul 2017 under the terms that People's United would acquire about $730 million of net investment in leases and loans and retain almost $250 million of securitizations.On completion of the deal, total assets of People's United amount to about $4 billion, making it the 16th largest bank-owned equipment finance entity.Since 2002, the Philadelphia, PA based LEAF Commercial Capital has provided finance of about $5.8 billion to more than 243,000 customers.

Earlier, in Nov 2016, People's United had acquired Gerstein Fisher, a $3 billion investment management firm.The company’s progress on the acquisition front reflects its capital and liquidity strength. Further, People’s United’s organic growth remains impressive. However, persistent pressure on margins despite rising rates and escalating expenses might restrict its bottom-line growth in the near term.Shares of People’s United have gained 17.5% over the last one year, underperforming the 25.3% rally of the industry.Currently, People’s United carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the financial space include The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) and Trustmark Corporation (TRMK  -  Free Report).

44,PBCT,"People's United Financial Inc. (PBCT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2015 results on Thursday, Jul 16.Last quarter, this financial savings and loan institution witnessed more than10% year-over-year rise in earnings, while at the same time managing to beat estimates. Results were aided by higher revenue, partially offset by increased expenses and provisions.Will People's United fail to impress in the upcoming release after combating the challenges witnessed by the industry in the quarter? Let's see what factors might have influenced the earnings report this time around.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsIncreasing commercial real estate and lending activities from the improving economy is likely to contribute to People’s United’s revenue growth. Notably, the company has a track record of positive loan growth (annualized) for the past 18 consecutive quarters. While continuity of such a trend is likely to drive net interest income in the second quarter, we remain cautious at the same time. We expect to witness a rise in provisions during the quarter given the rapidly growing and diversifying loan portfolio.Also, net interest margin is predicted to remain under pressure, owing to lower yield on new loans, given the current low rate environment.Additionally, bank service charges will continue to be impacted due to certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.On a positive note, as reaffirmed by the company during its first-quarter earnings call conference, growth in net interest income from its originated portfolio exceeding lost accretion on the acquired portfolio will likely continue to be a driving factor for subsequent quarters.Also, commercial banking lending fees is likely to get a boost due to moderate growth in commercial prepayment activity in commercial real estate.We believe the quarterly results are likely to reflect reducing expenses.  This is because increase in expenses owing to seasonality in the first quarter is not likely to repeat in the second quarter. Further, as previously announced, the company intends to close around 10 branches in the remainder of this year and plans to reduce real estate costs by consolidating other facilities. Such efforts are likely to reflect in the company’s expense base.Activities of People's United during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained stable at 21 cents per share over the last 7 days.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that People's United is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for People's United is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 21 cents.Zacks Rank: People's United’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings surprise call.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:KeyCorp. (KEY  -  Free Report) has an earnings ESP of +3.57% and carries a Zacks Rank #2. It is expected to report its second-quarter results on Jul 16.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) has an earnings ESP of +1.35% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. It is expected to report its second-quarter results on Jul 17.The earnings ESP for Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. (CFR  -  Free Report) is +3.57% and it carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company is expected to release its second-quarter results on Jul 29.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Adjusted earnings per share of $1.19 outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents.Results were driven by rise in revenues and lower provisions.

Moreover, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $827.6 million.Total revenues (net of interest expense) jumped 21.1% year over year to $230 million in the quarter, driven by higher net interest income and non-interest income. Furthermore, revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $219.8 million.Texas Capital’s net interest income was $210.6 million, up 23% year over year, mainly due to rise in loans held for investment. In addition, net interest margin expanded 36 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.47%. This resulted from improvement in loan yields, partially offset by high cost of deposits.Texas Capital’s non-interest income advanced 3.2% year over year to $19.4 million. The rise was primarily due to an increase in service charges, servicing income, swap fees, wealth management and trust fee income, along with bank-owned life insurance income. These were partially offset by lower brokered loan fees and other income.However, non-interest expenses flared up 25% year over year to $133.1 million. This mainly stemmed from a rise in almost all components of expenses.As of Dec 31, 2017, total loans rose 17% year over year to $21.7 billion, while deposits climbed 12% year over year to $19.1 billion.Credit Quality ImprovedNon-performing assets totaled 0.55% of the loan portfolio plus other real estate owned assets, reflecting a year-over-year contraction of 52 bps.

The uptrend chiefly allied with retention of net income.Our ViewpointTexas Capital’s improved top line and a better balance sheet during the quarter impress us. However, bleak economic situation might hurt the company’s performance in the future. Though its inability to control expenses may hamper near-term profitability, improvement in margin remains a favorable factor. Texas Capital Bancshares, Inc.

50,PBCT,"People's United Financial, Inc. (PBCT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 18. Both revenues and earnings are anticipated to grow year over year, with likely earnings beat on the cards.Before we discuss why an earnings beat is likely and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.   Driven by higher revenues and lower provisions, People's United reported a positive earnings surprise of 4% in third-quarter 2017. Further, elevated loans and deposits balances were tailwinds. However, escalating expenses was the undermining factor.Notably, People's United delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 2.09%. People's United Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise People's United Financial, Inc. price-eps-surprise | People's United Financial, Inc. QuoteRegarding the stock’s performance, shares of the company have gained around 3.1% for the three-month period ended Dec 31, 2017, outperforming growth of 2.6% recorded by the industry.Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to People's United’s stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the fourth quarter. Notably, our quantitative model predicts a likely earnings beat this time. Here’s why:Our proven model indicates that chances of People's United beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate is high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at +0.61%. This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company.Zacks Rank: The combination of People's United’s Zacks Rank #2 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged over the last seven days and is expected to move up 12.5% year over year. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected at $392.7 million, up 18.6% year over year.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsLoan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans declined on a sequential basis during the December-end quarter. Particularly, growth in consumer loans, with slowdown in real estate loans, along with commercial and industrial (C&I) loans, is expected. Therefore, interest income for banks is projected to improve marginally.In addition, management’s expectations of loan and deposit growth in 2017 will likely be reflected in this quarter. Management projects loan portfolio to grow in the range of 11-13%.Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Given the influence of rise in interest rates, People's United is anticipated to have recorded an increase in NII. Notably, management’s projections of 2017 NII to grow in the range of 12-14% is likely to show impact in the quarter to be reported as well.Fee Income to Escalate: On strong retail banking, fee income might escalate for the bank. Additionally, the company projects non-interest income to rise in the range of 5-7% in 2017, the impact of which is likely to be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter.Increase in Expenses: Despite undertaking a number of expense-saving initiatives, People’s United’s operating expenses have witnessed an elevated level. Though the company is focused on optimizing its branch network and has initiated installation of technology to improve efficiencies and reduce costs, escalating expense levels are likely to limit bottom-line expansion.Adverse impact of new tax code: The tax reform might result in elevated operating expenses from one-time bonus payments, higher charitable contributions and investment losses from securities portfolio restructurings. Also, though the company has not provided any information about the write-down of deferred tax assets (DTAs), it might record a significant one-time charge in the fourth quarter.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Earnings ESP for Legg Mason, Inc.

53,PBCT,"People's United Financial Inc. (PBCT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2015 results on Thursday, Jul 16.Last quarter, this financial savings and loan institution witnessed more than10% year-over-year rise in earnings, while at the same time managing to beat estimates. Results were aided by higher revenue, partially offset by increased expenses and provisions.Will People's United fail to impress in the upcoming release after combating the challenges witnessed by the industry in the quarter? Let's see what factors might have influenced the earnings report this time around.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsIncreasing commercial real estate and lending activities from the improving economy is likely to contribute to People’s United’s revenue growth. Notably, the company has a track record of positive loan growth (annualized) for the past 18 consecutive quarters. While continuity of such a trend is likely to drive net interest income in the second quarter, we remain cautious at the same time. We expect to witness a rise in provisions during the quarter given the rapidly growing and diversifying loan portfolio.Also, net interest margin is predicted to remain under pressure, owing to lower yield on new loans, given the current low rate environment.Additionally, bank service charges will continue to be impacted due to certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.On a positive note, as reaffirmed by the company during its first-quarter earnings call conference, growth in net interest income from its originated portfolio exceeding lost accretion on the acquired portfolio will likely continue to be a driving factor for subsequent quarters.Also, commercial banking lending fees is likely to get a boost due to moderate growth in commercial prepayment activity in commercial real estate.We believe the quarterly results are likely to reflect reducing expenses.  This is because increase in expenses owing to seasonality in the first quarter is not likely to repeat in the second quarter. Further, as previously announced, the company intends to close around 10 branches in the remainder of this year and plans to reduce real estate costs by consolidating other facilities. Such efforts are likely to reflect in the company’s expense base.Activities of People's United during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained stable at 21 cents per share over the last 7 days.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that People's United is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for People's United is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 21 cents.Zacks Rank: People's United’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings surprise call.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:KeyCorp. (KEY  -  Free Report) has an earnings ESP of +3.57% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

79,PBCT,"People's United Financial, Inc. (PBCT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20. With expectation of year-over-year growth in revenues and stable earnings, we can’t conclusively predict a likely earnings beat.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might not be in store and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.   The Bridgeport, CT-based company’s first-quarter 2017 earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Higher revenues and elevated expenses were recorded in the quarter. Growth in loans and deposit balances were the positives. Moreover, credit quality marked a significant improvement.Notably, in the second quarter, the stock declined around 3%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Moreover, People's United has a decent earnings surprise history, as evident from the chart below:People's United Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise People's United Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | People's United Financial, Inc. QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to People's United stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the second quarter. However, our quantitative model doesn’t conclusively point toward an earnings beat this time. Here’s why:People's United doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – for increasing its chances of an earnings beat. It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Zacks ESP:The Earnings ESP for People's United is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 23 cents. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: People's United’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsLoan Growth: Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans grew on a sequential basis during the second quarter. Both commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans (C&I) are anticipated to increase, while consumer loans might fall. Therefore, interest income for banks is projected to improve marginally.In addition, management’s expectations of loan and deposit growth in 2017 will likely be reflected in this quarter. Management projects loan portfolio to grow in the range of 5–7%.Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Given the effect of rise in interest rates, People's United should have recorded an increase in NII. Notably, management’s projections of 2017 NII to grow in the range of 5–7% is likely to show impact in the second quarter as well.Fee Income to Escalate: Given the seasonal tailwinds, service charges and payments might escalate lifting fee income for the bank. Moreover, the company expects non-interest income to rise in the range of 5–7% in 2017.Increase in Expenses: Despite undertaking a number of expense-saving initiatives, People’s United’s operating expenses have witnessed an elevated level. Though the company is focused on optimizing its branch network and has initiated installation of technology to improve efficiencies and reduce costs, elevated expense levels are likely to limit bottom-line expansion.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Old National Bancorp (ONB  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.70% and a Zacks Rank #2.

The rise was driven by an increase in average earnings assets.  Net interest margin (NIM) remained unchanged at 3.30%.Non-interest income inched up 1% year over year to $314 million. The upsurge mainly stemmed from growth in capital-market fees, cards and payment processing income, along with trust and investment-management services.Adjusted non-interest expense declined slightly to $633 million on a year-over-year basis. The decrease stemmed from a fall in almost all components of expenses, partially offset by rise in personnel costs.

Non-interest expense is anticipated to be down 2-4%.The NIM for 2018 is estimated to remain flat as compared with the prior year, on a GAAP basis, as expansion in NIM might offset the reduced benefit of purchase accounting. Further, efficiency ratio is projected at 55-57%.Management predicts average loans and leases to increase in the 4-6% band on an annual basis, while average deposits are expected to be up 3-5%.Overall, asset quality metrics are likely to remain stable with moderate quarterly volatility, given the current low level of problem assets and credit costs.Management anticipates NCOs to remain below the long-term normalized range of 35-55 basis points.The effective tax rate for 2018 is estimated in the range of 15.5-16.5%.Our ViewpointHuntington reported an encouraging quarter.

The company reported core earnings of 27 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 24 cents.

Net interest margin expanded 21 basis points (bps) year over year to 6.17%.The company reported non-interest income of $13.5 million, up significantly from $6 million in the prior-year quarter. The rise was attributable to higher gains on derivatives and hedging activities.The company’s total expenses increased 21.6% year over year to $125 million. The rise was mainly due to increased compensation and benefits expenses, higher FDIC assessment fees and other expenses.Efficiency ratio, on a non-GAAP basis, decreased to 36.5% from 36.8% in the year-ago period. Generally, a lower ratio indicates improved profitability.Credit Quality WorsensProvision for loan losses was $53.9 million, up considerably from $25.3 million in prior-year quarter.Delinquencies as a percentage of private education loans in repayment were 2.5%, reflecting an increase of 3 bps in the year-ago quarter.Growth in Deposit and LoansAs of Mar 31, 2018, deposits of Sallie Mae Bank were $16.5 billion, up from $13.4 billion as of Mar 31, 2017.

Operating efficiency ratio on a non-GAAP basis is expected in the range of 37-38%. Private education loan originations are projected to be $5 billion.Our ViewpointResults of Sallie Mae highlight consistent focus on increasing private education loan assets, maintaining a solid capital position by introducing multiple complementary new products and improving efficiency.We believe that improving economic conditions and lower tax rate will further assist Sallie Mae in maintaining its leading position in the student lending market. Moreover, its focus on solidifying presence in the consumer banking business space bodes well for the upcoming quarters.

85,PBCT,"People's United Financial, Inc. (PBCT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19, before the market opens. Both revenues and earnings are anticipated to improve year over year.Before we discuss the factors that could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.Driven by higher revenues and lower provisions, People's United reported a positive earnings surprise of 11.1% in fourth-quarter 2017. Further, elevated loans and deposits balances were tailwinds. However, escalating expenses was the undermining factor.Notably, People's United delivered positive earnings surprises in three out of the four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 4.87%. People's United Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise People's United Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | People's United Financial, Inc. QuoteRegarding the stock’s performance, shares of the company declined slightly for the three-month period ended Mar 31, 2018. Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to People's United stock? This depends largely on whether or not the firm is able to post a beat in the first quarter. Notably, our quantitative model does not conclusively predict likely earnings beat this time. Here’s why:Our proven model indicates that People's United does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for People's United is -0.27%.Zacks Rank: People's United carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged over the last seven days and is expected to move up 36.4% year over year. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected at $394 million, up 18.2% year over year.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsLoan Growth: Per the Fed’s latest data, loans are expected to improve slightly on a sequential basis during the quarter to be reported. Particularly, weakness in revolving home equity loans might offset growth in commercial and industrial (C&I), consumer and overall real estate loans to some extent.In addition, management’s expectations of loan and deposit growth in 2018 will likely be reflected in this quarter. Management projects loan portfolio to grow in the range of 4-6%, while deposits are projected to be up 3-5%.Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Given the influence of rise in interest rates, People's United is anticipated to have recorded an increase in NII. Notably, management’s projections of 2018 NII’s growth in the range of 10-12% is likely to show impact in the quarter to be reported as well. This is based on the expectation of net interest margin (NIM) in the range of 3.05-3.15%, on assumption of a 25-basis-point rate hike during the year.Fee Income to Escalate: On strong retail banking, fee income might escalate for the bank. Additionally, the company projects non-interest income to rise in the range of 3-5% in 2018, the impact of which is likely to be reflected in the first quarter.Increase in Expenses: Despite undertaking a number of expense-saving initiatives, People’s United’s operating expenses have witnessed an elevated level. Though the company is focused on optimizing its branch network and has initiated installation of technology to improve efficiencies and reduce costs, escalating expense levels are likely to curb bottom-line expansion.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Earnings ESP for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) is +0.21% and the stock carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

88,PBCT,"On May 17, we issued an updated research report on People's United Financial (PBCT  -  Free Report). The company has witnessed solid organic growth over the last few years. Further, its involvement in capital deployment activities continues to enhance shareholders’ value. However, consistently rising expenses and significant exposure to commercial loans remain major concerns.Nevertheless, opportunistic acquisitions, improvement in asset quality and strong loans and deposits balances have aided the stock’s rally of 12.1% in the past year compared with 11.4% growth recorded by the industry.Further, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has remained stable, over the last 60 days. As a result, it currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).People’s United’s strong balance sheet position along with sound inorganic growth strategies have bolstered its revenues. In July 2017, it acquired LEAF Commercial Capital, an independent commercial equipment finance provider. In April 2017, the company completed the $391 million all-stock deal to acquire Riverhead-based Suffolk Bancorp, which is set to fortify its footprint in the New York Metro region. Moreover, these transactions are anticipated to be accretive to earnings.Further, driven by a robust capital position, the company remains committed to enhance shareholders’ value. In April 2018, it raised its quarterly dividend by 1.4%, marking the 25th consecutive annual dividend hike. Further, given its favorable debt/equity ratio, these capital deployment activities are sustainable, going forward.Moreover, consistently improving credit quality acts as a tailwind. The company’s non-performing assets have declined at a five-year CAGR of 9.3% in 2017, with the trend continuing into first-quarter 2018 as well.However, despite undertaking a number of expense-saving initiatives, People’s United’s elevated operating expenses remain a headwind. Over the last five years (ended 2017) costs have witnessed a CAGR of 3.4%. Though the company is focused on optimizing its branch network and has initiated installation of technology to improve efficiencies and reduce costs, high expense levels are likely to limit bottom-line expansion.Also, majority of People’s United's loan portfolio — nearly 73% as of Mar 31, 2018 — comprises total commercial loans (commercial and industrial lending as well as commercial real estate lending). Such high exposure to commercial loans remains a concern.Stocks to ConsiderBOK Financial Corporation (BOKF  -  Free Report) has witnessed a 4% upward estimate revision in the last 30 days.
