2,IQV,"Veeva Systems (VEEV) is a ""coiled spring"" ready to jump, thanks to several growth initiatives.XThat's the contention of Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis, who says Veeva stock has had a mighty run so far in 2018. He adds the cloud-computing firm that focuses on software applications for the pharmaceutical and life-sciences fields has room for further growth.In using the term ""coiled spring"" to describe Veeva's outlook, Davis says the future looks even more prosperous when 2019 comes into view.""Veeva has several growth initiatives in process that range from significant new feature upsells to adjacent customer breadth moves,"" Davis said in a recent note to clients.Pleasanton, Calif.-based Veeva has more than 600 customers in the life-sciences industry, ranging from Big Pharma firms to emerging biotechs.It counts companies like Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK), Novartis (NVS) and Pfizer (PFE) among its customers.Veeva went public in October 2013 at $20 a share, and hit an all-time high of 78.28 on March 8. It managed to avoid most of the carnage in this week's sell-off and shares were down 1% Friday to 74.30.Veeva stock broke out of a 38-week consolidation period with a buy point of 68.17 on Feb. 28, a day after the company posted better-than-expected results for the fiscal fourth quarter and gave guidance that crushed Wall Street's estimates for the current fiscal year.For its current fiscal year, which will end next Jan. 31, Veeva expects to earn an adjusted $1.32 a share, up 43% year over year, on sales of $818 million. That's up 19%, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Analysts were modeling adjusted profit of $1.01 a share on $807 million in sales.Veeva's growth initiatives are likely to reach sufficient scale this year to provide a path to upside to 2019 estimates, Davis said.""If this scenario is correct, investors will figure this out sometime this summer or fall at which point Veeva shares could sustainably move higher,"" he said. Davis rates Veeva stock as buy.Veeva began in 2007 with a software application to help pharmaceutical sales reps organize drug data to make stronger doctor pitches. Today, that product for customer relationship management — called Veeva CRM — dominates the drug market with roughly 80% user share. It's now part of Veeva's Commercial Cloud business.A big driver of the company's business today is Veeva Vault, which launched in 2011. It was created to organize all content involved in clinical drug trials — documents, patient data and work flow. Vault products now cover the clinical, quality, regulatory and commercial aspects of drug development, manufacturing and sale. It has penetrated less than 10% of the market, William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri told Investor's Business Daily.Veeva also has discovered that its Vault offering is useful for other heavily regulated industries, such as the chemical and consumer product sectors.The company's offering for companies outside of life sciences is called Vault QualityOne. It has more than 20 companies using the product, which launched about a year ago.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn a conference call with analysts on Feb. 27, Veeva Chief Executive Peter Gassner said the company has been ""planting seeds for future growth.""""It's especially exciting to see the franchise we're building on the R&D side of life sciences,"" he said. ""Veeva is uniquely positioned there to help streamline drug development since we're the only technology provider with best-in-class application suites across each of the major areas of development; including clinical, quality, regulatory, and coming next year, safety, all in a single, modern cloud platform. We believe Veeva Development Cloud will be transformational for the industry over the long term.""Veeva's software-as-a-service offering has been replacing legacy vendors that use on-premise hardware and software systems. Its rivals include Oracle (ORCL), Medidata Solutions (MDSO), IQvia (IQV) and others.Veeva management has a strong track record of delivering growth and is conservative in its guidance, William Blair's Suri said. He rates Veeva stock as outperform.Veeva has forecast a revenue run rate of $1 billion by the fourth quarter of 2020.""We think they will hit that run rate by early next year — 18 months plus ahead of expectations,"" Suri said. ""Not only could they hit that billion-dollar run rate early next year, but the sustainability of growth should be there for the next two or three years.""Meanwhile, JPMorgan downgraded Veeva stock from overweight to neutral on March 9, citing valuation concerns after the stock had climbed 40% for the year.""This is a strong franchise that is executing well on a number of growth initiatives,"" but has little room for outperformance at current levels, JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty said in his note to clients.He estimates Veeva's addressable market at about $5 billion, a fraction of the more than $50 billion spent each year by life-sciences companies on information technology.""This fertile market should provide greater than 20% growth in subscription revenue in fiscal 2019 after growing 26% in fiscal 2018,"" Auty said.RELATED:Veeva Rockets After Topping Quarterly Estimates, Crushing Guidance ViewsCEO Gassner Makes Sure Veeva Has A 'Second Act' — And More

10,IQV,"When the pharmaceutical and biotech industries are prolific with new drug candidates, PRA Health Sciences (PRAH) prospers.X A provider of clinical development services, PRA Health has been a top performer on the stock market of late, thanks to solid fundamentals. It has posted accelerating growth in earnings per share for the last three quarters and Wall Street sees the pattern continuing for the next two quarters.Shares are up 65% year to date through Friday, when it hit a record high of 92 intraday. The stock ended regular trading up 0.5% to 91.53.""Over the last several quarters, it seems like the organic growth of PRA has been pretty consistently about double its peers,"" William Blair analyst John Kreger told Investor's Business Daily. ""This is a market that grows 6% or 7% (a year) and their organic growth has been around 15%.""Kreger is modeling for PRA Health to post 13% to 14% sales growth next year.Baird analyst Eric Coldwell also sings PRA Health's praises.""PRA has materially outperformed peer average growth rates for years and would almost assuredly continue to do so in 2018 and 2019,"" even without recent acquisitions, Coldwell told IBD.PRA Health wins business by getting high marks for contract performance, Coldwell said. It has a strong ""no excuses"" culture and the wisdom to know which markets and businesses to avoid, he added, pointing out it hasn't made problematic acquisitions like some of its large peers.A leading contract research organization, PRA Health provides its services to pharmaceutical companies. Since 2000, the Raleigh, N.C.-based company has participated in about 3,500 clinical trials worldwide. Its trials have led to U.S. Food and Drug Administration or international regulatory approval of more than 70 drugs.PRA Health competes with such companies as IQvia (IQV), Icon (ICLR) and INC Research (INCR), among others.PRA Health has been ahead of the curve in major trends in the industry, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Donald Hooker told IBD.It was an earlier mover than peers in providing functional outsourcing services for drug companies. As a functional service provider, PRA Health handles entire operations of companies in drug testing and approval, rather than for specific drugs.The company scored such a deal with Takeda Pharmaceutical of Japan in September 2016 and won another major account with an unnamed customer in early 2017.PRA Health also was ahead of rivals in providing data services that can help in clinical drug test planning, management and even eventual pricing. It launched its Predictivv platform in 2015.In September, PRA Health acquired Symphony Health Solutions, a privately held provider of data, analytics and consulting services to the life sciences market. Symphony helps drug companies better track and understand the performance and use of their products.PRA Health paid $530 million upfront with potential contingent payments based on Symphony exceeding financial targets for the 12-month period ending December 2018.Symphony provides PRA Health with a state-of-the-art cloud computing infrastructure in which data can be stored on one common platform and used in a very agile way, Hooker said.The Symphony acquisition gives it additional cross-selling opportunities, adds Coldwell.IBD'S TAKE: PRA Health Sciences currently ranks No. 21 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks. For more analysis on PRA, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.The contract research organization field has been consolidating and that activity is likely to continue, analysts say.INC Research closed its merger with inVentiv Health on Aug. 1. IQvia was created in November following the October 2016 merger of IMS Health and Quintiles.PRA Health has been gaining market share as those big rivals digest their acquisitions, analysts say.""We continue to serve a broad range of clients from small development-stage biotech to large biopharma,"" Shannon said on a conference call with analysts Oct. 27. ""The diversity of our new business awards continues to be consistent with previous quarters, with approximately 70% of our new awards coming from the pharmaceutical sector and approximately 30% coming from the biotechnology sector.""PRA Health gets about 90% of its revenue from its clinical research segment and 10% from its data solutions unit, which includes the newly acquired Symphony.In the third quarter, PRA Health earned an adjusted 88 cents a share, 38% higher year over year, on revenue of $582 million, up 28%.For the December quarter, analysts expect PRA Health to earn $1.03 a share, up 45% vs. a year ago, on sales of $544 million, up 15%.PRA Health has more than 14,000 employees worldwide and has more than 70 offices across North America, Europe, Asia, Latin America, South Africa, Australia and the Middle East.Meanwhile, the pipeline of drug candidates coming up for clinical testing looks strong, KeyBanc's Hooker said.""The overall outsourcing environment for clinical trials is really strong right now,"" Hooker said. Capital markets are supportive of biotech R&D, there are more drug candidates to trial, and the FDA is working to bring more treatments to market.Said Hooker: ""It's a good time to be in pharma.""

12,IQV,"Delphi Technologies PLC (DLPH  -  Free Report) looks strong on the back of its vast global network and innovative product portfolio with updated technologies. The aftermarket business generates stable recurring revenues.Notably, Delphi Technologies reported strong first-quarter 2018 results. Adjusted earnings of $1.30 per share beat the consensus mark by 14 cents but were down by a penny from the year-ago quarter. Net revenues of $1.30 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.26 billion. The figure was up 10.9% year over year on a reported basis and 5% on an adjusted basis.Despite such impressive results, we observe that shares of Delphi Technologies have declined 17.4% against the industry’s rise of 11.9% on a year-to-date basis. What’s Driving Delphi Technologies?Delphi Technologies has a geographically diverse revenue base. Region-wise, it derived 43.6% of revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), 27.5% from North America, 26% from the Asia Pacific and 2.7% from South America in first-quarter 2018. The company is highly optimistic about opportunities in the Asia Pacific region. Net sales from this region grew almost 16.5% to $339 million in the quarter. Increasing levels of vehicle production in the region is encouraging.Regional presence coupled with its diversified and innovative product portfolio with updated technologies should help Delphi Technologies become a solid choice for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). This is because OEMS are focused on increasing efficiency and expanding their global manufacturing footprint by choosing suppliers with global scale who can easily adapt to regional variations.Additionally, Delphi Technologies is also optimistic about the opportunities from its aftermarket business. Through its aftermarket product portfolio, it offers an extensive range of solutions, which includes fuel injection, electronics and engine management, maintenance, and test equipment and vehicle diagnostics categories, to leading aftermarket companies, including independent retailers and wholesale distributors. Demand for aftermarket products and services depends on the growing number of vehicles, their life-cycles and total miles covered by them. While replacement of many of its aftermarket products is non-discretionary in nature, the company generates stable recurring revenues from the aftermarket business.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderDelphi Technologies is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

We expect the company to witness top-line growth across most of the regions.Region-wise, the consensus estimate for North America revenues indicates an improvement of 4.1% year over year to $2.27 billion. The same for Latin America is expected to rise 2.5% year over year to $124 million, 3.1% year over year to $361 million for U.K., 3.9% year over year to $421 million for Asia Pacific and 17.5% year over year to $778 million for Euro & Other Europe.

However, revenues from North America reduced 7.2% year over year to $1,985.7 million and the same from the Middle East and Africa were down 7% to $73.4 million.Earnings Likely to Grow on Tax Reform The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced corporate tax rates significantly from 35% to 21%, will benefit Omnicom’s earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, the consensus estimate for earnings per share (EPS) is pegged at $1.55, indicating year-over-year growth of 10.7%.In first-quarter 2018, earnings increased 11.8% year over year.

21,IQV,"Every week the government and other entities release economic reports that cover all areas of the economy - from retail sales to housing, to international trade to consumer sentiment.In fact, on virtually any given day there could be anywhere from one to a handful of reports.And while the financial media does cover them, they usually focus on headline numbers without doing a deeper dive.This is unfortunate because within these reports often exists money-making details that can quickly be uncovered with just an extra few minutes of reading.For example, in the Employment Situation report, it details what sectors saw the most new jobs or labor force expansion, and which ones contracted.I can remember countless times where that report got me into the right sectors and industries at the right time before anybody else was talking about them.In fact, I still remember getting into housing in early 2012 while everybody else was staying as far away from it as possible. But, after seeing construction jobs continue to rise in report after report after report, I knew the housing market had turned. And that was one of the first alerts to the housing recovery - for those who knew where to look.But the headline number and the obligatory one-or-two-sentence write ups on many news sites missed the best part of the story by not going the extra mile (or paragraph).Well here we are again, with more stock-picking insight, straight from last week's Employment Situation report. Last week it showed that some of the biggest job creation came from these five industries:1) Construction +58,000(up 177,000 over the last 6 months)2) Professional and Business Services +37,000(up 597,000 over the last 12 months)3) Private Educational Services +29,000(up 105,000 over the last 12 months)4) Manufacturing +28,000(up 57,000 over the last 3 months)5) Health Care +27,000(up 360,000 over the last 12 months)Once these reports point you in the right direction, you can then plug in the appropriate sectors and industries to capitalize on this information and find the best stocks within those groups.This is just one very specific way to do top down analysis. But you can go to any screener (like the one on Zacks.com or the Research Wizard) and locate the sector, then industry of interest.Then you should add in your favorite and most successful stock-picking criteria to drill down to the best ones, such as Zacks Rank 1s or 2s (Strong Buys or Buys); market-beating growth rates; below industry valuations; upward earnings estimate revisions, etc.Here are 5 stocks from some of the industries singled out as the biggest job creators in last week's Employment report:(LII  -  Free Report) Lennox(Construction)(MAN  -  Free Report) ManpowerGroup(Professional and Business Services)(LOPE  -  Free Report) Grand Canyon Education(Private Educational Services)(ITW  -  Free Report) Illinois Tool Works(Manufacturing)Q Quintiles IMS Holdings(Health Care)Profitable stock ideas can come at any time and any place. But instead of waiting for the next great stock to fall into your lap, you can actively search for them. And by reading a few extra reports and then putting those ideas into a capable screener, you'll soon be amazed at some of the new picks you come up with.And you'll feel pretty smart after finding them too.The Research Wizard is a great place to begin.

23,IQV,"And while the ""science"" of getting new drug therapies through the FDA gauntlet is full of landmines for investors, there are some essential ""infrastructure"" companies which don't have any FDA risk because they simply serve the scientists and get paid either way.

"
44,IQV,"On February 13, Q reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results and gave 2014 guidance that pleased investors. Q4 results impressed with revenue above expectations, led by

"
46,IQV,"More importantly, the company issued above-consensus top-line guidance of $4.09-4.15B (7.4% - 9% growth) and adjusted 2014 EPS of $2.33-$2.46, with solid book-to-bill metrics across both Product Development and Integrated Healthcare Services. Analysts responded by boosting their EPS estimates for this year and next. 
"
47,IQV,"One of the stand-outs in the quarter was the strong new business growth for both segments at 1.24 times for PD and 1.46 times for IHS.

"
48,IQV,"Analysts On Board
"
49,IQV,"Before and after their quarterly report, Wall Street firms were out in force praising the company and raising EPS estimates that caused the stock's Zacks Rank to increase from the #2 Buy rating to a #1 Strong Buy on February 15. Here's a sampling of analyst moves...
"
50,IQV,"Goldman Sachs: Upgraded to ""Buy"" on January 21, price target raised from $50 to $58.
"
51,IQV,"Citi: Initiated coverage of Q with a ""Buy"" rating on February 18.

"
55,IQV,"Wells Fargo: Reiterate ""Outperform"" and raise valuation range to $56-60.
"
56,IQV,"Institutional Support
"
57,IQV,"In my screening for growth stocks, I look at SEC filings from misattribution investors to find out ""who is buying what."" After Q came through my initial fundamental and technical screens, I looked up the big holders to see who's been buying and selling.
"
58,IQV,"The stand out owners are the private equity firms who still hold majority stakes since the IPO: Bain Capital and TPG Group. But the big fundamental buyer last quarter was Wellington Management who more than doubled their stake to 6,737,305 shares, or just under a 5% stake.
"
59,IQV,"An Enormous Market
"
60,IQV,"Baird analysts noted in their Feb 13 report, ""Clients don't have to choose Q, but the tools and testing done are highly scripted in law, regulation and practice. Given average 10-15 year lifecycles for development, ever-expanding testing requirements, and the glacial pace of change, we think Qs solution set will be viable for decades to come.""
"
61,IQV,"Considering the breadth of Q's global client base and combined product R&D and services offering, they estimate the total addressable market opportunity to be around $68B. And with the expanding breadth and furious pace of new science turning into potential pharmaceutical treatments, the new business opportunities for Quintiles should continue to grow within that pie of very little competition.
