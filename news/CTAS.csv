82,CTAS,"While exchange traded funds are ideal for producing short- and long-term investment gains, many ETFs can be deployed to generate steady income from stock dividends and bond interest.ETF investment strategies for generating income fall into five main categories:The highest yielding U.S. bond ETF tracked by Morningstar Inc. right now is SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond (JNK). Its 12- month yield sits near 6%. It's followed by First Trust Tactical High Yield (HYLS) yielding 5.6% and SPDR Short-Term High Yield Bond ETF (SJNK) yielding 5.5%.But seeing a fat yield on an ETF can be misleading. A big payout doesn't mean as much if the fund's total return is slipping. JNK has returned 11.31% year to date and an average annual 2.53% the past three years. That compares with 7.16% and 4.13% for HYLS and 10.8% and 1.64% for SJNK.Ranked by three-year returns, the top performer is Pimco 25+ Year Zero Coupon U.S. Treasury (ZROZ), up an average annual 18.39% the past three years and 20.44% year to date, and yielding just over 2%. It is followed by Vanguard Extended Duration Treasury (EDV), up 17.1% and 18.6% over the respective periods, and yielding 2.4%. Next is iShares 20 Year Treasury Bond, at 11.8% and 13.1%, and yielding 2.2%.Junk bonds and long-duration Treasury bonds are subject to bouts of heightened volatility, which investors looking for income often seek to avoid. So they're better off using ETFs that track these kinds of bonds as part of a diversified portfolio that contains steadier bonds.The benchmark for diversified bond portfolios is the Barclays Aggregate Bond index, which is made up of a broad array of investment-grade bonds. The index is tracked by iShares Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Fund (AGG), which has $190 billion in assets. It's up 5% year to date and an average annual 3.96% the past three years. It yields 2.3%.Those who prefer bonds need to be aware that anticipated interest-rate hikes could affect potential returns.In general, bond ETFs with higher durations will be more negatively impacted than those with shorter durations as expectations increase for higher rates. Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of bond price to changes in interest rates. Duration is tied to a bond's maturity, or the date at which the bond's principal is repaid to lenders. Investors can check an ETF's website for the average duration.For example, if rates rise, a long-term ETF such as iShares 20 Year Treasury (TLT) incurs more interest rate risk than iShares 3-7 Year Treasury (IEI), notes Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF Research at S&P Global Market Intelligence.""In short, if rates trend higher over time, returns for bond ETFs will be negatively impacted, but not equally,"" he said. ""However, one rate hike by the Fed should not be that impactful.""The highest yielding ETFs can bring big payouts, but if the quality of their holdings declines, the total return could be sapped by declining prices in unfavorable markets. The top yielding dividend stock ETF is Global X SuperDividend Alternatives (ALTY), paying out 8.2% of its stock price annually. It's a small, young ETF with just $3 million in assets and without a three-year record. It's up almost 19% this year.Its older and bigger sibling, $807.4 million Global X SuperDividend (SDIV), yields 6.7% and has gained 12% this year and an average annual 11.27% the past three years.High-yield stock investors tend to prefer stocks whose declines are about over. In that way investors can reap big payouts for each dollar invested with the hopes of capital appreciation as the business turns around. Not all ETFs screens for stocks in this way. One that does is Global X SuperDividend U.S. ETF (DIV). Its index methodology screens for stocks that have exhibited low betas relative to the S&P 500 in an effort to produce low-volatility of returns. It's up 9% this year and has risen an average annual 6.8% the past three years. Top holdings include Cone Midstream Partners (CNNX) and Invesco Mortgage Capital (IVR).At the other end of the spectrum, lower yielding ETFs invest in companies that have a long history of increasing dividends. Only top quality companies can increase payouts year after year, and they tend to be in big demand by investors looking for steady capital appreciation. Their stock prices rarely get whacked to the point where they have big yields.Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG) tracks the Nasdaq U.S. Dividend Achievers Select Index. It holds 185 stocks, each of which has grown dividends annually for 10 years or more. It yields 2.1% vs. SPDR S&P 500's (SPY) 2%. Top holdings include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Microsoft (MSFT) and Pepsi (PEP)ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (NOBL) holds 50 stocks, a smaller list that reflects a higher barrier to entry -- each holding has raised dividends every year for 25 years or more. It yields 1.8%. Top holdings include Cintas (CTAS), W.W. Grainger (GWW) and S&P Global (SPGI).SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY), which invests in dividend aristocrats from the S&P Composite 1500, has jumped 15% year to date. It yields 2.4%. Top holdings include property REIT HCP (HCP), People's United Financial (PBCT) and Caterpillar (CAT).Safe to say, MLPs are best left to the pros who know when to get in or out, or how to use them as portfolio diversifiers.Morningstar tracks 20 REIT ETFs. The top-performing one year to date is Global X SuperDividend REIT (SRET). It's up 27.4% this year and yields about 8%, the third-highest. The index it tracks, the Solactive Global SuperDividend REIT index, invests in 30 of the highest dividend-yielding REITs in the world with the least amount of volatility.Nearly all of the $33 million ETF's assets are invested in North America. Top holdings include mortgage REITs Annaly Capital Management (NLY), which yields 10.1%, and Chimera Investment (CIM), yielding nearly 12%, as well as property REIT Senior Housing Properties Trust (SNH) yielding 6.6%. The REIT was launched in March 2015.The biggest REIT ETF is $35.59 billion Vanguard REIT (VNQ). It's up 14% year to date and yields 3.3%. Its top holdings along with their year-to-date price performance include Simon Property (SPG), up 12%, Public Storage[ticker symb=PSA] down 7%, and Prologis (PLD) up 30%. They all yield about 3%.Convertible bonds are bonds that can be exchanged for a set number of the issuing company's common stock. They tend to carry lower interest than normal corporate bonds but have the potential for greater price appreciation.The top performing ETF in this area year to date is $471 million VanEck Vectors Preferred Securities ex Financials (PFXF). It's up 12% and yields 5.6%. The largest is $17.86 billion iShares U.S. Preferred Stock (PFF). It's up 3.8% this year and yields 5.74%.RELATED:The Latest ETF News

83,CTAS,"U.S. stock indexes traded in a narrow range Wednesday afternoon as the market awaited the final number on second quarter GDP.The Nasdaq inched up 0.1%, while the S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4% and 0.5% respectively. Volume was running slightly higher on both major exchanges in the stock market today.Q2 GDP will be released before Thursday's open. Analysts expect an upward revision to 1.3%. The first and second takes on economic growth came in at 1.2% and most recently 1.1%. The range of estimates for the final number runs from 1.1% to 1.5%.Fast-food chain Sonic (SONC) gapped down 7% on weak guidance. Volume was about 500% above average. Despite the ugly move, Sonic found support near the 25 price level. In February, Sonic found support at that same price area. Sonic ran up about 45% from February to early April, but has since pulled 30% off the April high.Restaurant stocks have struggled recently. Of the 61 stocks in the restaurant group, only two carry an IBD Composite Rating of 90 or better. The Composite combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A rating of 90 means the stock ranks in the top 10 percentile of all stocks in IBD's database.The two stocks with 90-plus ratings are Papa John's International (PZZA) at 95 and Jack in the Box (JACK) at 91. In Wednesday afternoon trade, Papa John's fell 1% in heavy volume. Jack in the Box dropped 1.5%, down for a third straight day.Meanwhile, blue chip winners and losers were about evenly split Wednesday afternoon. The top gainer was Caterpillar (CAT). The stock broke out of a flat, base-on-base pattern in strong volume. Caterpillar was up 3%, crossing above a 84.83 buy point.In the IBD 50, a list of the best stocks in fundamentals and technicals, Worthington Industries (WOR) also broke out. The maker of metal products and cryogenic containers cleared a 45.78 buy point in volume more than twice its usual pace. Worthington's pattern also was a base on base.A base on base involves a second pattern with lows settling at the previous pattern's highs. The first pattern's decline is often tied to weakness in the general market. When the second breakout works, it's often tied to a strengthening general market.IBD's Take: Although restaurant stocks are struggling, some IPOs are showing bullish action.Initial public offerings were showing good action, which is another good sign for the general market. August IPO and embedded antennae designer Airgain (AIRG) advanced 6%, touching a new high.July initial public offering TPI Composites (TPIC) scored a new high with a 3% pop. The charts of  Airgain and TPI both have a straight-up look.May IPO Acacia Communications (ACIA) fell 2% but the stock has formed a somewhat imperfect high tight flag pattern. A high tight flag can be a very bullish pattern. First, the stock rises 100% to 120% in four to eight weeks, which Acacia did. Then the stock corrects 10% to 20% in three to five weeks, which Acacia did with a 22% correction, slightly more than ideal. If the stock can break past 128.83 in heavy volume, Acacia could provide an entry.Other highly rated stocks posting solid gains Wednesday included Amazon.com (AMZN), up 1.5%; uniform maker Cintas (CTAS), up 2.5%; and RV maker Thor Industries (THO), up 0.5%. Thor and Amazon both marked new intraday highs.RELATEDAmazon Is Seen Dominating Multiple Key MarketsRestaurant Stocks Continue To Turn Investors' Stomachs

93,CTAS,"Paychex’s (PAYX) quarterly revenue came in slightly ahead of Wall Street estimates, while its earnings were in line with views. But shares for the provider of payroll assistance dropped more than 2% in the early going Wednesday.Paychex said that its third-quarter revenue rose 7% to $752.6 million as it provided more payroll services, added new customers and saw its revenue per check climb. Analysts had predicted revenue at $751.2 million.The company, which primarily serves small and medium-sized companies with minimum-premium health insurance and cloud-based accounting, said that its adjusted earnings were 50 cents a share.Paychex forecast its total service revenue for the fiscal year ending May 31 to grow 7% to 8%. The midpoint would be slightly below analyst consensus for roughly 7.6% revenue growth for the year.Human resources corporate services providers such as Paychex, Cintas (CTAS), Convergys (CVG), WageWorks (WAGE) and ExlService Holdings (EXLS) have expanded recently, in part by assisting companies at complying with ObamaCare regulations in the health insurance market.During the quarter, Paychex began integrating Advance Partners, a provider of financial, operational and strategic services that it purchased on Dec. 22 for an undisclosed sum.

But he also said BPO growth will slow.Doradla put Genpact trading at 18.8 times William Blair's 2016 EPS estimate for Genpact, ""a slight premium to its peers in the fast-growth BPO industry,"" which is trading at 17.6 times estimated earnings, he said.BPO is found in more than one industry group. In IBD's Commercial Services-Outsourcing group, Genpact ranks as the fourth-largest company, with a market cap of $5.6 billion. The group is led by Paychex with an $18.9 billion market value, Cintas (CTAS) at $9.5 billion and Aramark (ARMK) at $7.7 billion.Shares of both Cintas and Aramark were up more than 1% midday Friday.IBD's Computer-Tech Services also hosts some heavyweight outsourcers, including Infosys (INFY) with a $40.3 billion market cap, and Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) at $33.9 billion. IBM (IBM) is included in this group, although it does much more than outsourcing.Infosys stock was up a fraction midday Friday, while Cognizant was more than 2% and IBM nearly 2%.Genpact specializes in financial services outsourcing, contributing about 42% of its revenue. Manufacturing and health care are its other two main markets.Sales to its largest customer, General Electric (GE), fell 1% last year to 19% of Genpact's total revenue. Genpact is a GE spinoff.""Overall, we came away with a bullish tone from management, both at a company-specific level and with regard to the overall BPO market,"" Doradla said. ""Management highlighted that the company is witnessing healthy demand in its business and that Genpact has an active deal pipeline.""Some of the key drivers for the upwardly revised figures include customers increasingly viewing BPO companies as transformation partners who not only offer a cost arbitrage, but also provide valuable insights into business operations. Specific areas in which the industry is increasingly engaging clients include IoT, big data and cybersecurity.""Bottom line, we believe that the BPO industry is poised for strong overall growth over the next several years and that Genpact stands to grow at a faster pace than the overall industry due to domain expertise and strong client relationships.""Genpact carries an IBD Composite Rating of 96, with 99 the highest, and currently is an IBD Leaderboard stock. Trading near 26.50 midday Friday, it is within range from a 26 buy point touched last month.

100,CTAS,"Strategic allocation models typically carve out a portion of an investment portfolio for alternative investments, such as commodities, hedge funds, private equity or managed futures. These alternative asset classes can provide exposure to less correlated assets, theoretically increasing returns and lowering risks over the long term.

101,CTAS,"With the S&P 500 Index up more than 200% since the 2009 lows and near all-time highs, many investors have questioned why they own anything besides the S&P 500 Index1. It is always easy to be a Monday-morning quarterback, but it is surprising to us that many have forgotten the importance of true diversification. Although we do not believe the markets are headed for a substantial correction or a repeat of 2008, we do think it is important for investors to learn from the past. One of the most crucial outcomes from 2008 was that many investors became more aware of the importance of downside protection and true diversification. Traditional allocations, as it turned out, generally did not provide enough diversification, and as the markets unwound, correlations between traditional asset classes increased.

"
103,CTAS,"As during the 2008 sell-off, correlations can also increase during positively trending markets, which is what we have witnessed over the past few years, ultimately decreasing the diversification benefits traditional allocations may provide. Institutional investors have long utilized managed futures strategies as a way to achieve diversification and performance potential in almost any market. Consider some of the benefits managed futures may provide:  Blending assets that are non- or negatively correlated to traditional assets provides diversification.  Unlike long-only investments, managed futures employ long/short strategies designed to potentially profit from both rising and falling markets.  They have the potential to perform in both inflationary and deflationary environments.  Many managed futures are not confined to commodities futures but can also invest in currencies or interest rate futures.

158,CTAS,"Strategic allocation models typically carve out a portion of an investment portfolio for alternative investments, such as commodities, hedge funds, private equity or managed futures. These alternative asset classes provide exposure to less correlated assets, theoretically increasing returns and lowering risks over the long term. Of course, investors are glad when these types of exposure are performing well and adding to their portfolio returns, but many have trouble understanding why they even own these assets when they are underperforming. This year, that questionable asset class has been commodities, which have come under pressure year-to-date as a result of slow global growth, a rising U.S. dollar and falling oil prices. If this trend persists, we feel that commodity indexes that provide long-only exposure may be missing out on an opportunity.

If the price trend reverses, the index has the ability to go long oil, and it could benefit from a rebound in prices.  Diversification Beyond Commodities Helped Drive Returns for DTI®—One of the most persistent trends year-to-date has been the strength of the U.S. dollar against other developed currencies. The flexibility for DTI® to go long or short non-U.S. currencies and U.S. Treasuries, beyond just commodities, has provided a further performance edge. DTI®'s performance has benefited from being long bothTreasury bonds and Treasury notes, as interest rates have fallen in the U.S. year-to-date.

"
170,CTAS,"There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. An investment in this Fund is speculative and involves a substantial degree of risk. One of the risks associated with the Fund is the complexity of the different factors that contribute to the Fund's performance, as well as its correlation (or non-correlation) to other asset classes. These factors include use of long and short positions in commodity futures contracts, currency forward contracts, swaps and other derivatives. Derivative investments can be volatile and may be less liquid than other securities and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions.

There can be no assurance that such trends will be reflected in future market movements.

211,CTAS,"With the broad U.S. equity markets off their most recent highs, some have started to draw parallels to 2008, and some are even starting to prepare their portfolios for a market correction.1 Although we do not believe the markets are headed for a substantial correction or a repeat of 2008, we do think it is important for investors to learn from the past. One of the most crucial outcomes from 2008 was that many investors became more aware of the importance of downside protection and true diversification. Traditional allocations, as it turned out, generally did not provide enough diversification, and as the markets unwound, correlations between traditional asset classes increased. Managed Futures Can Provide Multilevel Diversification Like during the 2008 sell-off, correlations can also increase during positively trending markets, which is what we have witnessed over the past few years, ultimately decreasing the diversification benefits traditional allocations may provide. Institutional investors have long utilized managed futures strategies as a way to achieve diversification and performance potential in almost any market. Consider some of the benefits managed futures provide:  They are usually non- or negatively correlated to traditional assets.  Unlike long-only investments, managed futures employ long/short strategies designed to profit from both rising and falling markets.  They have the potential to perform in both inflationary and deflationary environments. The DTI Index Has Performed—Even During a Crisis As illustrated below, the Diversified Trends Indicator™ (DTI®) Index has delivered consistent performance over the past 10 years. More important, the DTI Index performance held up during the 2008 financial crisis as correlations between equity and fixed income securities tended to increase and everything moved down together.

266,CTAS,"Milacron Holdings Corp. (MCRN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 20, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company had delivered improvement in both the top and bottom line. Last quarter, Milacron surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.76%. The company beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 12.8%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Milacron Holdings Corp. Price and EPS Surprise  Milacron Holdings Corp. price-eps-surprise | Milacron Holdings Corp. QuoteFactors to ConsiderMilacron recorded orders of $322 million in third-quarter 2017. In the first nine months of 2017, orders were up nearly 10%. This performance reflects continued strength in high-growth regions and a solid order book, both for Milacron’s injection and extrusion product lines going into 2018.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is pegged at $303 million which projects growth of 5% over the $289 million in the prior-year quarter. The year–over-year improvement will be aided by continued orders and sales momentum along with strength in global markets, particularly in Asia and Europe and growth across all segments.According to our latest consensus estimates, Milacron is anticipated to post net sales of $168 million for the fourth quarter in its Advanced Plastic Processing Technologies (“APPT”) segment, reflecting year–over-year growth of 5%. Further, our consensus estimates indicate that net sales of Melt Delivery and Control Systems will reach $106 million in the quarter, a projected year-over-year growth of 5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fluid Technologies is pegged at $29.7 million, a rise of 6% from the $28 million reported in the year-ago quarter.For the APPT segment, adjusted EBITDA will rise 7% year over year to $21.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA will be $6.7 million for the Fluid Technologies segment, a 13% year-over-year improvement. The Melt Delivery and Control Systems segment’s adjusted EBITDA is projected at $34 million, a 4% growth over the prior year. Milacron continues to work on supply chain efforts to more effectively offset higher input cost. It remains behind schedule in realizing savings in the European plant consolidation. These inefficiencies resulted from high order rates in Europe that delayed ongoing plant consolidation efforts in the region as the company had to manufacture in both locations. This, along with higher input costs will affect results in the to-be-reported quarter. Further, pricing pressure remains a headwind in the APPT segment due to the combination of competition, low-growth environment in North America and broader commodity deflationary headwinds. Additionally, Milacron has a substantial debt to capital ratio of 65% at the end of the third quarter. Subsequently, higher interest expense will hurt margins. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is 39 cents, a 17% decline from the 47 cents reported in the prior-year quarter. Earnings Whispers Our proven model shows that Milacron is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Milacron is +1.52%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 40 cents is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents.  A favorable Earnings ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Milacron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Conversely, stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement. The combination of Milacron’s Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of +1.52% makes us reasonably confident of a likely earnings beat. Share Price Performance  Milacron has outperformed the industry in the past six months. The company’s shares gained around 22% compared with 20% growth recorded by the industry. Other Stocks That Warrant a Look Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: Boise Cascade Company (BCC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +15.79% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Boise Cascade’s shares have surged 45% in the past six months. MasTec, Inc. (MTZ  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.10% and a Zacks Rank #2. Its shares have gone up 31% over the past six months. The Earnings ESP for Cintas Corporation (CTAS  -  Free Report) is +1.04%. It carries a Zacks Rank #2. Shares of Cintas have advanced 25% in the last six months. Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

Revenues are anticipated to increase in the range of 3-6%.Our TakePressing macroeconomic concerns pose challenges to Flowserve’s near-term prospects. Over the past few quarters, loss of sales leverage and related under-absorption has been hurting the company’s profitability. Also, upstream oil and gas market uncertainty, which has been bothering the company, has currently spread to midstream as well as downstream markets adding to its woes.Additionally, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company is facing dearth of middle and larger sized projects opportunities along with cost reduction and project delivery postponement pressures by customers. Hence, this remains a matter of concern for Flowserve going forward.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the same space include Harsco Corporation (HSC  -  Free Report), Avery Dennison Corporation (AVY  -  Free Report) and Cintas Corporation (CTAS  -  Free Report).

273,CTAS,"On Dec 27, we issued an updated research report on business services provider, Cintas Corporation (CTAS  -  Free Report).Cintas maintains a focused approach for steady top-line growth. Revenues have witnessed an increasing trend over the past few quarters. From fiscal 2010-2017, revenues have seen a compounded annual growth rate of 5.2%. In second-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues increased 26.4% year over year to $1,606.4 million, primarily driven by the accretive acquisition of G&K Services Inc. Moreover, addition of new customers, strong customer retention and higher penetration of existing customers through better and innovative products and services led to organic growth of 7.7%.Cintas aims to continually achieve revenue build-up by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include fresh business segments. Cintas also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio.The acquisition of G&K Services has further expanded Cintas’ customer profile as the combined company is catering to more than 1 billion customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service has also improved with increased route density. The synergies from the combined operations are expected to yield $130 million to $140 million in cost savings from the fourth year of its operation.In addition, Cintas has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. Over the years, the company has consistently returned significant cash to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Its investment strategy takes a holistic view of the rapidly evolving market and deploys a dynamic capital allocation approach to focus on the relative value of the various sectors within the broader industry.With a diligent execution of operational plans, Cintas has outperformed the industry with an average year-to-date return of 34.5% compared with a gain of 31.8% for the latter. Cintas has also raised its earlier guidance for fiscal 2018 on favorable growth trends. Revenues are currently expected in the range of $6,365 million to $6,430 million, up from $6,325 million to $6,400 million anticipated earlier. Earnings from continuing operations are expected to be between $5.39 and $5.46 per share, up from earlier projections of $5.30-$5.38.However, Cintas procures raw materials from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, making it susceptible to market risks which are beyond its control. A sustained increase in raw material costs such as cotton also weighs on the margins. Cintas also faces stiff competition from national, regional and local companies on various factors such as design, price, quality, service and convenience to customers. Specifically, its first aid and fire protection services are decidedly commoditized markets and hence are subject to fierce competition. As such, the company has to continually invest in value drivers to fend off competition, which further weakens its profitability. Moreover, a persistent challenging macroeconomic environment has mostly driven customers to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas, which has resulted in some loss of businesses.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Better-ranked stocks in the industry include UniFirst Corporation (UNF  -  Free Report), NV5 Global, Inc. (NVEE  -  Free Report) and Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

In those nine years, a $9,000 investment in the S&P 500 has turned into $49,200.However, recently, a number of market pundits are concerned that the bull runs that have sent the bourses to record highs might soon come crashing down. And why not? Rise in interest rates, likelihood of a new tech bubble and a pricey stock market are potential bottlenecks to investors’ hard-earned money. Valuation measures such as price-earnings ratios are increasing caution.Amid such uncertainty, investing in dividend aristocrats seems prudent, as they provide higher total returns with lower volatility, which are undoubtedly the ‘holy grail’ of investing. Such companies are also likely to make the most of the tax reform legislation and a steadily growing economy.Will You Have Money in Your Pocket as Fed Raises Rates?As widely expected, the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for the third time this year. The benchmark lending rate was hiked by a quarter percentage point to the range of 1.25-1.5%. In fact, Fed officials expect to raise rates at a steady pace in the coming years. The median expectation for rate hikes next year is pegged at three, at least two in 2019 and two more in 2020 (read more: Fed Hikes Rates: Top 5 Winners for 2018).Looming interest rate hikes mostly spell bad news for stock markets. Given that a rate hike will force consumers and business houses to pay more to borrow money it will eventually leave them with less money to spend.Tech Bubble, Overvaluation ConcernsThat said, a possibly bigger threat to the stock market is the bubble developing in the tech space. Silicon Valley’s major players including Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) are currently the three largest companies in the world in terms of market capitalization.Even though stellar growth of Apple, Microsoft and Amazon have given a boost to the stock market, their sheer size is a threat to the market if they start faltering. Moreover, experts believe that chances of these declining in the near future are a lot higher, as most technology stocks including these are priced too high compared to what they earn. This replicates the late Nineties, when the stock market was plagued by the so-called ‘dotcom’ bubble burst.In fact, two-third of the money managers finds the U.S. stock market’s recent record run unsettling. The gains in the current nine-year-old bull market are nearly 300%. This is now the second-strongest bull run since World War II, trailing only to a massive gain of 417% during October 1990 and March 2000, per data compiled by LPL Financial and FactSet Research Systems Inc. This year, the 30-stock Dow Jones has set record highs 70 times, the broader S&P 500 hit highs 53 times and the tech-heavy Nasdaq continues to hover near the coveted 7,000 mark.Time to Buy Dividend Aristocrats for 2018Given such an uncertain scenario, if you have money, where should you invest? Buy dividend aristocrats as they have tremendous financial strength and are immune to market vagaries. They reflect solid financial structure and healthy underlying fundamentals.

275,CTAS,"Sonoco Products Company (SON  -  Free Report) announced that it will increase the price of its paper-based tubes and cores by at least 6% due to the persistent rise in raw material costs. The price hike will be effective from Jul 16, relating to the shipments in the United States and Canada.Notably, Paperboard tubes and cores are elements of Sonoco’s Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment. In 2017, the company’s tubes and cores products were the largest revenue-producing group of products, representing around 22% of consolidated net sales in the year ended Dec 31, 2017.The price rise of tubes and cores is in response to the recent increase in costs for uncoated recycled paperboard (URB) which represents the largest input cost for tubes and cores. Also, Sonoco hiked prices to combat the rising costs of transportation.Sonoco Products Company Price  Sonoco Products Company Price | Sonoco Products Company QuoteSonoco expects strong performance in its Paper and Industrial converted product segment in second-quarter 2018, largely driven by solid demand and benefit from a favorable price-cost relationship. However, expected cost increases in raw materials, particularly tinplate steel and old corrugate containers (OCC), might hurt earnings.Although Sonoco projects that overall price/cost will be positive in 2018, the possibility of continued volatility in key raw material prices could make pricing for their recovery more challenging. Further, the company anticipates to face elevated freight costs and increased labor costs in 2018 which also remain matters of concern.Share Price PerformanceSonoco’s shares have outperformed the industry with respect to price, over the past year.

277,CTAS,"The U.S.-Canada trade dispute escalated after U.S. President Donald Trump called Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “very dishonest and weak.” Trump had accused Canada of “charging massive tariffs” to U.S. businesses.The tiff involved France and Germany who criticized Trump’s decision to back out of the G7 communique. Trump, in the meanwhile, threatened to double auto tariffs, marring the G7 efforts to show a united front.   With Trump refusing to endorse the G7 communique, stock market gains are likely to be capped. In fact, more uncertainty is lurking as Trump is set to meet North Korean President Kim Jong Un in Singapore. Amid such ambiguity, investing in dividend aristocrats seems prudent, as they provide higher total returns with lower volatility.No Breakthrough at G7 SummitTrump’s stinging attack on Canada jeopardized the G7’s efforts to maintain free and fair trade relationships. He specifically accused Canada of imposing a 270% tariff on dairy. This has forced many U.S. dairy products from making their way to Canada from the United States. Trump, in return, has decided to slap more import tariffs on the sensitive auto industry.Trump tweeted “PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our @G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that, ‘US Tariffs were kind of insulting’ and he ‘will not be pushed around.’ Very dishonest & weak. Our tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy!”Meanwhile, Trudeau’s office added that the dairy tariffs were primarily a reaction to Trump’s decision to levy charges on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the EU. Moreover, protective measures like Canada’s dairy tariff are very common throughout the world. Lest we forget, the United States has imposed tariffs to protect several of its industries, starting from the 350% tariff on tobacco to 160% on shelled peanuts.Trudeau said that Germany stood by the “jointly agreed communique” despite Trump’s decision to back out. France and Europe also continued to support the G7 communique and stated that anyone quitting the summit will be showing their “incoherence and inconsistency.”Historic Trump-Kim Summit, Central Bank MeetingsAmid the G7 trade spat, investors are keeping an eye on the much-talked-about meet between Trump and Kim in Singapore. The stakes are high as the summit marks the first time when both the leaders will meet in person to reach a denuclearization agreement on the Korean Peninsula.But, investors shouldn’t get their hopes up. Even if the meeting is successful, the stock market should brace for more gyrations as this week awaits outcome from central bank meetings.Time to Buy Dividend AristocratsSuch uncertainties make dividend paying stocks more attractive as they tend to outperform when the broader markets are facing gyrations. But, why dividend aristocrats? This is because this set of stocks outperforms other dividend payers on better quality business.This category of stocks reflects solid financial structure and healthy underlying fundamentals.

278,CTAS,"Cintas Corporation (CTAS  -  Free Report) has taken an initiative to provide details on the utility of back-up emergency and exit lights to all organizations. These automatic functioning lights are highly useful to United States where the incidence of power outage is higher than any other developed country. Encouragingly, elevated usage of these lights will likely spur demand for Cintas’ services, moving ahead.A survey conducted by Harris Insights & Analytics revealed that more than 34% of American adults consider their buildings unsafe during power loss. Notably, around 15 million individuals witness power cuts in the nation every year, making back-up emergency and exit lights a necessity.Cintas perceives that requirement of these lights will be even stronger in the upcoming U.S. summer season, when the frequency of power outages will be higher due to the occurrence of storms. Occurrences of harsh storms have been on a rise, of late, averaging between 70 and 130, every year.In this context, Cintas noted that back-up emergency and exit lights are essential for ensuring safety of building occupants during the summer storm season. In sync with this, the company specified that the facility and property managers should visually inspect their back-up lights regularly. Moreover, Cintas stated that managers should conduct complete functional tests and maintain thorough records of inspection for these lights.The aforementioned initiatives by facility and property managers will spur demand for Cintas’ non-imitable safety and first-aid services. Over the past month, the company’s shares have rallied 8%, outperforming the 6.6% gain recorded by the industry.The company is poised to grow on the back of the successful integration of G&K Services (acquired in March 2017), adequate liquidity and ongoing capital investments. Per our estimates, the company’s earnings are projected to grow 19.7% in fiscal 2019 (ending May 2019).Zacks Rank and Other StocksCintas currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

279,CTAS,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Cintas (CTAS  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 6.7% over the past month. CTAS hit a new 52-week high of $184.68 in the previous session. Cintas has gained 18.4% since the start of the year compared to the -6.4% move for the Industrial Products sector and the 16.1% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on March 22, 2018, Cintas reported EPS of $1.37 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1.35%.For the current fiscal year, Cintas is expected to post earnings of $5.83 per share on $6.44 billion in revenues. Meanwhile, for the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $6.97 per share on $6.79 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 19.7% and 5.42%, respectively.Valuation MetricsCintas may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for CTAS? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Cintas has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 31.7X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 28.2X versus its peer group's average of 18.5X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.64. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Cintas Corporation Price and Consensus Cintas Corporation Price and Consensus | Cintas Corporation QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Cintas currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Cintas meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though CTAS shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does Cintas Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Cintas have been rising, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including KION GROUP (KIGRY  -  Free Report), HD Supply Holdings (HDS  -  Free Report), and Ashtead Group (ASHTY  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.However, it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking, so it isn't all good news for Cintas. Still, the fundamentals for CTAS are promising, and it still has potential despite being at a 52-week high.

280,CTAS,"On May 23, we issued an updated research report on Cintas Corporation (CTAS  -  Free Report).The business services provider aims to continually achieve revenue build-up by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include fresh business segments. The company also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio. Revenues have witnessed an uptrend over the past few quarters. From 2010 to 2017, revenues of the company have recorded a compounded annual growth rate of 5.2%. Third-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues increased 26.6% year over year to $1,589.1 million while organic growth improved 7.8%.The successful integration of G&K Services Inc. has expanded Cintas’ customer profile and augmented its revenues. The combined company caters to more than 1 million customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service has also improved with increased route density. The synergies from the combined operations are expected to yield $130 million to $140 million in cost savings from the fourth year of its operation. The transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Cintas’ future earnings.In addition, Cintas has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. Over the years, the company has consistently returned significant cash to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Its investment strategy takes a holistic view of the rapidly evolving market and deploys a dynamic capital allocation approach to focus on the relative value of the various sectors within the broader industry. With a diligent execution of operational plans, Cintas has outperformed the industry with an average return of 22.7% in the last six months compared with a rise of 20% for the latter.At the same time, Cintas continues to benefit from the U.S. tax reform and provided bullish guidance for fourth-quarter fiscal 2018. Revenues are projected to be $1,625-$1,645 million. Earnings from continuing operations are expected to be between $1.64 and $1.69 per share. This assumes a fiscal fourth-quarter tax rate of 24%.However, Cintas procures raw materials from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, making it susceptible to market risks which are beyond its control. Its first aid and fire protection services are decidedly commoditized markets and hence are subject to fierce competition. As such, the company has to continually invest in value drivers to fend off competition, which further weakens its profitability. Moreover, some customers have started to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas. This resulted in some loss of businesses.  Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. Some other top-ranked stocks in the industry are Altra Industrial Motion Corp. (AIMC  -  Free Report), IDEX Corporation (IEX  -  Free Report) and Kadant Inc. (KAI  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Altra Industrial Motion topped estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 5.1%.IDEX has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 11%.

283,CTAS,"On Apr 3, we issued an updated research report on business services provider, Cintas Corporation (CTAS  -  Free Report).Cintas maintains a focused approach for steady top-line growth. Revenues have been witnessing an increasing trend over the past few quarters. From 2010-2017, revenues of the company have recorded a compounded annual growth rate of 5.2%. Third-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues increased 26.6% year over year to $1,589.1 million while organic growth improved 7.8%.Cintas aims to continually achieve revenue build-up by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include fresh business segments. Cintas also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio.The successful integration of G&K Services Inc. is further likely to expand Cintas’ customer profile and augment its revenues. The combined company is likely to cater to more than one million customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density. The synergies from the combined operations are expected to yield $130 million to $140 million in cost savings from the fourth year of its operation. The transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Cintas’ future earnings.In addition, Cintas has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. Over the years, the company has consistently returned significant cash to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Its investment strategy takes a holistic view of the rapidly evolving market and deploys a dynamic capital allocation approach to focus on the relative value of the various sectors within the broader industry. Cintas has outperformed the industry with an average return of 3.9% in the last three months compared with a gain of 3.4% for the latter.At the same time, Cintas continues to benefit from the U.S. tax reform and provided bullish guidance for fourth-quarter fiscal 2018. Revenues are projected to be $1,625-$1,645 million. Earnings from continuing operations are expected to be between $1.64 and $1.69 per share. This assumes a fiscal fourth-quarter tax rate of 24%.However, Cintas procures raw materials from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, making it susceptible to market risks which are beyond its control. A continuous increase in raw material costs such as cotton also weighs on its margins. Cintas faces stiff competition from national, regional and local companies on various factors such as design, price, quality, service and convenience to the customers. Specifically, its first aid and fire protection services are decidedly commoditized markets and hence are subject to fierce competition. As such, the company has to continually invest in value drivers to fend off competition, which further weakens its profitability. Moreover, some customers have started to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas. This resulted in some loss of businesses.  Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Some better-ranked stocks in the broader industry are Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. (AIT  -  Free Report), Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report) and EnPro Industries, Inc. (NPO  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The company is likely to report higher revenues from Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment, accounting for lion’s share of total revenues, due to improved demand for its products.This, in turn, is likely to result in higher earnings for the quarter.Top-Line ExpansionCintas recorded industry-leading revenue growth over the past few quarters, with continued focus on core businesses. New business wins, deeper penetration of existing customers with more products and services, and customer retention remain key strengths of the company. In addition, Cintas identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand the company's portfolio.

292,CTAS,"Leading business service provider Cintas Corporation (CTAS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on Dec 21. The company is likely to report higher revenues from Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment, which accounts for the lion’s share of total revenues, due to improved demand for its products.This, in turn, is likely to result in higher earnings for the quarter.Top-Line ImprovementCintas recorded industry leading revenue growth over the past few quarters with continued focus on core businesses. New business wins, deeper penetration of existing customers with more products and services, and customer retention remain key strengths of the company. In addition, Cintas also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is likely to benefit the company in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Moreover, the successful integration of G&K Services Inc. is likely to expand Cintas’ customer profile and augment its revenues. With annual revenues of approximately $1 billion, G&K Services has more than 170,000 customers in the United States and Canada. The combined company is expected to cater more than one billion business customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment revenues is currently pegged at $1,296 million, up from $1,006 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues from First Aid Safety and Protection segment are expected to be $137 million compared with reported revenues of $125 million in the year-earlier quarter.Other Key FactorsHowever, a persistently challenging macroeconomic environment has mostly driven customers to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas. This is expected to result in some loss of businesses. In addition, significant international operations expose it to risks of fluctuation in foreign exchange rates, which in turn, is likely to impact its financial results.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cintas is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components.

293,CTAS,"Investors on the lookout for stocks with the potential for maximum growth and value investing may consider the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy.This well-liked strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive growth prospects that are trading at a discount. GARP investing employs popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book value (P/B) ratio – to evaluate whether a stock is undervalued.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only nine.Here are five stocks that made it through the screen:CBRE Group Inc.  operates as a commercial real estate services and investment company.

300,CTAS,"Leading business service provider Cintas Corporation (CTAS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on Sep 26. In the last reported quarter, its adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10 cents. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors to ConsiderCintas has completed the acquisition of rival, G&K Services Inc. With annual revenues of approximately $1 billion, G&K Services has over 170,000 customers in the United States and Canada. The successful integration of G&K Services is likely to expand Cintas’ customer profile and augment its revenues. The combined company is expected to cater to over one billion business customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity.Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density. The synergies from the combined operations are expected to yield $130 million to $140 million in cost savings and the transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Cintas’ earnings in the full year of its operation.Furthermore, Cintas recorded industry leading revenue growth over the past few quarters with continued focus on core businesses. New business wins, deeper penetration of existing customers with more products and services and customer retention remain key strengths of the company. In addition, Cintas also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is likely to reap benefits in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Cintas has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. Over the years, the company has consistently returned significant cash to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Its investment strategy takes a holistic view of the rapidly evolving market and deploys a dynamic capital allocation approach to focus on the relative value of the various sectors within the broader industry.However, a persistently challenging macroeconomic environment has mostly driven customers to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas. This is expected to result in some loss of businesses. In addition, significant international operations expose it to risks of fluctuation in foreign exchange rates, which in turn is likely to impact its financial results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Cintas is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:  Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate of $1.23 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.26, is -2.54%.

Currently, the company operates in 13 locations, with total sales representing around 4% of its consolidated net sales in the first half of fiscal 2017.Over the last week, owing to severe weather conditions, many facilities remained closed and were unable to ship products. However, there was no material damage to the facilities, equipment or inventories. Some of these facilities have resumed operations as of Sep 5.Per management, the areas impacted by the storm will take time to return to its normal shipping levels.

Earnings per share topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.38.Reliance Steel recorded net sales of $2,475.2 million, up around 12.3% year over year, coming ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,416.1 million.The company, in its second-quarter call, noted that it expects earnings for the third quarter to be in the band of $1.15-$1.25 per share.Reliance Steel is likely to gain from the strong momentum across aerospace and automotive markets. It is also expected to benefit from aggressive acquisition strategy, broad and diversified product base and wide geographic footprint. Reliance Steel remains committed to offer incremental returns to shareholders.However, the company’s business in the energy markets is expected to remain under pressure due to low oil pricing. The non-residential construction market also remains on a slow road to recovery. The steel industry also suffers from fundamental issues including low capacity utilization, cheaper imports, excess supply and inventory glut.Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co.

302,CTAS,"On Aug 24, we issued an updated research report on business services provider, Cintas Corporation (CTAS  -  Free Report).Cintas maintains a focused approach for steady top-line growth. Revenues have witnessed an increasing trend over the past few quarters. From 2010-2017, revenues of the company have witnessed a compounded annual growth rate of 5.2%. Cintas aims to continually achieve revenue build-up by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include fresh business segments. Cintas also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio.The acquisition of G&K Services Inc. is further likely to expand Cintas’ customer profile and augment its revenues. The combined company is likely to cater to over one billion customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density. The synergies from the combined operations are expected to yield $130 million to $140 million in cost savings from the fourth year of its operation. The transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Cintas’ future earnings.In addition, Cintas has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. Over the years, the company consistently returned significant cash to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Its investment strategy takes a holistic view of the rapidly evolving market and deploys a dynamic capital allocation approach to focus on the relative value of the various sectors within the broader industry. Cintas has outperformed the industry with an average year-to-date return of 16% compared with a gain of 11.8% for the latter.However, Cintas procures raw materials from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, making it susceptible to market risks which are beyond its control. A continuous increase in raw material costs such as cotton also weighs on its margins. Cintas faces stiff competition from national, regional and local companies on various factors such as design, price, quality, service and convenience to the customers. Specifically, its first aid and fire protection services are decidedly commoditized markets and hence are subject to fierce competition. As such, the company has to continually invest in value drivers to fend off competition, which further weakens its profitability. Moreover, a persistent challenging macroeconomic environment has mostly driven customers to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas. This resulted in some loss of businesses.  Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. Other stocks in the industry worth considering include Barnes Group Inc. (B  -  Free Report), Graco Inc. (GGG  -  Free Report) and Superior Uniform Group, Inc. (SGC  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Barnes has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 9%.Graco has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 10.5%.

304,CTAS,"August is widely believed to be a bearish month for the stock market. However, market participants shouldn’t fear a stock market correction, simply because July has been pretty strong and 2017 has turned out to be an encouraging year so far. Upbeat corporate earnings and the economy’s breezing past the $19 trillion mark for the first time ever will surely help the broader markets fend off any negative sentiments in August.In fact, historically, August has traditionally been a bullish month for the Nasdaq. This calls for investing in some rock-solid stocks listed in the tech-heavy index for solid gains.August Traditionally a Soft Month for the Dow JonesAs the Dow Jones entered August, it braced itself for a two-month stretch known for stock market declines. August has been the worst month for the blue-chip index for the past two decades, with an average decline of 1.4%.The Dow has also endured major turbulences in August since the bull market began after the 2008-09 financial crisis. In 2015, the Dow tanked 6.6% in August on fears of a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy, China. Such apprehensions emerged after Beijing devalued its currency. Similarly in 2013, the Dow tumbled 4.4% in August due to Syria’s use of chemical weapons and weak earnings releases by Macy’s and Walmart. Fear of Greece defaulting on its debt affected the Dow in Aug 2011.S&P 500 Faces Perilous SummerThe S&P 500 is also preparing itself as it enters the historically soft month of August. The index, on an average, has gained a meagre 0.08% over the past 50 years in the month, as per data from Schaeffer’s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White. Performance-wise, September is second to August in terms of the worst performing months.The S&P 500 usually puts up a weak performance in August as the month follows the presidential elections. Sometimes in August, the benchmark index had posted negative returns while almost all other months registered positive results.What’s Working Against the Markets?August is vacation time and investors often view the indices critically before making investment plans for the rest of the year. So, the slightest of negative tidings spook investors, resulting in increased market gyrations.August has also been a weak month for a very specific reason. In the month, farmers usually withdraw substantial funds from Wall Street to purchase seeds. This outflow of funds results in an underperformance by the stock market. And why? Such high outflows negatively impact the psyche of Wall Street investors and traders.July Sets the Tone for an Upbeat YearBut, the stock market’s strong July performance might dispel some of the negative sentiments that emerge in August. All major indices saw their best performance in July since February, banking on healthy corporate earnings results and growing optimism on the strength of the economy. Such a positive momentum is expected to continue in August as well.Total Q2 earnings for the companies listed in the S&P 500 index are expected to be up 9.2% from the same period last year on 5% higher revenues. Secondly, an above-average proportion of companies are already beating EPS and revenue estimates (read more: Q2 Earnings Season Past the Halfway Mark).The U.S. economy, on the other hand, rebounded in the second quarter and more than doubled from the first quarter. Pick-up in consumer spending and an uptick in business investment in software, research and equipment boosted economic growth. Consumer outlays in particular improved on a steady job market and healthier household finances (read more: US GDP Crosses $19TN for the First Time: 5 Best Gainers).Analytics firm Kensho, in the meanwhile, added that if the S&P 500 gains 9% or more on a year-to-date basis through July, performance in August performance is usually higher in 8 of 14 occurrences since 1980. Heading into August, the benchmark index has gained more than 10%.5 Top Stocks to Buy in AugustEven though stocks have entered their worst month of the year, July’s stellar show is expected to ward off any serious downturns. The Nasdaq, in fact, has done well in August in the large majority of years from 1990 to date. The Nasdaq has overcome the dot-com crash and has yielded gains as much as 4.7% or more on an average in August. Banking on such positives, investing in fundamentally sound firms listed in the tech-laden index seems to be judicious.We have, thus, selected five such stocks that that not only boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) but also have a VGM score of ‘A’ or ‘B.’ Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.Cypress Semiconductor Corporation (CY  -  Free Report) manufactures embedded system solutions for automotive, industrial, home automation and appliances, consumer electronics and medical products.
