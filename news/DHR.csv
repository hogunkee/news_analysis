1,DHR,"General Electric (GE) will cut 2016 and 2017 earnings per share after adopting a new accounting standard and has begun revamping its board of directors.X Separately, Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) sold most of its GE stock in 2017, said Monday he was ""staggered"" by GE's financial lapses.The industrial conglomerate's earnings restatement will take into account revenue from long-term contracts, resulting in a 13-cent reduction in reported EPS for 2016 and a 16-cent EPS cut for 2017, according to GE's 10-K filing. The changes coincide with a Securities and Exchange Commission probe over its accounting tied to long-term care contracts tied to GE Capital.""In late March, we will provide comparative results for 2016 and 2017 that reflect the new standard,"" GE said in a news release issued late Friday. GE, whose earnings reports also are seen as overly complex and a headache for investors, promised to increase disclosures, standardization and transparency on various fronts. They include these five major changes:A looming risk flagged in the 10-K filing is potential litigation related to GE's legacy subprime mortgage business WMC Mortgage, which has been under investigation by the Justice Department.RBC Capital Markets warned the probe could result in a cash charge and legal action from the DOJ, unless both sides can reach a settlement.GE on Monday also announced three new candidates to its board in advance of the company's annual meeting on April 25. The three new directors are former Danaher Corp. (DHR) CEO Lawrence Culp, ex-American Airlines (AAL) CEO Thomas Horton and the former chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, Leslie Seidman. Nine directors including activist investor Trian Fund Management's Edward Garden will stand for re-election.That will take the board's size to a total of 12, down from 18 in prior years, in keeping with GE CEO John Flannery's stated goals, which also include getting out of several businesses, slashing costs, and even exploring a break up into separate public entities.Shares of GE closed up 1.1% at 14.65 on the stock market today, after making a fresh 52-week low earlier and hitting its worst level since July 2010.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportMeanwhile, Buffet told CNBC in a Monday interview that ""the accounting at GE has not been a model at all in recent years.""The Berkshire chief propped up GE with capital during the financial crisis, which eventually led to an equity stake in the industrial giant. But Berkshire has ""mostly"" sold that stock, Bloomberg reported Buffett as having said Monday.The billionaire, value-oriented investor hasn't bought any GE stock recently nor has he been courted on potential GE divestitures. Cash has been piling up at Berkshire, but Buffett has been hard-pressed to find an acquisition at the right price.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:These 3 Top-Rated Stocks Report Earnings This WeekHow To Make Money In Stocks Using The CAN SLIM Investing SystemThe Big Picture: Here Are Two Reasons To WorryNot Every Market Follow-Through Works: 2 Red Flags To Watch For

5,DHR,"The troubled General Electric (GE) has a bull in its corner — one who calls himself the only real GE bull left and who admits even his patience is running thin.X Melius Research's Scott Davis acknowledged getting pushback ""on buying GE here"" as other industrial peers ride the upcycle wave while GE struggles to find a bottom.Yet five small catalysts could move GE stock in an outsized way, the analyst wrote in a Thursday note:IBD'S TAKE: Don't try to guess the market's next move. Read The Big Picture every day to understand the action of the major averages and leading stocks.It's time for GE to ""come clean"" on what the prior management did to mislead investors, as well as to provide honest information, a plan of attack, and a time frame for execution, Davis concluded.

6,DHR,"In an industry clogged with look-alike mutual funds, an ESG focus helps Calvert Equity Fund (CSIEX) stand out. The $2.2 billion fund bases its buy decisions not only on fundamental financial analysis but also on socially responsible criteria.X ESG refers to environmental, social and corporate governance criteria. ""Investors are attracted to this approach (using ESG factors) because they want to invest in companies that are solving these pressing ESG challenges,"" said Anthony Eames, director of responsible investment strategy for Calvert Research & Management. ""Over time, companies that get ESG factors right benefit from that, and that's good for the companies and their shareholders.""The financial fundamentals that the fund's four managers screen for are designed to find ""companies with consistent growth and stability in earnings,"" said Joseph Hudepohl, one of four Atlanta Capital Management co-managers who subadvise the fund for Calvert. Both Atlanta and Calvert are units of Eaton Vance.""Companies like that can thrive in any environment,"" he added. ""They're not reliant on the capital markets for funding, so they can withstand periods like (the financial crisis of) 2008-09, and they can compound over time.""Those traits are reflected in fund performance: strong, not dazzling, with lower downside risk than many of its peers.Calvert Equity outperformed the broad market in the form of the S&P 500 for the past year going into Thursday, up 30.87% vs. 26.95%. Large-cap growth mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Direct averaged 32.56%. And the fund provided shareholders with a smoother ride than its peer group has over time periods stretching from three to 15 years. Over the past three years, for example, the fund has gone down less than 85% of the S&P 500 in downturns, while its peers have averaged declines of more than 110% vs. the big-cap bogey.Calvert analysts sift through a universe of about 2,500 stocks. They pass a pool of 100 to 150 stocks that meet its ESG standards to the fund's Atlanta Capital co-managers. ""Then, based on our financial criteria and (low) valuation, we gravitate to the 45 to 50 names that make it into our portfolio,"" Hudepohl said.""Our universe of high quality businesses overlaps a lot with Calvert's universe of businesses that meet their ESG standards,"" he added.He says companies that satisfy the criteria tend to have tail winds because of those traits. ""There are long-term benefits to focusing on clean water like Danaher (DHR), for example, and on clean air like Praxair (PX).""Danaher's products include water treatment and vapor recovery systems. Its earnings per share rose 8%, 10% and 15% the past three quarters. Shares are up 27% in the past 12 months.Praxair makes atmospheric gases, process gases and industrial gas production equipment. EPS grew 7%, 5%, 6% and 8% the past four quarters, which followed eight quarters of EPS declines. Share price rose 37% in the past 12 months. The stock yields 2%.ESG criteria do not prevent the fund from investing in stocks that are popular among investors. FANG stalwarts Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) are holdings.IBD'S TAKE: You can see how Apple's strengths — like its five quarters of earnings per share growth acceleration — stack up against its peers at the stock's easy-to-read IBD Stock Checkup page.Calvert Equity's thesis for Facebook focuses on what Facebook excels at. ""Advertising dollars go where the eyeballs are,"" Hudepohl said. ""The internet is taking (consumers) eyeball time away from other media. And Facebook is one of the top truly global platforms after Google (for attracting consumers). It benefits from worldwide growth in attracting advertising dollars.""Equity managers like the steady earnings growth prospects for both Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V). ""They're two of the better examples of high-quality growth stocks and what we're looking for from a financial perspective,"" Hudepohl said about the credit card giants.Both companies also appear to have long runways in front of them. ""Amazingly, half of all transactions in developed markets are still in cash, so there is a lot of opportunity there,"" he said. ""And within emerging markets like India, China and South America, 90% of transactions are still done in cash.""And the two companies avoid taking on consumers' credit risk. ""They don't carry loans (from consumers),"" Hudepohl said. ""They are paid on each swipe of a card because of their technology. And the number of swipes is increasing.""Also, the companies have huge free cash flow, Hudepohl says. ""So they don't depend on capital markets to grow their businesses,"" he said. That means they don't have to issue stock or pay interest on loans or bonds to pay for capital expenditures or develop new technology.Charles Schwab (SCHW) benefits from a long-term secular tail wind of online brokers gaining market share, Hudepohl says. Also, Schwab stands to gain from rising interest rates. ""(The) low interest rate environment forced Schwab along with the rest of the industry to grant fee waivers on money market funds,"" Hudepohl said. ""As rates rise, those fees are being reinstituted.""""Secondly, the low rate environment also compressed net interest margin,"" he added. ""As rates rise, the spread that Schwab earns on its assets should continue to expand. Both benefits carry very high incremental margins to Schwab.""RELATED:Here's How Wall Street Professionals Play Bitcoin — Should You?You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

9,DHR,"JPMorgan Mid Cap Growth Fund (HLGEX) has heated up this year thanks to leading-stock holdings like electronic parts maker Amphenol (APH), electronic payments processor Global Payments (GPN) and hotels-resorts-timeshares operator Hilton Worldwide (HLT). Their gains year to date range from 22% for Amphenol to 36% for Global.XAnd to help keep the good times rolling, the $3.2 billion fund is betting on top new buys as of its latest disclosure such as IPG Photonics (IPGP), a maker of fiber-optic lasers for industrial and medical applications; Linux operating system distributor Red Hat (RHT); and semiconductor test-equipment maker Teradyne (TER).Year-to-date gains by those newcomers ranged from 45% by Teradyne to 87% for IPG.

Other popular premium offerings include exclusive stock lists and The Big Picture, a daily update of what's driving the market.For the fund, all of that good news translated into a 21.64% gain this year going into Thursday. That outperformed 87% of the fund's midcap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Direct and easily topped the S&P 500's 13.66% return.The fund produced a three-year average annual gain of 9.13% vs. the big-cap bogey's 10.43% pace and the fund peer group's 8.59%.One reason the three-year tempo lags year-to-date gain is the three-year average includes the fund's paltry 2016 gain of 0.19%, which lagged 91% of its direct rivals.That makes this year, so far, the poster child for the fund's approach, which aims for capital growth through midcap- stocks with above-average growth. As the fund's latest fact sheet puts it, the fund's managers seek companies that are industry leaders, with business models that hold up in a variety of markets and whose executives know how to steer their charges to outsized growth.Timothy Parton just notched his 13th anniversary at the helm of the fund. Felise Agranoff has been a manager for about a year and nine months.Take a closer look at some of the fund's leading stocks. Portfolio newcomer Teradyne has IBD's next-to-highest-possible Composite Rating of 98. Scored on a scale of 1 to 99, stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.The maker of automated test equipment for the chip industry also has an A SMR Rating, which means it is in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.The chip-testing systems firm serves the automobile, computing and game markets.In addition, Teradyne is in IBD's 85-85 index. The index tracks stocks whose EPS and Relative Strength Ratings are 85 or greater, and whose prices are above $15, are within 15% of their 52-week high and whose average daily trading volume is 10,000 shares or more.In July, the company's second-quarter report showed earnings per share up 64%. The 31% jump in revenue was the biggest jump in at least 19 quarters. Teradyne said results in the first half of the year were driven by strength in mobility, automotive, analog, microcontroller and memory end markets.Bright Horizons (BFAM) is another top new buy. Earnings per share growth has accelerated, having climbed 14%, 19%, 20% and 21% the past four quarters. The firm provides child care, early education and other services.It sports a 95 Comp Rating and an A SMR Rating.The rise in Q2 revenue and EPS growth was driven by both new full-service child-care centers and improved results from existing ones, the company said. Price increases averaged 3% to 4%. In addition, sales of backup dependent care and educational advisory services expanded.Fortive (FTV), a newcomer to the portfolio, makes equipment for testing and measurement, many for field instruments. EPS rose 13% and 11% the past two quarters, up from 1% the prior stanza.A spinoff from Danaher (DHR), Fortive was held by 1,388 mutual funds as of June 30. That was up from 1,305 funds as of Sept. 30, 2016. Funds' collective stakes rose to 148.3 million shares, up from 135.1 million shares.RELATED:Looking For Winning Stocks?

12,DHR,"""Wait and see"" is the mantra of ETF investors as Donald Trump assumes the reins of the highest office in the land. Will his ambitious campaign proposals translate to policy or get lost in translation?""The U.S. equity markets have enjoyed a classic 'buy the rumor' rally,"" built around Trump's promises, said David Haviland of Beaumont Capital, an expert at investing in exchange traded funds. ""The question is, what will be the news that causes the sell?""Haviland is one of two money managers who spoke to IBD recently about their stock market outlook as well as their best ETF investment ideas for the year ahead. For the moment, Haviland is making some bullish bets.One of Haviland's picks, O'Shares FTSE U.S. Quality Dividend (OUSA) holds stocks that could rocket if Trump delivers fiscal stimulus as promised and allows U.S. companies to bring home their offshore cash.Click Here For A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2017Henry Ma of Julex Capital, another investing pro, expects two postelection rotation trades — from bonds to equities and from high yield to growth — to continue. His ETF picks, too, reflect an overall optimism.Still, both Haviland and Ma have eyes wide open to downside risks. Like many other investors, they straddle hope and caution as the White House welcomes its newest resident.Here they are in their own words:David Haviland is managing partner and portfolio manager at Beaumont Capital Management, a Needham, Mass.-based asset manager offering ETF-based growth strategies with defensive capabilities since 2009; assets under management and advisement: $3.7 billion as of September 2016.After the Nov. 8 election, the U.S. equity markets have enjoyed a classic ""buy the rumor"" rally. The rally has focused on the promises made during the election and the prospects for beneficial change.Specifically, some of the key topics include a $1 trillion, 10-year Federal stimulus package to improve infrastructure, the reworking of the federal corporate tax system to make our tax code more competitive, the renegotiation of several trade agreements that currently induce the exportation of jobs, and the likelihood of large amounts of repatriation of U.S. multinational foreign profits.All of these items should serve to stimulate growth and reflation here in the U.S. The question is, what will be the news that causes the sell? Investors tend to buy the rumor and sell the news.Here are four ETFs that should do well in 2017. These ETFs are currently owned or could be purchased at any time within BCM strategies.In a low-interest-rate environment, the baby boomers need income from their portfolio to live off of. O'Shares has distilled the universe of large-cap equities down to a portfolio of 151 companies across all sectors that should provide better long-term, risk-adjusted returns.Examples of these portfolio companies with superior balance sheets include Apple (AAPL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Microsoft (MSFT), Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Procter & Gamble (PG). (Editor's note: OUSA has a 2.32% 12-month yield.)To be included, at least 50% of a company's sales and revenue must come from the internet. The ETF also uses a more limited screening process for liquidity and size. The top holdings include the ""FANG"" stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and (Google parent) Alphabet (GOOGL).Over one-third of humanity currently lives without clean water. The infrastructure required for this most important resource will be massive here in the U.S. as well as across the globe in both developed and emerging markets.The ETF should benefit from Trump's infrastructure build here in the U.S. We do not currently own this ETF but we have in the past, and it could make its way back into the portfolio in 2017.Top positions in the fund include Danaher (DHR), London-based Wolseley, Switzerland-based Geberit and France-based Veolia Environmental, which illustrates the global reach.(Editor's note: While the ETF has relatively low average trading volume, a large asset manager like BCM can access the underlying liquidity of the stocks in the index through the create/redeem process.)In a rising-rate environment, Treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) tend to perform better than regular bonds given their yield plus inflation construct — the principal rises with inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, while the yield is fixed.This ETF also uses a short duration, currently 2.4 years, as added protection against rising rates. It yields 0.89%.Henry Ma is president and chief investment officer at Julex Capital Management, an SEC-registered quantitative investment management firm based in Boston. The firm's tactical unconstrained investment solutions aim to limit downside risks while maximizing upside potential; total client assets as of September 2016: $358 million.As we enter 2017, we may be witnessing major shifts of economic policies, which could have significant impacts on financial markets. The new year is likely to see a continuing rise of protectionism, which is evidenced notably in the Brexit referendum and the U.S. presidential election.This trend could undermine global growth, but there will be winners and losers. The export-dependent sectors have the most to lose.After eight years of monetary stimulus, policymakers among the developed countries have realized that loose monetary policies are no longer effective and fiscal policies are needed to spur economic growth. In the U.S., President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to reduce taxes and spend $1 trillion on infrastructure.These potential fiscal expansion programs have improved growth prospects, fueling higher inflation expectations, pushing bond yields upward, and causing losses for bond holders. We will see more rotation from bonds to equities in this reflationary environment. Within the equity markets, the yield-seeking trade has run its course as investors rotate from high-yielding sectors to growth sectors. We expect these two rotation trades to continue, and recommend three ETFs that could outperform in 2017.The Fed is likely to raise interest rates to 1.25%-1.50% at the end of 2017. This higher rate will certainly boost the profit margin for financial stocks. The potential appeal or revision of financial regulations such as Dodd-Frank by the Trump administration will also help improve their profitability and earnings growth.As we expect the U.S. economy to grow above 3% in 2017, the tech sector will benefit from increasing demand and higher revenue growth. The valuation is still attractive as the sector is traded at a slightly lower forward PE ratio than the S&P 500 index.Potentially protectionist trade policies and fiscal expansion programs will generate more domestic demand for small companies' products. The trailing PE ratio of IWM is 21.4, which is close to the PE ratio of the S&P 500 Index (20.4). Better growth prospects will provide small-cap stocks with more upside potential.(Editor's note: These ETFs are currently owned/were recently owned by Julex Capital strategies and could be purchased at any time within their client portfolios.)RELATED:High Yield Strategy Uses 10 ETFs To Deliver All-Weather Income With Low Risks6 Best ETFs For When You're Both Bullish And Cautious About The Markets

13,DHR,"IShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF (IHI) finds itself near highs as most of its holdings participate in the hottest segments of the medical sector this year.Most of the 47 stocks in the fund fall into one of two IBD industry groups: medical products or medical systems and equipment. Both have been in the top 25 of 197 IBD groups for many weeks, and both have the best year-to-date performance among 14 groups that make up the medical sector.Medical systems and equipment is up about 20% as a group, while the medical products group has climbed some 15%. Since the market low of June, however, biotechs and generic-drug stocks have made much stronger gains. Still, the medical equipment subset is up 18% in that period and the products group is up 15% -- better than nearly all other health care groups.You won't find any pharmaceutical companies in iShares U.S. Medical Devices, but rather companies that provide the tools to develop drugs and to help patients deal with medical problems. Indeed, the companies' product offerings span from syringes, to heart valves, to robotic surgical systems.The ETF -- which itself is up more than 17% in 2016 -- is trying to break out past the 145.85 buy point of a flat base. If it can hold above the 50-day moving average, there's a better chance of rising past the entry. Shares had their best run of 2016 from February to early August.The ETF's chart closely resembles that of its largest holding, Medtronic (MDT). The stock has been forming a shallow base and is near new highs. Among its many products, Medtronic makes insulin pumps, ear infection treatments, coronary stents and brain-stimulus devices to treat nervous-system disorders.Thermo Fischer Scientific (TMO), the fund's second-largest holding, rallied for most of September and also is nearing new highs. The company, which is in the research equipment and services industry group, makes medical research instruments.On Sept. 19, it completed its $4.2 billion acquisition of FEI, a maker of high-performance microscopes. Acquisitions have been part of the story in the medical devices industry, though not always resulting in stock gains.Danaher (DHR) has been a drag on the portfolio. The stock was basing nicely near highs in August but started tumbling with the Sept. 6 announcement that it is acquiring Cepheid (CPHD), which makes a system for fast genetic testing, for $4 billion.Abbott Laboratories (ABT), with nearly an 8% weighting in the ETF, also hasn't been much of a contributor. Shares remain locked in a 14-month-old consolidation.IShares U.S. Medical Devices has an average annual return of 20.35% over three years and 20.81% over five years.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market. A computer algorithm selects the ETFs based on relative strength and other objective performance ratings, with periodic adjustments for market trends and conditions. The universe from which the ETFs are selected includes the funds listed below.            RELATED:Danaher Buying Cepheid To Expand Diagnostics Business

14,DHR,"Diagnostics company Cepheid (CPHD) was soaring in early trading Tuesday after life-science instrument giant Danaher (DHR) announced an agreement to acquire the company for $4 billion in cash, or $53 per share.Cepheid, whose GeneXpert system provides rapid automated genetic testing, expects to generate $618 million to $635 million in revenue this year, adding to Danaher's $5 billion annual revenue base. Danaher expects 5 cents a share of earnings accretion in the first year, rising to 30 cents by year five.Cepheid shares rose nearly 53% to 52.53 on the stock market today, the highest since September 2015.Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken wrote that this deal fits with the larger acquisition strategy of Danaher CEO Thomas Joyce.""Cepheid is a growth-centric acquisition (could add 50 basis points to organic growth) with high consumable flow (>75%), cementing Tom's bias as a technology forward CEO,"" Muken wrote in a research note. ""The asset compliments the company's existing diagnostics platform and accelerates their entry into molecular markets.""Needham analyst Mike Matson wrote that an acquisition had been baked into his thesis on Cepheid, with Abbott Laboratories (ABT) being the other likely acquirer. But he says Abbott is too tied up in legal battles over its acquisition of Alere (ALR) to make a counter bid, so he downgraded Cepheid stock to neutral.Danaher stock was down fell 2.1% to 79.50 Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: With a strong Composite Rating of 94, Danaher is a longtime resident of the IBD Big Cap 20 list of large caps with solid growth profiles.RELATED:GE Buys European 3D Printing Firms, Lifting 3D Systems, Stratasys

15,DHR,"Major averages were mixed and mostly unchanged early Tuesday after the long Labor Day weekend.Dow component Apple (AAPL) edged higher ahead of Wednesday's event, when the company is expected to unveil a new iPhone. Shares rose 0.4%. Apple's chart has improved in recent weeks. Shares are holding above a prior resistance level around 100, bringing a possible breakout over a 110.33 buy point into play.China-based names Baidu (BIDU), NetEase (NTES) and JD.com (JD) outperformed in the Nasdaq 100, with gains of 2% to 5%.The Nasdaq composite added 0.1%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 dipped 0.1%.In the stock market today, Cepheid (CPHD) surged 52% after Danaher (DHR) agreed to acquire Cepheid for around $4 billion, or $53 a share. Cepheid makes molecular analysis systems used to identify infectious diseases and cancers.Meanwhile, consolidation in the pipeline industry continued after Canada-based Enbridge (ENB) announced plans to acquire Houston-based Spectra Energy (SE) for $28 billion. Shares of Enbridge rose 4% while Spectra jumped 13%.Elsewhere, Leaderboard name Line (LN) opened nicely higher on news Japan's most popular messaging app is adding a mobile phone service to its offerings. Shares rose nearly 5% to 44.11. Morgan Stanley brought Line public in mid-July at 32.75 a share.

16,DHR,"The market has seen some big winners since Brexit. Who are they, and what clues do they offer for how to play the market?The three sectors that did the best following the post-Brexit pullback were technology, financial services and industrials.Tech sector funds zapped ahead 13.34% on average. Financials rebounded 12.30%. Industrials got pumped up by 8.34%.Each of those topped the S&P 500's 7.24% rally. The big-cap bogey had sagged about 6% during the two trading days following the U.K.'s June 23 vote to get a divorce from the European Union.One sector actually lost ground post-Brexit. Utilities funds retreated 2.78%. Their return for the third quarter through the end of August was a negative 6.61%.The four top-performing tech sector funds since Brexit with at least $100 million in assets are $1.7 billion Fidelity Select Electronics (FSELX), $140 million Victory RS Science & Technology (RSIFX), $1.5 billion Fidelity Advisor Technology (FADTX) and $680 million Columbia Seligman Global Technology (SCGTX).Their post-Brexit gains ranged from 14.70% for Global Technology to 18.77% for Select Electronics. Which stocks were some of their big drivers?Applied Materials (AMAT), a recent top holding of Select Electronics, is up 34% off its post-Brexit closing low. It's up 60% so far this year.The company supplies fabrication equipment to semiconductor, LCD and solar PV cell manufacturers.Earnings per share growth is speeding up. It went from -4% three quarters ago to 17% and 52% in the past two frames.And the stock has a 99 Composite Rating from IBD.The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Price Strength Ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a high Comp Rating. You should look for stocks whose rating is 95 or higher, which means that they've outperformed 95% of all other stocks in terms of their Composite Rating.IBD'S TAKE: You can see what makes Applied Materials the No. 1 stock in the electronics-semiconductor equipment industry group with IBD's Stock Checkup.Victory RS Science & Technology was among the funds that held Facebook (FB) as of its latest disclosure. In fact, 3,328 funds of all stripes held the social media giant as of June 30. That was up from 2,950 as of Sept. 30, 2015.Facebook is up 16% off its post-Brexit closing low. EPS grew 16%, 33%, 46%, 83% and 94% the past five quarters.It has a 99 Comp Rating.IBD's TAKE: Is Facebook perfect? Colleague Paul Whitfield takes the mystery out of the popular stock's many ups and downs in this IBD report.Fidelity Select Brokerage & Investment Management (FSLBX) was the top financial services stock since Brexit. It gained 13.47%.Cohen & Steers (CNS) is a top-20 holding. The asset manager specializes in high-income securities, focusing on U.S. REITs, global real estate, preferred securities and large-cap value stocks.In a yield-starved world, that makes Cohen & Steers mutual funds and other investment vehicles popular. Shares are up 8% since the Brexit closing bottom. They've drifted lower since mid-July, but have round technical support at their 50-day moving average line. The stock is up 37% so far this year.Cohen & Steers, which has IBD's 81 Comp Rating, finally returned to positive EPS growth in Q2 with a 26% increase. That followed four quarters of EPS declines.The $604 million Fidelity Advisor Industrials (FCLAX) was one of the top industrials sector funds.Among its top holdings was Danaher (DHR), which is up 11% since Brexit. It's up 16% so far this year.The company makes water treatment and vapor recovery systems. EPS grew 13%, 19% and 17% the past three quarters.Danaher is the No. 2 stock in IBD's electronics-scientific measuring industry group. But the group is now ranked 74 out of 197. Its ranking is down from the 34th position it held eight weeks ago.It has a solid 95 Comp Rating.The maker of instruments last month completed the spinoff of its industrial products businesses. That company is now called Fortive (FTV). That left Danaher with environmental and health care instrumentation.Jeff James, manager of $314 million Driehaus Micro Cap Growth (DMCRX), which is a U.S. diversified stock mutual fund, says the post-Brexit rally occurred amid an improvement in U.S. macroeconomic data after a soft patch earlier in the year. The outlook for corporate earnings was also improving, and a growing number of investors felt earnings were likely to be stronger in the second half of the year.James' own outlook is fueled in part by the fact that much of the post-Brexit gains were in smaller stocks. And smaller stocks tend to be less followed by institutional investors and Wall Street analysts. That makes it relatively easier to find underappreciated stocks among small caps, especially micro caps, says micro-cap manager James.RELATED:Stock Outlook Shines For Managers of Top Post-Brexit Mutual FundsTop Stock Holdings Of Hottest Growth Mutual Funds Since BrexitTop Stocks Held By The Hottest Mutual Funds Since BrexitInvestors Jump On Buy Opportunities Opened By Brexit

21,DHR,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's health care plan, released over the weekend, could have a positive impact for some companies in the medical hardware and development market, says Evercore ISI.Analyst Ross Muken wrote in a research report that Clinton's plan to encourage research and development spending should give a boost to providers of life science tools and services used in pharmaceutical development.""The added focus on generics and biosimilars can add an additional leg of growth to the pharma end market, largely continuing to benefit chromatography (Agilent (A), Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO)), Waters (WAT)) and separations players (Pall/Danaher (DHR)),"" Muken wrote. ""The one potential offset would be if the increased scrutiny on drug pricing led to fewer total dollars spend on R&D (we view that as unlikely).""All the above stocks are currently highly rated by IBD metrics -- especially Danaher, which hold a highest-possible Composite Rating of 99 and is trading at all-time highs. Danaher stock closed down 1% at 80.08 on the stock market today, after touching a record high of 81.28 on Friday.Agilent shares fell 0.2%, Thermo Fisher also lost 0.2% and Waters eased 0.5%.Clinton also wants to clear out the backlog of generic drug applications in the FDA and shorten the seven-year exclusivity period granted to biosimilar drugs. Muken says this should accelerate production by companies making these drugs and drive business for contract research organizations (CROs).""Additionally, the plan's intention to hold drug companies accountable and require value-based studies to justify the high drug prices could accelerate pharma's adoption of real-world data services,"" he said. ""This adoption could provide CROs another avenue of growth outside the traditional clinical trial outsourcing and is one of the reasons highlighted by Quintiles' (Q) management for the Quintiles/IMS Health (IMS) merger.""Parexel (PRXL) has also named real-world data services as a growth driver, Muken noted.Quintiles stock, with a middling CR of 58, fell 0.8% Monday. Parexel, which holds an excellent IBD EPS Rank of 97, dipped less than 0.1%.The outlook is more mixed for clinical devices and systems. On the one hand, if the plan succeeds in expanding the number of covered lives it will help boost demand for things like orthopedic and cardiovascular implants, and the focus on women's health could be positive for Hologic (HOLX), Muken wrote. On the other hand, it could increase the pricing pressure that's already been dogging the industry.""Players like Medtronic (MDT) who are already shifting to a value-based business model are best positioned for the next leg of evolution in the health care space,"" Muken wrote.Medtronic stock, with a strong CR of 90, hit a new intraday high of 88.91 Monday before closing at 88.51. Hologic stock, which has been consolidating as the company goes through a financial turnaround, fell 0.9% to 35.61.

He noted that in addition to lifting its organic-growth guidance for this year to 4.5%, the company had offered a glimpse into next year.""Management offered an initial view of fiscal 2017, projecting 4.5% organic revenue growth, and reiterated its commitment to target 22% operating margins,"" Leonard wrote.

27,DHR,"Through eight months and a double-dip market correction, one of the hardest-hit industries has been medicine. The presidential election debate over high drug prices and health care policy in general has given investors the jitters, and soft guidance in the most recent round of earnings reports didn't help matters. A notable exception has been stocks involved in dentistry. Not many of them…

A number of high profile 'tech' names reported earnings and the results were 'less than stellar' - not horrible, but just a bit disappointing......Commodities continued to weaken.........The chatter was all doom and gloom, THIS was going to be the catalyst for the market to correct. OMG! What would this all say about China? It's as if the whole world is dependent upon this one country.....It's the herd mentality playing out.....

31,DHR,"Apple (AAPL) - reported another great quarter - yet somehow so many seemed to find something wrong with the report or the $48 billion they earned or the 47 million units they sold or the $49 billion they are expected to earn in the current quarter..whatever.....That is what traders do - they react and pounce.....Investors do not...they do the analysis, they strategize and they lay out the plan - then they take advantage of the opportunity created by the short-term disruption....... and take advantage is what they did....buyers yesterday will be patting themselves on the back today as Apple begins the climb back. Look for it to struggle a bit at $127.80 - but after that - it's off to the races yet again......Just sayin.....

32,DHR,"Then we get the likes of some high profile market strategists - (Dennis Gartman) seeing 'the makings of a protracted bear market' - as he, like so many others, jumps on the commodity breakdown bandwagon......Gold, Copper, Oil, Wheat, Soybeans, all collapsing. Is it because of the strong dollar or because of weakening global demand? Are those concepts mutually exclusive? No.....they go hand in hand..... Hey look! Commodities and the Dollar have an inverse relationship....when one goes up the other goes down - commodities are priced in dollars, foreign buyers will use dollars to buy commodities, so when the value of the dollar rises they have LESS buying power - putting pressure on demand, conversely when the dollar weakens - then they have more buying power which should naturally produce more demand....so before we all go and make ourselves crazy that there is a global slowdown and the end of the world is coming (again) - consider the natural inverse relationship between the dollar commodities. And by the way - weaker oil and food prices NEVER hurt anybody....
"
33,DHR,"Add in the expectation that the Fed is about to raise rates - that will only cause the dollar to get stronger - which will put more pressure on commodities.....so what's the issue? If you believe this relationship then why would you be a buyer in line right now? You wouldn't - but at a discount you might....and if you are a seller you get more anxious as the buyers pull back.....and there it goes - that vicious circle.........But at some point investors realize that the global economy is doing just fine - and the action is not because of a global slowdown.....and then the markets re-adjust.....

46,DHR,"Best Mutual Funds 2015: May Performance Report
"
47,DHR,"Corporate takeovers were the theme for May, boosting mutual funds holding these stocks and testifying to resilience in the U.S. economy, even as mixed economic data trickled in.
"
48,DHR,"The parade of pairings includedCharter (CHTR) and Time Warner (TWC), Avago (AVGO) and Broadcom (BRCM), Ascena (ASNA) and Ann (ANN), CVS (CVS) and Omnicare (OCR), Verizon (VZ) and AOL (AOL), and Danaher (DHR) and Pall (PLL).
"
49,DHR,"""M&A activity continues to support the U.S. stock market,"" Russ Koesterich, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist, wrote May 26. The deals allow companies to expand into new markets, as well as gain efficiencies and earnings leverage.
"
50,DHR,"And they came despite — or perhaps because of — sluggish manufacturing activity in May and an economy that shrank in the first quarter. In fact, weak data paradoxically boosted stocks because it ""alleviated concerns over an aggressive Federal Reserve rate-hiking regime,"" Koesterich added.
"
51,DHR,"U.S. diversified equity funds rose 1.3% on average in May, according to Lipper Inc. General domestic taxable bond funds fell 0.42%.
"
52,DHR,"Growth funds across the market-cap spectrum continued to notch the biggest gains. Small-cap growth funds beat last month, advancing 2.8% on average. That took their year-to-date gains to 6.2%. Midcap growth funds rallied 2% and 6.8% in the same periods.
"
53,DHR,"Value funds are catching up, posting tidy gains in May but lagging year to date.
"
54,DHR,"Sector-focused mutual funds holding health and biotech stocks proved stellar again. They trumped every other domestic fund category, soaring 7.5% in May and 16.2% in 2015 as of month-end.
"
55,DHR,"Strong Health Care Earnings
"
56,DHR,"Health care companies showed strong first-quarter earnings growth — 21.4% overall, topping all 10 S&P sectors. Stocks such as IBD Sector Leaders Actavis (ACT) and Illumina (ILMN) are profiting from robust demand for innovative drugs and testing equipment, as well as acquisitions of smaller companies to streamline or diversify operations.
"
57,DHR,"As interest rates stay lower for longer, mutual fund investors are seeking out income-producing equities. Utility and telecom funds eked out 0.2% and 0.5% gains last month. Year to date, they're laggards.
"
58,DHR,"Koesterich advises income investors to focus on dividend growth funds. ""Many sectors offering high yields, such as utilities, are expensive and the most vulnerable to a rise in rates,"" he said. ""Instead, yield-hungry investors should look for technology, financials, health care and select energy companies offering rising dividends.""
"
59,DHR,"The price of gold ended May roughly 1% higher at 1191.40. But a stronger dollar weighed upon bullion as the month wore on. Mutual funds investing in precious metal commodities managed to turn in a 1% gain on average over the course of last month. Virtually every other commodity fund — from ag-based to energy-focused — saw losses.
"
60,DHR,"Precious metal equities funds — such as those holding mining stocks — gave up 1.6% in May. They're more influenced by operational conditions, not just the underlying metal's price.
"
61,DHR,"Modest Gains Abroad
"
62,DHR,"In a reversal from the previous month, investors who turned to foreign markets for successful investing pegged slight declines.
"
63,DHR,"Still, several international regions managed to beat the ""sell in May"" naysayers, including rallying India, Japan and Europe. But China stock mutual funds fell 0.2% vs. their 14.2% outsize gains in April.
"
64,DHR,"Year to date, China region funds still lead their international peers with a 21.6% surge. But they were hurt in May by stock market news of shrinking factory activity and weak export growth.
"
65,DHR,"Overall, world equity funds dropped 0.5% in May vs. their 4.3% gain the previous month.
"
66,DHR,"""International markets have done pretty well year to date,"" said Matthew Dobbs, head of global small companies at Schroder Investment Management, ""so it's not entirely surprising to see a bit of a reversion back.""
"
67,DHR,"Dobbs manages part of the $2.8 billion Vanguard International Explorer Fund , which rose 0.9% in May and is up 12% in 2015. It invests 23.3% of assets in Japan, its biggest single-country allocation.
"
68,DHR,"Japanese mutual funds rose 1.7% in May. They're up 16.5% this year.
"
69,DHR,"Large caps in Japan powered that performance, said Dobbs. The falling yen gave these companies, which tend to have sizable exposure to foreign earnings, a boost.
"
70,DHR,"VINEX also assigns 58.4% of assets to continental Europe and the U.K. European funds rallied 0.5% last month. Year to date, they're up 9.5%. Massive stimulus measures have kick-started markets there.

122,DHR,"Just how bad will the U.S.' slap-fight over trade, which escalated with China on Friday, be for S&P 500 earnings and stocks? Just how much can the U.S. economy, which delivered solid June jobs growth on Friday, still grow after a nine-year expansion?Analysts expect another blowout quarter in Q2 — 20.7% earnings-per-share growth for S&P 500 index components and an 8.1% jump in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters. Wall Street is betting on continued scorching results for the rest of the year. But they may not be as scorching if President Donald Trump's trade wars with China, Canada, Mexico, Europe and others become more heated. The quiet earnings growth next year might be even more muted.Analysts say the effects of a trade war have yet to be priced into financial forecasts.""I think the first tangible impact should start showing up in estimate revisions as these earnings results come out,"" said Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks.In other words, the second-quarter earnings season could offer some higher drama than CEOs' usual blanched remarks about ""headwinds"" and ""tailwinds."" Investors, even more than usual, will focus on earnings guidance and post-earnings call commentary to get some answers as to how the tariffs will affect profit, sales, prices, corporate strategy and shareholder returns.Higher costs for parts and supplies that U.S. companies bring in from overseas could mean higher costs for customers. Businesses could rethink or even uproot complex global supply chains. Higher prices on U.S.-made goods sold overseas could crimp international demand. Companies could cut or delay major investments.S&P 500 index companies, filled with hundreds of U.S. multinationals and exporters, are more exposed to tariffs and global demand than the U.S. economy itself.As for the second-quarter itself, the gains from S&P 500 companies come courtesy of President Trump's tax cuts and an enduring U.S. economy.Rebounding oil prices will lift the energy sector's Q2 earnings by around 141.5%, with sales up some 20%, according to Thomson. S&P 500 energy stocks, which include Dow Jones giants Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) as well as ConocoPhillips (COP), Valero (VLO), Marathon Oil (MRO), Schlumberger (SLB) and many others, have generally been strong performers.Analysts expect the S&P 500 financials to clock a 22% gain in earnings on a 4.5% bump in revenue, as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and other banks enjoy lower taxes and deregulation. Thomson forecasts semiconductors and internet software and services to lead the S&P 500 tech components toward 25.5% earnings growth. Tech revenue is seen jumping 12%. Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB) are all slated to deliver solid-to-stellar growth.As estimates stand now, Thomson Reuters is forecasting the 20%-plus earnings growth to reach into the third and fourth quarters.""The last time we had earnings growth in Q3 and Q4 like this was in 2010,"" Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters, said in an email.However, looking past 2018, analysts appear to have a harder time justifying bullish expectations for S&P 500 companies.""You look at the numbers going forward, you really don't start to see a significant drop in growth until you get into 2019, when again, you'll be back to apples-to-apples on the tax rates,"" said John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet.But tougher comparisons aren't a massive concern right now, analysts say. And next year's growth still looks solid. Dhillon said that for 2019 investors can expect a 9.7% earnings growth rate, ""which is still higher than the 20-year average of 7.3%.""Wall Street also worries that the U.S. economy has fewer tools at its disposal to keep its marathon run going. The dollar is stronger. The yield curve is flatter due partly to the Federal Reserve's decisions to lift short-term interest rates.The narrowing yield curve, the gap between rates on short-term and long-term government debt, looms large for banks in particular. The flatter curve, also seen as a precursor to an economic downturn, has dragged bank stocks lower in recent months.Banks also lend money to borrowers based on long-term rates, but borrow from depositors according to short-term rates. The narrower the difference between the two, the narrower the banks' net interest margins. JPMorgan, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) report second-quarter earnings on Friday.The three banking giants, which all announced hefty shareholder-return packages last month, are expected to deliver solid EPS growth. But JPMorgan stock, along with that of Citigroup, Wells Fargo and others, is near 2018 lows.When the Fed raises rates that affects the money flowing into global, emerging markets as well.""If U.S. interest rates are going up,"" Mian said, ""and an investor or a class of investors is scouring world markets for yield and returns, and if the yield and return is going up in a developed market like the U.S., then there's no reason to take the extra risk of going to Argentina or Turkey when you can get it in the U.S.""The U.S. on Friday lobbed tariffs at $34 billion worth of Chinese products — more than 800 types of products total. That's the first part of a $50 billion response for what Trump says are China's trade abuses against the U.S.The U.S. tariffs target aircraft parts, industrial parts and equipment, some vehicles and other machinery. The duties from the U.S. targeted products related to China's tech-focused ""Made in China 2025"" plan. Trump has said that initiative would ""hurt economic growth for the United States and many other countries.""""The United States can no longer tolerate losing our technology and intellectual property through unfair economic practices,"" Trump said in a statement last month.China on Friday responded with penalties of its own on U.S. products, including automakers and agriculture. China aimed those tariffs squarely at Trump's base.Trump has threatened to levy another $200 billion in tariffs on China, and even more. Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to impose a global import tariff on autos. That follows duties on steel and aluminum that have spurred Europe, Canada and Mexico to retaliate.Further trade discord could force companies to rethink their supply chains. Those adjustments could undo corporate America's efforts over the past two decades to more efficiently manage their inventories. Such practices over that time firmed up businesses' balance sheets.The brinkmanship has swept up some of the most iconic American businesses along the way. General Motors (GM) said as much last week, warning that more tariffs would lead to ""reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic American company.""Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would offer more detail, on its earnings call this month, about its plans to move some production out of the U.S. to skirt tariffs from the EU. Brown-Forman (BFB) is raising the price of Jack Daniel's in parts of Europe because of the tariffs imposed by the EU.No one knows how the Trump trade wars, and their impact on S&P 500 companies, will play out.""We expect company-specific risks from tariffs and China-trade exposures to be a central discussion topic during 2Q18 earnings calls,"" RBC analyst Deane Dray, who covers industrials vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, wrote in a note last month. ""But no one has a crystal ball on how the tariff situation will ultimately play out, especially the potential knock-on effects.""He said companies like 3M (MMM) and Danaher (DHR) looked best equipped among industrials to handle the trade disputes.The trade war also threatens chipmakers like Micron (MU). A Chinese court blocked sales of some of its chips in the country, a move seen as pushback from the nation against Trump's trade salvos. China has held up approving the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Boeing (BA) isn't subject to China tariffs, but Beijing could favor Airbus (EADSY) jets in a protracted U.S.-China trade war. The aerospace company in April downplayed worries over a trade war.Baird analyst Benjamin Hartford covers transportation and logistics companies like UPS (UPS), FedEx (FDX) and Expeditors International (EXPD). Hartford wrote in a research note last month that he'd seen no ""material evidence (yet) of freight volume weakness amid rising global trade tensions.""Some analysts, like Tigress' Ivan Feinseth, expressed optimism that strength in corporate earnings would offset any trade damage. Others wonder how much a trade war will hurt corporate travel for the likes of global carriers like American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), and cargo demand broadly. Delta Air earnings are due Thursday.""We still expect demand to grow, but those expectations are dampened with each new tariff introduced,"" Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said of air cargo demand in a statement this week.

130,DHR,"The new IBD Tech Leaders Index looks at companies in the technology field that are highly rated using IBD’s proprietary ratings. With the current market condition being Uptrend Under Pressure, these names should be approached with higher caution, especially since they will be tied more to the performance of the Nasdaq composite.As of the April 29 list, the electronics sector stands out with a dominant representation by two industry groups making up more than 25% of the list: the scientific measurement electronics group, at No. 10 of IBD's 197 industry groups, and the electronics parts manufacturers, at No. 23.Many of the stocks in the sector serve in support roles, so part of your analysis should include the areas of exposure for the companies. Are they focused on life sciences with exposure to the biotech industry? Biotechs had a great run in 2014, but the group has fallen considerably, with big winners like Celgene (CELG) and Gilead (GILD) topping in the summer of 2015.A company like Danaher (DHR) has exposure to multiple industries, with segments that serve life sciences and diagnostics vs. its segments focused on industrial technologies and petroleum businesses. Danaher will make the analysis a little easier when they complete a tax-free spinoff in the third quarter of 2016. The company retaining the Danaher name will keep the life science exposure and the new spinoff, named Fortive, will take the industrial side.What about the exposure to foreign markets? Bruker (BRKR) not only has strong links to the life sciences and pharmaceutical research but also, according to the company website, 80% of its revenue comes from outside the U.S. As the first-quarter earnings season has unfolded, companies have often pointed to currency headwinds created by a strong dollar as being the culprit behind soft earnings.

Value funds averaged a 5.71% annual advance in the same period, which ended going into Monday.Value funds started the decade strong and got a tailwind from the financial crisis market meltdown from late 2007 through early 2009. A large number of investors sought safety in defensive stocks and sectors, many of which are value-oriented.Financials, a heavily value-oriented sector, rallied in 2012 and 2013.Value and growth funds split 2014, but 2015 was dominated by growth stocks and funds.Value funds' outperformance in the first quarter of 2016 was not enough to cost growth funds' the decade's lead.If you had invested $10,000 in the average growth fund on March 31, 2006, by 10 years later it would have grown into $18,833. That is less than $1,000 more than it would have ballooned into in the average value fund.Over that decade, $1.8 billion Alger Spectra Fund (SPECX) was one of the top-performing growth portfolios among those with $100 million or more in assets.The fund notched an 11.05% average annual gain.

134,DHR,"Special Report: Income Investing 2016Dividends can yield a steady stream of income for investors. Leading fund managers have used game plans focused on buying select dividend-paying stocks to boost total returns and drive outperformance.T. Rowe Price Dividend Growth Fund and Columbia Dividend Income Fund have been among the top mutual funds for dividend investors over the last decade. Here are some insights from the managers who have executed successful dividend investment strategies.T. Rowe Dividend GrowthTom Huber has beaten large blend funds tracked by Morningstar by an annual average of 136 basis points over the last 10 years as manager of the T. Rowe Price Dividend Growth Fund.He points out that dividends can prove to be a substantial portion of investors' total returns. ""Over time, dividends have made up 40% to 50% of total returns,"" Huber said. ""It gets lost a little bit when markets are strong and compounding at double-digit rates, but if you look back over history, dividends have been an important source of returns for investors.""For income investors, Huber emphasizes the importance of buying stocks of companies that have been able to increase their dividends over time. ""A track record of dividend growth is a good sign of a quality business, financial health and durability,"" he said. ""In addition to offering investors a growing stream of income, dividend-paying stocks also tend to be less volatile and offer some downside protection.""Dividend Growth is designed to reward patient investors. ""There are market environments where our strategy does better and environments when it is going to lag,"" Huber said. ""In big up markets, dividend stocks tend to be a bit out of favor, but when growth moderates and the market corrects, they tend to hold up better.""Dividend Growth sticks with many of its bets for the long haul. ""We have a relatively low turnover,"" Huber said of the mutual fund's 19% turnover ratio. ""We want to own these companies over time and benefit from the compounding effect of earnings, cash flow and dividend growth.""In comparing Dividend Growth to a generic growth fund, Huber points out the low turnover can be advantageous for tax purposes. ""The percentage distribution between dividends and capital gains will likely vary between the two (funds), but tax rates on the two are similar,"" he said. ""Our fund has a turnover rate that runs between 10% and 30%, which is much lower than peers and helps limit taxable events.""The fund's top holding, Danaher (DHR), has been a mainstay in the Dividend Growth portfolio for much of Huber's tenure. ""It yields less than a percent but does raise its dividend nicely every year,"" he said. ""It's a diversified industrial company of better-than-average businesses, characterized by higher-than-average margins and free cash flow conversion.""Pfizer (PFE) is Huber's No. 2 holding. ""The company has been growing its dividend at about a 10% rate over the last five years,"" he said. ""Pfizer has an underappreciated pipeline. It's not an expensive stock and has a yield over 3%.""Huber sees General Electric (GE) shareholders benefiting from the company divesting much of its financial services unit. ""You end up with an industrial earnings stream which is much less volatile than it had been previously,"" he said of the fund's No. 3 holding. ""It will be a higher-quality, more durable mix of businesses, and in the meantime you collect a dividend yield of 3%.""Columbia Dividend IncomeColumbia Dividend Income Fund is co-managed by Scott Davis, Michael Barclay and Peter Santoro. It has topped large value funds tracked by Morningstar by an average of 186 basis points for the past 10 years.To achieve this outperformance, the trio thoroughly assesses the long-term business prospects of a dividend-paying company before buying. ""When we look at stocks, we do not look at the dividend first,"" Davis said. ""We look at a company's corporate structure and its ability to generate cash from operations. To sustain a dividend, you need to have a healthy company that can afford to pay it.""Davis emphasizes that the fund's dividend investment strategy does not get caught up in chasing yield. ""It's not just about focusing on the highest-yielding stocks,"" Davis said. ""It really has to do with the sustainability of a dividend and a company's ability to grow the dividend.""Barclay notes that the fund's portfolio provides ample downside protection. ""One of the hallmarks of our product is that it keeps investors from getting hit hard when the stock market goes down,"" he said. ""By doing that, clients stay engaged and are still in the fund when the market turns around and goes back up.""Cash Flow GeneratorsAs of Sept. 30, Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) were the top two holdings. ""Not only do Microsoft and Apple have superior free cash flow generation, but they are actually growing,"" Barclay said. ""When you can find a company that is growing its top line and producing strong free cash flow because of strong operating margins, that's a formula for good growth and sustainability of the dividend.""The fund's top consumer cyclical holding is Home Depot (HD). ""We continue to see home improvement projects gaining consumer wallet share,"" Santoro said. ""Home Depot has done a great job of anticipating consumer needs. They have also been good stewards of capital and have been raising cash flow expectations.""The portfolio has held a position in Exxon Mobil (XOM) since 2003. ""Exxon has probably the best balance sheet in the whole industry,"" Santoro said. ""It pays a dividend of almost 4% and is incredibly secure.""

216,DHR,"On Jun 20, we issued an updated research report on premium diversified operations company — Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report). The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and holds a VGM Score  of D.Rising cost of sales remains a major cause of concern for Danaher. The company’s cost of sales flared up 13.3% and 7.8%, year over year, in 2016 and 2017, respectively.  Notably, the same rose 9.6% in first-quarter 2018. Higher oil prices continue to escalate the company’s utilities and freight expenses. We fear that escalating costs, if unchecked, will weigh over Danaher’s profitability in the upcoming quarters.Moreover, realignment of certain manufacturer and distributor relationships has given rise to inventory modifications in Danaher’s Dental segment’s distribution channel. This has been hurting this segment’s top line for the past few quarters. The segment’s organic revenues dipped 3% year over year in the first quarter. Danaher stated that apart from the ongoing realignment moves, lackluster traditional consumables and equipment business performance also dampened the segment’s revenues in the quarter. These challenges might continue to dent the Dental segment’s results in the upcoming quarters.Over the past month, Danaher’s shares have lost nearly 1% compared with the 3% loss recorded by the industry, and 1.4% growth yielded by the benchmark S&P 500 index.Danaher’s business is overseen by a number of U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities, which ensure that the company complies with multiple regulations related to import laws, export control and economic sanctions laws, which restrict its scope. Moreover, investigation and audit for compliance with requirements of government contracts hamper the company’s growth. Also, any change in governmental regulations might reduce demand for the company’s products or services and escalate its expenses.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the industry are listed below:Raven Industries, Inc.

218,DHR,"General Electric's (GE  -  Free Report) Healthcare business is set to introduce interactive, customizable training options for HTM professionals at AAMI 2018. Notably, the options enabled by the Virtual Reality (VR) technology will facilitate training of the next generation HTM professionals, safely and efficiently.Every year, the company’s Healthcare business offers training services to over 8,000 HTM professionals. We believe the VR technology will eliminate the need to travel to a GE training facility, which in turn, is likely to save costs. This will allow the conduction of training onsite at a provider’s facility. Recently, the technology has also been adopted in other industries such as hospitality, retail as well as entertainment. Our TakeGeneral Electric is poised for long-term growth with improved performances from the emerging markets like India and China. In this regard, the company’s increased investments in key industrial businesses through restructuring, state-of-the-art technology, and R&D initiatives seem to bode well. Moreover, its three core segments — power, aviation and healthcare equipment — require advanced hi-tech products with a high degree of reliability. These products often generate higher margins and are likely to drive growth in the long run.In the past three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 1.8%, outperforming the industry’s decline of 3.9%.Furthermore, with a strong international presence, a significant portion of the company’s total revenues are stemmed from emerging markets. In fact, General Electric has been selling big-ticket items such as locomotives and power turbines to India and China. Moving ahead, it expects to benefit from these regions, given their faster economic growth.This apart, the company generates solid free cash flow, which allows management to invest in product innovations, acquisitions and business development. Also, stringent cost-cutting measures are likely to improve profitability.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Crane Company (CR  -  Free Report), Danaher Corp.

Notably, this 11th low rate initial production (LRIP) contract will deal with 135 engines, apart from covering areas like program management, production support, engineering support, spare modules as well as spare parts.Also, the contract is likely to reduce the unit recurring flyaway (URF) price for the 110 LRIP Lot 11 conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) and carrier variant (CV) propulsion systems by 0.34% from the earlier negotiated LRIP Lot 10 URF. Furthermore, the URF price for the 25 LRIP Lot 11 short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) propulsion systems is expected to be reduced by 3.39% compared with the earlier negotiated LRIP Lot 10 URF.Our TakeUnited Technologies has a strong aftermarket business. In fact, its aftermarket services business is relatively stable compared to new product delivery. This, in turn, helps offset the negative impact of downturns in the new products market.

On the other side of the equation, producers are grappling with competitive pressures, supply chain complexities and short production cycles. This creates the ideal environment for technologies that enable producers to quickly identify, foresee and act on shifting consumer and market demands.Our TakeGE is trying to reshape and revamp overall structure through a number of specific and tactical steps, centred on simplifying current business model. A recent move was the $11-billion merger of its railroad business with Wabtec Corp., a passenger rail transport company.In order to focus more on core business activities, the company has exited from the financial business and increased investments in key industrial businesses through restructuring, state-of-the-art technology and R&D initiatives. Currently, it has three core segments — power, aviation and healthcare equipment — which require advanced hi-tech products along with high degree of reliability. These products generate higher margins and are likely to contribute to impressive long-term growth.GE’s shares have lost 21.3% in the past six months, wider than the industry’s decline of 9.5%. Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderGeneral Electric carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the same space include Raven Industries, Inc (RAVN  -  Free Report), Federal Signal Corp.

Notably, this project marks the company’s 32nd award for Oleflex technology in China. This apart, the company unveiled a connected portable gas detector, Honeywell BW Ultra, to ensure the safety of its workers in confined spaces. The new detector, which features Honeywell TouchConnect technology, is capable of monitoring up to five different gases at the same time that includes volatile organic compounds. Leveraging Bluetooth connectivity, the Honeywell BW Ultra enables safety managers to monitor valuable data as well.Our TakeHoneywell is well-positioned to gain from long-term expansion in the markets like aerospace, facility automation and automotive turbochargers owing to its strong market share and product line-up. Also, the company’s continuous focus on investment in innovative technologies is likely to help Honeywell maintain its leadership position. The company is building a robust pipeline of new products too. Further, the demand for Honeywell's construction, automobiles and airplanes products are expected to grow backed by expansion of emerging markets. In the past three months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have returned 0.6% against the industry’s decline of 3.3%.Honeywell’s diversified business portfolio also helps it to earn consistent above-average returns and mitigate operating risks. Moreover, the company’s balanced mix of long- and short-cycle businesses along with decent organic growth in new products and expansion in high-growth regions bode well on a long-term perspective. With a flexible yet disciplined focus on cost and productivity, Honeywell remains focused on increasing its presence in high-growth regions.However, the company is susceptible to material price inflation, which in turn, affects profitability. Also, the company remains highly dependent on its supply chain to scale up production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Danaher Corp.

Following the name change,Jefferies Financial Group will use the ticker “JEF” for trading purposes on the New York Stock Exchange.Notably, Leucadia renamed itself as part of its transformation from a holding company with disparate assets to a financial services company. The company also declared a cash dividend of 10 cents per share, payable on Jun 29, 2018, to its shareholders as of record Jun 18, 2018.Our TakeLeucadiahas to continually maintain and upgrade its computer systems as well as networks to prevent any intrusion and data theft of confidential and sensitive client information. At the same time, the company has to employ risk monitoring techniques such as scenario analysis and stress tests, exposure concentrations, counterparty exposure, leverage, cash capital, and performance analysis for its financial services businesses. All these consume a significant amount of Leucadia’sresources and strain its profitability.Moreover, the company has a significant exposure to the European market. In the current scenario, when the economy in the region is highly unpredictable, particularly after the Brexit referendum, it becomes difficult for Leucadiato increase revenues and reduce costs. Brexit might further result in higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade between the U.K. and the European Union, thus lowering the productivity of the company.

The remaining 49.9% of stake of the combined company will be retained by Wabtec shareholders. Notably, the deal is likely to close in early 2019.The latest move will combine GE Transportation’s digital solutions for railroad, marine, drilling, wind and mining industries with Wabtec’s extensive range electronic solutions.

This will help to improve the safety, efficiency and productivity of their offerings.Notably, the combined company will have a large global installed base, with more than 23,000 locomotives that would create significant opportunities for aftermarket services growth.Our TakeGeneral Electric is well positioned for long-term growth backed by improved performances from emerging markets like India and China. In order to focus more on its core business activities, the company has exited from the financial business and increased its investments in key industrial businesses through restructuring, state-of-the-art technology, and R&D initiatives.

225,DHR,"United Technologies Corporation’s (UTX  -  Free Report) operating segment — Climate, Controls & Security — recently entered into a definitive agreement with The Middleby Corporation (MIDD  -  Free Report). Per the deal, this segment will sell Taylor Company to Middleby — a manufacturer of commercial foodservice equipment. This $1 billion deal is expected to close early in the third quarter of 2018.Our TakeUnited Technologies serves various end-markets such as aerospace, defense and commercial construction. This business mix and diversification allows the company to generate profit even during tough economic times by delivering consistent earnings and dividend growth. Also, the company’s continuous investment in innovative products, through higher engineering expenditures, secures orders that might drive the top line in future.In the past six months, shares of United Technologies have gained 7.2% against the industry’s decline of 6.2%.  Moreover, the company’s strong aftermarket services business remains relatively stable compared to new product delivery. This, in turn, helps United Technologies to offset the impact of downturns in the new products market. For instance, in first-quarter 2018, its aftermarket business witnessed robust sales across the segments with commercial and military up 18% and 13%, respectively.Meanwhile, the company also revamped its aerospace unit, including an overhaul of its organizational structure. Per United Technologies, its streamlined organizational set-up might enable the company to better serve its customers.However, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company relies on suppliers, including third-party contract manufacturing and commodity markets, to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems.

Shares have added about 3.9% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback?

Notably, adjusted earnings increased 13% on a year-over-year basis.The improvement in the company’s bottom line can largely be attributed to Danaher Business System (“DBS”) that focuses on three critical areas -- quality, delivery, and cost & innovation. Moreover, a decent top-line performance led to mid-teens adjusted earnings per share growth, strong margin expansion and cash flow during the quarter.Inside The HeadlinesThe company reported total sales of $4,528.2 million, reflecting an increase of 9.6% year over year. Moreover, the sales figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,460 million. Also, core businesses grew 3% year over year, partially offset by adverse effect of currency translation.Life Sciences revenues recorded an increase of 5.1% year over year to $1,393 million. Operating margin for the quarter increased 230 basis points (bps) to 17.7%. Impressive growth in operating margin came on the back of increased sales volumes. Revenues at the Diagnostics segment increased 19.5% year over year to $1,449 million. Also, operating margin at the segment increased 80 bps year over year to 16.8%.Revenues at Dental were up 2.7% year over year to $694 million. However, operating margin decreased 30 bps to 14.7%.

Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate investors will probably be better served looking elsewhere.OutlookThe stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We are expecting an above average return from the stock in the next few months.

230,DHR,"3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, before the opening bell.The company has a decent earnings history, surpassing estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 3.2%. Last quarter, the company reported earnings of $2.10, delivering a beat of 3.5%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Consider3M enjoys diversified product portfolio. However, the company’s growth initiatives are largely dependent on timing and market acceptances of its product offerings that include 3M’s ability to frequently renew its pipeline of new offerings and bring those to market at acceptable price points. Also, the company has to manage commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward physical contracts.Moreover, the company’s global presence makes it susceptible to tremendous local competitive pressure, particularly in Brazil, China, India and Indonesia. In order to survive the stiff competitive environment, 3M has to locally develop, manufacture, hire and purchase. These, in turn, are likely to reduce its profitability to some extent due to continuous investments in value drivers that act as a hedge against stiff competition.Given 3M’s international presence, adverse foreign currency translations might affect its net investment in foreign subsidiaries and cause instability in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions moving ahead. These undermine the company’s long-term growth potential to some extent. Additionally, 3M is facing increased pension expenses of late. The related extra costs are likely to be a drag on the company’s bottom line in the impending quarter as well.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues from the Industrial segment (which constitutes a major portion of 3M’s total revenues) remains high at $2,883 million, reflecting growth of 6.4% year over year. Also, the company’s portfolio restructuring efforts by divesting assets bode well for its growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for 3M this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks ESP: 3M has an Earnings ESP of +0.27%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $2.51 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.50.

234,DHR,"General Electric Company’s (GE  -  Free Report) Power Services business revealed new capabilities which will augment the performance and reliability of other original equipment manufacturer (OEM) gas turbine fleets. The conglomerate also disclosed that it had secured more than $200 million in backlog for gas turbine cross-fleet orders.GE’s advanced capabilities and technology will provide gas plant operators greater flexibility, reliability and efficiency. It will also ensure longer maintenance intervals and superior overall performance. The gas turbine cross-fleet capabilities also include remote monitoring capabilities to boost reliability as well as availability and reduce operational risks and maintenance costs.These latest technological developments benefit from the company’s extensive experience as well as the extensive steam turbine, generator and HRSG other-OEM capabilities and expertise acquired from Alstom’s power business in November 2015.GE Power is the largest segment of the conglomerate in terms of corporate revenues. However, the unit has been a drag on earnings in the last few quarters, thanks to increasing global demand for renewable energy sources. Also, overcapacity, lower utilization and fewer outages are other factors that are dampening demand. Per Industry experts, the acquisition of Alstom’s assets further compounded the problems for General Electric, as it hiked operating costs and contracted margins.Nevertheless, in 2017, Flannery assured investors that energy, aviation and healthcare will continue to be the focal points of GE’s operations. It has been nearly five months since Flannery outlined his plan to divest more than $20 billion of assets.In April, GE inked an agreement to sell a trio of its health-care information technology businesses to private equity firm Veritas Capital for $1.05 billion.

235,DHR,"Pratt & Whitney, one of the operating segments of diversified conglomerate — United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) — recently announced that its PurePower Geared Turbofan engines will be used by Air China and Shenzhen Airlines. The engines will power 60 Airbus A320neo aircraft of the airline, widely known for their superior performance.The PurePower engine family has proven its mettle in the industry. It has a state-of-the-art gear system, which separates the engine fan from compressor and turbine, thereby facilitating an optimum operating speed for each of the modules. While the fan rotates slower, the low-pressure compressor and turbine operate at a high speed, increasing engine efficiency and delivering significantly lower fuel consumption, lesser noise and lower emissions along with reduced maintenance costs.Pratt & Whitney had earlier secured the joint Type Certification from the Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation Safety Agency for its PurePower Geared Turbofan engine in Airbus A321neo aircraft. Such coveted accreditations and continued product improvements have enabled United Technologies to outperform the industry with an average year-to-date return of 7.2% as against a decline of 6.6% for the latter.The PurePower Geared Turbofan engine has been able to meet the strict quality standards relating to burn, noise and emissions to receive the accreditation. The PurePower GTF engine has the ability to reduce engine fuel consumption by 16%, regulating emissions and noise footprint by 50% and 75%, respectively. The engine is reportedly being used by 80 different customers across the globe.The technologically superior products create a competitive advantage for Pratt & Whitney and ensure a steady stream of revenues. The company is among the world’s leading suppliers of aircraft engines to the commercial, military, business jet and general aviation markets. Its Global Services provide maintenance, repair and overhaul services, including the sale of spare parts and fleet management for large commercial engines.United Technologies presently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

236,DHR,"Shares of industrial goods manufacturer General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) continued to fall for the second consecutive day on massive dividend cut and radical business restructuring policies made public by CEO John Flannery. Its shares fell 5.9% to close at $17.90 yesterday to a nearly five-year low, after tanking 7.2% on Monday for its biggest one-day selloff since Apr 20, 2009.It appears that the proposed steps of Flannery have failed to arrest the negative investor perception. Under the current scenario, let's discuss whether it would be a wise move to dump the stock straightaway or buy it at a discounted price.Dividend Cut & Businesses TrimmedGE has been the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year, with a decline of 41.3% year to date as against a gain of 19.8% for the index. In order to boost its sagging shares, Flannery has decided to focus on just three core segments — power, aviation and health-care equipment — and gradually exit all other businesses.This puts on the chopping block its much-publicized acquisition of Baker Hughes along with its railroad and lighting businesses. Consequently, the company would retrench a sizable number of its employees and reduce its board of directors to 12 members from 18. GE further intends to have asset sales worth $20 billion to improve its liquidity.At the same time, the company halved its quarterly dividend to 12 cents per share — the first dividend cut since 2009 at the peak of the recession. For 2018, the dividend allocation will be $4.2 billion, down from more than 100% of free cash flow to 60-70% while the dividend yield will be trimmed from 4.7% to 2.3%. A healthy dividend yield was one of the strongest enticements for GE investors and the dramatic plunge in share prices are testament to the fact that shareholders have been very critical of the turnaround plan.Guidance LoweredFor 2017, the company has lowered its adjusted earnings guidance to $1.04-$1.12 per share, significantly down from earlier expectations of $1.60-$1.70. For 2018, GE expects adjusted earnings to be further down to $1.00-$1.07 per share and free cash flow at significantly reduced levels of $6 billion to $7 billion.The company intends to restructure employee bonuses by eliminating the three-year cash long-term performance awards by swapping it with a program that conforms to ""market norms."" Specifically, GE plans to adjust its compensation policies to include a higher equity mix target for its top 5,000 employees and cut costs to the tune of $3 billion.Bumpy Road AheadFlannery has termed 2018 as “a reset year” and expects the company to stage a turnaround to reward its shareholders with risk-adjusted returns. Critics, however, have widely raised concerns about the efficacy of such steps. Although the dividend cut was expected, the proposed exits from other businesses surprised the investor community, who argued how a much smaller and more focused GE could actually be beneficial with lower revenue-generating opportunities. Deane Dray, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, observed, “The company’s turnaround will now be more protracted than previously anticipated.”The drastic fall in share price has mostly strengthened this opinion. Although some optimists would like to view this scenario as glass being half full rather than half empty, investors should remain cautious and weigh their options for the future.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksGE presently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Danaher Corp. (DHR  -  Free Report), Federal Signal Corp. (FSS  -  Free Report) and Leucadia National Corp. , each carrying Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

238,DHR,"Diversified technology company, Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) recently inked a 15-year agreement with Dubai-based airline firm Emirates to offer maintenance and aftermarket components for its fleet. The agreement with the world’s largest operator of Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 aircraft aims to cut airline operating costs by reducing grounded aircraft time through round-the-clock support services.Over the years, Honeywell has developed a rich expertise in the areas of aircraft component exchange and repairs. The company intends to leverage this strength to provide comprehensive repair and maintenance services to lower cost of ownership and increase the lifespan of aircraft components. This, in turn, will effectively reduce departure delays and cancellations and boost Emirates’ commitment to on-time arrivals.The airline industry is fiercely competitive and each player in the market strives to incorporate all possible options to reduce operating costs. In tune with this strategy, Royal Jordanian Airlines selected Honeywell's Connected Aircraft GoDirect Fuel Efficiency software to minimize fuels usage on its fleet of 24 aircraft. The software utilizes data analysis and various monitoring tools to identify various fuel-saving opportunities to make operations more cost-effective and conducive to green environment.  Fuel consumption usually accounts for 20-40% of an airline’s operating costs and even a single-digit percentage improvement can reportedly save millions for an airline company. With this initiative, Royal Jordanian joins an expanding list of global customers that are patrons to the software, including India's Jet Airways, Japan Airlines, Finnair and Turkish Airlines.On the back of such innovative portfolio of products and services, the company has outperformed the industry with an average year-to-date return of 25.8% as against a decline of 3.5% for the latter. Honeywell’s diversified business portfolio has the potential to earn consistent above-average returns and mitigate operating risks. The company’s diligent focus on working capital management, free cash flow generation and a conservative balance sheet remain key positives amid a challenging macroeconomic environment.In addition, the company’s balanced mix of long- and short-cycle businesses, along with a decent organic growth in new products and expansion in high-growth regions augur well on a long-term basis. With a flexible yet disciplined focus on cost and productivity, Honeywell remains focused on increasing its presence in high-growth regions. Additionally, the company is building a robust pipeline of new products.Honeywell currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Adjusted operating margin increased to 11.9% from 7.1% in the prior-year quarter due to strong volume and lower expenses.Net sales in the Commercial and Industrial System segment were $408 million, up 4.8% year over year driven by strength in North America, Asia, oil & gas and commercial HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) markets.

240,DHR,"First-quarter 2018 earnings growth is expected to be in double-digits on a year-over-year basis for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors. In all the sectors, the Conglomerates space is among the handful whose earnings are expected to contract year over year in the to-be-reported quarter.Ongoing tariff issues, which will likely impact major U.S. industrials, have clearly weighed on investors’ minds in recent times. On an average, the Conglomerates space has declined 10.8% year to date.Let’s discuss some economic factors and events which will have a bearing on these diversified companies in the near future.The Tariff ProposalThe proposal of tariffs on steel and aluminum, announced by the U.S. administration last month, has already left companies across multiple sectors apprehensive about higher input costs and contracted margins. The move has forced investors to consider increasing raw material prices and inflated manufacturing costs, which might make these industry players less competitive.If enacted, the tariffs will create uncertainties across the supply chain, which is likely to have further adverse impact on margins.ISM Manufacturing Reading for MarchThe ISM index for national factory activity in March came in at 59.3, comparatively lower than 60.8 recorded in February, which had marked the highest level in 14 years.Although a reading of above 50 suggests that the sector is expanding, tariffs proposed by the U.S. administration on steel and aluminum and against Chinese imported products in fields of aerospace, machinery, information and communication is likely to hurt business confidence domestically as well as internationally. Moreover, higher prices, coupled with trade disputes between the United States and China might hamper demand for U.S.-manufactured products globally and in turn can harm U.S. economic growth.Despite these formidable headwinds, there were a few companies in the Conglomerates space that defied broader negative trends and enjoyed investor optimism amid economic uncertainties. These companies also boast a strong earnings profile, which indicates operational strength. Investors interested in this sector might consider four such stocks, as discussed below.Four Solid PicksFederal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report): Federal Signal is a leader in environmental and safety solutions.

245,DHR,"Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.19 cents per share, delivering a positive surprise of 2.6%.We expect Danaher to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Danaher has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Danaher has an Earnings ESP of +2.04% as the Most Accurate estimate of 95 cents is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #2, which when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Reasons Behind Better-Than-Expected ResultsDanaher has successfully repositioned itself as a healthcare company by expanding its footprint in the healthcare and dental markets. These markets are expected to benefit from rise in the aging population and increased spending on healthcare and fitness. Also, prospects in pharma and clinical end-markets bode well for the company. Per Danaher, it is well-positioned in the biopharma business, which in turn is expected to prove conductive to its operating profit and bottom-line growth for the first quarter.Additionally, within the Danaher Business System (‘DBS’) framework, the company’s number of strategic initiatives with respect to idea generation, product development and others have been significantly boosting its key financials over the past few quarters. For instance, in fourth-quarter 2017, DBS contributed appreciably to the company’s impressive run in delivering year-over-year core revenue growth, earnings improvement and margin expansion.Meanwhile, the company’s recent acquisitions are acting as major profit churners. The buyouts  are anticipated to boost top-line growth in the quarter under review. This apart, Danaher expects core growth rate to accelerate moving ahead, in the light of improving order trends and recent acquisitions like Cepheid and Phenomenex. Notably, Phenomenex has meaningfully enhanced Danaher’s Life Sciences portfolio and is expected to help the company achieve a double-digit return on investment in less than five years.Further, the company’s continuous focus on introduction of products has enabled it to penetrate new markets and gain competitive edge over its peers. Of late, Danaher has also witnessed compelling secular market drivers across each of its platforms and believes that rapid market traction of the newly launched products should continue supplementing sales performance in the upcoming quarters as well.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Crane Company (CR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.58% and a Zacks Rank #2.

In today’s fast paced times, implants are preferred over conventional removable dentures owing to comfort and convenience.Factors Driving Demand for Dental TreatmentHigh Demand Among Children and Teenagers: Per a Markets and Markets report, children and teenagers are expected to dominate the global orthodontic market in the coming years. A high number of patients with malocclusions and jaw disorders are likely to drive the demand. Also, rising need for fixed braces among children and teenagers will act as a major demand propeller.

Also, the timing of the deal seems sensible as the demand for IDT’s products is expected to grow dramatically in the near future.Danaher has successfully repositioned itself as a healthcare company in recent times, gradually broadening its presence in the healthcare and dental markets. These markets are expected to benefit from the rise in aging population and increased spending on healthcare and fitness. Also, lucrative prospects in pharma and clinical end-markets bode well for the company. In six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has gained 19.3% against the industry’s loss of 1.1%.Additionally, Danaher’s acquisitions have helped it to enhance productivity and drive growth. Also, it anticipates core growth rate to accelerate on account of improving order trends and acquisitions like Cepheid and Phenomenex.Despite these positives, the slowdown in the company’s academic business in Europe and stunted revenue growth in the Dental business remain concerns for the company. Moreover, softness in industrial markets of China, North America, Latin America and the Middle East has been severely impacting the company’s business.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Potlatch Corporation (PCH  -  Free Report), Leucadia National Corporation  and 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report).

255,DHR,"Technology and manufacturing giant, Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 20. In the quarter to be reported, the company anticipates weak revenues in Aerospace Business, which constitutes the major portion of total revenues.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.80, reflecting a beat of 1.7%. Overall, Honeywell pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 2.1% over the last four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to Consider In a bid to better positioned itself to leverage the shared business models and maximize share-owner value through focused strategic decision making, Honeywell has reorganized operating segments. However, the company’s proactive restructuring initiatives are yet to witness signs of stabilization in a number of its major end markets.Particularly, Honeywell’s revenues for its Aerospace’s defense and space-related products and services remain vulnerable to changes in the U.S. government’s defense and aerospace funding. Further, the high research and development costs could also be a drag on this segment margin and affect its profitability in the upcoming quarter.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Aerospace segment in the to-be-reported quarter currently remains low at $3,535 million compared with second-quarter revenues of $3,674 million. Revenues from Materials and Technologies segment are also anticipated to be low with estimate of $2,194 million compared with reported revenues of $2,239 million in the prior quarter.Moreover, Honeywell remains susceptible to material price inflation, which in turn is expected to affect its operating profit and bottom-line growth for the third quarter. Further, high dependency on supply chain to scale production and adjusting delivery of long lead-time products during times of volatile demand remains matters of concern. High operating risks in one of the key ingredients of its business might reflect poorly on the upcoming quarterly results.However, Honeywell’s balanced mix of long and short-cycle businesses, along with a decent organic growth in new products and expansion in high-growth regions augur well for the company. Additionally, the company is building a robust pipeline of new products. It has regularly fine-tuned portfolio, having sold about 60 of its units (accounting for $7 billion in sales) since 2002 and acquiring another 90 companies contributing $14 billion in revenues over the same period. These factors bode well for the company’s quarterly numbers and are anticipated to offset some of the risks it faces.Furthermore, infrastructure investments and increasing gas consumption in high growth regions like India and China are expected to drive demand for the company’s acquired business Elster’s gas heating assets, strengthening its existing gas combustion portfolio. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Honeywell this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.74.

The company also expects core growth rate to accelerate going forward, in light of improving order trends and recent acquisitions like Cepheid and Phenomenex.Phenomenex has meaningfully enhanced Life Sciences portfolio, and is anticipated to help the company achieve a double-digit return on investment in less than five years.

258,DHR,"Shares of industrial goods manufacturer, Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week high of $151.10 during yesterday’s trading session, before closing a tad lower at $150.43 for a healthy year-to-date return of 29.5%. Barring minor hiccups, the company’s share price has steadily been on an uptrend since the second half of April. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has the potential for further price appreciation with long-term earnings growth expectations of 9.2%.Growth Drivers    Honeywell’s diversified business portfolio has the potential to earn consistent above-average returns and mitigate operating risks. The company’s diligent focus on working capital management, free cash flow generation and a conservative balance sheet are its key strengths in an enterprising macroeconomic environment.The company’s balanced mix of long- and short-cycle businesses, along with decent organic growth and expansion in high-growth regions augur well for the long term. With a flexible yet disciplined focus on cost and productivity, Honeywell remains focused on increasing its presence in high-growth regions. The company has regularly fine-tuned its portfolio, having sold about 60 of its units (accounting for $7 billion in sales) since 2002 and acquiring 90 companies, contributing $14 billion in revenues over the same period. These factors bode well for for Honeywell’s growth in 2017 and beyond.Honeywell continues to invest in its enterprises to create units that grow faster and are more profitable than its competitors. The acquisition of Elster — a leading provider of thermal gas solutions for commercial, industrial and residential heating systems, and gas, water and electricity meters for $5 billion — is likely to augment revenues. Infrastructure investments and increasing gas consumption in high growth regions like India and China are expected to drive demand for Elster’s gas heating assets, strengthening its existing gas combustion portfolio to create a full solution offering.  The company has $300 million in its fund for its restructuring initiatives to improve its overall cost position and drive further margin expansion going forward.Honeywell reportedly has the largest industrial cyber security research capabilities in the industry. The company has hi-tech solutions to protect clients against cyber threats. Two such solutions are Risk Manager — the industry's first solution to proactively monitor, measure and manage industrial cyber security risks — and Secure Media Exchange, which protects plants against threats from removable media such as USB flash drives.With such state-of-the-art products, Honeywell strives to gain a competitive edge over its rivals and augment revenues. The company reported solid third-quarter results with healthy year-over-year increase in earnings and revenues. Honeywell further revised full-year earnings guidance on favorable growth dynamics. Its earnings per share is currently expected in the range of $7.05-$7.10 (from $7.00-$7.10). All these factors probably raised investor confidence and drove the company’s shares to a fresh 52-week high.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther stocks in the industry worth considering include Danaher Corp. (DHR  -  Free Report), Federal Signal Corp. (FSS  -  Free Report) and Leucadia National Corp. , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2.

259,DHR,"General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) recently collaborated with visual computing firm NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) to incorporate state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) in its healthcare imaging devices. The strategic deal will provide the industrial goods manufacturer an edge over its peers and augment its position in the market.AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines. With an increasingly competitive market, manufacturers aim to develop sophisticated products by integrating AI in machines to improve the efficiency and accuracy levels. The advent of data analytics has further enhanced the scope of using AI in machines and has improved the interoperability of products.GE intends to leverage NVIDIA’s AI computing platform to develop Revolution Frontier CT — an advanced CT scan instrument — that is two times faster than the existing products available in the market. Cleared by the FDA, it is likely to offer superior clinical outcomes in liver lesion detection and kidney lesion. This would ultimately benefit patients with compromised renal function by eliminating unnecessary follow-ups and doctor visits.  It has been reportedly found that less than 3% of more than 50 petabytes of data generated on an average by hospitals is tagged or analyzed. GE Healthcare aims to harness this data for improved patient outcome by combining AI into its medical devices. This is likely to augment its revenues with ease of use and higher clinical efficiency.Shares of GE have underperformed the industry year to date, with an average loss of 42.5% compared with a decline of 5.7% for the latter. In order to boost the company’s sagging shares, CEO John Flannery has decided to focus on just three core segments — power, aviation and health-care equipment — and gradually exit all other businesses. GE further intends to sell assets worth $20 billion to improve its liquidity. The collaboration with NVIDA is a step in this regard.GE currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report) and Leucadia National Corporation , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Danaher has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 10.6%.

260,DHR,"Industrial goods manufacturer General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) recently inked two new contracts in the Aviation and Power segments in its continued efforts to sustain focus on the core business focus. The Aviation contract totaling $143 million was obtained from the U.S. Navy, while the Power segment contract worth $400 million was procured from the Iraq Government.The Aviation DealPer the terms of the deal, GE Aviation will manufacture 22 T408-GE-400 engines to power the CH-53K King Stallion helicopters, primarily used by U.S. Marine Corps. These advanced engines will enable the U.S. Naval Air Systems Command to execute higher workload through the copters by carrying a 27,000-pound external load over a mission radius of 110 nautical miles in extreme weather conditions. This is almost triple the workload executed by the existing CH-53E Super Stallion copters powered by GE Aviation’s T64 engine.The new T408 engines will reportedly offer more than 57% power compared with the existing T64 engines, thereby consuming 18% less fuel and saving energy. In a nutshell, the new engines will function excellently in environment-friendly conditions, increasing the durability and ruggedness of the engines to withstand an inclement weather.The engines will be manufactured at various GE Aviation facilities with parts supplied from facilities in Dayton, OH; Lynn, MA; Hooksett, NH; Madisonville, KY and Jacksonville, FL.The Power ContractPer the contract with the Iraq Government, GE will help develop the country’s electrical infrastructure by building 14 electric substations. At the same time, the company will supply critical equipment such as transformers, circuit breakers and other outdoor equipment to revamp the existing substations in tune with the various upgrades available in the market.The contract will facilitate GE to help the war-ravaged country save on electricity costs while hooking up power plants in various provinces to the national grid. The company is also likely to help the relevant ministry secure funding from various financial institutions to implement the infrastructure upgrade.Moving ForwardShares of GE have underperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has slumped 42.6% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 5.9%. In order to boost the company’s sagging shares, CEO John Flannery has decided to focus on just three core segments — power, aviation and health-care equipment — and gradually exit all other businesses. GE further intends to have asset sales worth $20 billion to improve its liquidity.Flannery has termed 2018 as a reset year and expects the company to stage a turnaround to reward its shareholders with risk-adjusted returns. Critics, however, have widely raised concerns about the efficacy of such steps.Despite the headwinds, the recent contracts are likely to drive the company’s strategic objectives as well as enhance its revenues.Zacks Rank & Key PicksGE has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

262,DHR,"Shares of industrial goods giant General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) continued to fall for the second consecutive day, nearing its two-year low as changes across top management failed to quell negative investor perception. Its shares closed at $23.36 yesterday — very close to the lowest level since Aug 25, 2015.  Glass Half-Full or Half-Empty?GE has been the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year, with a decline of 26.1% year to date as against a gain of 15.5% for the latter. In order to boost its sagging shares, the company restructured its businesses and focused on core industrial operations after completing the GE Capital exit plan. Also, the company initiated a reshuffle in top management to bring in new ideas as John Flannery took the helm as CEO, replacing Jeff Immelt.Early last week, Flannery further assumed the role of the Chairman of the company as Immelt retired three months in advance. Three top order exits followed in quick succession with Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Bornstein stepping down after 28 years of service on Oct 31, 2017 and fellow vice chairs, John Rice and Beth Comstock, retiring at year end after 39 and 27 years of service, respectively. The strategic moves seemed to be an effort by Flannery to start his tenure as the CEO and Chairman with a clean slate and a completely new support staff.However, such sweeping changes in top management created a negative investor perception and fueled speculations that fundamental challenges within the company are worse than what Wall Street is currently discounting.Down But Not OutDespite a dismal stock performance, GE has offered bullish guidance for 2017. The company anticipates operating earnings to be within $1.60-$1.70 (up 7% to 14% year over year), with organic growth of 3-5%. GE intends to return $19-$21 billion to the shareholders in 2017, including $8 billion in dividends and $11-$13 billion in share repurchases.In addition, the company expects to generate $18-$21 billion in cash flow from industrial operations in 2017. GE has solid long-term earnings growth expectation of 10%. It has beaten earnings estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 9.7%.For the first half of 2017, organic revenues improved 4% while operating profit increased 11% year over year. The company has returned $7.8 billion to shareholders in the first six months of the year, half of which was through share repurchases. A healthy dividend yield in the vicinity of 4% is also fully covered by earnings and has enough scope for further appreciation.With such a favorable outlook and decent dividend yield, investors can expect to profit in the future by buying this blue-chip stock at a discount.Zacks Rank & Key PicksGE presently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

264,DHR,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 2.8% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Danaher Q2 Earnings Beat, Increase Y/Y, Guides UpDanaher reported adjusted earnings of $0.99 per share in second-quarter 2017, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.97 by 2.1%. Moreover, adjusted earnings rose 10.0% on a year-over-year basis.The bottom line also steered past the company’s guided range of $0.95–$0.98.The upside in the company’s bottom line can be attributed to its effective Danaher Business System (“DBS”), which provides a set of philosophies, processes and toolsets to drive improvement. Moreover, a decent top-line performance supplemented earnings rise.Revenues by SegmentDanaher reported total sales of $4,510.1 million, reflecting an increase of 6.3% year over year. In addition, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,496 million.Improvement in second-quarter revenues was due to positive contributions from both non-core and core businesses. While acquired businesses contributed 6.0% to overall growth, core businesses contributed 2.0%, both on a year-over-year basis. The company’s recent large acquisitions, Pall and Cepheid, contributed significantly toward the top-line increase.Life Sciences segment revenues rose 4% year over year to $1,384 million. Operating margin for the quarter expanded 150 basis points (bps) to 16%. The sales growth of this segment was driven by robust market traction of mass spectrometers, microscopy, flow cytometry and genomics products. Impressive rise in the operating margin was driven by higher sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with restructuring actions.Revenues at the Diagnostics segment increased 14.5% year over year to $1,440 million. Impressive performance of clinical business in China and robust performance of acute care diagnostic and pathology diagnostics business proved conducive to growth of this segment. However, operating margin at the segment contracted 760 bps year over year, to 10.9%. The fall is attributable to higher costs associated with new product development and higher restructuring and impairment charges.Revenues at Dental came in at $703 million, falling 1.5% on a year-over-year basis. Operating margin rose 30 bps to 15.6%. Lower demand for dental consumable product lines in North America and Western Europe proved to be a drag on the top line of this segment. Also, price decreases impacted this segment negatively. Rise in operating margin is attributable to incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions.At the Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, revenues were up 4.5% year over year to $983 million. Solid performance across all the business lines, namely, water quality, analytical instrumentation, chemical treatment solution and ultraviolet water disinfection in end markets drove growth for this segment. Operating margin rose 70 bps to 23.9%. Cost savings associated with restructuring actions benefitted operating margin.On a year-over-year basis, operating profit margin contracted 150 bps to 15.2%. Gross margins were down 110 bps to 55.0%. Both operating and gross margin decline is attributable to restructuring and impairment charges, which completely offset benefits of higher sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings.LiquidityDanaher exited the second quarter of 2017 with free cash flow of $891.9 million compared with the year-ago figure of $835.7 million.GuidanceConcurrent with the earnings release, Danaher provided its guidance for third-quarter 2017. The company projects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.92–$0.96.Furthermore, Danaher raised its full-year 2017 adjusted earnings guidance. It now expects adjusted net earnings per share to lie in the range of $3.90–$3.97 compared with the earlier guided range of $3.85–$3.95. Overall, the company reported impressive key metrics largely driven by its effective business model, the DBS. The model focuses on three critical areas – quality, delivery, and cost & innovation.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Analysts were quiet during the last one month period as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions.Danaher Corporation Price and Consensus  Danaher Corporation Price and Consensus | Danaher Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, Danaher's stock has a subpar Growth Score of D, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F.

Moreover, it presents opportunity for the passengers to utilize the second channel for SwiftBroadband voice and data connectivity in the cabin.Our TakeHoneywell is well-positioned to gain from long-term expansion in markets like aerospace, facility automation and automotive turbochargers backed by its strong market share and product line-up. The company also continues to invest in innovative technologies that are expected to help it maintain its leadership position. Also, as emerging markets expand the demand for the company’s, airplanes, automobiles and construction products is expected to grow.In the past year, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have outperformed the industry. While the stock has gained 20.7%, the industry declined 12.9%. Further, the company’s balanced mix of long- and short-cycle businesses along with a decent organic growth in new products and expansion in high-growth regions auger well on a long-term perspective.However, the company is yet to witness signs of stabilization in a number of its major end markets despite its proactive restructuring initiatives. Moreover, in order to differentiate its products and prevent commoditization, Honeywell has to continually develop and maintain competitive products by adding innovative features. These, in turn, might lead to high R&D expenditures, often resulting in margin contraction.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report), Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report) and Raven Industries, Inc.

The reported figure also improved 20.3% from the year-ago tally of 64 cents.The impressive bottom-line performance can be primarily attributable to the company’s initiatives to drive operational improvements.

278,DHR,"Confirming industry wide speculations, General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) unveiled its plans to lay off 12,000 employees across the globe in its GE Power business, as part of its corporate objective to lower operating costs and improve profitability. The drastic step seems to be the call of the hour as the beleaguered company aims to restructure its power business in tune with the evolving market conditions.With about $27 billion revenues in 2016, GE Power was the largest business segment of the company in terms of corporate revenues. However, the business has been a drag on earnings in the last few quarters as global demand waned with increasing popularity of renewable energy sources, overcapacity, lower utilization and fewer outages. Industry experts opined that the acquisition of Alstom’s assets for $10 billion in 2015 further compounded the problems for GE, as it increased the employee count by approximately 65,000 with the addition of several field offices and manufacturing sites across the world. It seemed as if GE erred in its judgment about market demand and gambled on an industry that was on a decline.GE intends to execute the job cuts over the next 18 months, with about half of them taking place in Europe, namely France, Germany and Switzerland. The strategic move is also in tune with the broader goal of the industrial goods manufacturer to integrate the energy connections and power businesses with GE Power, seeking to save about $1 billion in costs in 2018 and an additional $500 million in 2019. The latest layoff follows a similar exercise last month, when GE trimmed staff at its interim corporate headquarters in Boston and eliminated about 100 sales positions within the GE Digital division. According to Bloomberg, GE has announced a total of 19,242 job cuts in 2017 — the most by any U.S. company in the year.     The continued reduction in employee headcount is aimed at scripting a turnaround for the 125-year-old conglomerate by reducing operating costs and strengthening its liquidity. Shares of GE have underperformed the industry year to date, with an average loss of 43.9% compared with a decline of 5% for the latter. In order to boost the company’s sagging shares, CEO John Flannery has also decided to focus on just three core segments — power, aviation and health-care equipment — and gradually exit all other businesses. In addition, GE aims to improve its profitability by reducing overhead costs by $2 billion in 2018, majority of which is likely to come from the beleaguered power segment that sells electrical generation equipment. GE further intends to sell assets worth $20 billion to improve its liquidity. Flannery has termed 2018 as a reset year and expects the company to stage a turnaround to reward its shareholders with risk-adjusted returns. Critics, however, have widely raised concerns about the efficacy of such steps.GE has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report), 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and Leucadia National Corporation , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

279,DHR,"Technology and manufacturing giant, Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report), is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 20, before the opening bell. For the quarter, the company anticipates solid revenues from its Aerospace Business, which constitutes the major portion of total revenues.Last quarter, Honeywell reported earnings of $1.85 per share, delivering a beat of 0.5%. In the trailing four quarters, the company pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 1.3%.We expect Honeywell to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Honeywell has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Honeywell has an Earnings ESP of +0.46% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.90 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.89. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Honeywell International Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Honeywell International Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Honeywell International Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors Behind Better-Than-Expected ResultsHoneywell remains well-positioned to gain from long-term expansion in markets like aerospace, facility automation and automotive turbochargers backed by its strong market share and product line-up. The company also intends to expand its presence in high-growth regions, with a flexible yet disciplined focus on cost and productivity. Furthermore, Honeywell’s balanced mix of long and short-cycle businesses along with a decent organic growth in new products and expansion in high-growth regions augurs well for the company. Also, the company is building a robust pipeline of new products. Honeywell has regularly fine-tuned its portfolio, having sold about 60 of its units (accounting for $7 billion in sales) since 2002 and acquiring another 90 companies, thus contributing $14 billion to revenues over the same time frame. These factors bode well for the company’s upcoming performance and are likely to offset some of the risks it faces.Moreover, the company’s strategic and operational initiatives to improve its business have provided a boost to financials over the past few quarters. For instance, the merger between the Transportation Systems and the Aerospace segments has enabled it to leverage on the shared business models as well as the engineering and technology similarities.Amid this backdrop, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues from the Aerospace segment currently remains high at $3,697 million, reflecting growth of 4.3% year over year. Revenues from the Performance Materials and the Technologies segments are also anticipated to be strong, with the consensus estimate projected at $2,516 million compared with $2,069 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, the company’s focus on investing in innovative technologies should help in maintaining its leadership position.However, Honeywell is yet to witness signs of stabilization in a number of its major end markets. Also, in order to differentiate its products and prevent commoditization, the company has to continue developing and maintaining competitive products by adding innovative features. These, in turn, might increase R&D outlay, resulting in margin contraction.Key PicksHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.45% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Also, major contributions of the earnings growth are expected to come from the Energy, Conglomerates and Technology sectors, out of which Energy and Conglomerates are anticipated to witness double-digit earnings growth.Diversification a Win-Win Strategy:  5 Gems from 5 Solid SpacesWhile the overall earnings growth in Q3 is expected to be lowest among all four quarters of 2017, the earnings season still offers good scope for investors, especially in some top-ranked Zacks sectors that are likely to witness year-over-year earnings and revenue growth. The sectors demanding attention are the Conglomerates, Consumer Staples, Technology and Industrial Products that are ranked among the top 13%, 19%, 25% and 31%, respectively out of all 16 classifications.Here is the winning strategy: Plucking an S&P 500 stock from each top-ranked sector that possesses a favorable combination of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) with a positive Earnings ESP.

282,DHR,"According to a Reuters report, General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) is likely to lay off about 4,500 employees in Europe as part of its corporate objective to lower operating costs and improve profitability. Although the company spokesperson declined to comment on the grapevine, an unnamed union source confirmed the veracity of the news.The job cuts are mostly centered on the power and grid businesses that GE bought from Alstom in 2015 and will affect employees in Switzerland, Germany and Britain. Billed as one of the largest acquisition by GE at about $10 billion, the transaction increased the employee count of the company by approximately 65,000 with the addition of several field offices and manufacturing sites across the world. This significantly increased the operating costs of the company and eroded margins as demand for new power plants waned due to competition from cost-competitive wind and solar systems and higher inventory in the market. Consequently, management was forced to initiate some drastic steps and eliminate redundant positions in order to improve profitability.The strategic move is also in tune with the broader goal of the industrial goods manufacturer to integrate the energy connections and power businesses with GE Power, seeking to save about $1 billion in costs in 2018 and an additional $500 million in 2019. The latest layoff follows a similar exercise last month, when GE trimmed staff at its interim corporate headquarters in Boston and eliminated about 100 sales positions within the GE Digital division.    The continued reduction in employee headcount is aimed at scripting a turnaround for the 125-year-old conglomerate by reducing operating costs and strengthening its liquidity.

(DHR  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 earnings results before the opening bell on Jul 20.The company hasn't missed estimates in the trailing sixteen quarters, which is an impressive feat.  Last quarter, it posted a positive earnings surprise of 1.2%. The stock boasts an average positive surprise of 5.7% over the past four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderIn the past few quarters, Danaher has faced stunted revenue growth in its dental segment, mainly attributable to weakness in higher-margin traditional consumables business. We believe the weakness will continue to mar the second-quarter results as well. Moreover, unfavourable product mix and incremental costs associated with various new product developments, particularly in the dental segment, are expected to hurt the margin performance for the soon-to-be-reported quarter.This apart, sluggishness in some of Danaher’s key end markets, including Latin America and some European regions, are likely to impact growth. A significant portion of its revenues is derived from regions outside the U.S., which makes it vulnerable to currency fluctuations. Over the past few quarters, Danaher has been suffering from strengthening of both the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen versus other currencies.Also, the company has been witnessing relatively smaller organic growth over the past few quarters. We believe Danaher's Life Science portfolio lacks a significant upstream product offering, which has been restricting growth. A decelerating organic growth is likely to affect the company’s overall top-line performance for the second quarter.Despite these negatives, Danaher’s acquired businesses, namely Pall and Cepheid, are expected to act as key growth drivers for the quarter to be reported. Also, the company’s robust operating culture, DBS, is likely to act as a catalyst. Historically, DBS has contributed to meaningful core revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share improvement and cash flow generation. Furthermore, positive industry trends like new regulations from the Chinese Food and Drug Administration are expected to act as tailwinds, fueling top-line increase for the second quarter. Also, market traction of the recently launched products, including SMARTmatic handpiece campaign, KaVo OP 3D Pro panoramic X-Ray imaging system and CM130 coring monitoring system, are expected to stoke growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Danaher will beat earnings estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

286,DHR,"Shares of industrial goods manufacturer United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) scaled a new 52-week high of $126.44 during Friday’s trading session, before closing a tad lower at $126.17 for a healthy year-to-date return of 16.5%. Barring minor hiccups, United Technologies’ share price has steadily been on an uptrend since mid-September.Despite its strong price appreciation, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has the potential to continue its upward trend with long-term earnings growth expectation of 8.4%.Growth DriversUnited Technologies serves various end markets such as aerospace, defense and commercial construction, that move according to their own cycles. This business mix and diversification allow the company to remain profitable even during tough economic times.In addition, United Technologies has a strong aftermarket business. The company not only manufactures and sells primary products such as elevators, aircraft engines and helicopters but also sells spare parts and offers related services to keep those primary products running.The company’s aftermarket services business is relatively stable compared to new product delivery. It further helps offset the negative impact of downturns in the new products market. With a diligent execution of operational plans, the company has outperformed the industry with an average year-to-date return of 15.1% against a decline of 4% for the latter.United Technologies has also revamped its aerospace unit. This included an overhaul of its organizational structure in the aerospace business along with some key changes in the leadership positions within it. United Technologies anticipates that the streamlined organizational setup would enable it to better serve its customers. In addition, the company expects that the strategic moves will further ensure a successful entry and production ramp-up of its Geared Turbofan engines to thwart intense competition from other players in the market.Incorporating its improved expectations for organic sales growth in the near future, management has raised its guidance for 2017. Adjusted earnings are currently anticipated to lie within the $6.58-$6.63 per share range compared with the previously estimated range of $6.45-$6.60.  Additionally, the company raised its revenue guidance for 2017 from the previous projection of $58.5-$59.5 billion to $59-$59.5 billion (estimating an organic growth of 3-4% year over year). Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment and continued investments in the aerospace segment, the company expects to generate significant cash from operations to reward the shareholders with a risk-adjusted return through share repurchases and dividends. This represents improving business conditions and strong operating fundamentals of the company.All these measures for a healthy near-term growth probably raised investor confidence and drove the shares to a 52-week high.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the industry are Danaher Corp.

291,DHR,"Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings of 99 cents per share in second-quarter 2017, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents by 2.1%. Moreover, adjusted earnings rose 10.0% on a year-over-year basis.The bottom line also steered past the company’s guided range of $0.95–$0.98.The upside in the company’s bottom line can be attributed to its effective Danaher Business System (“DBS”), which provides a set of philosophies, processes and toolsets to drive improvement. Moreover, a decent top-line performance supplemented earnings rise.Revenues by SegmentDanaher reported total sales of $4,510.1 million, reflecting an increase of 6.3% year over year. In addition, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,496 million.Improvement in second-quarter revenues was due to positive contributions from both non-core and core businesses. While acquired businesses contributed 6.0% to overall growth, core businesses contributed 2.0%, both on a year-over-year basis. The company’s recent large acquisitions, Pall and Cepheid, contributed significantly toward the top-line increase.Life Sciences segment revenues rose 4% year over year to $1,384 million. Operating margin for the quarter expanded 150 basis points (bps) to 16%. Sales growth of this segment was driven by robust market traction of mass spectrometers, microscopy, flow cytometry and genomics products. Impressive rise in the operating margin was driven by higher sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with restructuring actions.Revenues at the Diagnostics segment increased 14.5% year over year to $1,440 million. Impressive performance of clinical business in China and robust performance of acute care diagnostic and pathology diagnostics business proved conducive to growth of this segment. However, operating margin at the segment contracted 760 bps year over year, to 10.9%. The fall is attributable to higher costs associated with new product development and higher restructuring and impairment charges.Revenues at Dental came in at $703 million, falling 1.5% on a year-over-year basis. Operating margin rose 30 bps to 15.6%. Lower demand for dental consumable product lines in North America and Western Europe proved to be a drag on the top line of this segment. Also, price decreases impacted this segment negatively. Rise in operating margin is attributable to incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions.At the Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, revenues were up 4.5% year over year to $983 million. Solid performance across all the business lines, namely, water quality, analytical instrumentation, chemical treatment solution and ultraviolet water disinfection in end markets drove growth for this segment. Operating margin rose 70 bps to 23.9%. Cost savings associated with restructuring actions benefitted operating margin.On a year-over-year basis, operating profit margin contracted 150 bps to 15.2%. Gross margins were down 110 bps to 55.0%. Both operating and gross margin decline is attributable to restructuring and impairment charges, which completely offset benefits of higher sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings.Danaher Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Danaher Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Danaher Corporation QuoteLiquidityDanaher exited the second quarter of 2017 with free cash flow of $891.9 million compared with the year-ago figure of $835.7 million.GuidanceConcurrent with the earnings release, Danaher provided its guidance for third-quarter 2017.

292,DHR,"On Nov 30, we updated the research report on industrial goods manufacturer, Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report).With a flexible yet disciplined focus on cost and productivity, Honeywell aims to increase its presence in high-growth regions. Population growth, urbanization and infrastructure development continue to create attractive opportunities across its entire portfolio. The company’s balanced mix of long- and short-cycle businesses, along with a decent organic growth in new products and expansion in high-growth regions augur well for the long term. Additionally, the company is building a robust pipeline of new products.Honeywell regularly fine tunes its portfolio. It has sold about 60 of its units (accounting for $7 billion in sales) since 2002 and acquired 90 companies, contributing $14 billion in revenues over the same period. The focused approach bodes well for its growth.The company has outperformed the industry with an average year-to-date return of 32.3% against a decline 4.4% for the latter. Honeywell’s diversified business portfolio has the potential to earn consistent above-average returns and mitigate operating risks. The company’s diligent focus on working capital management, free cash flow generation and a conservative balance sheet remain key positives amid a challenging macroeconomic environment.However, Honeywell is susceptible to material price inflation, which affects profitability. Although the company’s proactive restructuring initiatives have positioned it better than many of its peers, it is yet to witness signs of stabilization in a number of its major end markets. A change in the U.S. government’s defense and aerospace funding could also adversely impact sales of Aerospace’s products and services. The high research and development costs could also be a drag on the Aerospace segment and result in margin contraction.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Some better-ranked stocks in the industry are Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report), Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report) and Leucadia National Corporation , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

It has surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 2.6%.Federal Signal has delivered an earnings beat thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 11.5%.Leucadia has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 18%.

293,DHR,"Credit rating agency, Fitch Ratings recently downgraded industrial goods manufacturer General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) related to both short-term and long-term issuer default ratings. Despite the downgrade, its shares remained resilient and rallied 1.6% to close at $18.41 yesterday.Rating CutCiting relatively low margins and less-than-anticipated free cash flow, Fitch lowered the long-term and short-term issuer default ratings for GE to ""A+"" from ""AA-"" and to ""F1"" from ""F1+"" with a negative outlook, respectively. The rating agency noted that GE was plagued by a weaker performance in the power segment’s gas turbine business owing to lackluster demand patterns and higher inventory in the market.Fitch further pointed out that although GE intended to improve its profitability by reducing overhead costs by $2 billion in 2018, majority of which is likely to come from the beleaguered power segment that sells electrical generation equipment, execution risks remain. In addition, cash flow is likely to be adversely affected by the suspension of dividends by GE Capital.    The current rating downgrade is the second of its kind. Earlier this month, Moody’s Investor Service, the credit rating business of Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report), lowered GE to ""A2"" from ""A1"" owing to likely challenges in the power segment which might persist till 2019.Shares Defy the NegativityDespite the negative undercurrent, the company’s share price moved up as investors seemed to repose some faith in the latest restructuring process of the company. CEO John Flannery has decided to focus on just three core segments — power, aviation and health-care equipment — and gradually exit all other businesses. GE further intends to have asset sales worth $20 billion to improve its liquidity.Flannery has termed 2018 as a reset year and expects the company to stage a turnaround to reward its shareholders with risk-adjusted returns. Critics, however, have widely raised concerns about the efficacy of such steps.However, shares of GE have underperformed the industry year to date, with an average loss of 41.8% compared with a decline of 4.4% for the latter.Zacks Rank & Key PicksGE has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).
